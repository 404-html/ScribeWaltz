Hello Freak pitches.
We're making podcasts magic again.

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.060
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by ting ting

3
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:17.061
is a long time sponsor of the podcast and one that we have got universally

4
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:20.920
positive feedback from everybody that I know that I've turned onto.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.900
It has saved money using Tang.
Tang is a cell phone service,

6
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.340
mobile phone service that uses the sprint backbone.

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.660
They have their own company though,

8
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:34.890
so they have their own rules like no contracts,
um,

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.640
no ETFs or early termination fees.

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.060
They have a new thing they would call the ETF relief program.

11
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:43.380
If you're paying an ETF,

12
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:48.381
come to ting and they will give you credit for 25% of your ETF up to $75 per

13
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:54.090
device.
Simply purchased your device through Ting port,
your number,

14
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:56.400
then submit your final bill with the ETF.

15
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.200
Detailed from your previous care carrier is ETF.
Like when you have a contract,

16
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.460
early termination fees.
Um,
they,
uh,
it's a,

17
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:08.100
it's a sweet cell phone company.
The way they have it set up.

18
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.260
I really enjoy a lot of the aspects of it.

19
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.370
One of the things that I really enjoy is there's no overage coverages or

20
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:15.204
penalties.

21
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.470
So like a lot of times it's like if you have one service and you'd go higher,

22
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.710
use more minutes,
you get hit with a penalty.
They don't do that.

23
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.210
They just charge you what you would have used or pay for you,

24
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:32.211
what what you have used and if you use too much or if you'd rather use too

25
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:38.490
little.
If you like,
if say had one contract and it was set up for,
you know,

26
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.920
x amount of minutes and you use something lower than that,

27
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.040
they'll knock you down to a lower rate and,
and credit you on your next pill.

28
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.820
It's beautiful.
Cancel anytime you want.

29
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.730
Brian has the new Samsung Galaxy s three there's a naked girl on your co.

30
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.550
Your phone,
dude.
Wow.
Wonder woman is hot as fuck to bed.

31
00:01:56.551 --> 00:02:00.510
Wonder when we can't be just a big fucking angry fat,
broad cost small.

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.150
This one is Paris.

33
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.460
Why can't wonder woman would be like a really fit crossfit woman?

34
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.270
Why does she have to be this sex pot?
You know,
it's rude.
If I was willing,

35
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.000
I'd be pissed,
but I'm not.
Yeah,

36
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.950
the a iPhone looks very dainty

37
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.430
<v 1>compared to that galaxy.
It kind of ruins it.</v>

38
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:23.280
Like it kind of like after you go back to your iPhone,

39
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:25.800
it really feels like a little kids like phone now.

40
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.750
I didn't think that was going to happen quite honestly.

41
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:29.700
I thought I fucked up when I brought that thing.

42
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.050
I got it the first weekend I got it.

43
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:34.020
I went to England and it worked flawlessly over there and it's like,
wow.

44
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.790
You know,
maybe I get back home,
it's too big.

45
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:38.400
Maybe I'll just get the s four but then as time went on,

46
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.320
it became normal and as long as it fits in my pocket,
I have zero regrets.

47
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.130
I can have that phone.
I can officially say apple fucked up.
They fucked up.
Yup.

48
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.540
The Ain't better.
Hurry the fuck up with this new big phone supposedly making,

49
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.420
well the online experience is just a way better.
Way Better.
I mean,

50
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:58.470
I was watching Hulu plus on my phone last night in bed and it was fine.

51
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.180
It was this screens perfect for bed.
Yeah.

52
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.470
<v 0>Beautiful.
I'm,
I'm a huge fan.</v>

53
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.650
I'm a huge fan of a all of the galaxy devices,

54
00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:10.100
but just android phones in general.
I have the HTC one as well.

55
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.580
I loved that phone to Alva.
Apple's made mistakes.
Um,

56
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.460
the beautiful thing about tank as well as you don't have to,
uh,

57
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.290
you don't have to compromise on devices.

58
00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:20.840
They do have all the latest and greatest android phones,

59
00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:23.540
including the galaxy s three or the galaxy s four.

60
00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:27.140
They have that to the galaxy s three of the galaxy s four and the note three,

61
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.830
which is the one I have,
they have the HTC one.
They have all the,

62
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.940
the niftiest swiftest,
new beautiful galaxy phones and all the kids are using,

63
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.630
uh,
and um,
ting.
If you use the,
the,

64
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.620
if you go to rogan.ting.com,
uh,

65
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.640
you can save $25 on your first ting device when you sign up.

66
00:03:46.641 --> 00:03:51.380
So visit rogan.ting.com couldn't recommend enough them enough.

67
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.490
Very cool company.

68
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.560
And all our friends that have used him of all reported that they've saved a ton

69
00:03:57.561 --> 00:03:59.990
of money on their bill and it's just a more ethical,

70
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.630
it's more reasonably set up service.
I like what they're doing.

71
00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:04.370
They're making plenty of money.
They don't have to rob.

72
00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:07.190
You don't have to make you feel like you're getting fucked

73
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.300
<v 1>like a sexy.
This one is,
if you go back to this,</v>

74
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.510
if you want to go to the s four jet,

75
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:14.450
if you ever end up thinking that screens too big purple as for emptying.
Yeah,

76
00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:18.130
as far as pretty God damn big,
it's still five inches.
You know,
it's just,

77
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.900
you get so greedy because the,
the note three,
it's just like a little laptop.

78
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.960
It's amazing for like,
I like I draw my notes on it,

79
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.160
I write them and it comes out just like you're writing on a piece of paper and

80
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.740
it's pressure sensitive or it's a pressure sensitive phone because I was using

81
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:36.590
it to draw.
It's like if you lightly draw,
it's just a little light,
you know,

82
00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:39.760
like a little couple real pencil and then if you push harder it gets darker.

83
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:44.410
Just,
it's,
it's an amazing note.
Yeah.
These,
I was very impressed with the stylist.

84
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.660
I hadn't used a stylus on the,

85
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:49.450
anything in a long time since I had a palm pilot and there was a hunk of shit.

86
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.900
Remember that thing?
I still have mine and my trios,

87
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:57.460
remember that trios PalmPilots like the size of a thermos,
big fat,

88
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:58.390
stupid thing.

89
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.330
Remember when we used to try weird things like Dell cell phones and like that's

90
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:05.370
creepy.
Like smart phones,
you know what I mean?
Did that,
yeah,

91
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.220
there was a lot of different goofy cell phone ideas that didn't quite make it.

92
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:13.600
There was a bunch of Sony ones that use some,
whoa,
we got some weird crackling.

93
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.430
There was a bunch of Sony ones that use some really weird operating system

94
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:21.880
that's not around anymore.
You remember that operating system?
Yeah.
What was that?

95
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.500
Uh,
there was like a business operating system,
God dammit blackberry.
But it was,

96
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.700
no,
it was something totally different.
You know,
there was,
there was like,

97
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.340
there was one type of operating system that was getting used by like Nokia's and

98
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:40.660
a lot of weird,
uh,
cell phone companies.
And they had their own like little apps.

99
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.770
They all got smushed under the hurricane.
That was the iPhone.

100
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:48.100
Once the iPhone launched,
everybody was like,
fuck you.
Get out of the way.

101
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:50.140
It was so much better than everything else.

102
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.280
Like we both had android phones before we had the android too.

103
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.520
It was a Haka is shit.
Yeah.
The first one,
what was it?
The first droid,

104
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.450
they'll go horizon droid or awful.
There was so terrible.

105
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.310
You'd pick them up and you go back to the iPhone.

106
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:09.050
The iPhone was like your friend immediately.
Oh my sweetie,
I got your back.

107
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.080
It's not like that anymore.
Now it's actually swung the other way.

108
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:16.430
I this this a galaxy note three and it's huge screens if I'm sold.

109
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.920
Did you know you could also,
when you're on,

110
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.940
they have this thing called scrapbook.
Have you seen this?

111
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.460
When you're on a website you're like,
I got to remember this website.

112
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:23.600
So you take out the Stylus,

113
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:27.770
you circle whatever you want the picture to be and then it saves the whole

114
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:31.390
website and links the original website and just makes it a little thumbnail for

115
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:31.511
it.

116
00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:34.090
So you could just go back and have like your own little scrapbook of websites.

117
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.220
Exactly.
That's,
and that's what it's called.
It's called scrapbook.
It's amazing.

118
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.250
It's so cool.
There's so many more options too.

119
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:42.530
When you start fucking around with all the different things you can do.

120
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.460
Apple fucked up and the watch,
I almost bought the watch but I didn't want

121
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.980
big and I'm like creepy.
You have a camera on it.
Like what am I supposed to be?

122
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.150
This is like 40 yeah.
It only lasts a day to write.

123
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.930
You have to charge it every day and that's has to be cancer of your wrist and

124
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:02.240
you don't want to fuck with your best lady.
Yeah.

125
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:04.840
You don't want to fuck with your wrist where in your left hand?
Yeah.

126
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.030
Don't you wear it on your laptop?

127
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.710
It makes it totally feel you don't want risk cancer,
Zombie masturbating,
all bad.

128
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.780
If you found out that cave,
you risk cancer.
I mean,

129
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.910
well if he gives you a brain cancer,
if you put it up to your head all day,

130
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.670
why wouldn't they give you a risk?
Cancer.

131
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.610
They're trying to destroy her head in hand so we only have legs to like pull
big,

132
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:29.240
heavy rocks for the government.
Just don't get the need for another clock.

133
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.790
Like you've got to clock in that big thing in your pocket,
dummy.

134
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.460
Why is it attach to that stupid little thing on your wrist that you're not never

135
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:37.490
going to look at?
Maybe they want you to like keep because it's so big.

136
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:40.250
Keep the note like hidden waste.
You don't have to actually pull it out.

137
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:43.100
This big thing,
you know what I mean?
Like maybe,

138
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.030
but then I bet it's a cluster fuck trying to get it to answer on your phone or

139
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:50.240
your wrist or talking in your phone.
You look like an asshole.

140
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.710
Here's what apple it has to do.

141
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.790
Apple has to release an exact version of the note size,
like maybe even bigger.

142
00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.260
You get crazier and then have the best watch known to man and release both of

143
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:04.220
them at the exact same time in three to four months and then they will have

144
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:08.000
destroyed.
They can't do that now though because they've been cock blocked.

145
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.500
Samsung put out those,
those two items together.
Apple could never just copy that,

146
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.050
put out their own phone and their own watch.

147
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:18.380
Supposedly that might be why they got rid of the old iPod.
Remember this square?

148
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:19.910
I thought that everyone was making watches.

149
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.960
They immediately changed it to an uglier longer one because they were like,
shit,

150
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:27.920
we don't want to destroy our own watch market.
Uh,
interesting.
Well they fucking,

151
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:30.770
they're too slow.
And I had to interview with Dave Foley,
this guy,

152
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:34.820
and he uses that.
Maybe he doesn't take fully for news radio.
Right,
right,
right,

153
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:35.721
right.
All right.

154
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:39.920
So I talked to this other guy and he might use Foxcom and you would think that

155
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.420
that that product takes like,
you know,
weeks to make from like sending it,

156
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.400
it takes only days before,
like thousands and thousands of like units to be made.

157
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.450
That's how fast Fox is.
Like Fox comes a robot.

158
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.090
That's why those people were jumping off buildings.
Yes.
The,
the

159
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.710
<v 0>death people.
Apparently there is,
um,</v>

160
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.940
a new cell phone company out of the Netherlands that's calling itself the phone.

161
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.210
I think it's out of the Netherlands.
It's not available in the United States yet,

162
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:10.540
but it's all a ethically sourced minerals and uh,

163
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:15.060
people were paid a certain wage to make.
The phone doesn't have four g though.

164
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.700
It's got like three G.
It's not quite four G,
right?
Yeah.
So it's,
it's you,

165
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.170
you take a beating a little bit,
but it's Android,

166
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:24.960
it's an android phone and they're trying to make a phone that you could buy that

167
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:26.160
you don't feel like a piece of shit.

168
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.460
Like if you watch those vice documentaries and how they get the minerals in the

169
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:31.800
Congo and you go,
Whoa,
that's Kinda fucked.
Yeah.

170
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:33.690
That's going to be like the having the first at your wide,

171
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.200
you're going to have that phone in and it's going to be whack.

172
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.260
It's going to be whack anyway.

208
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.800
it just sounded Christ,
it sounded kind of like hipster.
Well,

209
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.010
it's just one of those things.
It's the kettle bell community.

210
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:10.240
They did love to use the word pooed.
You know,
like the,
they like to be silly.

211
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:11.500
You know,
like people love to do that.

212
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.680
I was at a gun store the other day and I heard people talking and like they all

213
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:19.420
do.
I lock the Ar with the five four and the people love to have like very like

214
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.360
inside dialogue to let you know they're,

215
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:26.380
they're on the cutting edge of this particular point of interest.

216
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.880
So when you talk about,
you know,
what do you,

217
00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:30.850
what are you doing your training with?
Well,
use two pood you know,

218
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:35.730
it was much swings and I'm leaving the shut up.
Tell me pounds.
God dammit,

219
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.420
don't even go metric.
Don't you dare go metric.
Well,
34 kilogram.
Oh,

220
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:44.650
use 34 kilograms.
What country do you use that and fuck head.
Huh?

221
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.040
He goes straight to Russia with your kilograms.
You go to China.

222
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.820
This is America boy.
72 pounds.
Say a bitch.

223
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.840
That's what I'm saying.
Uh,
we also have,
uh,

224
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.860
some new supplements and including a one 80,

225
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.040
which is our response to one 80 is basically the best way you can nutritionally

226
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:13.570
try to satisfy a high,
a hangover or jet lag.
I want to put this to the test,

227
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:16.960
Joe.
Yeah,
I get fucked up.
You do anyway.
Just drink it.
No,

228
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:21.370
I mean take it sober and see if it gets me drunk.
No,
it doesn't work that way.

229
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.400
You got to hit,
hit your head on something.
Um,

230
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.380
it's basically the neurotransmitter support of Alpha brain with the best

231
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:33.730
adaptive gins from shoon tech sport,
some five HTP in their minerals,

232
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:35.650
all sorts of wonderful nutrients.

233
00:13:35.651 --> 00:13:40.651
If you go to [inaudible] dot com there's plenty of information on the various

234
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:46.270
ingredients and what they hope to achieve.
Really a fun stuff.

235
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.531
I,

236
00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:51.531
I've been a fan of taking alpha brain after long plane flights and after,

237
00:13:51.941 --> 00:13:55.660
um,
uh,
if I've had some alcoholic beverages,

238
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.930
either one of those things really can slow down your thinking.

239
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.470
And I think their nutrients are the things that sparked that backup,

240
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.300
especially nutrients specifically designed to improve cognitive function.

241
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:12.070
All of it is explained on,
on it.
Uh,
calm.
That's o.

242
00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:14.700
N.
N.
I.
G.
Joe.
Can I get a discount?
Uh,

243
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.730

244

246
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.940

255
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.600
He's a chameleon

256
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.100
that she should be a new intranet is.
Thank you very much.
The fuck credits dude.

257
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:11.060
Fuck all that.
Comedy central nonsense.
Just hit an mc a card with the song on it.

258
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:11.960
Just saying this bitch,

259
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.400
seeing it like your children are in trouble or I'm not doing the time.

260
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.950
Hit hit the high notes too.
Don't crackle.
Uh,

261
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.930
we met Justin when we were doing the Addison Improv couple of years ago.
Right?

262
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.930
Two,
three,
four years.
Longer than that.
It's like five or six.
It wasn't really,

263
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:29.000
yeah,
it's been awhile.
Damn time flies.

264
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.640
But he was a very funny then since then he's gone downhill.

265
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.090
You were,
I was,
it was a very fun to see that Texas,

266
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:45.830
especially Dallas and in that one club has like a real community.
Yeah.

267
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.360
We came in the first time we came in like we did a show before the show like Ari

268
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.500
and someone else was a part of it was Joey was it Joe?
Yeah.

269
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.810
Yeah that was um,
yeah,

270
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.200
you guys had a showcase night where there was like a gang of like local comics

271
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:04.970
went up and you went up and um,

272
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.520
who was the other cat that we were just talking about?

273
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:11.360
That one I told John told you went up and there was a few other ones but you had

274
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:15.530
like a real community.
Yeah.
Dallas to get a good,
a good comedy scene.
Yeah.

275
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.420
It was cool to know or cool to find out.
I didn't know before.
So yeah,

276
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.780
it's always nice to see like it's all you need is like one club where there's a

277
00:16:23.781 --> 00:16:27.650
couple funny dudes they get together and then the open Mike night kind of kicks

278
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:30.500
ass every week.
People keep coming back.
All you have to do it.

279
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.240
But everybody's so short.
Shortsighted.

280
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.360
They don't do the open mikes anymore because open mikes don't make any money.

281
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.440
Right.
Nobody Britt.
Yeah,
that's a,
that's a problem.

282
00:16:37.441 --> 00:16:40.430
There's nobody really comes in for that because the headliner is coming to net

283
00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:44.540
weekend.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
well,
it's not even that no one comes in for that.

284
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.950
The clubs,

285
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.850
the local clubs are missing out on an opportunity to raise local talent.

286
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.850
It'll save you money.
Like you don't have to pay for their hotel room.

287
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:57.410
They live nearby.
Right.
And it also will ensure that you always have a good show.

288
00:16:57.411 --> 00:17:00.870
And you could start doing these shows on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
Well,

289
00:17:00.871 --> 00:17:04.640
you might be dark and you could make a lot of money doing that if you just had a

290
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:07.640
real local scene.
And that was the cool thing about that club.

291
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.080
And it's still like that.
But there'll be like,

292
00:17:09.081 --> 00:17:11.990
if a headliner only wants to do two shows on Saturday,
they'll be like,
okay,

293
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:16.010
well we'll do an 1130 show,
but we'll give it to all the local guys.
Like nobody,

294
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:19.670
you know,
nobody does that anymore.
Smart people get off work.

295
00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:23.450
Like say if you've got off work at 10 30 and he know that there's an 1130 show

296
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.240
like fucking man,
let's go to the Improv.

297
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.940
A couple of drinks is always a good show.
The local guys are always good.
Right?

298
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.420
You know,
there was this time in Boston where there were no visitors,

299
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.230
that everything was all handled locally.
It sounds crazy to people today,

300
00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:40.130
but the only people that played that came in from out of town where like Jerry

301
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.090
Seinfeld would do a concert.
George Carlin would do a concert,
right?

302
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.050
But there was very few like comedians came in and did like a week at the club

303
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.160
and it was all by local

304
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.510
<v 0>talent.
And because of that,</v>

305
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:56.511
there was this amazing wealth of local talent and a place like Dallas is taking

306
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:00.540
that same concept,
you know,

307
00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:03.360
that Addison Improv and they were just running with it.

308
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:08.120
Is it still like that now?
It's gotten better.
Now there's another club.
Uh,

309
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.400
there's two other clubs and there's like bar shows and there's like underground

310
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:14.940
shows and like it's,
it's a really cool scene now.
So important.

311
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.250
Every improv should have an open mic night.

312
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.260
Someone should just sit them down and said,
listen,

313
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.210
this is like you're planting a garden.

314
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.210
It might actually cost you money the first year because you've got to buy all

315
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:28.200
your seeds and your machinery and you might not,

316
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.680
it might be cheaper for you to go out and buy the food,
but don't do it.

317
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.170
Stick with it.
Cause if you stick with it,

318
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:37.650
you can have a real comedy scene and that you build a fan base.

319
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.800
And so when you've got a headline in that comes in that it's not necessarily

320
00:18:39.801 --> 00:18:41.070
going to draw a lot of people.
You Go,

321
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:44.100
well I got two local guys who we've been developing for the last three years.

322
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.090
That'll help.
Yeah.

323
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.880
And they don't need a hotel room and there they will do it for nothing.
Yeah.

324
00:18:47.881 --> 00:18:50.790
And you'll,
you'll educate people about comedy in general.

325
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:53.870
More people be aware of,
of good comedy.
Yeah.

326
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.720
When a scene develops like that,
it's such a cool fucking thing to watch.

327
00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:01.980
Like Denver,
there's one Wendy in Denver who owns a comedy works.

328
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.330
She did it all on her own.

329
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:08.160
Like essentially she created the the Denver and cultivated the to Denver comedy

330
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:09.900
scene with those comedy works clubs.

331
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.560
She's got two of them there and she's got a whole system as far as like open

332
00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:17.300
miker so they go from open mic to middle and middle act a headliner and the

333
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:21.060
cultivate these local people and they've been doing it forever and because of

334
00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:24.510
that there's all these funny people like if you go to a sealed local show and

335
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:27.890
I'm like a Monday night or what have you.
It's a lot of funny comedians.
Yeah,

336
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.320
and Austin is the same way too.
Awesome.

337
00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.090
Like if you go into the cap city on a on a Tuesday night,

338
00:19:33.091 --> 00:19:34.800
it's always a really good show.
Awesome.
Yeah,

339
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.300
that's a perfect example because Austin is like a real hang too like comics.

340
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:43.260
Like whenever I'm in town,
I always see comics that are also in town,

341
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:47.250
like hanging out at the bar.
You know guys who are working at the Velveeta Room,

342
00:19:47.251 --> 00:19:49.710
we'll come over or what have you.
Right.
You know,
it's,
it's,

343
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.830
there's clubs there like hangs.
We're comics,

344
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:55.380
we'll like meet up yet an Improv is good like that.
Edison,

345
00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:58.260
there's a club called high end is in Dallas where they have a big bar area,

346
00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:58.740
so the door,

347
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.740
the open mic and say they don't make a lot of money off ticket sales,

348
00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:05.730
but now you've got 40 comics hanging out the bar till 2:00 AM you're going to

349
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.600
make,
you know what I mean?
You're going to make money.
Yeah,
no doubt.
And again,

350
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:12.770
it's,
it's one of those things where you can't look at it as a,

351
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.970
like a straight flat business move.

352
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.880
You have to look at it as a part of owning a business,

353
00:20:17.881 --> 00:20:22.080
a part of owning a comedy club.
A critical part is supporting the community.

354
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.670
They fuck up with that.
These big giant places,
they don't have open Mike Nights.

355
00:20:26.671 --> 00:20:30.420
It's,
it happens a lot now.
Much more so than what I was coming up,

356
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:33.360
but I was coming up.
It seemed like during the 80s,

357
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.340
comedy got so big and so crazy that everywhere you looked there was an open mic

358
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:41.970
night.
There was so many of them.
They were everywhere and every club had won.

359
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.810
Every club stitches had one.
Knicks had won all these different clubs in town,

360
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:50.530
had one.
And it was,
seemed like every time you would go local or you'd go to a,

361
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:54.640
um,
uh,
a road Gig,
the local comics would have an open mic night as well.

362
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.500
It was like to,
everyone always had one,
right?

363
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:58.150
It was a part of having a comedy club.

364
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.400
You had an open mic night and you would ask guys like,

365
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:03.400
when's your open mic night?
Oh,
we do Sunday nights.
Oh,
we do Monday.

366
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.170
And it was just a standard thing.

367
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:10.240
But then they started creating these big monstrous fucking clubs that seat like,

368
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:15.480
like,
like standup live in Phoenix is 600 fucking people.
Hey,

369
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.800
San Jose improv palace.
Yeah.

370
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:21.070
That ancient Improv is the most beautiful old theater.

371
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:25.440
It's an amazing old theater.
The San Jose Improv.
You ever performed there?
That's,

372
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:30.040
I haven't done that.
Fuck.
That place is amazing.
Fuck,
it's so 20th are you?
Yeah.

373
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.700
It's so gorgeous.
It's just a beautiful,
beautiful old theater.

374
00:21:33.701 --> 00:21:36.220
Like it has a feel to it.
Like when you're walking backstage,

375
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:37.840
like this place has been,

376
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.700
people have enjoyed things in this place for a long ass time,
but it's huge.

377
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:47.470
You know,
545 days.
Yeah.

378
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:51.520
Like the old Tempe Improv was like four 50 right?
Those about four 15 yeah.

379
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.361
Those places,

380
00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:57.361
it's hard to do an open mic night when you get 459 people up front and a 450

381
00:21:57.461 --> 00:22:00.430
yeah.
It's hard to also have the local headliner,
you know,

382
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:04.150
because you got 450 seats to fill.
You don't really take that chance.

383
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:08.290
You go with a,
you know,
whatever.
Rob Schneider,
you know,
whatever.
You know,

384
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:09.730
you go go with someone who has a name,

385
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:14.830
maybe over someone who's a local guy who would be maybe even funnier,
but it's,

386
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:17.860
people don't know about it.
I don't know who it is.
Right.
But in Boston,

387
00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:20.440
they all knew about it.
Everybody knew about Lenny Clarke.

388
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:23.650
Like I remember when I was telling people that I was trying to be a stand up,

389
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.530
they would say,
oh,
you know,
I just taught Steve Sweeney last month.
You know,

390
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.500
everyone knew the local guys.
Right.

391
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.010
But Boston is like that with bands to like Boston supports local bands.

392
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.340
Like anybody that was like Boston,
that was big.

393
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.030
Always came back to boss like Aerosmith and there was celebrated.

394
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.880
You know Boston does have a good reason.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Boston had a great mood.

395
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.810
Music scene.
It's still does.
They have a lot of like clubs like by,

396
00:22:49.811 --> 00:22:52.540
it's just a smart fucking town.
Too Bad.
It's cold as fuck.

397
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.980
I would totally live there if they could move Boston to Texas.

398
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.280
I had moved there and it sounds like a damn heartbeat.
You would,

399
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.710
you would move back to Boston if just the weather was a little bit better.
Yeah.

400
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.130
I would just live outside of town.
I wouldn't live in the city.

401
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.160
The city's too hostile.
We could get those voices of the women,

402
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.770
keep hearing them and you'll be at or like target and get to hear it.

403
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.000
It would keep my pants zipped up.

404
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.550
Bloody it,
Clia
deals.

405
00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.090
There was a girl when that we've talked about this girl to the end of time when

406
00:23:28.091 --> 00:23:32.410
we were at Boston,
she was just drunk and just yeah,
and the audience.
No,
she was,

407
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.960
it was outside after the show.
We were trying to get something to eat.

408
00:23:34.961 --> 00:23:36.640
They had like this one of those,
uh,
you know,

409
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:39.700
street carts that serve like sausage sandwiches and stuff like that.

410
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.560
If we were all waiting around and this,

411
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:46.470
this chick was just so hammered and she said to me,
he think you're via fax.

412
00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.920
<v 4>And that's what started my hate for Boston women right there.</v>

413
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.301
Just like the chick.

414
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:55.760
What does that movie with Christian Bale where he was like the crack head and

415
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:57.200
it's like the,
like the nine sisters.

416
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.800
<v 1>My friend was having sex with a girl from Boston and while he was having sex</v>

417
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:01.634
with her,
she goes,

418
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.920
<v 4>Ganna tell your friend,</v>

419
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.950
be out to dinner.
And he would just in the middle of doing it,

420
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.250
you can it tell you a friend.

421
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.780
It was just so drunk and exhausted and beaten by laggard while they're having

422
00:24:22.351 --> 00:24:25.770
sex.
You can.
It's how you friends.

423
00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.120
The girls that are from Boston that live here in La and know how to hide it very

424
00:24:30.121 --> 00:24:34.770
well,
but then once in a while to snip out,
come out.
Oh yeah,

425
00:24:34.771 --> 00:24:37.870
I knew it.
They get drunk and angry.
Right?
Fights.

426
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.760
That's like scratching you with their nails.
It isn't a market.
This Boston what?

427
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.220
Yeah,
it's the same.
Yeah,
something like that.
They call this the Boston man.

428
00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.390
Come on,
man.
Whoa.
Jesus

429
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.900
<v 1>market.
They have these coca cola machines.</v>

430
00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:54.050
Have you seen where it's like touch screen and you can be like,
yeah,
I'll have,

431
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:58.310
I'll have Mel yellow a zero.
They make mill yellow.
Zero.
What?

432
00:24:58.311 --> 00:25:02.510
Grape mellow yellow,
zero flavor.
It's 500 flavors.
It's,
it's like,

433
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.580
it's like a formula that coke don't want,

434
00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:06.980
doesn't want to spend the money to mass market because it's like,

435
00:25:06.981 --> 00:25:08.570
I don't think that many people,
it's going to like it,

436
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.670
but they have now put it in one machine.

437
00:25:10.671 --> 00:25:13.710
So you taste all these flavors that are unreleased.
Yeah,
I've tried.

438
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.610
I've done that in a movie theater.
Movie theaters have those,

439
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:20.090
you can add like a bunch of shit and some of the more sophisticated movie

440
00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:23.970
theaters.
Yeah,
but I just go diet coke really cooks hero.

441
00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.590
I want to take any chances to fuck anybody doing with coke zero to make it about

442
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:31.040
coke zero.
What's better for you?
Coax here.
I'll die there bro.

443
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:34.310
Fucking terrible for you.
Right?
Should be just,
should it be just drinking water?

444
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.950
You know how the,

445
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:39.950
the famous thing is that Mexican cokes use real sugar about to change that and

446
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.320
you do it the American Formula Way,
God dammit,

447
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.860
because just a couple of Mexican joints in La that I go to just because they

448
00:25:45.861 --> 00:25:49.400
have those bottled cokes from Mexico that have real sugar on them.

449
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.230
Real cane sugar or such concert.
We ruin everything.
They're just not fat enough.

450
00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:55.910
People aren't bad enough.
They want to add more corn.

451
00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.560
Sherp Mexicans were just coming out a little too lean.
We need to add corn syrup.

452
00:26:00.561 --> 00:26:04.490
I'm up there.
Probably made some horrible deals.
Some core manufacturer,

453
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.880
some giant conglomerate,
right?
Yeah.

454
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:13.130
Somebody should step up and make a like a sugar cane sugar soda.

455
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:15.950
That sounds bad for you.
That's probably all justice as anyway.

456
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.330
I just had a Stevia,
uh,
based Cola that I bought at trader Joe's.
What,

457
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.150
what are the horrible,
it's you know what it tastes like,

458
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:24.970
like shitty generic coke.
Cause you know,

459
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.900
coke and Pepsi have a flavor and that's why they're famous and you don't get

460
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.430
like an RSC and you're like,
well this was like generic cola.

461
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.720
But then like as if it was sitting out opened in the frigerator for three weeks

462
00:26:35.721 --> 00:26:36.920
and then shut back up,
you know,
right

463
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.250
<v 4>off Stevia is horrible.
Yeah.</v>

464
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:43.950
Tab.
Well coke,

465
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.130
<v 2>coke,
Coca Cola actually uses cocaine and you know,</v>

466
00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:50.550
that's not a reason that that was a real,
is that real?
It's not a myth at all.

467
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.990
They use the coca leaves and the actual company that extracts the cocaine from

468
00:26:54.991 --> 00:26:59.760
the coca leaves that they use to make coke.
There's no cocaine and Coke Cola.

469
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:01.080
Right.
But there used to be,

470
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:06.230
but the flavor is still the same because of the fact that they used this stuff.

471
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.610
What do you do?
What are you showing me?
This is an old tab.

472
00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:12.640
Commercial at base was based on conspiracy theories for tab.
Cool.
Really?

473
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.080
It had a big,
that's the tabs after my own heart.
A big foot.

474
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:21.590
Yeah.
Hmm.
That's a tab commercial.
Yeah.
Um,

475
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:27.060
nothing screams,
soda pop conspiracy theories.
Where was I?
I'm thirsty.

476
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.210
What was I talking about?
Cocaine.
Oh,
so the,

477
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:34.620
the largest medical manufacturer of cocaine is actually connected directly to

478
00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:38.700
Coca Cola.
They take their,
their cocoa leaves,
they extract cocaine out of it.

479
00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:40.170
They use it for medical cocaine.

480
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:44.700
And then coke uses those cocoa leaves without the cocaine in it.
For Flavor.

481
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.530
Really?
Yeah.
They've done it forever.

482
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:51.330
That's why Coca Cola is a very unique flavor.
If you compare it to Pepsi,

483
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.100
Pepsi can suck it.
How about that?
Not as good.
Nope.
It's not as good.

484
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.440
Coca Cola was the original one.

485
00:27:58.441 --> 00:28:01.470
They have the original cocaine flavor and look,

486
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.970
there's something to that flavor that's,
it's a little bit Tangier,
a little here,

487
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.013
so something to it.

488
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.400
Pepsi's like Pepsi's like a girl who didn't need to get a nose job but got one

489
00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:13.920
anyway.
Why'd you do that?

490
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.850
I said to people to eventually be a commercial for coke right there.
Sweet.

491
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.200
Somebody from the Coca Cola company.
Just a guy going,
yeah.

492
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.220
We used to put coke in this.

493
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.090
Not that I wouldn't drink Pepsi in a heartbeat or Diet Pepsi.
I don't avoid it.

494
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.480
I just preferred diet coke.
Yup.
Sanford,
Texas.
Dr Pepper.

495
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.900
Dr Pepper is much better than both of them.
How about that?
How about that?

496
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.280
How about Root Beers?
The shit over there.
Fuck yeah man.

497
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.740
What does that one kind of root beer that you always get?

498
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.070
Like the really Nice Delis.

499
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.750
It's in like the old school Lee fucking like Abbott brothers bottle barks.

500
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:48.780
ABC.
Yeah,
that stuff's that shit.
They make a diet.
Root Beer.

501
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:52.350
That doesn't even make you feel like a pussy.
It feels good.

502
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.340
The actual one though,
if you can act,
you know,
I've been gluten free for a while,

503
00:28:56.341 --> 00:28:59.040
but if,
if I really decided to go on a bender,

504
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:03.810
I'm going to go that caviar Rita's and get a sausage sub with a fucking real

505
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:08.580
root beer.
We just feel it.
You feel the whole thing.
Why don't they use IBC?

506
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.790
What did they use?
It's IBC,
right?
What do they use in there?

507
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.570
Let's see in groups and watch it be beer pecking the day they used to actually

508
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:17.460
be,
was it fun or back of the day?

509
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:21.510
Cookies had coke and root beer used to be bare and heroin used to be illegal.

510
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:26.310
Molly,
Molly butter was actually a really good time.
I'll leave butter.

511
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.770
There was no Molly butter,
right Molly?
When did they,

512
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.520
when did they discover Molly?
I Dunno.
Is it Molly?
Just ecstasy.
Okay.

513
00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:38.940
They have corn syrup in this shit.
IBC root beer though.

514
00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:43.090
Delicious has high fructose corn syrup.
So I think they all do,
man.
Yeah.

515
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:47.740
I don't think anybody rocks a soda with sugar anymore.
But New York Seltzer,

516
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.320
whatever happened to this guy,
that root beer.
It was kinda weird.

517
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.630
New York Seltzer roofing.
What was that?
Cherry coke.
Dr Something.
Cherry coke.

518
00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.610
Oh,
Cherry Cola doctor.
And he would uh,
make a root beer.

519
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.270
Dr Solace.
Cause that would be gross shawls.
Cherry Cola.

520
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.730
I just type Dr. Cherry Cola.
Dr Pepper.

521
00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.650
There was like,
you know,
it was,
it was another Delhi one.

522
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.980
I'll give you went to a lot of delis.
Velocity.

523
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.170
That's a term you guys have life off.

524
00:30:24.171 --> 00:30:27.000
Hold what you sound like Woody Allen outcome.
Yeah.

525
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.360
That doesn't sound like it at all.
No,
it's not clearly Canadian

526
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.950
doctors something.
You just name it shit.

527
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:40.660
Now Mr Thunder doctor beverage.

528
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.060
Is it doctor or Mister?
I don't know.
Mister Pib.
No,
that's,
no,
that's a Dr Pepper.

529
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:50.560
No soft Dr One.
Isn't there a doctor one?
I don't know.

530
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:55.030
What the fuck do I know Jack to keeps pulling me.
Dr Pepper.

531
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.560
Dr Soda.
Oh,
you make it shut up.
That's it.
That's the one.

532
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.610
Talk to me making shit up now.
Well,

533
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:05.560
this Austin is one of the few places that has uh,

534
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:10.710
like places where people will wait in line for hours and hours and hours.

535
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.660
Austin has that one.
Um,
a barbecue place.
What is it called?
DUBBS.

536
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.680
No.
Franklins or something like that.
What is the new one?

537
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.440
There's a new crazy barbecue place in Austin.

538
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.290
Fear just went there and told me it's worth it.

539
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.750
Is it the place that looks like it looks like a house,

540
00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:31.460
but there's like a line going down the street just to wait.

541
00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.050
Probably literally somebody's house.
I fucking love Texas.

542
00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:39.040
Do you Miss Texas living out here in la or did you do I do,
yeah.
Like I said,

543
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:43.810
I fought living here like the first year.
Franklin barbecue and now,
yeah,

544
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.020
now I had joined in barbecue,
Franklin Barbecue.
This is the spot.

545
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:50.230
If you go there and pack a lunch,
get there early to take you hours.

546
00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:53.200
You gotta wait in line.
And Ari was like,
how could this possibly be worth it?

547
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:56.440
And then he said,
he sat down,
he was like,
oh my God,
it's worth it.
Really.

548
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.110
How long did he wait?
More than an hour.
Huh?

549
00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.860
That's like standing outside for an hour like an asshole in the middle of the

550
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.170
summer.
I think he was there for south by southwest,

551
00:32:05.171 --> 00:32:09.070
but Anthony Bordain waited in line to on his TV show.
He did the whole deal.

552
00:32:09.071 --> 00:32:12.260
Like everybody else waited in line pointing out the front.
He didn't want to,

553
00:32:12.261 --> 00:32:15.400
he wanted the full experience.
That's the experience.
Your experiences,

554
00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.070
not just eating.
If there's a place that always has a line,

555
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.170
the experience is waiting in line.
Right?

556
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.800
Like I was just in Nashville and they have some place that on Sunday morning,

557
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:26.830
it's some pancakes spot.
You fucking can't get in there.

558
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.790
There's a giant line that last an hours.

559
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:33.670
People get there early and they wait for a guy with a clipboard to get the

560
00:32:33.671 --> 00:32:37.390
pancakes.
Oh,
I thought you said,
is there a missed?
Like you couldn't see it.

561
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.650
You're like,
I can't get into that.
A giant fog.
Where would you think miss?

562
00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.390
I thought he said line line line.

563
00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.780
You think list would go with line.

564
00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.900
You know what this restaurant needs no machine or something about missed a

565
00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.380
magic.
Maybe.

566
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.500
Maybe it's magic that you could make these people waiting in line for fucking

567
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:02.240
pancake check.
So wizard,
check this place out.
Yeah,
that looks so delicious.

568
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:03.830
That's what I miss about living out here.

569
00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:06.470
Cause they always had these Texas barbecue places out here and you get there and

570
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:08.600
it's never as,
oh,
let me fix you up real quick.

571
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.920
Hughley Walkleys van eyes hardly walk.
God Damn Dude.

572
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:16.070
It's one of the best barbecue places on the planet earth and it's here.

573
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.480
Fuck yeah,
he never been a doctor.
Hughley Walkleys Oh,
I went there yesterday,
son.

574
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.320
Really incredible artists in a very shady neighborhood.

575
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:29.090
But if you're the Compton to get barbecue,
it is git as all.
Fuck.

576
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.740
Hughley Walkleys is the bomb.
Diggity dude,
you'll eat there.
The ribs,

577
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:37.580
the brisket,
the fucking everything.
Their French fries are legit.

578
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.280
It's so good.
It's without a doubt.

579
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.660
The best barbecue in all of Los Angeles.

580
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:48.530
Fact it's fucking outstanding.
They have like the bread,

581
00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:51.830
it's sweet.
And when you're eating the barbecue,
like with the bread,
it's like,

582
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:56.390
oh my Christ.
They have buckets of sauce.
They leave on the table.

583
00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:00.530
Hot,
mild.
Oh my God.
It's so good.
It's so good.
All right.

584
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.730
That place is super legit and the decor hasn't changed.

585
00:34:03.731 --> 00:34:07.100
It's like 1953 but is there missed is they're mysterious.

586
00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.070
There's missing your eyes when you're eating because you're crying cause he

587
00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:13.220
can't believe how good it is.
I drove to uh,
Bledsoe's and Compton.

588
00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:16.970
They had pretty good barbecue but yeah.
BLEDSOE's and Compton.
Yeah.

589
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:19.130
It's always good to have barbecue and there's bars on the windows of the

590
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:23.990
restaurant.
We want them going where you live.

591
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.960
Yeah.
I think that uh,
there's some places that you have to go to for the food.

592
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.840
Have you done a chicken and waffles yet at Rose Dance?
Yeah,

593
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:38.840
I did Roscoe to go there and I did pink.

594
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.860
I stood in line for an hour for fucking hot.
That's nonsense is nonsense.

595
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.660
Pinks is a trick.
Yeah.
That doesn't make any sense.
Grounds Dr. Brown.

596
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.030
That's what it was,
doctor.
Yes,

597
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.820
because they have cream soda and the Cherry Soda to pinks is just a regular hot

598
00:34:52.821 --> 00:34:53.840
dog.
It's just a hot dog.

599
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.960
This is not even like a super gourmet like butcher shop hot dog where they snap

600
00:34:59.541 --> 00:35:02.300
when you bite into them.
They're not even that.
They're just regular hot dog.

601
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:05.640
It's at sheep mentality though is when people see a line,
they go,
oh,

602
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.370
he's got to do this.
I drove by it the other day.

603
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.470
There was only like two people in line.
Never saw that before.

604
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:14.210
I'm like I two p people.
That's how entourage did six seasons.

605
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:15.020
Right?

606
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.410
So same thing like the shitty club when they make everybody stand outside before

607
00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:21.710
they opened to think that,
oh this is cool and there's nobody inside.

608
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.830
It's a smart move.
Make everybody stand outside.
Right?

609
00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.240
And then you let them through and they just run it and they go,
Hey,
wait,

610
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.550
what the thing would say when six flags opens,

611
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.740
go charging into this empty hall.
Yeah,
yeah.
There's,

612
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.380
there's some spots that are worth traveling to Roscoe's chicken and waffles

613
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.220
without a doubt

614
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.730
<v 0>is one.
And that's another one.
If I ever go off the gluten diet,</v>

615
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.550
Ooh boy am I gonna fuck up some chicken and waffles.

616
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.950
Who would have ever thought that would be an amazing combination,

617
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:51.430
but it's perfect.
I recommend Dominic's by the Beverly Center.
Um,

618
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.400
Delmonico's pizza,
uh,

619
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:56.700
on Fairfax right across the street from another awesome place.
Canter's Deli,

620
00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:00.150
canter's Deli,
best Pastrami in all of Los Angeles.

621
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.250
Best people will just be to really,
you liked it?

622
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.050
Let me just looking around who it goes there.

623
00:36:04.051 --> 00:36:07.710
You know your three in the morning and it places pack with crazies run into

624
00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:09.610
comics there all the time that Reagan was there yet.

625
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.160
I'm always running into people.

626
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:14.600
That last time I was there running into Marin and I've run into Jeff Ross there.

627
00:36:14.601 --> 00:36:15.990
I ran into everybody there.
It's like,

628
00:36:15.991 --> 00:36:20.580
it's one of those spots where it's between the comedy store and the Improv so

629
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:24.330
it's like it's a straight shot to go down there and get it animal.

630
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.280
Have you been an animal?
It's right next door to that.

631
00:36:26.281 --> 00:36:28.620
Somebody was telling me about that place so you would love,

632
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.420
it's one of those like,

633
00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.440
oh I think on eat bone marrow I want to eat at like a pig's butthole,

634
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.070
whatever you want to eat.
Like any part of the animal.

635
00:36:35.071 --> 00:36:38.040
It's really any part of the animals must be really good though,
right?

636
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.810
Not everyone,
every part,

637
00:36:39.811 --> 00:36:43.320
but it seems like the usual things you're saying brains and stuff.
Oh really?

638
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:46.470
It's animal and Los Angeles right down the street from it was actually just tell

639
00:36:46.471 --> 00:36:49.980
me about that then today.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Yeah,
I've heard of that many times.

640
00:36:49.981 --> 00:36:53.080
That place.
Um,
I've heard it from you at least twice.
Yeah.

641
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:58.310
I think someone should be opening up a game restaurant in Los Angeles and I was

642
00:36:59.131 --> 00:37:01.970
like,
I know that place here in Calabasas,
you know that w there's,

643
00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.740
that's nowhere near here.
But yeah,
that's the,
it's called the um,

644
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.580
uh,
the something lodge saddle peak locks.
Saddle peak lodge.
Yeah.

645
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:14.730
It's like on the way over to Malibu.
People would freak out out here though.

646
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.360
If you opened it like a wild getting like I could just see people like picketing

647
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.600
it hides in the mountains.
You know,

648
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.890
there's a point in saying that it's not good because you don't want like factory

649
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:28.350
farming of these wild animals you want it to be.

650
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.040
But if you could have like a small restaurant that didn't serve that many people

651
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:35.580
and it was hard to get in and it would be fucking bad ass if you knew that.

652
00:37:35.581 --> 00:37:37.740
Like if like say my friend Steve Rinella,

653
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:42.030
he's a hunter and he has that show meat eater and I went hunting with him and I

654
00:37:42.031 --> 00:37:43.080
got this deer right here.

655
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.650
If he had his own restaurant and it was all just stuff that he shot,

656
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:51.360
he shot like a new animal every week and cooked it in the restaurant and you

657
00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:55.410
only ate like what they had shot recently.
That would be amazing.
That would,

658
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.820
if someone did that,
like called it the hunters lodge and have,
you know,

659
00:37:58.821 --> 00:38:01.980
only have like 10 seats or 20 seats,
a small place,

660
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.340
there'd be a line out front and you just have it so that these people have like

661
00:38:05.341 --> 00:38:06.570
some sort of sustained,

662
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.960
like there's a lot of places in Texas where they have what they call high fence

663
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:14.220
operation where they're essentially wild animals,
but they're blocked in,

664
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.680
they can't go anywhere.
And so because of that,

665
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.850
they're allowed to control the populations and there's more wild game species

666
00:38:20.851 --> 00:38:23.910
from Africa in Texas than are in Africa.

667
00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.170
A lot of different species of antelopes and all sorts of different animals that

668
00:38:28.171 --> 00:38:29.700
are extinct in India.

669
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:34.910
But I have great numbers in Texas because these guys create these wild wild game

670
00:38:35.591 --> 00:38:40.510
parks and then you take these these places and they set up tree stands and some

671
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:41.650
of them are like real blatant,

672
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:45.580
like they have feeders and if 6:00 AM every morning food comes out so the

673
00:38:45.581 --> 00:38:47.530
animals just gather up and you blast away.

674
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.070
I mean you could do it that way or you could try to do it more ethically.

675
00:38:51.071 --> 00:38:53.950
We try to stock these animals in their natural habitat,

676
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:58.150
but for the most part you're talking about places with like huge amount of

677
00:38:58.151 --> 00:39:02.350
acreages.
Someone,
some of them have two,
three and more thousand acres.

678
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.191
So they're huge.

679
00:39:03.191 --> 00:39:05.920
So it's conceivable these animals never even seen a person before.

680
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.300
They're all fenced in.

681
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.500
And if you had something like that and cultivated the animals that way,

682
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:13.630
you have like a sniper who works for you.

683
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.920
And then he just takes out an a an animal every day.
And you,
you know,

684
00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.300
today we're having bison that was just killed three hours ago by our hunting

685
00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:23.020
team.

686
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:27.910
I mean that would be incredible if people could see how delicious and how good

687
00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:29.260
for you that kind of food is.

688
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:33.040
We would really start relooking at the American diet.

689
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.780
I've noticed a big difference in like I get as much as I can.

690
00:39:37.781 --> 00:39:40.750
I try to buy grass fed beef now and I,

691
00:39:40.751 --> 00:39:44.860
whenever I have a state that's not grass fed,
I notice it in the taste.

692
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.880
I noticed it in like what it looks like.
It looks Pale.

693
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:53.140
Like if you have like a grass fed piece of meat,
it's a dark red,

694
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:57.430
it's a different color.
Right.
And if you buy one that's,
that's corn fed,

695
00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:59.560
it's like this poor thing is anemic.

696
00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.870
<v 4>Yeah.
And you also feel different to when you eat,
you know,</v>

697
00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.450
like if you eat organic chicken and then you'd go back to eating like process,

698
00:40:05.451 --> 00:40:08.510
you can definitely tell the difference and like just how you feel afterwards.

699
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.240
So I've never been able to tell the difference in chicken.
I can't.

700
00:40:11.241 --> 00:40:13.490
Organic chicken.
And then you go back to the process.
Always.
Yeah.

701
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.230
<v 0>Wow.
Well maybe you're more sensitive to that than I am,</v>

702
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.680
but I think there's been a lot of research that's been done on like what's

703
00:40:20.681 --> 00:40:23.350
healthy for you?
What kind of lean protein,
what,

704
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.820
what kind of a diet the animal should be on or to optimize nutrition value of

705
00:40:27.821 --> 00:40:31.240
the food.
The best is wild.
That's the best.

706
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.050
They're the leanest animals.
Their fat is the most valuable.

707
00:40:35.051 --> 00:40:36.820
Like bears like bear fat.

708
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.900
They've render that down and make these big jars of it and cook with it.

709
00:40:39.901 --> 00:40:40.930
It's amazing stuff,

710
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.440
especially if the bears had been eating like blueberries and actually has almost

711
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:49.210
a blueberry tint to it.
It's incredible.
It's like very highly valued bear fat.

712
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.500
When they blueberries,

713
00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.950
you can catch a bear that's been like dieting off nothing but blueberries from

714
00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:58.280
months.
Oh my God.
It's the most amazing meat ever.
The meat's delicious though.

715
00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:59.530
The fat is to,

716
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:04.690
and it's just so much more ethical than stuffing them into these farms where

717
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.240
they're all blocked in and they can't even move.

718
00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:10.630
And they fill them full of fucking fatty foods and then pissed in through the

719
00:41:10.631 --> 00:41:13.390
brain,
drain them out.
And you know,
they never had a life.

720
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.420
These animals live like a wild animal.

721
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:19.330
They're running around out there eating grass,
eating the,

722
00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.240
the natural plants that they would eat and then you shoot him.

723
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.160
It's totally a better move.
I support it.
I'm down.

724
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.020
<v 4>I'm just saying you just got so hungry for eight brains,</v>

725
00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:34.040
Joe and you have had brains.
What's that like?
What's it,
it's kind

726
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.930
<v 0>of like,
like a scrambled eggs type feel.
Brains was texture to it.</v>

727
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.250
I've had lambs brains.
My uncle used to cook lambs brains on the,
on the grill.

728
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.420
Really?
Yeah.
It was,
uh,
in the 1970s,
I guess this was around.

729
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:48.650
I was a really small boy,

730
00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.310
but I remember I was always in the horror movies and weird shit.
And so he,

731
00:41:52.311 --> 00:41:52.940
you know,

732
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.880
wanted to freak me out and show me their lamb skull and that we're going to cook

733
00:41:55.881 --> 00:42:00.070
the lambs brain.
My uncle.
Very cool.
And uh,
I remember they,

734
00:42:00.071 --> 00:42:04.220
they spiced it a certain way and would cook this lambs brain in the skull.

735
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.410
Oh yeah.

736
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.480
<v 5>Yeah.
It was really odd.
I had never had it since then,
for a long time</v>

737
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:14.410
<v 0>time.
And then I had it long time ago at a restaurant,</v>

738
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:17.170
there was a restaurant that has it served lambs brains.

739
00:42:17.171 --> 00:42:21.340
And I remember I had that.
And I've also had sweetbreads,
which is some gland.

740
00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:25.450
It's one of the gland of a,
I think it's a cow.

741
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.320
<v 5>Well,
shit,
your uncle is not at,
which is fucking with it.</v>

742
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.280
This is a sweet bread.
Try this.
Well,
you know,
my family,

743
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:37.920
<v 0>my family's straight from the boat.
Everyone was straight from the boat.</v>

744
00:42:37.921 --> 00:42:40.640
My grandmother and my grandfather on both sides,
they're both,
uh,

745
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.440
my grandfather on my father's side came straight from Ireland.

746
00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.420
My grandmother came from Italy and my,

747
00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.240
both my grandparents on my mom's side came from Italy.
So they,

748
00:42:48.241 --> 00:42:51.150
these motherfuckers,
they did everything right.
They killed their own rabbits,

749
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:56.130
you know,
they,
they,
they ate everything.
So sweetbreads is a,

750
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.810
it's a parotid gland,
including the parotid gland,

751
00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:04.920
the sublingual glands.
It's a bunch of different glands.
How do they prepare it?

752
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:10.410
Uh,
I think they fry it.
Okay.
I think they,
they,
uh,

753
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.950
it's like they pan fried frying makes everything.
Okay.
Here's one.

754
00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:18.660
It says one common preparation sweetbreads includes soaking in saltwater and

755
00:43:18.661 --> 00:43:23.430
then poaching in milk after which the outer membrane is removed.
Oh,
okay.

756
00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:27.630
Once dried and chilled,
they are offering breaded and fried.
Okay.

757
00:43:27.631 --> 00:43:29.760
So this is a lot going on with these things.
She,

758
00:43:29.761 --> 00:43:32.140
that's when people needed food so bad.
They,

759
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.220
they tried to figure out how to eat everything.
Right.
You know,

760
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:39.600
they boiled down tendons and shit.
That's why they figured out stews.

761
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.080
Stews were for parts of animal that you couldn't eat.

762
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:47.400
Like you couldn't choke it down.
So He'd have to break it down with a,

763
00:43:47.401 --> 00:43:48.390
with a brace.

764
00:43:48.391 --> 00:43:52.470
He would braise them and then boil them slowly for hours and hours until the

765
00:43:52.471 --> 00:43:54.450
meat finally gave up and collapsed.

766
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.410
<v 5>If you're a caveman,
didn't know anything about eating animals,</v>

767
00:43:57.411 --> 00:44:00.290
eating meat and stuff like that and you were just put onto this earth and you

768
00:44:00.291 --> 00:44:03.740
had to go,
all right,
I need to eat.
What would I start with first?

769
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:05.210
Would you go right to animal?

770
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:09.180
Cause I think I would just go grab a lot of grass and trees and stuff.

771
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:14.040
They were going to say people for a second problem

772
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.650
<v 0>as you need fat,
you know,</v>

773
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:18.470
especially if you don't have clothes and you're freezing your ass off,

774
00:44:18.471 --> 00:44:21.020
you're going to need a lot of fat.
You're going to be fat period.

775
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:22.010
Like fat as energy,

776
00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:24.860
especially if you don't have carbohydrates and you're not really going to get

777
00:44:24.861 --> 00:44:28.220
the kind of carbohydrates that we get today with pastas and breads and you know

778
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.290
the standard wheat based carbohydrates.

779
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.920
So like the amount of calories that you would actually need from vegetables.

780
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.610
It's a pretty substantial like pounds,
right?
If you were just eating grass,

781
00:44:38.611 --> 00:44:39.190
he would have to eat

782
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:40.780
<v 1>la.
I would live in a forest or something.</v>

783
00:44:40.781 --> 00:44:43.510
I think I would start off with that with so when I'm saying like I be eating

784
00:44:43.511 --> 00:44:46.900
like mud.
I think back then you'd have like two days a big now fuck this,

785
00:44:46.901 --> 00:44:50.020
I'm going to kill something.
Starve to death dude.
You really would.

786
00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:51.711
<v 0>That's what I mean.</v>

787
00:44:51.711 --> 00:44:56.390
I mean if you tried to go vegetables only unless you have a garden man fucking,

788
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:59.660
unless you live in a really unique place where they have a lot of naturally

789
00:44:59.661 --> 00:45:03.700
growing things and you can eat,
you got to cultivate your own shit.
It's,

790
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.880
it's hard to find.

791
00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.240
I mean they are like edible roots is a lot of different things that are like

792
00:45:08.241 --> 00:45:09.590
almost like wild potatoes.

793
00:45:09.591 --> 00:45:12.860
He can eat their roots and they're very nutritious and there's a bunch of plants

794
00:45:12.861 --> 00:45:13.694
you can eat but,

795
00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:18.110
but getting enough of them and then also being aware of what you can and can't

796
00:45:18.111 --> 00:45:21.320
eat this some shit that looks like shit.
You can eat it.
It'll kill you instantly.

797
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.100
Especially mushrooms when you start fucking around with mushrooms and picking

798
00:45:25.101 --> 00:45:27.530
mushrooms.
There was a sad story recently.

799
00:45:27.531 --> 00:45:31.640
This old lady in a nursing home went out and pick some mushrooms and cooked them

800
00:45:31.641 --> 00:45:34.220
up for everybody that she lived with and they all fucking died.

801
00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:36.980
<v 1>Like I saw some mushrooms in my front yard today.</v>

802
00:45:36.981 --> 00:45:39.890
Like those big white ones that almost looked like call it.
The answer's no,

803
00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.450
don't eat them.
Slick them first and then take a bite and then take two bites,

804
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:47.960
whatever you're about to say.
The answer's no.
Yeah,
I just know what those are.

805
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.801
Those kinds of mushrooms.

806
00:45:48.801 --> 00:45:52.450
I always wondered if those were poisons cause you see those everywhere.
Yeah,

807
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.160
I would imagine they probably are.
I mean some of them are edible.

808
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.180
There's places like the Pacific northwest where people go mushroom hunting and

809
00:45:59.181 --> 00:46:01.190
they're confident enough like there's some mushroom

810
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:06.230
<v 0>that are so easy to poke out or point out rather that you can,
you can go,</v>

811
00:46:06.231 --> 00:46:09.170
okay this one we can eat.
It doesn't look very any other,
anything you can eat.

812
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:12.620
And there's a few that are like that and people grow them too.

813
00:46:12.621 --> 00:46:15.230
They love to grow like shit.
Talkies and shit.
I did it once.

814
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.440
There's like a kit you buy at the supermarket and you basically just like put

815
00:46:18.441 --> 00:46:21.320
some water on her or something like that and leave it somewhere and they start

816
00:46:21.321 --> 00:46:23.390
growing.
I mean they want to grow,

817
00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:28.020
they just this pretty easy to make a mushroom grow.
They grow quick too,

818
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:33.400
like a lot of feces and that helps.
It's the,
it's not just shit though it,

819
00:46:33.401 --> 00:46:38.390
it has to be shipped from a cow and it has to be the way a double double

820
00:46:38.391 --> 00:46:41.150
stomached animal eats.
They,
they,

821
00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:46.180
they're shit like comes out like nice and like loose and it's got a lot of air

822
00:46:46.431 --> 00:46:48.020
in it.
Like an alcoholic shit.

823
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.290
You can't have alcohol and they wouldn't grow well and alcohol and just a human

824
00:46:54.291 --> 00:46:56.570
diet is no good.
It's not going to grow and meet.

825
00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:00.830
It wants to grow in plants that had been smashed up and pass through the stomach

826
00:47:00.831 --> 00:47:05.270
of,
I think it's called a double on [inaudible] animal or on Yulin animal.

827
00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:09.410
These wild cows and that's the whole idea with the silicide button mushrooms,

828
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.730
they always grow and cow shit.

829
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:16.030
These big fucking huge plate size mushrooms will glow in the Amazon on cow shit

830
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:19.610
and they look like Ufo is landing in a field.
Right.

831
00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.950
That's one of the reasons why the uh,

832
00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.980
the idea came to a lot of people's heads that really tripped hard was that they

833
00:47:24.981 --> 00:47:28.490
were communicating with another life form that came here and an asteroid.

834
00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:30.070
I can tell

835
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.850
<v 1>what makes sense at the time.
It doesn't just make sense</v>

836
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:35.210
<v 0>time unfortunately.
It makes sense like chemically.</v>

837
00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.450
Yeah cause spores can survive in a vacuum and apparently the chemical

838
00:47:39.451 --> 00:47:42.750
composition of Siliciden is very unique and there's nothing,

839
00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:45.170
there's nothing quite like,

840
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:49.470
it's like for Fox for Luxy and end dimethyltryptamine I know I said that wrong,

841
00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:53.010
but whatever it is,
I was listening to a lecture once by turns,

842
00:47:53.011 --> 00:47:54.520
but Ken and he was saying that the,

843
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:58.770
there's no other plant like that that has the phosphorous and the four position

844
00:47:58.771 --> 00:48:03.330
and then it's really possible that it could have come on an asteroid from

845
00:48:03.331 --> 00:48:06.480
another planet.
It's spores survive in a vacuum.

846
00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.610
Apparently you could take some mushroom spores.

847
00:48:08.611 --> 00:48:11.400
Like it doesn't have to be psychedelic Shataki,
whatever.

848
00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:14.640
Put Him on a fucking asteroid shooting in a space and they'll live,

849
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.970
they'll land somewhere,
boom and make a little mushroom farm.

850
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.580
<v 1>Do you see that asteroid or whatever the fuck it was over La the other day?
Yeah.</v>

851
00:48:21.581 --> 00:48:22.690
What was that supposed to be?

852
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.210
Did they say it was a satellite coming in then they say it was a satellite

853
00:48:25.211 --> 00:48:28.000
burning up?
No,
I don't think so.
Last I heard it was a,

854
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.210
they said it was an asteroid.
Yeah,
that's what they said.

855
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.810
All these people were coming in like comics and stuff like,
man,

856
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.050
we just saw some crazy,
it was like a fireball coming right over us.
And I'm like,

857
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.420
oh no,
it's,
have you checked Twitter yet?
He's like,
no,

858
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:43.090
you mean I wasn't the only one that's solid.
And then on Twitter it's just,

859
00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:47.050
cause I just like moving to la like a year and like I see Sheila and I don't

860
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:48.700
even know what's really,
you know,

861
00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:51.010
like I saw an explosion the other day and I'm like,

862
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:53.380
I don't know if I should call anybody or if they're just filming a movie.

863
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.740
And so like you see shit fall from the sky like,
oh fuck,
I know what that is.

864
00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.110
This animal plays doesn't even have a sign.

865
00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.140
They have no sign in front of the restaurant.
I know.
Try to be slick.

866
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.850
You just have to walk you bitch.

867
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.140
<v 0>They have chicken liver toast,</v>

868
00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:12.230
spicy beef tendon chip.
Yeah,
they got weird shit.

869
00:49:12.231 --> 00:49:17.000
Pigtails,
pig years,
heirloom tomatoes,

870
00:49:17.001 --> 00:49:21.290
veal brains.
Dude,
this makes places make me hungry.

871
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:26.030
Crispy pig head.
I'm in veal tongue,

872
00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:29.270
charred octopus.
This place might be the greatest.

873
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:31.790
<v 1>The history,
the war.
I'm telling you man,
it's my favorite wrestler.</v>

874
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:36.070
<v 0>Fried rabbit legs.
Oh my God,
this is incredible.</v>

875
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:40.210
It's great.
And they're really nice people over there to that saddle peak lodge.

876
00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:40.901
If you've never been there,

877
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:45.901
that place is the shit they serve like elk and venison and duck and they serve a

878
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:51.370
game game food.
But I think that would be like the ultimate restaurant.

879
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.290
That'd be like the ultimate community where you,

880
00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:59.020
you lived with a bunch of people that see like I watched these Alaska shows like

881
00:49:59.021 --> 00:50:03.880
I love like um,
life below zero.
You ever seen that one?
It's great.
It's new show.

882
00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:08.410
I'm watching,
I think it's on the history channel or,
or no,
Nat Geo and they uh,

883
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:11.860
they go out and most of these people are just living off the land.

884
00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:16.270
They're just out shooting seals and shooting Caribou and they barter,

885
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.000
they give each other stuff like the gate,

886
00:50:18.001 --> 00:50:22.660
like they were traded in frozen fish for fucking seal oil and they dip their

887
00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:25.360
food and seal.
It's,
it's craziness.

888
00:50:25.361 --> 00:50:29.120
But what's fascinating is no one ever goes to the supermarket,

889
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:32.750
all their food,
they either grow or they kill everything.

890
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.900
Everybody in the whole village and they all share.
They like,

891
00:50:35.901 --> 00:50:39.410
they have meals together,
they barter,
they give each other like,

892
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:42.920
I'll give you some Caribou,
you give me some of this and the,
I need a,

893
00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:46.160
a band for my,
a snow mobile.

894
00:50:46.161 --> 00:50:49.850
One of the guys blew one of his belts and the other guy gave him a snowmobile

895
00:50:49.851 --> 00:50:53.450
belt that he gave him like a side of Caribou.
And it's like a lot of work,

896
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.540
<v 4>too lazy.
Like I can't go grocery shopping.
It's a lot of work.</v>

897
00:50:57.541 --> 00:51:01.560
But like I literally made a sandwich like the last piece of the toast the other

898
00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.610
day,
like the last piece of bread,

899
00:51:02.611 --> 00:51:06.340
like I couldn't go kill a care about could you could though if you start that,

900
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:09.270
if you needed food you could do it.
I had cereal with water,

901
00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:15.150
water powder crumbs from the end of the box works with certain cereals.

902
00:51:15.151 --> 00:51:18.630
That's not bad.
Oh.
Chocula I can't even go get more lucky charms.

903
00:51:18.631 --> 00:51:21.260
I'm going to go shoot a salmon.
You have something like count Chocula

904
00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:25.150
<v 0>coating on the outside of it and you'd see all that water would work.</v>

905
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.540
Do you ever have um,
raw milk?

906
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.160
<v 4>No.
I've used milk.
That was really questionable though.</v>

907
00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:36.370
I don't want to go get [inaudible].
It's not the same.

908
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:38.680
This is probably bad,
but you know what?

909
00:51:38.681 --> 00:51:41.230
The Grocery store as a battlefield yogurt comes from though,
right?

910
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:46.030
It and I eat so much yogurt and that you just found that out.
We use,
well,

911
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:50.320
I'm not a smart man from a yogurt tree.

912
00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.080
This body or exactly.

913
00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:07.030
Did you grow up in Texas?
They have,
well,
we didn't eat yogurt.
They're wild pigs.

914
00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:09.550
No Yogurt.
Yogurt,

915
00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:14.620
yogurt.
It's just some board Dick on toast

916
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.110
<v 0>that was watching this special episode of meaty to the other day.</v>

917
00:52:20.111 --> 00:52:21.670
We was cooking up dear balls,

918
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.700
talking about people always throw them away and you really shouldn't.

919
00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.050
It's a waste of the deer ball.

920
00:52:26.051 --> 00:52:29.200
So he's pan frying these deer balls and slicing them up.

921
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.060
Apparently they're quite delicious.

922
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:36.050
<v 4>What'd you say?
What'd you try?
I'd eat it.
Hosted fear factor for sick.</v>

923
00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.340
He can't freak me out when it comes to food.

924
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.830
<v 0>Very different sense of what's gross.
I,
this girl</v>

925
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.960
<v 4>puked in front of me,
the Trashcan,
I need a trashcan.</v>

926
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:48.880
So I ran and grabbed her a trashcan.

927
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:52.400
We had both been drinking a lot of patrol and uh,
I gave it to her,

928
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:56.610
she pukes and we had Mexican before and it smelled like Mexican and vomit on it.

929
00:52:56.630 --> 00:53:00.500
Get it away from me.
It smells.
And I'm like,
I started puking and she was like,

930
00:53:00.501 --> 00:53:01.221
I need it back.

931
00:53:01.221 --> 00:53:04.860
And it was just like South Park and just thought that what a story began.

932
00:53:04.861 --> 00:53:08.780
So this girl threw up in front of me the other day.
Brian's living,
by the way,

933
00:53:08.781 --> 00:53:13.460
he's 40.
Yeah.
There's something about puked.

934
00:53:13.461 --> 00:53:18.461
It makes you want to Puke to instinct has totally been removed from me really

935
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:21.650
because of the show.
Yeah.
I saw so many people throw up.

936
00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:25.200
It doesn't do anything to me.
It doesn't make me flinch.
When I was a kid,

937
00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:26.110
I was the first guy.

938
00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:29.160
<v 2>If,
if someone threw up in the hallway,
I was the first guy to start dry heaving.</v>

939
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.850
I owed,
I threw up the first season of fear factor.

940
00:53:32.851 --> 00:53:34.920
I threw up watching it on TV.

941
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:39.510
I've watched the something that was there for in real life and I didn't throw
up,

942
00:53:39.511 --> 00:53:40.830
but watching on TV I threw up.

943
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.340
But then by the time like season two to season three rolled around,
dude,

944
00:53:45.341 --> 00:53:47.220
I was an Oji.
How's a veteran?

945
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.900
Yeah.
I,
uh,
I've,
I've cleaned people's puke up for them.
I think

946
00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.300
that'll get drinking that stuff.
We'll get ya.

947
00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.290
Your body realizes you've taken away too much poison too quickly,
right.

948
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:08.760
You're not sipping,
slamming it down and it's strong as fuck.

949
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:13.320
And next thing you know,
you're,
I vision's not good and you start,

950
00:54:13.321 --> 00:54:17.910
your mouth gets dry and can't stay stable.
Sweating,
wobbling from side to side.

951
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.550
What do you two fucks over there and then trying to get me in trouble.

952
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.990
What are you doing Jamie?
What?
It's,
it's the two girls.

953
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:29.040
Oh yeah.
I had to turn away from that three times.
I almost threw up.

954
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.260
We don't have to watch it.
I almost threw up watching you watch that.
Yeah.

955
00:54:34.261 --> 00:54:38.310
It was rough.
That was a,
that was people like did you guys stage that?

956
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:41.460
Absolutely not.
You can't pick both of them were real.
That was real.

957
00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:46.200
And then the Brian Watching dudes cut their ticks so much worse.
I would agree.

958
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:49.350
I would agree with that.
Correct?
Yeah.
Yeah.

959
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:51.690
Getting your Dick cut off is always a bad move.

960
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:55.230
You notice that there hasn't been a shocking video in a while.
Like a Oh yes sir.

961
00:54:55.231 --> 00:54:58.590
Is you just don't look,
I mean,

962
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:02.220
I mean minus beheadings cause I don't know if you've heard the whole Facebook

963
00:55:02.221 --> 00:55:05.190
beheading drama that's been going on,
but uh,
that,

964
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:08.250
that was fucked up like a girl getting her head chopped off because she cheated

965
00:55:08.251 --> 00:55:08.760
on her.

966
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:13.530
I saw that you watch that was the Mexican drug cartel videos or intense man.

967
00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:18.360
They just,
they don't put on my Facebook.

968
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:20.610
Oh yeah.
People will throw a link up.

969
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.850
It's one of those things where people just start talking about it and you'd get

970
00:55:23.851 --> 00:55:24.790
it,
you know?

971
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:29.950
And my Twitter has 1.1 7 million people or some shit like that.

972
00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:34.380
So when you have that many,
they know,
they know what I like.

973
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.780
They know I like watching fucked up things.

974
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:39.640
I don't like the violence and death stuff.
It's like,

975
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:43.170
but every now and then I watched,
I like watching someone do something retarded.

976
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:46.230
You walk me through what happens in that video because obviously I'm not

977
00:55:46.231 --> 00:55:49.380
watching that.
You don't want to watch it,
but it's rough.
We say noises,

978
00:55:49.381 --> 00:55:54.000
which are gurgling.
It's shockingly quiet,
but it's intense and it's 100% real.

979
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:57.890
Oh yeah,
there's no doubt about it.
They cut this woman's head clean off.
Oh Shit.

980
00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:00.300
Yeah,
he did it with those a small knife.

981
00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:04.350
He just reached into her neck and started cutting,
grabbed her by her.

982
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:07.600
I mean it was hardcore man and,
and it didn't take long.
You know,
her,

983
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:12.060
her head was removed and you know,
a minute or so I'm not.
Yeah,
it's hard.

984
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:15.810
It's hard to watch man.
And there's a lot of these videos too.

985
00:56:15.811 --> 00:56:19.410
There's not just one of these videos,
these drug cartel videos,
man,

986
00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:24.340
they never even existed before.
It was,
it's so crazy like climate of Mexico

987
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.940
<v 1>and how much has changed and that you could see it all documented on some of</v>

988
00:56:27.941 --> 00:56:32.290
these videos and it's moving up here to la man.
You see that?
It is.

989
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:37.030
I think so.
I am so much crazy shit going on in la.
Our friend Kayla,

990
00:56:37.031 --> 00:56:38.410
you know Kayla from dysentery,

991
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:43.240
somebody hit her car I yesterday or two days ago and it took off and so she went

992
00:56:43.241 --> 00:56:46.450
on this high speed chase throughout Hollywood going wrong ways in streets going

993
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:49.660
like,
you know,
just chasing this person down and take a photo of it.

994
00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:54.280
And then Mike,
it was just gang members pretty much in a new car,
you know,

995
00:56:54.281 --> 00:56:57.820
and they finally got him over and they got out of the car and took a picture of

996
00:56:57.821 --> 00:57:02.821
the person and the license plate and maybe some drama happened and then drove

997
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:03.790
off again.

998
00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:07.900
And then they went down this dark street in a like a warehouse in like really

999
00:57:07.901 --> 00:57:11.080
shady neighborhood and Kelly's like,
I'm done.
I'm not going down there.

1000
00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.240
But it was just like,
what could have happened to her?

1001
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:16.070
And she went down [inaudible] supposed to chase people anyway.

1002
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.790
If your car is good enough to drive,

1003
00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:21.220
that means you didn't get hit enough hard enough.

1004
00:57:21.221 --> 00:57:23.380
So you'd be chasing somebody that's ridiculous.

1005
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.810
Like what are you trying to do trying to get yourself killed.

1006
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:27.940
She wanted to get the license plates,
but the police,

1007
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:31.810
she called the police immediately and tell them what direction where they're at.

1008
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:35.230
You'd be amazed at how many cops were out there and a lot of times they can head

1009
00:57:35.231 --> 00:57:37.960
someone off,
especially if someone's driving fast,
you know,

1010
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:41.940
they were on the phone with the police the whole time.
Oh.
But uh,

1011
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:45.010
they got the license plate,
but that's it.
Uh,
there was one point though,

1012
00:57:45.011 --> 00:57:47.570
I guess they were going faster than the sky was going like 80 miles an hour.

1013
00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:50.500
I went over one of those like little hill things and the guy flew up and they

1014
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:53.800
like four feet and came down just like,
oh,
it's fine.
Like sparks and fire came.

1015
00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:57.660
Wow.
Yeah,
dude thought he was on the Dukes of Hazzard.
Know I got robbed.

1016
00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:01.360
My friend Justin Martindale got robbed.
This place is crazy.
Well,

1017
00:58:01.361 --> 00:58:03.400
if you're out at night,
man,
that's the reality.

1018
00:58:03.401 --> 00:58:05.290
If you're out at night and you're wandering around,

1019
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.420
especially if you've been drinking,
you know,

1020
00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:10.090
people look at you like you're a victim.
There's,
and there's,

1021
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:14.530
when you have poor people and rich people all mingling together in Los Angeles

1022
00:58:14.531 --> 00:58:17.980
has a massive amount of people that are impoverished,
a massive amount.

1023
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.520
There's 20 million people here who knows how many of them are living below the

1024
00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:22.840
poverty line.
It's a lot.

1025
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.640
And if you're flossing and Hollywood and everyone knows where they can find you,

1026
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:31.030
if you're some fucking baller character who's flashing some cash around in the

1027
00:58:31.031 --> 00:58:33.010
sky bar and people could find you in,

1028
00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:36.430
clock you and watch you and follow you to your car,
they're gonna rob you.

1029
00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:40.330
There's just a lot of that going on and it might happen only every now and
again.

1030
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:44.920
It's amazing.
It doesn't have more than it does.
It's scary.
It is scary.

1031
00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.610
It's scary and it's an issue that our society doesn't face.

1032
00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:52.210
Our society doesn't face the fact that there's people that grow up with no shot.

1033
00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.270
They're fucked from the jump,
shitty roll,
the dice,

1034
00:58:55.510 --> 00:59:00.010
terrible hand being born and incredibly impoverished neighborhoods and there's

1035
00:59:00.011 --> 00:59:01.900
very little support there.

1036
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:05.170
They're just left in their parents' hands and the parents are morons.

1037
00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.310
I mean that's,
that's the reality of babies growing up in poor neighborhoods.

1038
00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:11.170
Think of it like that because La is,

1039
00:59:11.171 --> 00:59:14.890
there's rich and poor like on top of each other.
Oh yeah.
Like each,

1040
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:18.390
well not only that,
but disconnected from each other.
Right.
Where,

1041
00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:22.130
which is different than New York and New York,
poor people and rich people

1042
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.710
<v 0>all sort of mingled together on a subway mingle together,</v>

1043
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:27.440
walking down the street.
There's like a,
a more,

1044
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:32.530
more human approach to like people being there.

1045
00:59:32.941 --> 00:59:35.120
It's more,
it's more diversified.

1046
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:37.250
It's like you may run into everybody in New York,

1047
00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.380
like I find that it's easier to be in your own little world.
In La.

1048
00:59:41.381 --> 00:59:44.030
You get in your own little car,
you stay in your own little neighborhood.

1049
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.970
You don't interact with people in New York,
you're forced to,

1050
00:59:46.971 --> 00:59:50.150
it's just a part of life in New York and I think that's a healthier thing.

1051
00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:53.750
I think it's healthier.
People have less fear of each other.

1052
00:59:53.751 --> 00:59:56.840
People you know and understand that we have much more in common that way.

1053
00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:01.040
It seems like it'd be a contradiction because most people think that Los Angeles

1054
01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:03.680
or California in general is nicer than New York,

1055
01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:05.510
but I think a lot of that is just the weather.

1056
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:11.270
The weather here is nice as is humanly possible.
It's did.

1057
01:00:11.271 --> 01:00:15.350
I was just in Edmonton.
It was fucking nine degrees.
It was snowing.

1058
01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:20.450
It was an amazing show.
Had a great time.
Came back to la 84 bitch,

1059
01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:22.580
suck upon it.
At the end of November,

1060
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:26.810
convertible driving attitudes are driving more variables with their sunglasses

1061
01:00:26.811 --> 01:00:30.740
on,
getting head cancer smiling.
Oh yeah.

1062
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:31.993
It's amazing.

1063
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:37.240
This is an amazing spot and I think just that alone is responsible for a lot of

1064
01:00:37.611 --> 01:00:42.410
the mood of the people in Los Angeles.
I think that alone helps a lot.

1065
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.270
Yeah.
It's hard to be depressed when you go outside and the weather is absolutely

1066
01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:50.690
perfect.
Yeah,
but then you get a call from an agent saying they passed again.

1067
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.080
Right,
and you're like,
fuck Ruth and the toilet.

1068
01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:59.030
It's a lot of depression in la because of just ridiculous expectations.

1069
01:00:59.110 --> 01:00:59.631
That's what I'm saying.

1070
01:00:59.631 --> 01:01:02.470
Like if the weather was worse here with the desperation in this town,

1071
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.550
there would be a lot.
It would be a like a lot more.

1072
01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.390
<v 1>I know a girl that moved out here just recently and when I first met her,</v>

1073
01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.520
everything was going great.
Lost her job.

1074
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:15.120
Now she's homeless and cold on the streets in Hollywood.
Where she,

1075
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:18.650
how long she been down here?
What did she do wrong?
Um,

1076
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.750
she just lost her job and then she couldn't get another job.
And then,
you know,

1077
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.270
once you're out of money or how to money,
it doesn't have any friends.

1078
01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:29.630
So she just found out she actually just moved out here.
Whoa.
Yeah,

1079
01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:33.220
it's pretty sad when she moved down here with $2.
I don't know.
I Dunno,

1080
01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.960
but it kicked her ass fast and you know,

1081
01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:40.730
you'd get these texts and you're just like,
oh Jesus.
Well,
I'm sorry to hear that.

1082
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.870
Bolton.

1083
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:45.180
<v 0>There are certainly individual stories were horrible.</v>

1084
01:01:45.181 --> 01:01:49.770
Shit happens to horrible people.
There's no doubt about that.
But it's also,

1085
01:01:49.771 --> 01:01:52.410
there's a lot of people that come down here and their ideas are really shitty.

1086
01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:54.870
Their plan is poor.
They don't have backups,

1087
01:01:54.871 --> 01:01:56.580
they're not willing to do certain things.
They don't,

1088
01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.720
they don't take the necessary steps in order to make sure that they're going to

1089
01:02:00.721 --> 01:02:04.290
be okay.
I know this dude came out here to try and be an actor.

1090
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.230
He's been out here and he thought he was just immediately,

1091
01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:10.260
apparently he's talented and he thought he was just immediately going to just

1092
01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:13.980
start getting roles and basically be a working actor within like a year.

1093
01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:17.250
It's a year and a half and he hasn't gotten a single job and he's starting to

1094
01:02:17.251 --> 01:02:20.070
freak,
you know,
and he doesn't to work.
He wants

1095
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.370
<v 1>to somehow or another like feed himself as an actor and that's not going to</v>

1096
01:02:23.371 --> 01:02:25.980
happen.
Right?
Like it's,
it's,
you might,

1097
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.590
you might get a movie and you'd be fine and so,

1098
01:02:28.591 --> 01:02:32.250
but he keeps banking on this idea that he's going to eventually get a movie and

1099
01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:34.350
then all his bills are going to be paid.
Like wow.

1100
01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:38.280
Do you know how many of you there are out there?
Like zero job.
He has no job.

1101
01:02:38.281 --> 01:02:39.270
He's his job.
See that?

1102
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.290
That's why I'm so glad I've been classically trained as a waiter and that's one

1103
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:45.570
of the best skills that you can have.

1104
01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:49.770
Any city I can get a fucking job at Denny's if it came down right.
I could be,

1105
01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.400
I can,
I have a job skill that I know like being a blacksmith or some and,

1106
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:56.100
and people that haven't been waiters before,

1107
01:02:56.101 --> 01:02:57.570
I don't know if they're scared to be a waiter,

1108
01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.940
but it really is the best fall back job you could possibly happen.

1109
01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:05.190
There's so many fucking restaurants that you can get a good job and make a

1110
01:03:05.191 --> 01:03:08.400
living.
You could actually,
you know,
do really well is a good waiter.

1111
01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:11.700
Is it easy to get a waiter job though?
I think it is.

1112
01:03:11.701 --> 01:03:14.640
It's just the quality of the restaurant,
you know,
like,
like,
like yeah,

1113
01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:17.670
you could get a fucking job at Denny's and come in there and anytime you wanted

1114
01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:19.860
to problems cause I bartended for a year,

1115
01:03:19.861 --> 01:03:23.840
so I know that in no matter how bad it gets,
I can always bartend somewhere.

1116
01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.000
In some towns I'll always had like some backup plan,
right?

1117
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:29.320
Because people are always going to want to get drunk,
you know,

1118
01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.750
plus probably a lot of drunk tricks.
Bus moves on you.
Are you kidding me?

1119
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.720
They must bus moves.
It's the best when you work at a restaurant also,

1120
01:03:36.721 --> 01:03:39.750
you're always getting laid because he'd become friends and alcoholics with all

1121
01:03:39.751 --> 01:03:42.780
the other waiters and waitresses and talk shit about how horrible the day is.

1122
01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:43.051
Right.

1123
01:03:43.051 --> 01:03:46.010
And you're all off at two o'clock in the morning at the same time and you all go

1124
01:03:46.011 --> 01:03:47.790
to the ground.
Each Other?
Yeah.
Oh Dude.
Yeah.

1125
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:49.670
We would live when that was bartending in Dallas,
we would,

1126
01:03:49.671 --> 01:03:54.000
we would just drive to Shreveport,
Shreveport,
Louisiana.

1127
01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.360
It was like just made $300 let's go across the border and gamble.

1128
01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:01.610
How far away is Louisiana for?
A couple hours.
That's it.
Yeah.
Wow.
That's the best.

1129
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:05.130
Is it like a different world though?
It's sad.
It's sad.

1130
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:09.800
Like take the coolness of Vegas and then,
and then like it's just,
yeah.

1131
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:12.810
It's not like Reno if it got bit by a vampire.
Right.

1132
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.830
Reno for that aids.
Yeah.
There's a few of those places that are like,
Whoa,

1133
01:04:19.831 --> 01:04:22.050
we did a bunch of early.
UFC is in those places.

1134
01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:27.270
A casino magic and shit like that.
I'm like,
1998 is fun.
When you're a kid,

1135
01:04:27.271 --> 01:04:31.350
you're like,
all I can go and drink under age and gamble.
You Windsor,

1136
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.070
California or Canada?
Windsor.
Yeah.

1137
01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:38.840
That's where like the whole Midwest would all drive up as kids to oh,

1138
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:43.380
that's and go to strip clubs.
I actually saw some of that when we were in,
um,

1139
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.800
we're filming in Detroit.
There was,
they were talking about how people,

1140
01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:50.370
you can be only be 18 you can get across to Kennedy could drink and got to strip

1141
01:04:50.371 --> 01:04:53.340
clubs.
And just,
it was,
it was awesome because you know,
most,
you know,

1142
01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:58.341
they're trying to raise the smoking age in New York to 21 which makes us much

1143
01:04:58.441 --> 01:05:02.280
sense.
Why is that?
Even though it doesn't make sense.
No,
it does make sense.

1144
01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:05.880
Why isn't it?
Right.
That's so stupid.
It's just,

1145
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:10.140
there's a real problem with cigarettes.
There's so fucking addictive.

1146
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:14.880
It's so addictive and they're so terrible for you and even a guy like you who's

1147
01:05:14.881 --> 01:05:16.710
not,
you know you're not completely retarded,

1148
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:21.430
but yet you can't stop going back to them.
Yeah,
I know I'm quitting soon.

1149
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:26.920
Now me and Kaylee are going to quit.
Oh that's sweet.
Together together forever.

1150
01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:27.773
If you're going to quit,

1151
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.730
why don't you just fucking get electronic cigarettes man.

1152
01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:33.700
It seems like that is the worst invention in the road.

1153
01:05:33.701 --> 01:05:38.470
I am so anti electronic cigarettes was that you see these kids that are the
kids,

1154
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:42.100
you see these people with like these humongous who because of electronic

1155
01:05:42.101 --> 01:05:45.910
cigarettes and they sit there and suck on it like a tit all night long and

1156
01:05:45.911 --> 01:05:50.170
they're just getting so much nicotine that they're pretty much telling it their

1157
01:05:50.171 --> 01:05:52.450
body.
Like,
hey no,
I need to live on nicotine.

1158
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.120
I need nicotine in my body all day long.
All Day.

1159
01:05:55.121 --> 01:05:57.310
Knight [inaudible] electronic cigarettes too accessible.

1160
01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:59.140
Cause like with a cigarette you get to go outside,

1161
01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:00.800
you got to go across the street,
you gotta find a lighter,

1162
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.670
then you guys will get the eastern area.
It's just always there.
Always there.

1163
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:07.600
And the people stuck on those things,
like it's seriously like a thumb.
I mean,

1164
01:06:07.601 --> 01:06:10.780
I've seen it.
Yeah.
Right.
But from what I understand,
it's not negative.

1165
01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:11.680
It's not bad for you.

1166
01:06:11.681 --> 01:06:15.490
It's making your body get fucking used to having that much nicotine in it.
Yeah.

1167
01:06:15.491 --> 01:06:17.650
But I don't take nicotine is what's wrong.

1168
01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:20.560
Nicotine's not really that bad for you.
From what I understand,

1169
01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:23.350
nicotine is actually a medicine and isn't a highly addictive.
Right.

1170
01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:27.410
I don't know if it's the nicotine necessarily that's really fucking like shit.

1171
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.310
They put in 590 different chemicals,

1172
01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.940
but people are addicted to American spirit cigarettes and that the only thing in

1173
01:06:33.941 --> 01:06:38.260
there is tobacco.
Let's find out nicotine addiction.

1174
01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:41.270
Let's find out.
Oh look,
nicotine addiction and then we'll,

1175
01:06:41.271 --> 01:06:46.180
we'll electronic cigarettes.
Yeah.
Just to me it seems horrible.
I don't know man.

1176
01:06:46.181 --> 01:06:48.670
It seems like way better for you.
Yeah.

1177
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:52.140
But you're going to have to do that for the rest of your life.
Yeah.

1178
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:55.270
You always think I would be east cigarette,

1179
01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:00.520
but instead of just quitting is what I'm saying.
Yeah,
I understand that.

1180
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:02.950
But if you're looking for a bridge between the two,

1181
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:07.120
it seems like there'll be a way better mood and less nicotine is not addictive.

1182
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:08.080
It seems like you're just getting,

1183
01:07:08.081 --> 01:07:12.340
your body used to weigh like larger amounts of a drug cause,
but like I said,

1184
01:07:12.341 --> 01:07:15.910
I don't think that a dick that nicotine is a real issue.
Yes.
Siri.

1185
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.980
Yeah.
As nicotine dangerous is nicotine addictive?

1186
01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:22.750
Of course it's tight.

1187
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.640
<v 6>Right?</v>

1188
01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.250
<v 1>I found on the web.
Oh,</v>

1189
01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:33.140
grocery shit.
Nicotine.

1190
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.190
Um,
there's benefits.
Studies have focused on the benefits of nicotine,

1191
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:40.760
nicotine therapy for adults with Adhd.

1192
01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.650
<v 6>Wow.</v>

1193
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:47.020
<v 1>So if you can't concentrate,
you can smoke,
you should smoke.
Well,
you know,</v>

1194
01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:51.220
it's really interesting because Steven King said that that cigarettes,

1195
01:07:51.221 --> 01:07:52.210
like when he quit cigarettes,

1196
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:56.440
that was one of the most profound effects on his writing,
that it really,

1197
01:07:56.470 --> 01:08:00.670
really slowed them down because cigarettes really made a synapses fire and he

1198
01:08:00.671 --> 01:08:05.440
felt like it made it more cause stimulant.
Right?
Yeah.
Shit,
I have ADHD.
Oh,

1199
01:08:05.441 --> 01:08:10.060
you definitely,
are you kidding?
So keep spoken.
You're fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1200
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:14.500
Doctor says psychoactive effects nicotine's mood altering effects are different

1201
01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:15.980
by report particular,

1202
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:18.200
<v 0>it is both a stimulant and a relaxant.</v>

1203
01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:22.300
First causing the release of glucose from the liver and Epi,

1204
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.230
epipen,
epinephrine,
adrenaline from the adrenal Medulla.

1205
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:30.980
It caused,
it causes sim stimulation,

1206
01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:35.090
users report feelings of relaxation,
sharpness,
calmness and alertness.

1207
01:08:35.091 --> 01:08:39.680
Like any stimulant it may,
it may vary.

1208
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:44.681
Rarely cause the often uncomfortable neuro psychiatric effects of,

1209
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.170
hmm.
How about this one?
A K a.

1210
01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:52.270
T.
H.
I.
S.
I.
A.
S.

1211
01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:56.750
By reducing the appetite and raising the metabolism,

1212
01:08:56.751 --> 01:09:01.700
some smokers may lose weight as a consequence.
Hmm.
Interesting.

1213
01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.033
Okay.

1214
01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:03.660
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1215
01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:08.430
<v 0>So the medical uses,
there's a bunch of different medical uses.
Um,</v>

1216
01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:13.200
primary therapy pdqs of nicotine is in treating nicotine dependence.
Duh.

1217
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:17.100
So stupid.
It doesn't seem like nicotine.

1218
01:09:17.101 --> 01:09:19.620
It's something you should suck on all day long.
That's what I'm saying.
However,

1219
01:09:19.621 --> 01:09:23.370
in a few situations,
smoking has been observed to be a therapeutic value.

1220
01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:26.460
These are often referred to as smokers paradoxes.

1221
01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.450
And although in most cases the actual mechanism is understood only poorly or not

1222
01:09:30.451 --> 01:09:31.110
at all,

1223
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:35.790
it is generally believed that the principal beneficial action is due to the

1224
01:09:35.791 --> 01:09:40.020
nicotine administered and that the administration of nicotine without smoking

1225
01:09:40.021 --> 01:09:42.240
may be as beneficial as smoking.

1226
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.060
So there's certain things like it says for instance,

1227
01:09:45.061 --> 01:09:49.830
study suggest that smokers require less frequent repeated revascularization

1228
01:09:49.831 --> 01:09:54.510
after whoa percutaneous coronary intervention.

1229
01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.700
Not many people do that anymore.
That's what is that?

1230
01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:03.640
It's like an old dance.
The TVS with black and white.
No.

1231
01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:08.660
What the fuck that is risk of ulcerative colitis has been frequently shown to be

1232
01:10:08.701 --> 01:10:12.330
reduced by smokers because you,
you kind of smoke the inside of your lungs,

1233
01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.310
you may get tougher.
Thank his main diseases that way.
Yup.
Wow.
That's not true.

1234
01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.610
We get more oil.

1235
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:24.870
Tobacco smoke is also been shown to contain compounds capable of inhibiting mano

1236
01:10:24.871 --> 01:10:28.910
aiming oxidase,
which is what you take when you make a Iowasca.

1237
01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:33.250
My domain,
monoamine oxidase is um,

1238
01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:36.660
what keeps DMT from becoming orally active.

1239
01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:40.260
That's why like if you eat like grass and things that have DMT and if you don't

1240
01:10:40.261 --> 01:10:43.470
just start tripping your balls off because of mano aiming oxidase.

1241
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:47.610
So if it inhibits model Amy and oxidize,
that can act as a hallucinogen too.

1242
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:52.570
If it's in like,
like harming.
If it's in like large doses,

1243
01:10:52.571 --> 01:10:56.320
I think it's close to close to like death doses.

1244
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:59.400
It becomes a hallucinogen.
Have you tried the E-cigarette at all?
Yeah,

1245
01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:02.330
I think I tried one.
I tried one recently.
Um,

1246
01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.440
because I wanted to see like what kind of a stimulant it gives you and whether

1247
01:11:05.441 --> 01:11:09.220
or not it would crave it more.
I puffed it all the way to the Bray Improv.

1248
01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.040
Did it do,
did it do anything?
Yeah,
gave me a little jolt,
but you know,

1249
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.750
<v 1>it's not something I want to do on a regular basis.</v>

1250
01:11:15.751 --> 01:11:17.790
It just wanting to experiment with it,
see what it was like.

1251
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.640
It doesn't have the satisfied checking of littering,
you know,

1252
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:25.650
just being a bad ass.
I spoke at [inaudible] Vegas the other day.

1253
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.710
Somebody had an EU hookah,
which was really one of those big fat ones.
Yeah.

1254
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.260
The big loan.
That's what Bobby Lee walks around with.
Bobby.

1255
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.900
He's got a God damn garbage can he brings with him.
It's filled up with nicotine.

1256
01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:41.010
So our roller and like he's rolling his golf clubs around him and PJ boats just

1257
01:11:41.011 --> 01:11:44.280
sit there and it just looks like,
I just look over.
I'm like,
that's not good.

1258
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.880
That's just not good.
Look at that.
Right.
But that's Bobby really,
you know,

1259
01:11:47.881 --> 01:11:51.570
he's like super indulgent.
This,
those funny guys,
man,

1260
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.690
there's so many funny guys that are just super indulgent and they almost can't

1261
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:57.720
help themselves.
There's this radio station and uh,
I believe Columbus,

1262
01:11:57.721 --> 01:12:00.280
Ohio that Bobby Lee was on recently and uh,

1263
01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.740
they had it video recorded video and he sat down on the couch and there was a

1264
01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:07.650
point where they were talking about another comedian.
Uh,

1265
01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.520
what's the One lady that really funny Chow with the tattoos?
Uh,

1266
01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.470
Margaret Cho.
Margaret trail.
Uh,
Margaret Cho was there.

1267
01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:18.660
She took off all her clothes and they were talking to Bobby about that.

1268
01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:20.640
And Bobby's like,
Oh,
you know,
I can take off all my clothes.

1269
01:12:20.641 --> 01:12:23.670
So he takes off all his clothes and sits down on the couch,
which is white.

1270
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:26.310
And then when he sat up and later and left,

1271
01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:30.690
he left the little Brown [inaudible] the radio station,

1272
01:12:30.691 --> 01:12:35.580
cut it out.
And it's,
oh gosh,

1273
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:40.860
he's dirty little like an excuse,
like,
well you don't understand.

1274
01:12:40.861 --> 01:12:45.180
I had an omelet too,
just shit his pants right there on their couch.

1275
01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.560
Oh,
he's probably cutting little farts to,
yeah,

1276
01:12:49.561 --> 01:12:53.040
you'd probably cut down.
He didn't want to let anybody know.

1277
01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:56.190
You probably get it on purpose.
He's like,
who has a white couch?

1278
01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:02.810
Yeah.
If you know Bobby.
Okay.
Um,
e-cigarettes,
let's see if,
uh,

1279
01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:07.420
it makes sense that e-cigarettes healthier.
Oh,
it's definitely healthier.

1280
01:13:07.421 --> 01:13:10.080
I'm not saying it's healthy,
I'm just saying that the nicotine intake,

1281
01:13:10.081 --> 01:13:12.250
I believe when you have like when these big who,

1282
01:13:12.251 --> 01:13:15.600
cause it's probably just drowning you with way more nicotine than your USP,

1283
01:13:15.601 --> 01:13:20.470
but I don't know if it is healthier.
I don't mind.
Not by much.
I mean,

1284
01:13:20.471 --> 01:13:23.820
I've,
it just feels like something's missing when you smoking a cigarette.

1285
01:13:23.821 --> 01:13:26.820
It's like drinking like coke zero.
You know what?
Maybe just doesn't have that.

1286
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:30.500
Yeah,
it's probably where I feel more than that.
Like I feel like it's,

1287
01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:34.320
this is not doing anything.
It doesn't feel like I have a straw.
I'm just going.

1288
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.233
Hmm.

1289
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:40.650
It says the one thing is the nicotine levels they're worried is the electronic

1290
01:13:40.651 --> 01:13:45.030
cigarette can contain as much nicotine as a regular cigarette or more and then

1291
01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:50.060
the amount of nicotine and electric cigarette delivers depends on the content of

1292
01:13:50.161 --> 01:13:52.920
the liquid nicotine cartridge installed it.

1293
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:57.780
So they can choose cartridges containing nicotine in a range of strengths and

1294
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:59.300
everyone goes for the strong ones too,

1295
01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:03.210
from cigarettes and you're sucking on that thing all day long and stuff.

1296
01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.830
Having a cigarette every like 1520 minutes or so.

1297
01:14:05.831 --> 01:14:10.110
Is there also cartridges that contain liquid without nicotine for users who want

1298
01:14:10.111 --> 01:14:12.070
the sensory experience of smoking without its

1299
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.903
<v 2>effect.</v>

1300
01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.940
So that's like fakers that's like people weren't fake glasses when they say that

1301
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.450
your first year,
like you're not really addicted to the nicotine,

1302
01:14:19.451 --> 01:14:22.870
you're addicted to the movement of putting the cigarette into your mouth a year,

1303
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.790
a year,
six months,
something I rent.
Yeah,
I like that.
A year,
six months,

1304
01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.040
three months.
You're just addicted to doing that.

1305
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.880
I read it somewhere or heard it or somebody else read it and they told him about

1306
01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:38.590
it.
Because when you drink,
you get drunk immediately.
The cigarette,

1307
01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:40.470
you don't really become addicted to it.
Nobody really liked.

1308
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.360
No one starts liking nicotine the first time you smoked a cigarette.
Well,

1309
01:14:43.361 --> 01:14:48.030
it's a weird feeling.
I remember that I did a,
uh,
sketch wants with,

1310
01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.630
um,
Adam Ferrara and Kevin James.
We're doing this Improv Troupe,

1311
01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:57.140
this comedy club,
and I did the sketch and I was supposed to play this,
uh,

1312
01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.830
this like poet that like smoked a lot of cigarettes.
So smart,

1313
01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:04.290
like really outrageous person.
So I was smoking these cigarettes on the set of,

1314
01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:08.140
so I took Adam cigarettes and I was fucked up,
man.

1315
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.670
I was really fucked up within like two cigarettes or three cigarettes.

1316
01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.410
My head was flying.
I was like,
my God,
I'm,
hi.
This is crazy.
Like,

1317
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:21.340
I didn't know this gets you high.
It gets you some weird kind of high.
Yeah,

1318
01:15:21.341 --> 01:15:25.720
it does.
Yeah,
but it doesn't,
it doesn't seem to interrupt your motor skills.

1319
01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.260
<v 5>This is a,
by the way,
I don't know if you can see this.
That might be hard to see.</v>

1320
01:15:28.261 --> 01:15:30.570
This is Bobby Lee's,
uh,
Skidmark.

1321
01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.640
<v 2>It's really hard to see it right here.
Yeah,
I can't see it.
Yeah,</v>

1322
01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.890
it's contrast is too fucked up.

1323
01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:39.131
Yeah.

1324
01:15:39.131 --> 01:15:43.210
So these things apparently it really depends who's making the east cigarette.

1325
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:46.650
And so in that way,
like a company like those blue Easter eggs,

1326
01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.500
that might be like the way to go,
like Elise,

1327
01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.960
you can count on it because it's saying that kind of the same thing is pot.

1328
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.370
Like when you buy a pot Brownie and you don't know what the fuck is in there,

1329
01:15:57.371 --> 01:16:00.340
like you're taking a total guess.
Right.
It's a big gamble.

1330
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:02.530
The difference between the impact of a pot cook,

1331
01:16:02.531 --> 01:16:06.970
your co a pot Brownie can be you just mellow sitting in front of the TV or you

1332
01:16:06.971 --> 01:16:11.080
on a wild rollercoaster ride to the dark recesses of your soul.

1333
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:15.820
Right.
You don't that feeling there's a big,
big,
big,

1334
01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:19.900
big God damn difference.
And because the fact that it's illegal,
you know,

1335
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:22.480
it's not regulated,
you don't know what you're getting.

1336
01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:25.300
That's probably the same thing with these east cigarettes

1337
01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:28.850
<v 5>and sometimes like the,
the cheaper ones,
like the gas stations,</v>

1338
01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:31.010
I'll have them now and you know,
you'd get the blue one,

1339
01:16:31.011 --> 01:16:32.090
that's the expensive kind,

1340
01:16:32.091 --> 01:16:35.810
but they all have like these like generic kind of versions of them and you get

1341
01:16:35.811 --> 01:16:39.140
some of those you suck on and you just get like a mouthful of juice sometimes

1342
01:16:39.141 --> 01:16:40.280
I'm like,
Eh,
that can't be good.

1343
01:16:40.281 --> 01:16:43.730
I'm taking like the juice that makes the smoke wringing out the filter at the

1344
01:16:43.731 --> 01:16:44.930
end of a cigarette.
Yeah.

1345
01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:49.160
<v 2>It's not good.
There's certain things like,
like,</v>

1346
01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.470
but you can count like one of the best things about,
uh,

1347
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.550
like edibles is if you find a company that makes a certain animal and you know

1348
01:16:56.551 --> 01:17:00.070
what it is like they make a jolly rancher.
Okay.
This jolly ranchers,

1349
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:04.380
very predictable one.
And you're good at light speed week does that,
yeah.

1350
01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.560
Their packages,
they have him.
How much they're very clever that way.

1351
01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.720
This east thing is interesting because they're starting to open up these

1352
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:16.670
e-cigarette lounges and places that we've seen them.
Yeah,

1353
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:20.480
yeah.
They have ecigarettes stores and e-cigarette lounges and they,

1354
01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:24.110
they serve different flavor.
Yeah.
It's weird.

1355
01:17:25.630 --> 01:17:28.890
People have like,
there's vaporizer store,
you know where it's going to do Joe.

1356
01:17:28.891 --> 01:17:32.880
It's going to make nonsmokers try it and then like it and then they're going to

1357
01:17:32.881 --> 01:17:35.270
get addicted to cigarettes and then here we go again.
Oh yeah.

1358
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.790
Someone's going to think they look cool blowing smoke and they're going to fuck

1359
01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:41.050
them and they're just going to keep trying to look cool again.
Just keep,

1360
01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.380
keep trying to itch that scab gotta make you feel better.

1361
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:49.100
It's like opium dance for people who aren't cool enough to smoke real
cigarettes.

1362
01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:52.340
Right.
Did you,
um,
you were,

1363
01:17:52.341 --> 01:17:56.800
you were in Alice and Addison last places.
Yeah.
Go back home.

1364
01:17:56.801 --> 01:17:59.500
I walk into a bar and everybody's just ripping cigarettes at the bar.
Yeah.

1365
01:17:59.501 --> 01:18:04.480
It's one of the last places that hangs in there.
Well,
when we performed there,

1366
01:18:04.481 --> 01:18:07.270
I was at the,
uh,
Addison Improv.
The last time was there.
I was like,

1367
01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:09.370
you guys have a goddamn smoking show.
I love it.

1368
01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.430
Like you have to specify and nonsmoking show.
Yeah.

1369
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.770
If you're a headliner from out of town,
you have to let them know in advance.
No,

1370
01:18:14.771 --> 01:18:17.730
not even that.
Like they have an 8:00 PM nonsmoker.
Right?
Right.

1371
01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.570
There was like an 8:00 PM nonsmoking Sean.

1372
01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:22.680
It was a 10:00 PM regular show and the 10:00 PM regular shows just stuff.

1373
01:18:22.681 --> 01:18:25.070
Fucking haze of shitty decision making,

1374
01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:28.840
booze and cigarettes,
ski and Marlboro Lights.

1375
01:18:29.710 --> 01:18:32.830
I'm not a fan of cigarette smoke.
I don't like the way it smells.

1376
01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:34.990
I think it's disgusting.
I think it's bad for you.

1377
01:18:34.991 --> 01:18:39.580
But there's something about a bar that's filled with cigarette smoke that just

1378
01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:43.090
feels right.
Crowd of cigarette smoke,
cause they're always a little bit better.

1379
01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.230
For some reason they're fucking animals and not worried about shit as much.

1380
01:18:47.231 --> 01:18:50.710
They're not even caring about their own body.
You know,

1381
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.830
Kinda two fucks.

1382
01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:57.580
Well it's a fact that girls who smoke or like much more likely to do something

1383
01:18:57.581 --> 01:19:00.280
freaky.
I'm so attracted to chicks.
You smoke cigarettes.
I don't know.

1384
01:19:00.281 --> 01:19:02.600
What are you telling me?
There's something sexy about that.

1385
01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:07.330
They're just making shitty decisions and the,
she's like,

1386
01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.970
you know how about one more on that cancer stick and you're like,

1387
01:19:09.971 --> 01:19:12.890
my Dick can't be nearly as dangerous.
Oh,

1388
01:19:12.891 --> 01:19:15.310
was she wrong after fuck cigarette?

1389
01:19:15.311 --> 01:19:18.170
Where you like just laying there or the during?
No,

1390
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:23.270
they just seem to tell your friends who's also like knowing that they're not

1391
01:19:24.011 --> 01:19:28.420
going to stay good looking for very long because the cigarettes like more

1392
01:19:28.421 --> 01:19:30.580
valuable.
It's a shorter ride

1393
01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:37.620
to shorter wilder ride fatality.
That was all.

1394
01:19:37.890 --> 01:19:42.890
If a girl is like really smoking hard cigarettes by the time she hits 40 fucking

1395
01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:47.560
party's over and you're my grandma now.
The party's over.
Write that down.

1396
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:54.040
It's true,
but a girl who's like a crossfit chick or something like that,

1397
01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.190
they could go deep in their forties and still like hot.
It's Pho yet?
Well,

1398
01:19:57.191 --> 01:20:00.430
there was just a picture on Facebook that was circulating where it has two
twins.

1399
01:20:00.490 --> 01:20:03.780
They're identical twins and one smoked for the last 15 years and then went

1400
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:07.260
didn't it showed them side by side.
The smoker looked remarkably good.

1401
01:20:08.230 --> 01:20:09.600
The twins.
I was like,

1402
01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:12.270
this is actually not a very good argument because it's 14 years of enjoying

1403
01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:16.650
cigarettes and barely paid a price and having fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're um,

1404
01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:20.730
like Halle Berry,
I think it's like 50 or something.
Like how old is she?

1405
01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:25.770
She's hot.
It's fuck man.
Does she smoke?
No,
of course not.

1406
01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:29.280
But I'm saying that's the difference.
Right?
If she did both of those lists,

1407
01:20:29.281 --> 01:20:33.780
be honest.
If I had to fuck one,
I don't know which one.
Should I click this?
Stop.

1408
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:36.350
Shut this off.
Shaming this.

1409
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.410
I'd rather watch beheading videos.
Shane,
you're shaming.

1410
01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:43.860
You're not supposed to do that one on the right.
Which one's the smoker?

1411
01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:48.420
Couldn't curl up.
Hey,
stop.
Don't show that anymore.
I'm sorry.

1412
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.170
Don't be showing it for real.
Like that's not good Karma to just show people,

1413
01:20:52.171 --> 01:20:55.590
go look how ugly these people's faces are and just if that's on a line
somewhere,

1414
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:58.350
that's one thing.
He's exactly what we're saying.
We're looking at it.

1415
01:20:58.351 --> 01:20:59.580
They're all beat up by cigarettes.

1416
01:20:59.581 --> 01:21:01.220
Were trying to figure out which one you would rather fuck.

1417
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:04.260
I wouldn't have both been through hell.
Okay.
Let's be honest.

1418
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:07.920
You wouldn't want your face appearing on a fucking a podcast.

1419
01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:12.690
Who would you rather fuck this guy or this guy with aids,
but the smoker,

1420
01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:16.620
the smoker would.
If she's still a smoker,
she would want to be on this podcast.

1421
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:19.130
That's almost like maybe,
maybe it's just,

1422
01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:24.140
just want to borrow $5 come here and blow everybody for a dollar 50 a piece.

1423
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:28.740
Be a disaster.
She's making shitty decisions.
They literally,
she left him,

1424
01:21:28.741 --> 01:21:32.010
put her face in that thing.
You know,
they probably gave her money for that.

1425
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:35.750
She's like,
well,
no one's gonna see it.
Everyone's gonna see it.
Goddammit.

1426
01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:40.830
Brian just showed it to half a million.
[inaudible] sorry.
I'm sorry for that.

1427
01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:43.740
I wouldn't have done it,
ma'am.
I just want you to know.
I just think it's wrong.

1428
01:21:43.741 --> 01:21:48.250
Don't do it again.
You fuck.
It's the right one is the smoker.
Yes.

1429
01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:50.370
That's the one I would do.
The other one looks like she has a black,

1430
01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:54.630
nevermind just stumping me.
I don't want,
I mean,
don't be mean.

1431
01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.890
It's just a person,
man.
It's a person out there and making shit decisions,

1432
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:01.380
but I support people's right to make shitty decisions.

1433
01:22:01.381 --> 01:22:05.700
There's something about the temporary nature of bar life and cigarette smoking,

1434
01:22:05.701 --> 01:22:10.701
but it's like it's kind of dying out and people are like clinging more to to,

1435
01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:16.160
to their existence and there's a part of me that enjoys a bar that's smokey.

1436
01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:20.430
Just like I enjoy being around drunk people sometimes I like,

1437
01:22:20.431 --> 01:22:22.830
I like drunk people that can handle it,
you know?

1438
01:22:22.831 --> 01:22:27.150
And I like a bar filled with people that are just out having a good fucking
time.

1439
01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:30.940
Yeah,
there's a lot more people that can handle it then can't handle it.
Right.

1440
01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:33.270
It's the people that can't handle it.
They're so outrageous.

1441
01:22:33.271 --> 01:22:36.420
They ruined the time for the people that can walk around throwing up and trash

1442
01:22:36.421 --> 01:22:39.060
cans in the middle of the street.
That's how it smell.
Like they handled it.

1443
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:42.120
If they threw up in each other's underwear,
then it would be a problem.
Well,

1444
01:22:42.121 --> 01:22:44.400
there's a difference between going to a bar where,
but he's cool drinking,

1445
01:22:44.401 --> 01:22:47.970
having a good time and they go into like a a 50 cent shot night college bar.

1446
01:22:47.971 --> 01:22:51.800
Like that's when it fucking train radical pitcher nickel,
right?
Yeah.

1447
01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.630
Well it's like being around college drinkers.

1448
01:22:54.631 --> 01:22:57.990
It's just like being around white belts in Jiu Jitsu class.
They spazz out,

1449
01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:00.490
they don't know how to relax.
They're just,
they,
you know,

1450
01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:02.940
they don't know how to like go with their friends and just have a couple of

1451
01:23:02.941 --> 01:23:06.070
shots and clink glasses and go,
let's do a shot of Jack

1452
01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:09.970
<v 0>for king hit knuckles together and you sit there and drink like nice people.</v>

1453
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.730
Right.
And you enjoy it and you have more laughs and you,

1454
01:23:12.731 --> 01:23:16.630
you talk more shit and you laugh at each other and you have a good time and it's

1455
01:23:16.631 --> 01:23:20.170
fun.
And it's a lot of hugs and high fives and shit.
A lot of hugs.

1456
01:23:20.171 --> 01:23:22.210
That's what it's like when we drink.
Well we drink,
it's,

1457
01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:26.170
there's no one gets any fights is no anger,
no breaks,
bottles and stabs people.

1458
01:23:26.171 --> 01:23:27.100
There's none of that going on.

1459
01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:31.210
You have to be a special type of fuck head to ruin a good drinking moment

1460
01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:35.200
unless you're drinking fireball.

1461
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:37.750
Unless you were one of those dudes that just can't drink.

1462
01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:41.310
We know those dudes that are just nice guys but they just can't handle it.

1463
01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.530
They just can't do it.
It can't do it.
They try,
they can't pull it off,

1464
01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.140
can't fucking do it.
There's a lot of them.

1465
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.380
They just got that broken gene in the man.
There's a lot more in California.

1466
01:23:50.381 --> 01:23:53.890
I noticed also I think there's a lot of psychologically damaged folks out here

1467
01:23:53.891 --> 01:23:57.400
that have come out here to reinvent themselves and I think you add alcohol to

1468
01:23:57.401 --> 01:23:59.080
that,
that particular mindset.

1469
01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:03.850
It's like the problem that I have with that is the same problem they have when

1470
01:24:03.851 --> 01:24:07.900
guys like doctor drew start talking shit about like the withdrawal syndromes

1471
01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:12.520
that are associated with weed.
I'm like how many people saying that?

1472
01:24:12.521 --> 01:24:16.240
It's like saying that peanuts will kill you because some people are allergic to

1473
01:24:16.241 --> 01:24:20.110
them.
Right?
Cause there's some people eat peanuts.
You're fucking dead.
It's not.

1474
01:24:20.111 --> 01:24:21.430
Most people though,
right?

1475
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:24.040
If you're watching some report on peanuts killing people and you're eating

1476
01:24:24.041 --> 01:24:27.370
peanuts going without fuck,
are you talking about peanuts are delicious.

1477
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:30.310
I had a peanut butter jelly sandwiches more.
I'm eating peanuts now.

1478
01:24:30.311 --> 01:24:33.210
I've got some honey roasted peanuts.
I got some salted peanuts.
I got some ropy.

1479
01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.900
Come on man.
Peanuts.

1480
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.710
But peanuts do kill a certain percentage of the population that's a kin to the

1481
01:24:38.711 --> 01:24:41.500
same type of people that are getting withdrawal syndromes from weed.

1482
01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:45.070
That's not typical.
That's not,
no.
So when you pretend you're,

1483
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:49.360
you're disingenuous if you're on TV pretending that it's a dangerous withdrawal

1484
01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:54.280
syndrome,
it's attached to the stronger weed today.
Um,
no it's not.
No,

1485
01:24:54.281 --> 01:24:56.170
it's just like people allergic to peanuts.

1486
01:24:56.470 --> 01:25:00.190
It's some rare freaks that smoke pot and next thing you know they're sucking

1487
01:25:00.191 --> 01:25:03.910
Dick for more pot.
Right.
Those are rare.

1488
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:08.040
It doesn't happen very often.
I think the old way to meet and the,

1489
01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:10.030
with drinking now getting older,
the only,

1490
01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:13.480
the only problem I have is like the hangovers.
Rq.
So fucking brutal now man.

1491
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:15.090
That's why you need one 80 from the onset.

1492
01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:17.560
When you were talking about the beginning,
I was like,
I'm like writing it down.

1493
01:25:17.561 --> 01:25:21.070
I'm like,
okay,
go ahead.
Well,
your body does not want you to do that.
I know,

1494
01:25:21.071 --> 01:25:24.340
but doesn't want you to drink like that.
You've got to drink a lot of water.

1495
01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:26.680
It's hard to do,
but if you do it while you're drinking,

1496
01:25:26.681 --> 01:25:29.710
it makes a big difference.
If like while you're drinking booze,

1497
01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:33.270
you force yourself to pound water.
You make a lot of trips to the bathroom.
Right?

1498
01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.010
But so what?
Just do it.
You'll feel way better.

1499
01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:39.250
It'll just go through your system better.
Your rehydrate better.

1500
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:40.600
He's still gonna feel like shit though.

1501
01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:44.980
I just have it solid poop one of these days.
One day,
Brian,

1502
01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:49.600
if you plan and hope and wish and pray to the Po,
the poop ferry,

1503
01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:54.250
it'll all come out hard.
You're probably dying.
You're probably,

1504
01:25:54.251 --> 01:25:56.410
your body's probably slowly breaking down from the inside.

1505
01:25:56.411 --> 01:26:00.040
You're probably shitting away little pieces of your liver detox and right now I

1506
01:26:00.041 --> 01:26:04.100
haven't drank saying I like to not drink for a of days a week.
Yeah,
you don't

1507
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:04.933
<v 1>have to,
man.</v>

1508
01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.780
It's just to your problem is you're in the social circles that are like,

1509
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:12.470
you know,
everyone's drinking and that's,
that's how everybody gets laid.
You know,

1510
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.750
which by the way,
the feminists think is rape.

1511
01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.290
We were talking about this on display with Kayla.
She's,
you know,

1512
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:20.920
sober now and she was talking about hard.
It is,

1513
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:25.930
thank God how hard it is to like actually get laid or how to like meet somebody.

1514
01:26:26.991 --> 01:26:28.880
Because when you're with a sober person,

1515
01:26:28.881 --> 01:26:32.270
like if you take a girl out that doesn't drink and you go,
oh,
that's the worst,

1516
01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:35.990
hardest thing to get to that first base.
Even because you're not,
you know,

1517
01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:40.580
you don't feel confident.
She is weird.
The weird thing that it actually is,

1518
01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:44.140
I'm going to stick your penis in her body.
Right.
It's weird.
You know,
it's,

1519
01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:47.120
it's only until people are drunk that it sounds like,
fuck yeah,
let's do this.

1520
01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.670
It'll grow.
Look at you.
You want to fuck.
Or what you're like,
whoa.

1521
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:53.690
Rarely happens when girls are sober over and if they are sober and they say,

1522
01:26:53.691 --> 01:26:54.524
do you want to fuck or what?

1523
01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:57.790
<v 2>Yeah,
exactly.
Probably crazy.</v>

1524
01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:03.040
Probably going to burn your house down right after they,
fuck you.
Bitch is nuts.

1525
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.810
<v 0>Yeah.
I don't know man.
It's hard for a girl.</v>

1526
01:27:05.811 --> 01:27:10.280
It's hard for anybody to trust anybody to be inside them.
It's very evasive.

1527
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:14.120
It's weird.
It's weird.
But you only that dudes are like creeps.

1528
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:17.030
There's a lot of rapists,
a lot of my stronger than women.

1529
01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:19.610
Women hear everyday about some guy in the news.

1530
01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:22.580
He forced himself on a girl and killed her and buried her body.

1531
01:27:22.581 --> 01:27:24.140
And there's crazy stories.

1532
01:27:24.141 --> 01:27:27.960
Like there was a kid recently in high school that killed one of the teachers,

1533
01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.820
cut it with a box cutter and dragged her into the woods behind the school.

1534
01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.380
What the fuck?
Yeah,
no one knows why or what.
Or there's the,
it's a mystery.

1535
01:27:36.381 --> 01:27:40.280
He's like 14 he was a well liked kid.
The whole thing is craziness.

1536
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:43.790
And that's a boy.
You know?
Imagine men,
if I was a chicken,

1537
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.290
be terrified to fuck a guy.
Yeah,
I mean they should be.
It's,
it's a,

1538
01:27:47.291 --> 01:27:49.370
it's a weird scenario and you know,

1539
01:27:49.371 --> 01:27:54.371
it's one of the only reasons why when you hear feminists talk about like how to

1540
01:27:54.471 --> 01:27:58.250
approach girls and how to respect the idea that these girls would be terrified

1541
01:27:58.251 --> 01:28:03.140
of you.
I agree with that whole heartedly.
100%.
It's one thing like,

1542
01:28:03.141 --> 01:28:06.110
I've heard it argued against that,
like the men's rights guys are like,

1543
01:28:06.111 --> 01:28:09.080
that's horse shit.
That's stupid.
You know,
not all guys are assholes.

1544
01:28:09.081 --> 01:28:13.160
He treated us like we're assholes.
It's sort of like manifest this whole,

1545
01:28:13.161 --> 01:28:16.040
you know,
attitude that certain men and women have with each other.

1546
01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:20.370
But that's easy for dudes to say because they're not getting raped,
you know,

1547
01:28:20.371 --> 01:28:21.950
and the men's rights guys,

1548
01:28:21.951 --> 01:28:25.280
one goofy thing that they fucking say they really need to shut the fuck up
about.

1549
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:29.270
They'd go,
you know who gets raped more than anybody in this country?
Men,

1550
01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.190
men in prison

1551
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:35.330
<v 2>and in prison.
And it's a hard,
that's a hard,
no,
it's a fact.</v>

1552
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:38.210
Man in prison get rate more than anyone in this country.

1553
01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:42.290
We know what the problem with that fact is.
They get raped by men,
right?

1554
01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:46.880
It's black on black crime.
Okay.
The men are raping the men.

1555
01:28:46.881 --> 01:28:49.940
It's not women breaking into prisoner of raping fucking poor prisoners.

1556
01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:51.890
It's men raping men.

1557
01:28:51.891 --> 01:28:55.660
It supports women's idea that these men have fucking assholes.

1558
01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:58.400
It's exactly what they've been saying.
I mean it's ridiculous.

1559
01:28:58.401 --> 01:29:02.370
It's such a fucking asinine and disingenuous argument,

1560
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:05.400
<v 0>but would you agree?
Okay.
Feminist and then men's,
right.</v>

1561
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:07.230
Would you agree there's a balance in the middle,

1562
01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:10.410
like a woman's doesn't want some guy who's going to intimidate her and scare the

1563
01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:10.821
shit out of it,

1564
01:29:10.821 --> 01:29:13.530
but she doesn't want some pussy who doesn't know how to make a movie either.

1565
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.860
As long as there's a fine line in the middle.
Yeah,
I,
well,

1566
01:29:16.861 --> 01:29:19.440
I think here's the problem with saying women want all right,

1567
01:29:19.710 --> 01:29:24.330
everybody wants something different.
Some women like Super Feminine,
really thin,

1568
01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:28.320
like heroin looking dudes.
Some women like guys with guts.

1569
01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.960
Some women like black guys,
someone,
women like Asian guys,

1570
01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:33.780
some women like timid guy.
Some women like aggressive guys.

1571
01:29:33.781 --> 01:29:36.360
Some women like to be held down so women like their hair polled.

1572
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:39.700
Some women like to be choked.
Some women will fucking screaming,

1573
01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:43.410
stab you if you tried to choke them rightly so.
If you just try to grab them,

1574
01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:45.090
it's triangle him like your last girlfriend,

1575
01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:47.400
they'll fucking think you trying to rape them and they'll grab something,

1576
01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:49.890
stab you in the Dick.
That's normal too.

1577
01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:54.180
There's a weird broad spectrum of what people like and don't like.

1578
01:29:54.181 --> 01:29:58.050
So whenever you say,
we don't want a man that does this,
are you sure?

1579
01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:00.270
Because I've met girls that want that.
You know,

1580
01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:02.220
don't tell me that women don't like to be choked.

1581
01:30:02.221 --> 01:30:04.740
They won't face fucked because they do.

1582
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.730
There's girls that like their face fucked.
Like I've,
I've seen it,

1583
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:13.020
I've heard him say it.
I've heard the words,
which fucked my mouth.
Like Whoa,

1584
01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:15.780
Holy Shit.
You're the boss.
Yeah.
Puke on your Dick.

1585
01:30:15.781 --> 01:30:17.790
And it dries up and it's like a skeleton.
The next day,

1586
01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:20.100
the first time a girl said it to me,
I was young man.

1587
01:30:20.101 --> 01:30:22.050
I had never even heard it before.
I was like,
wait a minute.

1588
01:30:22.051 --> 01:30:23.760
What's my last girlfriend?

1589
01:30:23.761 --> 01:30:26.640
She would scream if I grabbed the back of her head and this girl was telling me

1590
01:30:26.641 --> 01:30:30.960
to fuck her face.
Like everyone's different.
Everyone's different.

1591
01:30:30.961 --> 01:30:34.110
That's what the problem with this whole women like this are men.

1592
01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:37.020
Men want a women who not every man wants a woman that does that.

1593
01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:39.870
There's a lot of Ben,
one weird shit.
There's a lot of men want a mommy.

1594
01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.270
A lot of men like women that punch them in the face.

1595
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:45.990
There's this men that like there's a whole website's dedicated to getting kicked

1596
01:30:45.991 --> 01:30:50.010
in the balls by girls wearing stilettos.
There's a lot of weirdness in the world,

1597
01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:54.430
man.
You can't say men like this and women like that.
You can't,

1598
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:56.970
you only thing you could do is be nice to each other.

1599
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.640
That's the only thing he could do,
man or women.

1600
01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:03.600
So like the reason why feminism exists,

1601
01:31:03.630 --> 01:31:07.230
the only reason why it exists is because there's an imbalance.

1602
01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:09.360
If there wasn't an imbalance,
there wouldn't be.

1603
01:31:09.361 --> 01:31:11.850
This need to be extreme towards that side.

1604
01:31:12.090 --> 01:31:15.630
If it was like if men were like really kind to women and there was no dispute,

1605
01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.900
then there would be,
it would be,
it would be ridiculous to have feminism.

1606
01:31:18.901 --> 01:31:21.870
Nobody would believe in it.
The only reason why I can exist,

1607
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:25.830
like whether you believe in a lot of the things that they generalize or not and

1608
01:31:25.831 --> 01:31:27.930
I don't,
I don't believe in the generalizations.

1609
01:31:27.931 --> 01:31:30.330
I believe there's a lot of good people out there and I think as soon as you

1610
01:31:30.331 --> 01:31:33.090
start lumping men in a general categories,

1611
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:37.500
it's just like lumping women or anyone in the general categories were too broad

1612
01:31:37.501 --> 01:31:39.250
in a spectrum is always an exception.
Everything,

1613
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:42.480
but there's too many different variables when it comes to humans interacting

1614
01:31:42.481 --> 01:31:43.890
with each other,
especially sexually.

1615
01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:48.870
But the only reason why feminism exists at all is because there's something

1616
01:31:48.871 --> 01:31:50.670
wrong.
If there was nothing wrong,

1617
01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:53.040
if there was no women that were getting shit on,

1618
01:31:53.190 --> 01:31:55.950
if there was no sexual harassment in the workplace,

1619
01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:58.980
if there was no discrimination when it comes to employment,

1620
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.140
they're the don't know those things existed.
You couldn't make the argument.

1621
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:06.190
It just,
it's that simple that nobody would buy it.
The women wouldn't buy,

1622
01:32:06.210 --> 01:32:08.830
nobody would join.
They'd be like,
what are you talking about?
Like every men,

1623
01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.890
men treat women like they're themselves living another life right now.

1624
01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.470
But that's not the case.
So when you have,

1625
01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:17.230
whether it's the men's rights guys or the feminist,

1626
01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:20.530
the reason why these groups exist is because something's wrong.

1627
01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:22.330
There's not a balance,
you know,

1628
01:32:22.331 --> 01:32:24.820
and there's always gonna be someone that's out there on the far end of the

1629
01:32:24.821 --> 01:32:26.920
seesaw trying to tip it one way or the other,

1630
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:30.700
but that they exist because something's going on.

1631
01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:34.180
The men's rights guys exist because there's something going on because a lot of

1632
01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:36.730
guys do get fucked over in divorce.
Man,
I've seen it.

1633
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:39.760
I've seen some brutal shit happened to men in marriages.

1634
01:32:39.761 --> 01:32:43.360
I've seen some men that were targeted by women who are just,

1635
01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:47.350
there were financial assassins and they went after men for their money and got

1636
01:32:47.351 --> 01:32:50.020
pregnant with these men for their money and stole money from these man.

1637
01:32:50.021 --> 01:32:53.980
I've seen it.
I know it happens.
I've seen it without this.
The baby part.

1638
01:32:53.981 --> 01:32:57.460
I've seen,
I've seen people get fucked over.
I've seen it happen many times.

1639
01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:59.710
That doesn't mean that the men's rights guys are right.

1640
01:32:59.711 --> 01:33:03.850
When they say stupid shit,
like men get raped more than women,
you know?
Yeah,

1641
01:33:03.851 --> 01:33:06.280
you fucking give raped by each other.
You'd dumped.
Fuck,

1642
01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:10.300
that's such a dumb thing to say.
It's just,
it's so,
it's like,

1643
01:33:10.301 --> 01:33:13.370
it's such a disingenuous argument.
Are you really worried about being raped dude,

1644
01:33:13.690 --> 01:33:16.450
cause I don't worry about it ever.
How about that took her to prison.

1645
01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.870
I don't worry about getting raped,
man.
That's never comes up.
No,

1646
01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:21.850
and I'm around UFC fighters all the time.

1647
01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:25.210
I'm around people who actually could rape me and it doesn't really come up.

1648
01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:26.401
I just went.

1649
01:33:26.401 --> 01:33:31.090
A guy says that if a guy was talking about divorce laws and the idea that you

1650
01:33:31.091 --> 01:33:31.330
know,

1651
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:36.330
someone can actually target someone and someone can extract money from them by,

1652
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:40.990
you know,
by basically a conspiracy,
you're conspiring to rip guys.
Awesome.

1653
01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:42.220
That's what a gold digger is.

1654
01:33:42.221 --> 01:33:45.220
It's a whole professional and there's songs about it.
I mean,

1655
01:33:45.221 --> 01:33:49.060
it's not like a kind of a myth,
like a unicorn or something like that.

1656
01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:52.810
It's not what Coupa cobre it's a real fucking thing.
It's a category in society.

1657
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:56.320
Gold diggers,
and you know that's not good either.

1658
01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:59.620
But then there's the guys who fall for those traps.
What does that,

1659
01:33:59.621 --> 01:34:02.280
that's natural selection.
You stupid.
Fuck.
How do you,

1660
01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:05.530
how do you not look at her and look at you and not know she's after your money.

1661
01:34:05.531 --> 01:34:08.740
You're disgusting,
right?
What do you think?
It's your personality.
You know,

1662
01:34:08.741 --> 01:34:12.190
you're walking around with a fucking $10,000 watch on driving a Ferrari and you

1663
01:34:12.191 --> 01:34:15.250
wonder why women want you to pay for their rent.
Okay.
That's what you do.

1664
01:34:15.251 --> 01:34:18.910
Stupid within.
I'm on both sides.
Both sides of the fence.

1665
01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:23.410
That's how rocket.
But you know,
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to bridge gaps here.

1666
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:24.730
I'm trying to bring people together.

1667
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:27.730
I'm trying to let feminists and men's rights advocates and,

1668
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:31.210
and everybody know that we're all just humans.
When I see,

1669
01:34:31.211 --> 01:34:33.910
like I was watching this thing about atheism plus,

1670
01:34:33.911 --> 01:34:35.800
I don't know if you know what a few of them isn't pluses.

1671
01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.510
She's the people that want to attach atheism with core values,

1672
01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:44.660
like against sexual harassment,
racial discrimination,
my,
and they would,

1673
01:34:44.661 --> 01:34:47.890
they had these really long verbose speeches,
but my problem with that,

1674
01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:52.660
when I was watching that,
I was like,
Duh.
Right,
Duh.

1675
01:34:52.690 --> 01:34:54.660
That's what it essentially,
that's what it is.
Anyways.

1676
01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:59.300
It Gay Marriage de Racial Discrimination,
Duh.

1677
01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.000
You know,
w w sexual discrimination,
Duh.
All of its De,
yeah.

1678
01:35:04.001 --> 01:35:07.670
It shouldn't be there.
Right?
Everyone should just,
we should all know that.

1679
01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:10.070
It's like when you start railing on about it,

1680
01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:14.060
you make me want to sexually harass somebody because you're so fucking annoying

1681
01:35:14.061 --> 01:35:15.710
and it's so obvious what you're saying.

1682
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:20.930
It's so stupid to keep harping on shit that I say we shouldn't stab babies.

1683
01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:24.600
Yes.
Yes.
Those stabbing babies.
Profound.
Yeah.
Nobody,
well,

1684
01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:27.650
if you don't want gay people to get married,
you're a fucking asshole.

1685
01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:32.000
If you don't think that black people should have the same rate of pay as a white

1686
01:35:32.001 --> 01:35:33.200
person,
you're an asshole.

1687
01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:35.270
If you don't think black people should live in your neighborhood,

1688
01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:38.300
you're an asshole.
If you don't.
It's all nonsense.
It's,

1689
01:35:38.301 --> 01:35:41.830
it's so clear by this day and age that it's Duh.

1690
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:46.160
So when I see something like atheism plus in these long drawn out speeches where

1691
01:35:46.161 --> 01:35:49.010
they're mentioning all these other things that we should already agree on,

1692
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:52.010
like where are we starting from?
We starting from barbarism.

1693
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:56.750
Are We fucking pirates?
Are we,
are we educating fucking horrible criminal people?

1694
01:35:56.751 --> 01:36:01.000
Our fee is like,
yeah.
It was like stop harping on this shit enough ready?

1695
01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:03.560
We should literally make two countries.

1696
01:36:03.710 --> 01:36:07.850
We should saw the fucking country in half and put up a giant fence.

1697
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:12.350
And anybody who doesn't want gay marriage,
anybody who doesn't want black people,

1698
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:16.790
anybody you know,
hates Asians,
get over there,
stop.

1699
01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:18.770
You need to figure it out on your own.

1700
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.390
I tell many people have already figured it out.

1701
01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:23.570
Half the steps to I would say like a small island.
I looked like an island.

1702
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.060
Just let it go and do that.
It might even be half the people,

1703
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:27.163
but it's going to be,

1704
01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.970
but my point is if you're joining atheism plus Jesus fucking Christ,

1705
01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.380
aren't you already there?

1706
01:36:33.710 --> 01:36:37.010
I mean you really have to repeat that or I mean how much preaching to the choir

1707
01:36:37.011 --> 01:36:37.844
has to be done.

1708
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.410
They have dog Chirp on that same shit that we all rational people already

1709
01:36:42.411 --> 01:36:44.720
agreeing.
Saw this pitch,

1710
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:49.520
Roger Animoto or we'll take the left.
You take the right

1711
01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:53.150
<v 2>go right and we can all live in each of the spots we want it to,
but let's,</v>

1712
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.720
let's recognize what we have over here.
We have a bunch of black haters,

1713
01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:00.890
bunch of Jew haters,
but you gay bashers all in one country.

1714
01:37:01.670 --> 01:37:03.920
We can give them Louisiana.
Not Louisiana is pretty full.

1715
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:06.590
We should we give them North Dakota,
give them South Dakota.

1716
01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.540
Nobody even goes there.
I would say Rhode Island,

1717
01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:13.100
the move to South Dakota people to like Connecticut.
They'd be so happy.

1718
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:19.790
This one spot to give him some upper Alaska areas.
Will they have camps?

1719
01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:23.640
That's what we should do.
Take Racist,
rally them up there quite a bit.
Camps,

1720
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:25.430
I can live with polar bears.

1721
01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.500
You want to know how much you're going to love black people.

1722
01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:30.290
After nine months of living with polar bears,
I got an idea.

1723
01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:34.850
Let's take everybody and put them in a kid
that's never been done before.

1724
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:38.480
This will glue the idea.
Well,

1725
01:37:38.481 --> 01:37:42.140
clearly we have too many people that suck.
It just,
it's so simple.

1726
01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:44.800
It's just don't be an asshole.
You don't need it.
It's,

1727
01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:49.820
it's so salty and it really,
in this day and age,
it's really all that's left.

1728
01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:53.660
You know,
if you,
I mean,
someone can say,
I am a blank.

1729
01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:56.050
Fill in the blank with the religion.
As soon as you,

1730
01:37:56.050 --> 01:37:58.710
<v 0>religion involves killing people that don't believe in your religion,</v>

1731
01:37:58.890 --> 01:37:59.760
you're an asshole.

1732
01:37:59.810 --> 01:38:04.650
It doesn't matter if you call yourself a Muslim or a Mormon or Christian.

1733
01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:07.530
You know any Christian that believes in killing people that don't believe in

1734
01:38:07.531 --> 01:38:10.560
Christ,
right?
You're missing it though.
You're missing a completely.

1735
01:38:10.650 --> 01:38:13.380
And what about that little voice in that site that just says this isn't,

1736
01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.990
this just doesn't feel right.
Some people don't have that voice.

1737
01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:17.680
Do they have voice and says,
eat the babies.

1738
01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:20.450
But that's a small minority of sociopaths.

1739
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:23.790
I'm talking about even the most hardcore Christian it deep down inside of

1740
01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.470
someone's going to murder another,
you go add.

1741
01:38:25.471 --> 01:38:28.170
This just doesn't feel good if everything's going well.
See,

1742
01:38:28.171 --> 01:38:29.490
that's what the thing is though.

1743
01:38:29.491 --> 01:38:32.520
The thing is that only exists if everything's going well.

1744
01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:35.700
If everything's going well in people's lives and they're not living a really

1745
01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:39.870
savage existence where they're hardscrabble trying to feed their family and the

1746
01:38:39.871 --> 01:38:44.480
children.
Once that starts happening,
people get really savage.
Really?
Correct.

1747
01:38:44.490 --> 01:38:46.380
But what I'm saying is like a hardcore Christian,

1748
01:38:46.381 --> 01:38:49.080
deep down inside you know that it's not right.

1749
01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:51.570
You shouldn't be against gay people being happy you.

1750
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:55.120
Why don't you listen to that voice,
but they don't know.
Because if,

1751
01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:59.220
if someone really believes in an ideology,
okay,

1752
01:38:59.221 --> 01:39:01.890
if you really believe in the teachings of the Bible,

1753
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:06.630
there are passages in the Bible that you can interpret as saying that a man

1754
01:39:06.631 --> 01:39:09.870
should not lie with a man.
Sure.
And then if a man does that,

1755
01:39:09.871 --> 01:39:11.970
that man is against God.

1756
01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:15.540
And then if you get really crazy about defending God's will,

1757
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:19.620
you might conceivably think that you're doing God's work by killing someone who

1758
01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:24.000
happens to be gay.
It's a ridiculous aspect of ideology.

1759
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.990
It's a real problem.

1760
01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:30.770
There was a fucking crazy video that Sam Harris tweeted after he did my podcast.

1761
01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:34.820
We talked about Islam and we talked about,
um,

1762
01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.690
people that think that it's radical Islam,
but it's not radical Islam.

1763
01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.040
It's just some of the tenants of being a Muslim that they all believe in.

1764
01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:49.440
Find that video,
find that video.
It's a Sam Harris,
uh,

1765
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:53.340
on.
It's actually on Sam harris.org.
It's on his website.

1766
01:39:53.490 --> 01:39:58.110
He Ha he wrote a whole blog post about it and then link the video and you watch

1767
01:39:58.111 --> 01:40:01.350
it.
And they're talking about stoning people to death for adultery and how many

1768
01:40:01.351 --> 01:40:04.650
people agree with it and they're all agreeing and raising their hands like,
no,

1769
01:40:04.651 --> 01:40:08.550
that just makes you an asshole.
Right?
That just makes you an asshole.

1770
01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:11.700
Try to find the video.
It's in there somewhere.

1771
01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:13.210
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

1772
01:40:13.210 --> 01:40:16.660
<v 0>it says something.
That's it right there.
Islam or Islamophobia.</v>

1773
01:40:17.630 --> 01:40:21.850
Now watch this.
And this is fascinating because this guy is really,

1774
01:40:21.851 --> 01:40:26.851
really confident when he's making this speech about what,

1775
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:31.510
what,
uh,
Muslims believe and don't believe.
I mean,
this is actually islam.net.

1776
01:40:31.511 --> 01:40:36.511
This is not a website that's designed to like shame the Muslims.

1777
01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:39.370
They're very proud of what this guy is saying.

1778
01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:44.390
It's very radical.
It's really interesting.
Pull it,

1779
01:40:44.391 --> 01:40:47.330
pull it forward a little bit till you see the guy talking.

1780
01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:49.520
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1781
01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:54.040
<v 0>How they always attack the Muslims or Islam in particular while</v>

1782
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:57.400
<v 8>for four,
seven certain things.
For example,
about gays in the,</v>

1783
01:40:57.610 --> 01:41:01.960
they're always attack us and the teachings towards this matter.
For example,

1784
01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:06.010
while in Christianity in Judaism it's the same punishment,

1785
01:41:06.610 --> 01:41:10.330
uh,
that exist.
You know,
I mean it's Harambe and uh,

1786
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:12.430
so why they're always,
for example,

1787
01:41:12.431 --> 01:41:16.990
focusing on Islam and not a Judaism or Christianity.

1788
01:41:16.991 --> 01:41:18.850
While for example,
also on Jerusalem,

1789
01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:23.620
for those who've been to Jerusalem in the bosses,
in Jerusalem for example,

1790
01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:26.490
women's sits separate than men for example.
You know,

1791
01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:29.230
so why like five minutes ago or early,

1792
01:41:29.231 --> 01:41:34.060
we were asked about why Muslims,
uh,
has to be sitting separate,

1793
01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:39.070
you know,
men and women,
but they never ask these questions to Jews or Christians.

1794
01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:40.870
Why specifically Muslims or Islam?

1795
01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:42.710
<v 9>Did you answer this question yesterday?</v>

1796
01:41:44.130 --> 01:41:46.010
And you said that you need to ask the media.

1797
01:41:49.130 --> 01:41:53.390
<v 8>Yeah,
he was an a tier,</v>

1798
01:41:53.391 --> 01:41:54.730
but the other people were here.

1799
01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:59.090
There are other people will suffer because of you.

1800
01:42:00.570 --> 01:42:01.850
The answer's very simple.

1801
01:42:01.851 --> 01:42:05.600
Islam is the truth and in Christianity and Judaism and not the truth.

1802
01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:10.350
<v 9>Oh,
what a great answer.
Can I get fucking change this topic?
Oh,</v>

1803
01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.370
watch this.
This is where it gets interesting.
Yup,
but you are the shit.

1804
01:42:16.450 --> 01:42:19.100
You're the doctor.
I said,

1805
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:25.330
can we have the camera?
Can we have this camera focusing on all the audience?
Sir,

1806
01:42:26.650 --> 01:42:29.620
can we have this camera focusing on all the audience?
Because

1807
01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:34.360
every now and then,
every time we have a conference,

1808
01:42:34.361 --> 01:42:36.190
every time we invite a speaker,

1809
01:42:37.210 --> 01:42:40.570
they always can come with the same accusations.

1810
01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:46.380
This speaker supports death penalty for homosexuals.

1811
01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:50.800
This speaker support death penalty for this crime,

1812
01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:53.470
this crime that he is homophobic,

1813
01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:57.420
they subjugate women,
etc. Etc.
Etc.

1814
01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:02.520
It's the same old stuff coming all the time and we always try to tell them.

1815
01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.220
I always try to tell them that,
look,

1816
01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:12.150
it's not that speaker that we are in whiting who has this extreme radical views.

1817
01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.233
As you say,

1818
01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:18.730
these are general views that every Muslim actually has.

1819
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:24.030
Every Muslim believes in these things just because they're not telling you about

1820
01:43:24.221 --> 01:43:24.420
it.

1821
01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:27.730
Just because they're not out there in the media doesn't mean they don't believe

1822
01:43:27.731 --> 01:43:30.550
in them.
So I will ask you,

1823
01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:37.180
everyone in the room,
how many of you are normal?

1824
01:43:37.181 --> 01:43:42.010
Muslims do not extremist.
You're not radical.
This is normal Sunni Muslims.

1825
01:43:42.011 --> 01:43:42.940
Please raise your hands.

1826
01:43:45.670 --> 01:43:49.690
Everybody a lot.
So panela.
Okay,
take down your hands again.

1827
01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:56.260
How many of you agree that men and women should sit separate?

1828
01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:00.800
Please raise your hands.
They're all raising their hands,
by the way,

1829
01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:03.560
except for one bad ass.
What the fuck are in the front row that keeps his arms?

1830
01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:08.670
Everyone agreed now,
now it gets rather,
it's just this kind of losses.

1831
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:13.190
So it's not just this radical shifts then a lot of work.
But next question.

1832
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:18.430
How many of you agree that the punishments described in the Qur'an and the

1833
01:44:20.301 --> 01:44:23.000
sooner,
whether it is death,

1834
01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:26.300
whether it is stoning for adults or whatever it is,

1835
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:29.660
if it is from a lot and his messenger,

1836
01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:34.940
that is the best punishment ever possible for humankind.

1837
01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:39.590
And that is what we should apply in the world.
Well,
who agrees with that?

1838
01:44:40.130 --> 01:44:42.770
Everyone raises their hand.
4,000 people.
La,
look,

1839
01:44:42.771 --> 01:44:46.640
what are you all radical extremists and they're all matte.

1840
01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:52.670
So all of you are saying that you are common Muslims.

1841
01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:55.880
You all go to the different massages.
No Way.
Or is it,

1842
01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:01.240
are you like a specific sect like the Islam Net sec to anything like that?

1843
01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:05.330
Are you like that?
Nah.
Is it?
Oh like the periods yet.

1844
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.970
Please raise your hand if you like this extreme Islam,

1845
01:45:07.971 --> 01:45:10.970
that sector or anything like that.
No one raises their hand.

1846
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:16.300
How many of you just go to this normal massage?
It's in Norway.

1847
01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:20.990
The normal student.
He must please raise your hands.
Everyone raises their hand.

1848
01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:25.970
Allahu Akbar.
So what's,

1849
01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:27.830
what's the politicians going to say now?

1850
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.350
What does the media going to say now that we're all extremists were all

1851
01:45:32.370 --> 01:45:37.100
radicals.
We need to deport all of us from this country.
A law,

1852
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:42.660
a law hawk.
Duck been duck.
Okay,

1853
01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:43.873
kill it.

1854
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:45.900
<v 1>Amazing.
Yeah,
but this is it.</v>

1855
01:45:45.901 --> 01:45:50.901
Just because that group in particular is like going to it like a huge church and

1856
01:45:51.241 --> 01:45:54.570
then they're all just like,
yes,
we believe you.
Now are these just normal people?

1857
01:45:54.571 --> 01:45:57.900
Like if you go out on the street is in the Quran,
right?

1858
01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:01.440
Those are the punishments that are for homosexuality,

1859
01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:06.180
for adultery.
Those were the punishments,
right?
You're supposed to be killed.

1860
01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:08.760
And there were saying that every Muslim agrees with this.

1861
01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:12.420
Everyone at least in that group of 40,000 people agrees with that man.

1862
01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:16.320
Whether or not that carries over to larger groups or whether or not people have

1863
01:46:16.321 --> 01:46:19.680
a more moderate view.
That's a small group.
That small bro.

1864
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:24.120
It's not the whole country,
but everyone in the group agreed.
It's a weird thing.

1865
01:46:24.121 --> 01:46:27.120
We couldn't get that many people and they're all raising their hands at throwing

1866
01:46:27.121 --> 01:46:28.650
rocks at people until they die.

1867
01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.890
But if you go to like one of our men and men and ministries,
you know,

1868
01:46:31.891 --> 01:46:35.940
like are people that,
you know,
the guys that always asks for money and you know,

1869
01:46:35.941 --> 01:46:39.390
like there's big groups of people at the church is that you have on late night

1870
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:40.490
teenagers like,

1871
01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:44.800
but the administry if you see one of those and he did the same thing and then

1872
01:46:44.801 --> 01:46:48.390
I'll,
you know,
all those people might be like that.
You know what I mean?
It is,

1873
01:46:48.391 --> 01:46:50.010
it all likeminded people are drawn together

1874
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.020
<v 0>in one place.
It could be.
Yeah.
It could be,</v>

1875
01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:57.050
but I think the difference being is that he's citing very specific passages in

1876
01:46:57.391 --> 01:47:02.220
the religion that deal with crimes and punishments and,
uh,
you know,
they,

1877
01:47:02.221 --> 01:47:05.660
they're,
they're,
they're agreeing on murder.
Oh yeah.

1878
01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:09.140
Basically because it's the truth.
Yeah.
Because it's the truth.
That's all he said.

1879
01:47:09.141 --> 01:47:13.760
It's just the truth.
Yeah.
That's,
um,
that becomes a problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1880
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.230
That's,
that's like,

1881
01:47:15.250 --> 01:47:19.550
this is not just simply whether or not you think that other people should

1882
01:47:19.551 --> 01:47:22.430
believe what you believe,
but you believe if two guys fuck each other,

1883
01:47:22.431 --> 01:47:24.080
they should throw rocks at them.
Until they die.

1884
01:47:24.930 --> 01:47:27.060
<v 1>If you look at this group,
if you really look at the people,</v>

1885
01:47:27.061 --> 01:47:29.730
they're all young people,
they all look like call of duty players.

1886
01:47:29.731 --> 01:47:33.450
Actually I don't even see one old person over the age of 2030 I mean,

1887
01:47:33.451 --> 01:47:35.190
well it's Kinda hard to see quite honest.

1888
01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:36.680
<v 0>You see some people in the front row,</v>

1889
01:47:36.681 --> 01:47:38.870
but everything back behind that gets really blurry.

1890
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:42.440
You don't really see how closely,
you know,
see a close up other faces.

1891
01:47:42.650 --> 01:47:45.980
But the front row.
Yeah,
definitely young people.
I think a lot of like,
you know,

1892
01:47:45.981 --> 01:47:49.970
radical religions,
they find people that are looking for guidance,
you know,

1893
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:53.270
and they find people that are looking for some sort of a,
a clear pattern.

1894
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:56.240
There's something about like that guy talking.
Okay.

1895
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:59.960
He was so confident that everyone was going to raise their hand along with him.

1896
01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:03.140
Yeah.
And the things that he was saying,
there's a,

1897
01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:06.410
there's this like appeal to like being a part of that.
You know,

1898
01:48:06.411 --> 01:48:07.570
this is like this.
There's this,

1899
01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:12.560
you're drawn to the idea of being a part of this crazy group that is so down for

1900
01:48:12.561 --> 01:48:15.560
what they believe that they think that you should kill people with rocks have,

1901
01:48:15.561 --> 01:48:20.090
they don't fall some old old writing.
There's something appealing about that.

1902
01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:24.200
It becomes something like you,
you become like a part of like some bad ass group.

1903
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:25.670
Have you joined up with that?

1904
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:29.660
He become like a serious person who really believes in God.
Like,
Ooh,

1905
01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:33.530
it appeals to,
it appeals to a weird aspect of the human psyche.

1906
01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:37.930
What's that song was playing in the background?

1907
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:41.320
<v 6>I don't hear anything.</v>

1908
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:45.570
<v 0>Oh Sir,
sir.</v>

1909
01:48:45.570 --> 01:48:48.660
Something from someone's laptop or something leaking over a sound check to

1910
01:48:48.661 --> 01:48:53.640
islam.net.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What was that
freak out?
White people.

1911
01:48:53.641 --> 01:48:57.830
They probably don't even like that.
We want to freak them out.

1912
01:48:58.130 --> 01:49:00.660
<v 1>It's like a televangelist.
This is what I was trying to think of earlier,</v>

1913
01:49:00.661 --> 01:49:02.160
but that's what it seemed like.
It's,
um,

1914
01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.560
did it look like they were all on board with that though?

1915
01:49:04.590 --> 01:49:07.160
Because there was a lot of hesitation,
it seemed like on some of their faces.

1916
01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:10.390
That dude in the right hand corner with his arms crossed.
Yeah,
that motherfucker,

1917
01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:15.730
that guy never raised his hand.
He's just looking at the ground.

1918
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:17.400
He looks pretty Russian,
but they,

1919
01:49:17.401 --> 01:49:19.830
a lot of them were kind of laughing a little bit like they weren't even like,

1920
01:49:19.831 --> 01:49:22.080
I don't know if we'd do 100% believe this.

1921
01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:23.920
<v 0>Well,
I don't know about that.</v>

1922
01:49:23.921 --> 01:49:26.740
I think you guys are looking into that when that dummy on to the right side,

1923
01:49:26.741 --> 01:49:30.220
because Islam is the true that you're the ball and Christianity and Judaism are

1924
01:49:30.221 --> 01:49:34.780
not the truth.
You shut up you Tommy,
you just trying to get friends.

1925
01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:39.130
You don't have any friends.
You want friends be on your side.
You're old,

1926
01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:40.990
you're old,
you're pretending.
That makes sense.

1927
01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:42.700
You don't have anybody to talk to you.

1928
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.330
If you get that stupid beard and pair of glasses and a fucking blazer on,

1929
01:49:46.331 --> 01:49:48.040
like you're a college and you say that

1930
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.770
<v 2>in front of a group of people and don't know that it sounds retarded.</v>

1931
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:53.170
You don't have any friends.
Did you know that?

1932
01:49:53.171 --> 01:49:56.860
There's an oculus rift porn now I heard it's connected to like a fleshlight

1933
01:49:56.861 --> 01:49:59.650
device and then to sit there and you,
I heard,

1934
01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:02.530
what is the guy saying?

1935
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:07.280
He's seeing an anime character that he's fucking crazy.

1936
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:11.440
The more he fucks her,
the more he like.
That's so ridiculous.

1937
01:50:11.441 --> 01:50:14.460
And it's very south park like anime.
I don't want to see that guy's Dick.

1938
01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:18.170
I'm just know that you'll see some base.

1939
01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:28.780
Yeah,
hole.
It's a matter of time before they have a robot that fucks you.

1940
01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:29.713
Yeah.

1941
01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:33.880
I wonder if it'll be that first or it'll be like the new thing that Motorola

1942
01:50:33.881 --> 01:50:35.200
came up with.
If you've seen this,

1943
01:50:35.201 --> 01:50:40.201
it's a patent for a tattoo that they're going to tattoo a microphone on your

1944
01:50:40.670 --> 01:50:44.380
voicebox,
like some sort of electronic tattoo.

1945
01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:46.510
So they're going to literally implant,

1946
01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:51.540
they're going to start implanting microphones on people's necks and with that

1947
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:56.460
you're going to be able to talk directly to the device without any distortion or

1948
01:50:56.470 --> 01:51:00.040
sound.
These aren't the droids.
Yeah,
exactly.
That's how it started.
I mean,

1949
01:51:00.041 --> 01:51:02.630
this is how it starts now.
It starts.
It's,
it's,

1950
01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:07.680
it's more like by your command for people that have problems talking,

1951
01:51:07.691 --> 01:51:09.510
you know,
like with throat cancer or something like that.

1952
01:51:09.511 --> 01:51:12.520
When I was a wall and it will have any bearing instead a voice box just to the

1953
01:51:12.521 --> 01:51:16.480
computer chip.
Yeah.
It's just a microphone.
It's only a microphone.
See this.

1954
01:51:16.481 --> 01:51:19.870
They're going to tattoo that shit.
Gangster style and your neck,
like

1955
01:51:21.970 --> 01:51:24.130
Ethan Hawke movie back when girls wanted to fuck him.

1956
01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:26.710
He probably did a few of these movies back when he was still kind of cute.

1957
01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:30.980
Now he's like a dad.
He's a dad and a horror movie a lot back.
Every horse.

1958
01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:32.920
He was a cute,
smart guy.

1959
01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:36.370
He's going to rescue you because you have that tattoo on your neck and starts

1960
01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:39.310
glowing.
Just means your life tokens or app or something.

1961
01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:44.320
Did I just make a plot for a new hit?
Someone called Michael Bay.

1962
01:51:45.070 --> 01:51:48.550
It's a great idea.
Are you going to go see Thor?
Oh yeah.
I would love to see Thor.

1963
01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:52.420
I love those movies.
I was at a huge marvel comics fan growing up,

1964
01:51:52.421 --> 01:51:55.540
so I see every one of those fucking things.
And iron man or what have you.

1965
01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:58.120
I enjoyed iron man three.
I thought it was kind of interesting.

1966
01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.790
It wasn't as good as iron man too,
but it's still a good ride.

1967
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:05.200
Same thing with Wolverine.
I love the new wolverine.
It was the last one,

1968
01:52:05.201 --> 01:52:07.370
but it was all right.
You thought this,
you thought,
uh,

1969
01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:10.360
Orgill's is better than the new one?
Yeah.
Okay.
I thought it was,

1970
01:52:10.810 --> 01:52:14.140
I thought that one of the bones coming out of his novels [inaudible] come on,

1971
01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:16.880
there's a little,
but the Avengers,
this,

1972
01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:21.150
the hog scene alone for the Avengers was worth the price of division.
The Hog.

1973
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.510
They have the whole down.

1974
01:52:22.511 --> 01:52:25.480
For the longest time they used to have to get a dude pretending to be the hall,

1975
01:52:25.481 --> 01:52:29.350
cause that was bullshit.
But now they can CGI the shit out of the hawk.

1976
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:34.090
See only thing that works with CGI better than it works in real life because the

1977
01:52:34.091 --> 01:52:36.640
hulk is supposed to be this freakish thing that doesn't even really look

1978
01:52:36.641 --> 01:52:39.760
remotely like a person.
Right.
Not supposed to be a bodybuilder.

1979
01:52:42.010 --> 01:52:44.300
New One.
The new hoke is the shit,
dude.
Yeah.

1980
01:52:44.301 --> 01:52:45.980
I was worried about that at first cause I was,

1981
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.370
I kind of like Edward Norton playing it and then I saw and he fucking knocked it

1982
01:52:49.371 --> 01:52:50.420
out of the park.
There was awesome.

1983
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:54.340
Edward Norton gets suck it after you see the new one.
Yeah.
Over bitch.
Yeah.

1984
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:59.330
What's this guy's name?
Mark Ruff.
Ruff.
Ruff.
Hello.
Yeah,
he's nailed it.

1985
01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:01.850
He's way better.
I believe that he's going to turn into the hulk.

1986
01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:04.070
That scene when he goes,
the trick is,

1987
01:53:04.071 --> 01:53:06.560
I'm always angry I best food scene in the movie.

1988
01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:09.680
I believe that that dude's just barely keeping it together and when he turns,

1989
01:53:09.681 --> 01:53:12.080
man,
it's fucking fantastic.

1990
01:53:12.710 --> 01:53:16.790
But I didn't buy scarlet Johannson surviving that bitch.
Please.
Oh,

1991
01:53:16.791 --> 01:53:18.440
you got some fucking flippy moves.

1992
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:22.250
He got some gymnastics and you got the hawk chasing you running through walls

1993
01:53:22.251 --> 01:53:27.160
and you just managed to survive.
And even watching shield of police,

1994
01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:29.510
even watching agents of shield on NBC.
No,

1995
01:53:29.511 --> 01:53:32.420
it was it any good or whatever channels.
I'm watching TV shows,
Dude.

1996
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:35.740
But that one guy is in the show,
the one that died in the crossers.

1997
01:53:35.890 --> 01:53:39.030
How the fuck he died in the Avengers.
Yeah,

1998
01:53:39.031 --> 01:53:42.530
I remember they make you figgy does they give you like a playing card or

1999
01:53:42.531 --> 01:53:45.770
something,
right?
That's right.
Yeah.
I don't know.

2000
01:53:45.771 --> 01:53:46.940
They can do whatever the fuck they want.

2001
01:53:46.941 --> 01:53:49.850
They bring people back with time machines and shit.
Comic books.

2002
01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:54.560
You believing it's Thor.
You believe in [inaudible] guy came from,

2003
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:57.340
from another planet and our problem is there a guy that maybe died.

2004
01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:00.470
I'm not buying.
This is fucking show's over.

2005
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:05.060
I buy that little skinny scientists guy can become a huge hulking 8,000 pound

2006
01:54:05.061 --> 01:54:09.710
green man,
but no,
I had to do it back flips.
Yeah.
I don't buy that.

2007
01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:11.240
The whole can fly through the air,

2008
01:54:11.241 --> 01:54:15.440
but he can't catch scarlet Johannsen that she does gymnastics to get away from

2009
01:54:15.441 --> 01:54:15.860
him.

2010
01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:20.860
He literally can leave like a bullet through the air and he can't catch her

2011
01:54:21.230 --> 01:54:25.520
bitch.
Continuity.
You fucks.
How about a little continuity?

2012
01:54:25.521 --> 01:54:28.580
How about right something that makes more sense and you don't have that scene.

2013
01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:29.733
Asshole.

2014
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:36.140
I thought of the best shit was captain America and iron man duking it out in the

2015
01:54:36.141 --> 01:54:40.130
woods.
Upset with each other.
Well,
it was iron man and captain America.

2016
01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:44.300
They were talking shit to each other.
I remember it was Thor and Captain America.

2017
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:46.370
Thor and Ironman went to war.
Right,

2018
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:49.640
but captain America and iron man,

2019
01:54:49.641 --> 01:54:52.910
we're talking shit to each other cause it's captain America was like,
yeah,

2020
01:54:53.250 --> 01:54:55.990
who you are without that machine is right.
Bitch,
you're on steroids,
right?

2021
01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:01.260
Captain America.
I was like a little skinny guy.
They gave him like the Super Roy.

2022
01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:05.870
Yeah.
Come on sign.
This is stupid fucking argument we're having here.

2023
01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:09.740
That was a great scene.
Those are good movies,
man.
They're fun.
They're stupid,

2024
01:55:09.741 --> 01:55:12.170
they're fun and when they're over you feel like a boy again.

2025
01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:15.560
You'll feel like you just watched something retarded.
Nobody cried.

2026
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:17.930
He didn't have to fucking explain yourself afterwards.
Well,

2027
01:55:17.931 --> 01:55:22.931
I felt like she was being unfair to him because his whole day you have to

2028
01:55:23.091 --> 01:55:27.520
interpret,
not interested.
She got blown up.
Yeah.

2029
01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:30.570
Women like to interpret films after they're over.
Guys like to try to fuck you,

2030
01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:32.150
which I do take it in a movie.

2031
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:35.870
It's just we're just trying to give you something fun to do before we fuck you.

2032
01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:41.990
It's really nice to at least try to fuck you.
I mean,
maybe want to say it.

2033
01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:44.100
It's bad.
Good.
That looks good.
I heard

2034
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.180
<v 0>that was amazing.
It's so funny.
Everyone that says saw it said it was amazing.</v>

2035
01:55:48.330 --> 01:55:52.230
It looks fucking does a lot of it in Columbus,
Ohio.
Let's film too,
by the way.

2036
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:55.090
Fun Fact.
Really?
Yup.
It's good.
A lot of dumb people in Ohio

2037
01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:58.870
don't realize as Johnny maximum,

2038
01:56:00.050 --> 01:56:04.590
what are you retarded jackass yet?
Yeah,
if you don't know,

2039
01:56:04.710 --> 01:56:08.580
he looks,
that's the most amazing thing they can do now with,
with makeup.

2040
01:56:08.990 --> 01:56:09.151
You know,

2041
01:56:09.151 --> 01:56:12.450
like even back when Jamie Kennedy had that show that Jamie Kennedy experience,

2042
01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.870
those make,
it was a little sketchy,
right?

2043
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:18.690
Like you had to be like kind of gullible to fall for it.
But now the goal,

2044
01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:21.720
I mean he looks like an old guy,
man.
It's perfect.

2045
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:25.070
I would really like to see it in person.
You know what I mean?
We didn't,

2046
01:56:25.230 --> 01:56:28.710
have you ever seen that kind of makeup on somebody?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2047
01:56:28.711 --> 01:56:32.610
I saw when Kevin James was doing,
uh,
here comes the boom.
They made them up.

2048
01:56:32.611 --> 01:56:35.430
Like you got the shit kicked out of him,
do it.
I believed it.

2049
01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:38.400
Totally believe that he looked like a guy who just got beat up.

2050
01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:42.870
They gave him like welts.
They couldn't cuts and it was,
it was amazing.

2051
01:56:42.871 --> 01:56:46.590
Like they can make you look pretty fucked up and they can,
you know,

2052
01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:49.920
they can do some pretty amazing shit like with making you look old,

2053
01:56:49.921 --> 01:56:52.470
especially you can't make an old guy look young.

2054
01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:54.180
You got to do that with like special effects.

2055
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:56.430
But you can make a young guy with cold pretty easy.

2056
01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:00.020
That would be cool if they can make little guys look young.
It never looks right.

2057
01:57:00.410 --> 01:57:02.080
It never looks right in the movies when they do that.

2058
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:06.330
This thing that I've been doing for my back,
this uh,
Regino Keenan,
anybody,

2059
01:57:06.331 --> 01:57:07.164
if you have,

2060
01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:12.270
if anybody has a back injury and a like a bulging disc situation,

2061
01:57:12.930 --> 01:57:16.260
my bulging disc has completely gone away.
And uh,

2062
01:57:16.261 --> 01:57:18.030
I just found this out through Mris.

2063
01:57:18.031 --> 01:57:22.980
I had a six millimeter bulging disc in my neck that was numbing my fingers and

2064
01:57:23.290 --> 01:57:25.200
through spinal decompression,

2065
01:57:25.201 --> 01:57:27.910
which is this thing where like pulls on your neck and straightens.

2066
01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:31.140
It extends your discs and they they,

2067
01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:34.620
they draw back in and you do it slowly over a long period time.

2068
01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:36.900
Lot of stretching,
changing my diet,

2069
01:57:36.901 --> 01:57:41.310
a lot of rolfing and all that stuff and something called prolozone therapy,

2070
01:57:41.311 --> 01:57:42.510
which is prolotherapy,

2071
01:57:42.511 --> 01:57:45.630
which strengthens ligaments and tendons and it's mixed with ozone,

2072
01:57:45.631 --> 01:57:48.720
which helps you heal.
Just doing all that stuff.
My,

2073
01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:51.180
my disc is completely stopped swelling.

2074
01:57:51.181 --> 01:57:54.660
It's gone down to where it looks like a normal disc now,
which is crazy.

2075
01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:59.010
That means six millimeters went back in and I didn't do Jujitsu for more than

2076
01:57:59.011 --> 01:58:02.250
six months,
so I knew that I wasn't,
I just gave myself the time.

2077
01:58:02.490 --> 01:58:04.650
I was still able to work out in a lot of ways,

2078
01:58:04.651 --> 01:58:07.140
but I knew that if I got my neck yanked on again,

2079
01:58:07.141 --> 01:58:09.760
it would probably go right back.
Are you going to go back to Jujitsu?
Yeah,

2080
01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:12.660
definitely.
But now this regino keen stuff that I've been doing,

2081
01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:16.440
it's this thing that they developed in Germany and it's just blood spinning

2082
01:58:16.441 --> 01:58:16.891
procedure.

2083
01:58:16.891 --> 01:58:20.940
They take your blood and then they introduce it to heat and the heat makes your

2084
01:58:20.941 --> 01:58:23.580
blood,
uh,
grow like white blood cells,
I believe.

2085
01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:28.470
And then they spin it in a centrifuge and they draw this yellow liquid out of it

2086
01:58:28.471 --> 01:58:32.790
that turns out to be like the most potent anti inflammatory drug known to man.

2087
01:58:32.970 --> 01:58:35.190
And your own body makes it,
your blood makes it.

2088
01:58:35.370 --> 01:58:38.730
They figured this shit out in Germany and they do it in Santa Monica now,

2089
01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:41.380
but the guy in Germany has figured out a way to,

2090
01:58:41.381 --> 01:58:45.130
they're very close to being able to give you an injection that restarts your

2091
01:58:45.131 --> 01:58:48.910
body's production of Collagen,
which is what gives people wrinkles.

2092
01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:52.330
So when old dudes get wrinkles or old women get wrinkles,

2093
01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:56.800
this will let your body restart.
It's college production,

2094
01:58:56.860 --> 01:58:59.130
project production,
and your face,
your wrinkles,

2095
01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:03.730
your face will start to disappear.
There are two years away from curing wrinkles.

2096
01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:08.710
Incredible fuck cancer.
We got wrinkles.
While they're going to tell vein,

2097
01:59:08.711 --> 01:59:11.560
we are as a country,
we're going to have a lot of things down by,

2098
01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:13.150
they're going to die,
but you're going to look great.

2099
01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:16.270
They cure a lot of fucking cancer.
Now,
man,

2100
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:19.420
a lot of Kansas when they pulled this out of you,
when they pull it,

2101
01:59:19.450 --> 01:59:23.740
they just inject it back in.
They,
they spin it in a centrifuge and there's,

2102
01:59:23.741 --> 01:59:28.630
if you go to a,
if you just look up the regino keen,
I think it's r,
e,
g.
E.
N.

2103
01:59:28.631 --> 01:59:33.040
O.
K.
I.
N.
E.
Um,
they explained the process,
its course.

2104
01:59:33.250 --> 01:59:34.990
I think it has a different name in Germany.

2105
01:59:34.991 --> 01:59:37.300
It's called Ortho keen or something like that.

2106
01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:40.720
But basically it's a blood spinning procedure.

2107
01:59:40.721 --> 01:59:44.190
It's not like platelet rich plasma.
It's different and it's uh,

2108
01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:47.200
it's getting your blood to react to,
uh,

2109
01:59:47.230 --> 01:59:51.250
to heat and then they spin it and then they withdraw the stuff out of it.

2110
01:59:51.251 --> 01:59:54.610
And people with arthritis,
people that have like serious injuries.

2111
01:59:54.850 --> 01:59:57.370
Peyton manning started his football career.
Like he's,

2112
01:59:57.610 --> 02:00:00.520
he was like almost retiring.
He had two neck surgeries,

2113
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:05.150
went to that dude in Germany,
Bam.
Playing football like a champ.
Now.
So many,
uh,

2114
02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:08.110
I know several MMA athletes that have gone over there.

2115
02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:10.330
They'll place in Santa Monica and the place in Germany.

2116
02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:13.510
You get their knees fixed.
People with like serious arthritis,
they,

2117
02:00:13.570 --> 02:00:17.890
they get shot with this stuff and within a week they have this an incredible

2118
02:00:17.891 --> 02:00:21.100
range of motion that they haven't had in years.
It's amazing stuff.

2119
02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:23.950
There's doctors are so fucking smart,
man.

2120
02:00:24.130 --> 02:00:28.810
There's just like every year they figuring out some new thing and every year

2121
02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:33.220
they're making people healthier,
fixing injuries.
I keep hearing that sound.

2122
02:00:33.221 --> 02:00:36.880
I think it's outside.
It's not,

2123
02:00:36.881 --> 02:00:40.150
it's not coming through the microphone.
It's coming through outside somewhere.

2124
02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:44.590
And I think it might be like a ups truck thing near me,
squeaky wheels.

2125
02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:49.000
But it's just,
it's so incredible when you see all the different shit.

2126
02:00:49.150 --> 02:00:51.870
Did you see that thing where a guy made a um,
um,

2127
02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:55.480
a three D in a three d printer made a,
uh,

2128
02:00:55.481 --> 02:00:59.650
an artificial hand for a son?
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2129
02:00:59.651 --> 02:01:02.920
For like 10 bucks.
Yeah.

2130
02:01:04.510 --> 02:01:09.460
They also figured out a way to make the first functional gun in a metal three d

2131
02:01:09.461 --> 02:01:10.210
printer.

2132
02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:14.530
They made a metal three d printer and they made a pistol and fired off 50 rounds

2133
02:01:14.531 --> 02:01:18.880
of this pistol.
That's scary though.
Fuck yeah,

2134
02:01:18.881 --> 02:01:23.530
that's fucking terrifying.
It's all crazy.
There's this,
the the hand,
this guy on,

2135
02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:28.850
he created this first you look at $10.
Hey that it's hard to see what that is.

2136
02:01:28.930 --> 02:01:30.340
It's good boy hand.

2137
02:01:30.810 --> 02:01:34.720
His hand is holding that object and he never had,

2138
02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:39.130
that's the metal things or his fingers.
Lo.
Yeah.
He's holding something.

2139
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:40.220
A pipe

2140
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:43.160
<v 2>or something,
but we're really close.</v>

2141
02:01:43.190 --> 02:01:46.420
I met a guy in New York when I was doing that.
See if you can click on that link.

2142
02:01:46.421 --> 02:01:49.770
It showed the video.
I met a guy in New York when we were doing um,

2143
02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:53.840
that a Scifi show that had a complete artificial hand.

2144
02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:57.950
I get that 10 bucks.
Amazing.

2145
02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:00.410
Hit with a fucking digital printer.

2146
02:02:00.620 --> 02:02:02.690
Costs me $50 to get headshots printed at Kinko's.

2147
02:02:06.090 --> 02:02:06.740
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2148
02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:11.320
<v 2>I got a fucking hand.
Head shots are hilarious.
This one guy,</v>

2149
02:02:11.321 --> 02:02:16.000
I'm in Australia,
got his leg and his arm bitten off by a shark and the God,

2150
02:02:16.001 --> 02:02:18.850
a new artificial arm and an artificial leg.

2151
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:23.260
These robotic bionic carbon fiber arms and legs.
That's great.

2152
02:02:23.410 --> 02:02:26.830
And he walks around,
dude with no limp.
It's the weirdest shit ever.

2153
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:32.260
We would find this man gets artificial limbs

2154
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:36.200
after bitten off by a shark.

2155
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.823
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2156
02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:46.950
<v 2>Silver fineness.
Yeah.
Giant Shark.
Ooh.
Nope.</v>

2157
02:02:46.951 --> 02:02:49.080
Killed Kill South American,

2158
02:02:49.081 --> 02:02:52.980
South African German tourists on life support after losing her arm in Hawaii.

2159
02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:58.170
While there's a lot of fucking people you killed by sharks,
dude reach

2160
02:03:00.190 --> 02:03:03.670
bionic leg helps shark attack.
Victim Walk.
Cause that it,

2161
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:08.880
<v 6>nope,
I mean it,
this is it.
Matt Lauer.</v>

2162
02:03:10.090 --> 02:03:12.700
<v 4>So what is being called the world's first bionic man,</v>

2163
02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:15.340
and we're going to check him out in action in just a minute.
But first,

2164
02:03:15.341 --> 02:03:19.720
how the bionic man came to be,
what the fuck?

2165
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:25.540
Not Right.
Not Lowers the bionic man.
That was creepy.

2166
02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:32.580
<v 2>Oh,
a hundred percent biotic man.
Well that's Kinda interesting.</v>

2167
02:03:33.090 --> 02:03:33.923
<v 10>She has come.</v>

2168
02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:39.020
It's a nearly bionic man assembled from prosthetics and artificial parts already

2169
02:03:39.091 --> 02:03:43.840
in real use in real people.
We might change what it means to be artificial halls,

2170
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:48.090
artificial trachea,
authors by only cans,
artificial eyesight,

2171
02:03:48.210 --> 02:03:52.470
implantable kidney,
artificial blood,
bionic Exoskeleton,

2172
02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:55.950
restoring walking ability to people who are paralyzed.

2173
02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:01.170
28 different parts in all together for the first time.
Bear told Meyer,

2174
02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:05.400
a Swiss social psychologists hosting an upcoming special on the project.

2175
02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:10.880
<v 2>That's crazy.
Whoa.
Yeah.</v>

2176
02:04:10.881 --> 02:04:14.510
We're only a few hundred years away from not being able to tell whether or not a

2177
02:04:14.511 --> 02:04:18.590
person's a robot.
Yup.
In 200 years,
I think.
I'm not,

2178
02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:22.590
that's not even a conservative gamble.
200 years is,

2179
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:27.110
it's probably not even a hundred really.
And when I say 200 years,
I mean,

2180
02:04:27.111 --> 02:04:31.880
that's like,
that's 100% right.

2181
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:34.310
If we don't blow ourselves up 200 years from now,

2182
02:04:34.670 --> 02:04:38.460
if we make it to 200 already living among us guys.
Yes.

2183
02:04:38.490 --> 02:04:42.840
Just think about 200 years ago it was slavery was legal.
Right.

2184
02:04:43.170 --> 02:04:47.130
You know,
wrap your head around that.
Can you imagine what we're going to see?

2185
02:04:47.131 --> 02:04:48.300
Like when we're like super old,

2186
02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:52.050
like what we're going to tell our kids and grandkids 200 years ago,

2187
02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:53.340
no photographs.
Nope,

2188
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:59.000
no cars slavery's legal fear riding around ha animals like an asshole Yogi have

2189
02:05:00.661 --> 02:05:01.171
a horse.

2190
02:05:01.171 --> 02:05:04.620
You take your stupid stinky horse everywhere and you have to tie it up and it

2191
02:05:04.621 --> 02:05:08.310
shits all over the place.
You know what the fuck that is?

2192
02:05:08.330 --> 02:05:12.940
A bunch of fucking gods up there.
Lightened candles.
Yeah.
No Way.
No,

2193
02:05:13.590 --> 02:05:16.350
200 years ago.
It's so long ago.

2194
02:05:16.351 --> 02:05:20.020
When you think of like if you had to go back in time and live like people live

2195
02:05:20.021 --> 02:05:24.810
200 years ago,
it would suck a fat one.
It wouldn't even be a little fun.

2196
02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:27.480
Everybody would die.
Every time the flu comes into town,

2197
02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:31.560
all your best friends are dead,
dead.
You don't live.

2198
02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:35.670
If you get an infection dead,
you just got to survive at that point.

2199
02:05:35.850 --> 02:05:37.080
200 years later,

2200
02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:41.640
we're talking about 200 years from now where there's robots that you literally

2201
02:05:41.641 --> 02:05:44.160
can't tell if it's a person or a robot.
Right?
For sure.
Right?

2202
02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:47.520
100% and no wrinkles.
I think they're already here.

2203
02:05:47.550 --> 02:05:50.650
Do you think the robot prostitutes would be the first market?
Oh yeah,

2204
02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:53.220
probably right.
Violence or sex.
How much?

2205
02:05:53.370 --> 02:05:57.300
How much blow back do you think there'll be with robot prostitutes if women,

2206
02:05:57.330 --> 02:05:59.940
you know,
what will women like draw a line in the sand?

2207
02:05:59.941 --> 02:06:04.710
That fucking robot is a cheating thing.
Oh Shit.
I'll find a way to justify that.

2208
02:06:04.711 --> 02:06:07.290
Yeah.
Like when will it come?
Like,
okay,
let's say like,

2209
02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:09.360
what if the robot looks like,

2210
02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:13.800
like this alien head doesn't look remotely like a person.
It looks fake as fuck.

2211
02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:17.460
The robot looks like this
by the way,

2212
02:06:17.461 --> 02:06:21.680
that one that you sent me the other art today or last night.
That's amaze.

2213
02:06:21.681 --> 02:06:26.040
Same Guy.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
That's a Zombie that he made for us.

2214
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:28.410
Um,
I can't wait to see that in person.

2215
02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:31.510
Can you can't get normal people ordered these.
It's either my website,

2216
02:06:31.530 --> 02:06:33.810
I'll find out.
I'll find out what his,
what his deal is.
Uh,

2217
02:06:33.811 --> 02:06:38.400
his name is Francisco Hernandez and he's,
uh,
he's in La.
He's an La Guy,

2218
02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:43.360
but he made me this fucking dope ass Zombie is coming here and this week.
Yeah.

2219
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:47.790
Yeah.
It's so cool to just be able to get a artists to create shit for us.

2220
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.250
It's so cool.
So,
so many different things.
I've got to bring the gorilla in the,

2221
02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:55.160
the,
the Werewolf fucking the grill in the ass and still have that at home.

2222
02:06:56.100 --> 02:07:00.420
I just shows up,
shows up at the fucking ice house.
I'm like,
what is this?

2223
02:07:00.421 --> 02:07:03.580
I opened it up.
It's so fucking Werewolf fucking a gorilla in the ass.

2224
02:07:03.581 --> 02:07:04.440
The greatest cause of a,

2225
02:07:04.441 --> 02:07:09.240
an idea that I had a dream I had once werewolf and a gorilla having sex and I

2226
02:07:09.241 --> 02:07:12.060
was trying to like creep around the outside of the room so they didn't notice

2227
02:07:12.061 --> 02:07:15.930
and get out of there.
That didn't make me mad.
It made me the death squad cap,

2228
02:07:15.931 --> 02:07:18.170
but it has a huge hog.
Like a big Dick.

2229
02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:22.890
[inaudible] is awesome.
Dude's a freak.

2230
02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:27.330
So back to what you were saying,
so,
so something is ugly as like

2231
02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:32.280
they would still get mad if we had sex with it.
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2232
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:36.130
If he gets to like,
if it looks like a fake thing,
women

2233
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:38.860
<v 0>probably,
it would be like treat it like a fleshlight.
Right.</v>

2234
02:07:39.190 --> 02:07:43.450
But as it gets closer and closer to a real person,
like if it looks like Robby,

2235
02:07:43.451 --> 02:07:46.690
the robot from lost in space,
danger,
danger,

2236
02:07:46.691 --> 02:07:48.610
and you could stick your Dick in that.
No one's gonna say anything.

2237
02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:51.970
<v 1>What would they let you print out a face of her though?</v>

2238
02:07:51.971 --> 02:07:54.850
Like set of it looks just like your wife you have,
then you need that.

2239
02:07:54.851 --> 02:07:57.720
Why would you want to come home or faces covering seven inches.
A calm.

2240
02:07:58.310 --> 02:08:01.360
He never clean it.
You just keep shooting on her face and she's like,

2241
02:08:01.361 --> 02:08:02.590
what are you doing?
He tried to drown me.

2242
02:08:02.591 --> 02:08:05.740
Is this like some passive aggressive shit or you're drowned me and calm or

2243
02:08:05.741 --> 02:08:08.370
you're married to your Burnett and you come home and the robot's blonde.
Yeah.

2244
02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:10.600
And that's what she just freaks the fuck out.
You come home,

2245
02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:14.960
you're putting black face on your role.
Your wife like

2246
02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:21.460
know a teacher got fired in Toronto because he dressed up like Mr t for

2247
02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:26.140
Halloween and put blackface on.
Well you can't be Mr t without it.

2248
02:08:26.290 --> 02:08:30.010
How the fuck that is so dumb that you would,

2249
02:08:30.090 --> 02:08:34.390
a guy has a mister t outfit on and he's not allowed to darken his skin.

2250
02:08:34.690 --> 02:08:38.890
What kind of bullshit?
Pc World or we live at somebody in San Diego.

2251
02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:43.510
Same thing happened because he dressed up as a bobsled team member and team

2252
02:08:43.511 --> 02:08:46.180
member actually say,
oh no,
that's funny.
I like,
look,

2253
02:08:46.570 --> 02:08:49.450
I'm going to take the opposite on this.
Like all sip.
But they'd of that.

2254
02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:52.930
But if you're a teacher and you know how sensitive people are when you're

2255
02:08:52.931 --> 02:08:55.840
pulling your Mr t costume out of the closet,
you got to go,
you know what?

2256
02:08:55.841 --> 02:08:57.070
I probably shouldn't do this,

2257
02:08:57.220 --> 02:09:01.560
but your mayor smokes crack and shorts and no kidding.

2258
02:09:02.110 --> 02:09:05.650
It's gotta be that as you're applying back face as a teacher,
you should go,

2259
02:09:05.651 --> 02:09:09.820
and this is probably not going to sit well with people.
Assholes.
I love Toronto.

2260
02:09:10.090 --> 02:09:10.930
Toronto's the shit.

2261
02:09:11.590 --> 02:09:14.900
<v 0>It's Toronto is the shit.
It's a,
it's an amazing,
amazing city.</v>

2262
02:09:15.110 --> 02:09:17.240
It's really crazy because it's like a city,

2263
02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:20.630
but yet it's also like a bunch of really nice people.

2264
02:09:20.631 --> 02:09:23.840
It's almost like small towny,
you know?
It's,
it's very strange.

2265
02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:26.170
I think it's one of the rare cities in this,

2266
02:09:26.330 --> 02:09:29.780
in this country that has a very unique vibe of it's own.

2267
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:32.360
Vancouver has a vibe of it's own as well.
Men.

2268
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:34.490
Montreal has a vibe of it's own as well.

2269
02:09:34.530 --> 02:09:38.480
Very great vibe to Montreal is a great comedy town,
but Toronto,

2270
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:42.830
I think it's my favorite city in Canada is just something special about that

2271
02:09:42.831 --> 02:09:46.070
place.
I would move there even though it's cold as fuck.

2272
02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:49.730
That's how much I love Toronto.
Like if shit got weird,

2273
02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:53.030
I don't know if I'd live in Vancouver,
I think I might live in Vancouver,

2274
02:09:53.031 --> 02:09:55.010
but Vancouver,
even though it doesn't get cold,

2275
02:09:55.280 --> 02:10:00.110
it gets like a lot of rainy and shit and Toronto is pretty dope and it's got a

2276
02:10:00.111 --> 02:10:04.370
great comedy community as well.
Yeah,
Toronto's got a suites.
It's a lot.

2277
02:10:04.371 --> 02:10:07.640
A lot of comics there.
Joey Diaz,

2278
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:09.920
<v 1>what the fuck are you on speaker phone?</v>

2279
02:10:09.921 --> 02:10:12.850
I have some that you can't be calling me in the middle of the podcast,

2280
02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:17.370
Joey had dairy.
We have the exact same tone,
but yours is white and uh,

2281
02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:21.010
or black with a white case as the minds of white with a black case cases.

2282
02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:24.940
<v 0>You want to buck here so you wouldn't want to know that.
I wanted to contrast.
Oh,</v>

2283
02:10:24.941 --> 02:10:25.774
you're crazy.

2284
02:10:25.930 --> 02:10:29.710
I like the white case cause I can see it cause I would put the black case down.

2285
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:34.640
Everything's black.
Black leather,
black.
Yeah.
I see.
I don't see it as much.

2286
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:37.610
I like it.
I got this because they didn't have the black.

2287
02:10:37.611 --> 02:10:40.760
But then once I ordered the black and the mail,
I put the bark off.
So,
you know,

2288
02:10:40.770 --> 02:10:45.290
I like the white better.
But that case is the perfect case.

2289
02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:48.530
It's Kinda cool too.
When you close it like the window on the outside of it,

2290
02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:51.770
it shows the um,
makes a window.
Yeah,

2291
02:10:51.771 --> 02:10:56.771
it does a weird thing like camp you have like things like camera access can just

2292
02:10:56.901 --> 02:11:00.590
access your camera so much more you can do with these droid phones than with an

2293
02:11:00.591 --> 02:11:05.060
iPhone.
I mean,
it's a big goddamn difference.
I was about to jump over.
Yeah.

2294
02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:08.840
I hate my iPhone.
Well,
I don't hate the iPhone.
It's just too small.

2295
02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:10.100
Does the screen is just,

2296
02:11:10.101 --> 02:11:12.950
when you compare it even to the galaxy s four it's just too small.

2297
02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:16.700
Just need to catch up.
They need to catch up.
I don't think they're going to,

2298
02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:17.540
the thing that I,

2299
02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:21.200
one of the other reasons why I wanted to try a droid out because when I,

2300
02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:23.720
when I'm honest and I look at it,

2301
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:25.880
I think apple makes the greatest computers on earth.

2302
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:30.020
I don't see myself switching from the apple laptops.
I've tried windows.

2303
02:11:30.290 --> 02:11:33.620
I think they're too vulnerable.
I know,
I know Mac has a vulnerable as well.

2304
02:11:33.621 --> 02:11:37.340
I don't think it's as vulnerable and I just think it's higher quality.

2305
02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:39.790
I think they work better.
If I was on a budget,
fuck yeah,

2306
02:11:39.791 --> 02:11:40.980
I'd get a laptop from windows.

2307
02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:43.940
I'll get a like a Lenovo or something like that and when there's some good

2308
02:11:43.941 --> 02:11:47.600
brands,
but if you can afford it,
but apples are better.

2309
02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:52.010
But then I see all the different people that are working on phones and I go,

2310
02:11:52.011 --> 02:11:54.620
you know what?
I don't see it with phones anymore with phones.

2311
02:11:54.621 --> 02:11:59.360
I see too many companies that are working on android.
Too many.

2312
02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:02.600
There's too much competition there.
They're constantly innovating.

2313
02:12:02.601 --> 02:12:06.380
They're constantly cranking out new phones.
They have new features.

2314
02:12:06.381 --> 02:12:08.000
They have new camera,
mega pick,

2315
02:12:08.001 --> 02:12:10.400
like what does this and mega pixels in this fucking camera.
I don't know.

2316
02:12:10.401 --> 02:12:13.370
It's pretty good.
Some insane like 12 or some shit like that.

2317
02:12:13.730 --> 02:12:14.600
I don't even know what it is.

2318
02:12:14.670 --> 02:12:18.010
I do think I like the iPhone's camera a lot better though.
Yeah.

2319
02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:21.260
After using it a lot.
I you fuck with the settings though?
Well,

2320
02:12:21.261 --> 02:12:23.320
I have iPhone five s and the camera,
they,

2321
02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:26.850
they have a really nice lens in this wine and I think,
yeah,

2322
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:30.590
it's way better than they.
I've been taking test shoots and stuff like that.

2323
02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:33.020
Still better.
I think that's too bad.

2324
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:35.210
Why did they come out with a bigger fucking phone?
I would go back.

2325
02:12:36.290 --> 02:12:40.040
It's coming [inaudible] that I bet it's coming.
Dirty pitches get together.

2326
02:12:40.070 --> 02:12:44.540
Actually talk to somebody that knows like their friend works for Apple.

2327
02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:48.310
You got to get him fired.
I don't know that the person in my life,

2328
02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.120
I was just talking to him and he's like,
yeah.

2329
02:12:50.130 --> 02:12:54.140
Is he saying like how just sad it is right now?
Oh really?
Well,

2330
02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:58.280
it's just like everyone that even works there,
it's kind of not just excited and,

2331
02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:00.800
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He's dead.

2332
02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:07.130
When a guy like Steve jobs is not alive anymore,
things are going to get weird.

2333
02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:11.690
That guy was like a primal force.
He was like a force of nature.

2334
02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:16.550
I mean the guy literally lived and breathed that company.

2335
02:13:17.570 --> 02:13:20.870
And when a guy like that,
he only took like a dollar in salary every year.

2336
02:13:20.871 --> 02:13:23.120
I mean it was like a maniac,
you know,

2337
02:13:23.230 --> 02:13:27.410
he lived for that fucking company and everybody says that he was a con and like

2338
02:13:27.411 --> 02:13:28.640
he would yell at employees and Shit.

2339
02:13:28.641 --> 02:13:33.641
But could you imagine if you were like incredibly obsessed motherfucker and your

2340
02:13:33.811 --> 02:13:37.590
employees were just regular people just going to work,
you're like,
yeah,

2341
02:13:37.591 --> 02:13:39.210
it ain't going to cut it.
Right.
You know,

2342
02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:42.720
you gotta be obsessed like me and like God an asshole and he is an asshole.

2343
02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:46.170
You know,
if people are having a job,
they shouldn't have to work 90 hours a week.

2344
02:13:46.410 --> 02:13:49.590
Okay.
But there's some companies like demand crazy shit like that.

2345
02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:53.130
And then eventually employees like wake up and go without fuck am I doing,

2346
02:13:53.370 --> 02:13:55.260
speaking of which cliffy bees coming on the podcast.

2347
02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:59.860
<v 4>Yeah.
Soon speaking of free agents,
I,
there's a,</v>

2348
02:13:59.861 --> 02:14:02.590
there's an APP that I don't want,
want to talk about.

2349
02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:06.010
Don't talk about it then bitch put his picture up on the screen.

2350
02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:10.280
The fuck is wrong with you.
What's wrong with it?
I want to tell you about,

2351
02:14:12.550 --> 02:14:14.200
everyone else is going to talk about it very soon.

2352
02:14:14.201 --> 02:14:17.560
So I don't know if we should even issue,
it's just a,

2353
02:14:17.650 --> 02:14:21.250
it's just one of these apps that,
you know,
as a guy you can't use,

2354
02:14:21.970 --> 02:14:24.490
but girls can and I've been trying to hack the system,

2355
02:14:24.491 --> 02:14:27.370
like make fake Facebook pages and all this stuff just so I can,

2356
02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:29.680
<v 0>well,
it's all right.
Oh,
I know what you're talking about.</v>

2357
02:14:29.681 --> 02:14:32.260
I know exactly what you're,
we'll talk,
we'll talk about this afterwards.

2358
02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:37.540
I don't even know what the fuck.
Yeah.
Okay.

2359
02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:41.610
Um,
Justin Foster,
what is the,
um,
the,

2360
02:14:41.710 --> 02:14:46.710
the process been like of moving from Dallas to La and was there any hiccups

2361
02:14:47.801 --> 02:14:48.634
along the way?

2362
02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:50.910
<v 4>It was just frustrating at first.
Um,</v>

2363
02:14:51.930 --> 02:14:54.960
because I mean like moving as a comic because you know,

2364
02:14:54.961 --> 02:14:58.170
when you're in a place for so long and you're used to regular stage time,

2365
02:14:58.180 --> 02:15:01.290
it used to doing,
you know,
and then you come here and it's like at for,

2366
02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.621
and you know,

2367
02:15:01.621 --> 02:15:05.460
first it's like two minutes at a coffee shop and then waiting around two hours

2368
02:15:05.461 --> 02:15:08.040
to do three minutes.
So that was kind of frustrating,
you know what I mean?

2369
02:15:08.490 --> 02:15:11.290
Cause I wanted to be at more right,
I guess.
And then after that,

2370
02:15:11.310 --> 02:15:14.250
then after awhile you can create,
this is a spot that you hit and everything.

2371
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:18.390
<v 0>Did you feel like,
was there any point in time where you felt like,
you know what,</v>

2372
02:15:18.391 --> 02:15:21.450
I'm just fucking spinning my wheels.
I got to get back to Texas.

2373
02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:23.220
I got to get back to Texas and try to,

2374
02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:27.800
<v 4>no,
there was a couple of times when I came really close moneywise I'm like,
fuck,</v>

2375
02:15:27.801 --> 02:15:29.750
I'm running out of money.
And I don't want to be homeless,

2376
02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:33.000
but then something went out is something would come up and,
and I,

2377
02:15:33.001 --> 02:15:37.460
I felt that there was more of a challenge here because you do have to start
over.

2378
02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:39.500
I believe as a comic,
when you're anywhere else in the country,

2379
02:15:39.501 --> 02:15:40.910
when you come to La,
you have to start.

2380
02:15:40.911 --> 02:15:42.800
Unless you already established TV and Shit,
which I'm not.

2381
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:46.270
You had to start over from the beginning and I kind of hated slash enjoyed that.

2382
02:15:46.750 --> 02:15:48.970
<v 0>Yeah.
Even when I was on TV,
when I came here,</v>

2383
02:15:48.971 --> 02:15:53.380
I was already on TV and I had an audition at the store.
I didn't get passed.

2384
02:15:53.381 --> 02:15:57.850
I was a non paid regularly for a few months and then I finally got a paid

2385
02:15:57.851 --> 02:16:00.370
regular status and they've got like late night spots.
But yeah,

2386
02:16:00.371 --> 02:16:02.590
you gotta pay your dues.
Maybe I didn't give a shit if he had a second.

2387
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:05.110
<v 4>No one gives a fuck.
How long have you been doing it in?
In what other town?</v>

2388
02:16:05.111 --> 02:16:06.850
If you're not doing an la,
you're not really doing it.

2389
02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:10.690
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a different thing.
It's also,
there's so many people out here,</v>

2390
02:16:10.691 --> 02:16:14.390
they can't just trust you that you're good.
Right.
You know?
Yeah.
It's just too,

2391
02:16:14.410 --> 02:16:15.310
just too many.
I mean,

2392
02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:18.640
you're going to go up at the comedy store or the laugh factory and there's going

2393
02:16:18.641 --> 02:16:21.490
to be 10 guys that have been on movies,
TV shows,

2394
02:16:21.491 --> 02:16:24.820
and a packed back to back to back to back,
and it all due in 15 minutes,
you know,

2395
02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.250
and you want your 15 minutes,
you gotta earn that Shit.
Right,
right.

2396
02:16:27.310 --> 02:16:30.010
<v 4>Exactly.
And so it's easy to frustrated at first</v>

2397
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:33.130
<v 2>and go,
Oh fuck this,
I'm going back home.
But then everybody I talked to was like,</v>

2398
02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:34.930
you just gotta you just gotta fight through all that Shit.

2399
02:16:34.931 --> 02:16:37.230
How long you been here now?
Almost to two years.
Yeah.

2400
02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:40.780
You got to do one of our ice house shows.
I'd love to.
I love that place.
Yeah.

2401
02:16:40.810 --> 02:16:45.010
Yeah.
We'll probably do one.
Um,
not next Wednesday.
Not this Wednesday,

2402
02:16:45.011 --> 02:16:49.570
coming up in next Wednesday.
Done.
Cool.
Most likely if I,
uh,
if I got the time.

2403
02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:51.313
Um,

2404
02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:53.420
<v 5>but in the new show that I'm doing at the ice house,</v>

2405
02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:59.120
it's this new show called Thunderpussy that of course it's called Thunderpussy.

2406
02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:03.310
Hi Jeremiah Watkins.
Very funny comic.
He's,

2407
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:07.180
he's been doing this show for a while and Hollywood and I got to do it once and

2408
02:17:07.181 --> 02:17:09.210
I'm like,
we need to do this big.
Uh,

2409
02:17:09.250 --> 02:17:12.670
what we do is we take seven comics and then we all go up on stage and people

2410
02:17:12.671 --> 02:17:16.030
from the audience yell out like things like,
like a microwave.

2411
02:17:16.210 --> 02:17:18.940
And then we kind of have to try to just make up comedy on the spot.

2412
02:17:18.941 --> 02:17:21.950
But it's a live podcast also.
So it's one of the first,

2413
02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:25.780
cause the comics have been asking me for awhile or people have been asking me

2414
02:17:25.781 --> 02:17:28.900
for a while to put a podcast up that should have stand up comedy.
And I was like,

2415
02:17:28.901 --> 02:17:31.180
no one wants to throw their,
there's material way like that.

2416
02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:34.630
So this is a perfect wave that comics and go on stage kind of showed their

2417
02:17:34.631 --> 02:17:38.350
improv skills,
you know,
and they don't care if it's online.

2418
02:17:38.351 --> 02:17:41.920
And I've been getting a lot of new material from it,
from doing it.
You know,

2419
02:17:41.921 --> 02:17:46.450
like I,
I've got two new bits off,
just people yelling shit out.
Got It.
Yeah,

2420
02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:49.630
<v 2>that totally makes sense.
Especially like I used to do that,
uh,</v>

2421
02:17:49.710 --> 02:17:53.750
after shows and do Q and A's.
But the problem with that is like,

2422
02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:58.040
you've already done like an hour and 10 minutes of actual comedy and then trying

2423
02:17:58.041 --> 02:18:01.820
to make some funny out of the Q and a.
Like sometimes it'll be a dropoff,

2424
02:18:02.050 --> 02:18:05.300
there'd be like crushing,
crushing,
you know,
everything was laugh,
laugh,
laugh,

2425
02:18:05.301 --> 02:18:06.590
and then question,
answer.

2426
02:18:06.591 --> 02:18:09.950
It was like dragged out and weird and he didn't know how to end it.

2427
02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:12.020
And then you ended it and people on,
Oh,
is that good?

2428
02:18:12.970 --> 02:18:15.680
It was great for an hour and 10 minutes and then it just became,
you know,

2429
02:18:15.730 --> 02:18:19.550
it'd be fucking good at that Joe.
Yeah,
I would do it.
I'll definitely when,

2430
02:18:19.551 --> 02:18:20.760
when do you guys do it?
Would you like to do?

2431
02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:24.690
<v 5>Uh,
usually it's Friday we have ice house chronicles,
you know,</v>

2432
02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:27.680
but now we're doing every other Friday we're doing thunder places,
so,

2433
02:18:27.690 --> 02:18:29.220
but we'll do it whenever you want to do it.

2434
02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:30.370
<v 2>Yeah.
I don't,</v>

2435
02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:35.220
a Friday will ever work like a lot of times on Friday I'm working or both.

2436
02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:38.310
But we'll do it one one day eventually.
But um,

2437
02:18:38.940 --> 02:18:40.530
I'm going to do it so high I can't talk.

2438
02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:41.740
<v 5>Yeah.
That's how I do it.
I get,</v>

2439
02:18:41.741 --> 02:18:46.741
I get so drunk and stoned and then I just go crazy.

2440
02:18:47.111 --> 02:18:49.720
And it's fun because I've gotten so much.
It's a fun show.

2441
02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:50.230
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2442
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:53.540
That does sound like fun place to put yourself when you know you don't have an

2443
02:18:53.541 --> 02:18:56.510
act,
remember that'd be the perfect place to put yourself.

2444
02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:59.500
No stress and knowing you're only going to be up there for like five minutes in

2445
02:18:59.501 --> 02:19:01.550
10 minutes or whatever the fuck.
If you fuck up,
it's like,
well,

2446
02:19:01.551 --> 02:19:03.770
you guys should've picked something better to yell out.
Yeah.
And if you fuck up,

2447
02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:08.540
that's exactly right.
Well,
yeah,
this is on y'all.
Yeah.
Well you can,

2448
02:19:08.541 --> 02:19:10.940
you can have some fun times doing that with the right crowds too.

2449
02:19:10.941 --> 02:19:14.180
Especially if the crowd like develops like a feel for it.

2450
02:19:14.630 --> 02:19:15.800
And who's the kid who you do it with?
You?

2451
02:19:15.950 --> 02:19:19.790
<v 5>Jeremiah Watkins.
Very funny guy.
Where's he from?
I got strong background.</v>

2452
02:19:19.791 --> 02:19:22.910
I believe he's from California,
but he's got strong impression

2453
02:19:22.970 --> 02:19:25.640
<v 2>background and his on my punk ethic last week.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

2454
02:19:25.641 --> 02:19:28.160
What's your pocket?
You got a podcast too?
Everyone's gone.
I figured

2455
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:32.030
<v 4>there wasn't enough uh,
comics in La doing podcasts.
There's no one.</v>

2456
02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:37.220
You're amazing.
How'd you figure out how to do it?
It was an untapped market.

2457
02:19:37.850 --> 02:19:40.600
What's it called?
A foster.
The podcast foster.

2458
02:19:40.601 --> 02:19:44.450
The podcast kind of double entendre.
It's a,

2459
02:19:44.490 --> 02:19:47.390
it's basically just people come on and tell like a really quick,

2460
02:19:47.391 --> 02:19:51.230
awful story that most of them aren't comfortable with telling.

2461
02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:54.500
That's what you're a,
that's all it is.
Yeah.
Oh that's funny.

2462
02:19:54.530 --> 02:19:58.550
It's like 15 to 20 minutes.
Why do you always do that?
That's just,

2463
02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:03.050
it just entertains.
It's,
it's funny to see and hear shit cause I,
you think,
oh,

2464
02:20:03.051 --> 02:20:05.420
I've heard everything and then someone else will come on.
You make,
oh,
okay.

2465
02:20:05.421 --> 02:20:06.254
I haven't,

2466
02:20:06.350 --> 02:20:09.080
do you worry that you're gonna run out of like people coming up with crazy

2467
02:20:09.081 --> 02:20:13.730
stories though?
No.
No.
Not In this task.
In this fucking town.
Not In this town.

2468
02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:17.300
Well,
plus if people find out that there's a venue for something like that.
Yeah.

2469
02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:20.780
That's all right.
Foster the podcast.
So they're real quick ones.

2470
02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:26.240
I think the longest one was like 30 minutes.
That's great.
Beautiful.
So yeah,

2471
02:20:26.241 --> 02:20:27.320
we'll,
we'll get you on a nice house.

2472
02:20:27.321 --> 02:20:29.630
Crockwell I remember you were really funny when we saw you in Texas.

2473
02:20:30.820 --> 02:20:33.860
Did you don't suck.
No idea.
No,
no.
Actually did you get better?

2474
02:20:33.900 --> 02:20:36.260
Actually gotten better.
Yeah.
And that's another thing being out here too.

2475
02:20:36.261 --> 02:20:40.640
It makes you,
it makes you better.
Yeah.
Well you gotta be inspired.

2476
02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:41.570
You're out here.

2477
02:20:41.570 --> 02:20:45.290
There's so many great comics we can get comfortable doing the same set all over

2478
02:20:45.291 --> 02:20:47.000
and over and that kind of moved to a new place.
Like,
all right,

2479
02:20:47.001 --> 02:20:51.130
I got to step it up a little bit so you can get comfortable at anytime.

2480
02:20:51.250 --> 02:20:53.180
Fuck yeah.
I'm constantly terrified of that.

2481
02:20:54.130 --> 02:20:56.340
<v 2>It's important like whatever,</v>

2482
02:20:56.350 --> 02:20:59.890
whenever I do something after it's done at fucking hate it cause I'm onto the

2483
02:20:59.891 --> 02:21:03.350
next thing like hypercritical about it.
Like Ah,

2484
02:21:03.430 --> 02:21:07.030
get it away from me and then I move on to the next one and that like motivates

2485
02:21:07.031 --> 02:21:10.990
me every time to make the next one better.
Whether I get there or not.

2486
02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:16.420
Arguable you know sometimes it's just like you got to figure out like what

2487
02:21:16.421 --> 02:21:18.520
topics have the most juice in him.

2488
02:21:18.910 --> 02:21:22.090
You know like you might have like a lot of material but there's topics that just

2489
02:21:22.091 --> 02:21:26.710
don't have the same people just not as interested in is like other ones.
Right.

2490
02:21:26.711 --> 02:21:31.120
You know and you find one that like really like hits a high interest level and

2491
02:21:31.121 --> 02:21:34.210
then you could juice it up with like big laughs too.

2492
02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:36.010
Like it's got a bunch of things going on.

2493
02:21:36.011 --> 02:21:39.190
People are excited that you're talking about it and then it's got a lot of funny

2494
02:21:39.191 --> 02:21:39.520
laugh.

2495
02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:42.130
And then there's other ones you're like trying to convince people of where do

2496
02:21:42.131 --> 02:21:45.730
you feel like it's forced?
Yeah,
sometimes and sometimes I think they're funny,

2497
02:21:45.731 --> 02:21:47.350
but other people don't see my sense of humor.

2498
02:21:47.351 --> 02:21:49.360
There's not as fucked up as me or whatever it is.

2499
02:21:49.450 --> 02:21:52.960
Then I drag them through this dark alley that they don't want to go to after.

2500
02:21:52.961 --> 02:21:56.950
I like send them down this beautiful flower field road for half an hour and then

2501
02:21:56.951 --> 02:22:01.860
I'm like,
hey,
take a left with me.
Yeah.
Let's talk about child molestation and TV.

2502
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:05.990
<v 4>Commercial
baby</v>

2503
02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:08.450
<v 2>has a beard.
He's driving a car with a grown woman.</v>

2504
02:22:08.451 --> 02:22:12.800
What do you think's happening here?
Yeah,
there's a standup.

2505
02:22:12.801 --> 02:22:15.050
Comedy is just such a fucking open ended thing.

2506
02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:17.030
So one of my favorite parts about it.

2507
02:22:17.350 --> 02:22:20.300
So you never know where your next idea is going to come from.

2508
02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:24.470
You never know where your,
you know,
your next big bits going to come from,

2509
02:22:24.500 --> 02:22:26.010
what it's going to be about.
Right.

2510
02:22:27.330 --> 02:22:29.880
Do you write like as far as like standup,

2511
02:22:29.881 --> 02:22:34.110
do you right stand up in joke form or do you write blogs and pulleys standup out

2512
02:22:34.450 --> 02:22:38.730
ad Lib?
Shit.
I still do like pen and paper in the morning at the coffee shop.

2513
02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:39.930
Right.
You know writing,

2514
02:22:39.931 --> 02:22:44.250
I tried to go backwards of stuff cause when you first start I feel it's like

2515
02:22:44.251 --> 02:22:45.330
joke,
joke,
joke,
joke.

2516
02:22:45.331 --> 02:22:48.210
And then after a while you're like okay now I can actually go back and revisit

2517
02:22:48.211 --> 02:22:52.380
some things and put into joke form.
That was a little,
you know,

2518
02:22:52.381 --> 02:22:56.010
people weren't really,
didn't really want to hear in the beginning.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2519
02:22:56.011 --> 02:23:00.450
Some sometimes you have like a good premise but your s your skills are so
shitty.

2520
02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:04.110
You can't turn that good premise into a bit.
Like I'm doing something now.

2521
02:23:04.111 --> 02:23:05.840
Like if I woulda turned like about when I was younger,

2522
02:23:05.841 --> 02:23:07.860
I was in a mental hospital for depression.

2523
02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:11.430
If I would've tried to do that bit a year in it,
wouldn't you know what I mean?

2524
02:23:11.431 --> 02:23:14.730
And Nestle,
if you tried to do it in Texas and now you've writes all,

2525
02:23:14.740 --> 02:23:16.650
you're depressed,
you can't suck enough days.

2526
02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:19.440
How much did you sell going to the hospital?

2527
02:23:19.470 --> 02:23:22.470
And then now it's like well I'll just open with it cause I don't give a fuck

2528
02:23:22.471 --> 02:23:25.800
anymore.
You Open with that?
I did the other night,
I go,
here it is.

2529
02:23:25.801 --> 02:23:29.550
Here's the thing.
Wow.
Why were you in a mental hospital?

2530
02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:34.250
I was just severely depressed.
How old were you?
Uh,
I was like 13.
14.
Wow.
Yeah.

2531
02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:38.250
Damn.
That's real.
Yeah.
And so,
and but trying to talk about that,

2532
02:23:38.251 --> 02:23:40.740
the beginning of people would never go along with it and now you're like,
okay,

2533
02:23:40.741 --> 02:23:43.200
it's Kinda,
it's okay.
Now here's this thing.

2534
02:23:43.201 --> 02:23:45.840
Did you know then that you wanted to be a stand up?
Uh,

2535
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:47.730
my mom tells this story and I don't remember this,

2536
02:23:47.731 --> 02:23:50.400
but when I was in second grade,
I was like an awful fucking student.

2537
02:23:50.401 --> 02:23:52.290
And the teacher was like,
if he doesn't get it together,

2538
02:23:52.291 --> 02:23:56.480
the only job he's gonna be able to do as like a standup comedian.
Yeah.
And uh,

2539
02:23:56.570 --> 02:24:00.210
yeah.
So,
so I guess deep down,
yeah.
And maybe by default,
I don't know.

2540
02:24:00.250 --> 02:24:02.790
That's the worst motivation ever.
I know.
He doesn't get it together.

2541
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:05.830
He's going to have the greatest job in the history of [inaudible] sleeping

2542
02:24:05.831 --> 02:24:09.000
whenever he wants to fuck her and drink every night.
You're going to have fun.

2543
02:24:09.001 --> 02:24:12.000
You're going to make people laugh in a way that very few people ever get to

2544
02:24:12.001 --> 02:24:13.200
experience in their life.

2545
02:24:13.201 --> 02:24:15.900
And you've got to get to do it twice a night on the weekends and never have a

2546
02:24:15.901 --> 02:24:20.770
nine to five people don't know,
like I did.
Um,
I just did Edmonton,

2547
02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:22.260
this river creek casino,

2548
02:24:22.261 --> 02:24:27.261
it's like 1800 people mobbed the laughs that come off at 1800 people when

2549
02:24:27.571 --> 02:24:31.980
they're howling killing it's electric.
You're fucking,
you're,

2550
02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:35.040
you get goosebumps on your goose bar invincible.
Well,
it's just,

2551
02:24:35.041 --> 02:24:38.670
you feel great and they feel great.
You feel like it's a good exchange.

2552
02:24:38.671 --> 02:24:42.870
Like you're happy that they're laughing,
you know,
it's like,
it's an honest,

2553
02:24:43.050 --> 02:24:47.370
happy,
happy exchange and you get to make it all happen.

2554
02:24:47.370 --> 02:24:50.110
Like they're sitting down there and they're watching and you're getting,

2555
02:24:50.410 --> 02:24:53.340
you get to make it all happen and watch the results instantly.

2556
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:56.490
And as long as you keep working at it,
as long as you keep writing,

2557
02:24:56.770 --> 02:24:59.700
you know you're going to have some good sets and some bad sets and you're going

2558
02:24:59.701 --> 02:25:01.620
to have some good bits and some bad bits.

2559
02:25:01.621 --> 02:25:05.640
And if you put out 10 cds,
one of them,

2560
02:25:05.641 --> 02:25:08.430
you're not going to like that much or two of them where someone is going to be a

2561
02:25:08.450 --> 02:25:11.970
family like yeah,
I didn't like that one Justin.
It was just some about it.

2562
02:25:11.971 --> 02:25:16.430
You were all fucking weird and talking about flowers.
Right.
You know,
but,

2563
02:25:17.070 --> 02:25:18.720
but over it all,

2564
02:25:18.721 --> 02:25:22.800
if you have the right mindset and you continue to create and you continue to

2565
02:25:22.801 --> 02:25:23.770
write and perform,

2566
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:27.970
<v 0>it just keeps happening.
It just keeps happening.
If you give it what it needs,</v>

2567
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:31.950
you feed what it,
what it needs,
it keeps it keeps happening.
Yeah.

2568
02:25:32.410 --> 02:25:35.650
And there's a lot of guys that are like,
are perfect examples of that.
Like burr,

2569
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:39.790
like Bellbird did,
uh,
the ice house show last week,
last Wednesday,

2570
02:25:40.210 --> 02:25:44.470
all new stuff fucks around on stage.
It's always fucking around,

2571
02:25:44.471 --> 02:25:48.370
always writing.
And he had a really good point about writing too.
He's like,

2572
02:25:48.371 --> 02:25:51.250
you should be able to come up with an hour a year because really all it is is 10

2573
02:25:51.251 --> 02:25:55.090
minutes a month.
Right?
Yeah,
it's true.
Yeah.

2574
02:25:55.091 --> 02:25:58.750
That's another guy just watching him like even like just working shit out.

2575
02:25:59.110 --> 02:26:02.230
Fucking brilliant.
10 minutes a month as 120 minutes a year.

2576
02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:06.600
<v 1>So yeah,
I get,
yeah,</v>

2577
02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:11.580
<v 0>so if you wrote one good joke a week,
12 months,
10 minutes a month,</v>

2578
02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:14.730
120 minutes a year.
I do about that.
And she

2579
02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:19.860
see you haven't seen me in a one stop,
you fucking line the,
you know,

2580
02:26:19.861 --> 02:26:22.290
you have some good ideas,
but you know,

2581
02:26:22.530 --> 02:26:25.380
the reality of bits is they're never done.

2582
02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:28.260
You've got to keep chopping away at them and editing them.

2583
02:26:28.261 --> 02:26:30.570
And so what you say is like 45 minutes.

2584
02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:34.410
It's really 15 it's 15 monster minutes.
That's what,

2585
02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:39.150
<v 1>when I have an hour,
if I have an hour,
yeah,
I don't really have an hour.
What?</v>

2586
02:26:39.151 --> 02:26:39.860
I have an hour,

2587
02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:42.880
<v 0>five an hour.
I have 25 minutes of murder.
Right.
And I can,</v>

2588
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:44.330
I can turn that into an hour.

2589
02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:50.040
I can shop it into an assassinating 25 minutes and then sometimes extend.

2590
02:26:51.620 --> 02:26:54.290
<v 1>Sure.
You haven't seen me in a lot.
I'm sure you got way better.</v>

2591
02:26:54.291 --> 02:26:55.720
And probably the greatest comedian never.
No,
no,

2592
02:26:55.730 --> 02:26:58.760
I'm just saying that you don't know even know my material weeks ago.
Bitch.

2593
02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:02.310
The Ice House.
But you didn't see me doing my side bitch.

2594
02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:06.540
You saw audience members yelling at subjects to them.

2595
02:27:07.310 --> 02:27:12.200
I got the report back from the um,
comedy American comedy company.
Oh,

2596
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:15.560
through report.
Oh cool.
I did awesome.
Yeah,
I heard you did good.

2597
02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:19.520
I did really good.
I really did.
Did Awesome.

2598
02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:23.870
I believe,
you know I did.
Yeah.
If you don't believe me,
that's just,

2599
02:27:23.871 --> 02:27:27.170
I said I believed you heard Sunday night was a little rough.

2600
02:27:27.650 --> 02:27:30.140
Oh my guess sets the guest.
That's where different.

2601
02:27:30.141 --> 02:27:33.150
I'm a front in front of Brian Collins crowd.
I just said,
all right.
Sunday.

2602
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:34.940
That was a little rough.
Yeah.
Okay Joe.

2603
02:27:34.941 --> 02:27:38.090
So you know when there's somebody there to see you and then if there's somebody

2604
02:27:38.091 --> 02:27:40.940
other comic just comes on stage,
that's not their crowd.
You know,

2605
02:27:40.941 --> 02:27:44.540
it's going to be a little weird sometimes when he mixed certain crowds of people

2606
02:27:44.541 --> 02:27:45.740
don't know you.
Exactly.

2607
02:27:45.950 --> 02:27:49.250
<v 0>And I think with you,
like we've heard talked about this before,</v>

2608
02:27:49.251 --> 02:27:52.490
you get this Willy Wonka golden ticket where people already know you when you're

2609
02:27:52.491 --> 02:27:56.450
starting out.
There's pressure and that and then it's also,

2610
02:27:56.810 --> 02:27:58.370
it's also easier that way too.

2611
02:27:58.460 --> 02:27:58.641
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2612
02:27:58.641 --> 02:28:02.420
But if you have a Sunday eight o'clock show and is not your audience and it's

2613
02:28:02.421 --> 02:28:05.600
somebody else's eye and said nausea from hangover and there's a lot of couples

2614
02:28:05.601 --> 02:28:09.320
there that probably don't want to hear about fucking dolphins and calm and,

2615
02:28:09.410 --> 02:28:12.440
and shit like that.
There's a lot of people don't want to heal.
You're what

2616
02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:14.420
<v 0>those things.
That's the beautiful thing about performing.</v>

2617
02:28:14.421 --> 02:28:15.470
For people that don't know you,

2618
02:28:15.980 --> 02:28:18.830
you know one of the good things about doing like pop in shows,

2619
02:28:18.831 --> 02:28:21.680
like think one thing that a lot of comics to do.

2620
02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:25.640
So I like to go up on a show where people are not coming to see them because

2621
02:28:25.641 --> 02:28:27.420
that way they'll get a more honest reaction.
Sure.

2622
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:32.060
And sometimes it'll make you cultivate your bits for a new mind or for a new
ear.

2623
02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:34.490
You know,
someone who hasn't seen your stuff before.

2624
02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:39.540
<v 5>But I also did five shows in the weekend and all of them were amazing sets.</v>

2625
02:28:39.971 --> 02:28:43.690
So,
so amazing that that the owner of the club or at a three page letter

2626
02:28:43.691 --> 02:28:47.350
recommending me to other clubs.
Please.
It's so gross.
No,
but you're just saying,

2627
02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:52.060
I just said,
hey,
you did shitty in San Diego.
Say you did shit.

2628
02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:53.770
Like you were saying,

2629
02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:58.110
<v 0>going to say is I heard Sunday night was rough for not just you.
It was,</v>

2630
02:28:58.111 --> 02:29:00.750
it was rough for a lot of other people too.
Yeah,
right.

2631
02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:04.940
It was those shells thinking very rough.
Those are good for you.
Oh Dude,

2632
02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:08.510
they'll not gonna make you stronger than just eating Dick for 25 minutes.
Good.

2633
02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:11.760
Rough set is not bad.
But I heard you did very well,

2634
02:29:11.761 --> 02:29:13.170
but counts that you did very well.

2635
02:29:13.290 --> 02:29:16.350
But it's kind of gross to like Brag about the owner saying he did so awesome.

2636
02:29:16.410 --> 02:29:20.520
<v 5>Oh,
I'm just saying that I think this is,
I believe you,
but you know,</v>

2637
02:29:21.210 --> 02:29:24.600
and a lot of my set,
you're saying I only have a 15 minute set.

2638
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:28.110
You haven't seen me do any of my sense.
Probably to have a,

2639
02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:31.330
<v 0>I said if you say you have 50 new minutes,</v>

2640
02:29:31.331 --> 02:29:36.130
you really have 45 minutes means in my eyes,

2641
02:29:36.220 --> 02:29:40.960
15 minutes.
It means like you chop out a half an hour always because what?

2642
02:29:40.961 --> 02:29:42.370
How much of it is your best stuff?

2643
02:29:42.371 --> 02:29:44.050
How much of it is stuff that you really happy with?

2644
02:29:44.170 --> 02:29:45.850
How much of it needs to be edited down?

2645
02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.120
That's just how I look at material period and that's what I said about myself.

2646
02:29:49.270 --> 02:29:52.120
If I have an hour,
I don't have an hour.
I have 25 minutes of murder.

2647
02:29:52.570 --> 02:29:56.920
That's what you have.
You have,
you chop things up and as you build up more time,

2648
02:29:57.070 --> 02:30:00.550
like that's what the difference between right after you release a special,

2649
02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:04.030
the new hour that you work on in the beginning,
man,
if it's an hour,

2650
02:30:04.031 --> 02:30:07.360
it might only be like 15 minutes that you really love.
You know?

2651
02:30:07.361 --> 02:30:10.720
It might be like a lot of other stuff that you're like ham and egg and song and

2652
02:30:10.721 --> 02:30:15.640
dancing and then as time goes on you start stacking and adding and then it

2653
02:30:15.641 --> 02:30:17.230
becomes something that you're really proud of.

2654
02:30:17.650 --> 02:30:19.420
That's a process you haven't gone through yet.

2655
02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:21.220
You haven't gone through the editing process,

2656
02:30:21.250 --> 02:30:24.430
you haven't gone through the process of creating an hour chopping it down,

2657
02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:28.960
eliminating certain bits and then stretching it out to a real legit beginning to

2658
02:30:28.961 --> 02:30:31.630
end professional hour.
It takes a lot of work.

2659
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:33.380
<v 5>I have about an hour 20 minutes now,</v>

2660
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:36.410
so I would say I have like what you're saying cause face,

2661
02:30:36.470 --> 02:30:38.900
well I mean as an example of here's what,
here's a bit,
I know,

2662
02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:42.860
I know I a bit dolphin bit that I can do at 13 minute thing,

2663
02:30:42.890 --> 02:30:46.040
an eight minute thing or a five minute thing.
When I do the five minute thing,

2664
02:30:46.041 --> 02:30:47.090
it's like me rushing it,

2665
02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:52.120
the whole thing and and hitting all the seven or eight minute one.

2666
02:30:52.310 --> 02:30:56.750
It's a good s edited version but the 13 minute one is more like free.

2667
02:30:56.751 --> 02:30:58.700
It's kind of like one of your old school bits,

2668
02:30:58.730 --> 02:31:01.850
you know where it's like very comfortable to be in this playground.

2669
02:31:01.851 --> 02:31:05.240
And when I go to the,
the joke to the joke,
to the tag,
to the tag,

2670
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:07.880
it's very comfortable doing the 13 minute one.

2671
02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:11.570
But I've do all three like every week I do at least one to those is different

2672
02:31:11.571 --> 02:31:14.180
versions,
but it's always the 13 one it's really like,
all right,

2673
02:31:14.181 --> 02:31:15.770
that's the one that you need to do.

2674
02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:20.190
But so I have censored in edited different bits.
It depends on the show,

2675
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:23.340
<v 1>how much time I have.
Okay,
look Brian,
we all have different standards</v>

2676
02:31:24.020 --> 02:31:26.480
<v 0>and we all have different what we think are,
you know,</v>

2677
02:31:26.481 --> 02:31:28.210
legit bits when with finger,
not legit,

2678
02:31:28.211 --> 02:31:30.350
but so when I think is a legit but new thing is legit,

2679
02:31:30.351 --> 02:31:31.670
but it's probably going to be very different.

2680
02:31:31.850 --> 02:31:34.370
I don't want to judge your material and I want to sit and break down your act

2681
02:31:34.371 --> 02:31:35.690
and tell you what you should or shouldn't do.

2682
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:39.590
But people have a problem when you start saying how this is awesome and you did

2683
02:31:39.591 --> 02:31:44.540
so great and everybody wants the club owners writing letters for you and you

2684
02:31:44.541 --> 02:31:46.880
haven't seen me.
I'm doing awesome.
Now that I,

2685
02:31:46.881 --> 02:31:48.980
I saw you recently and it wasn't that long ago.

2686
02:31:48.981 --> 02:31:51.410
It was like you did Vancouver with me.
There was a couple of months ago.

2687
02:31:51.650 --> 02:31:55.280
That's not that long ago.
Thank Coover.
Yeah.
Did a theater in Vancouver.

2688
02:31:55.281 --> 02:32:00.220
It wasn't that long ago.
August.
Yeah,
I got four months ago.
Exactly.

2689
02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:03.270
It's a few months ago.
Give her a bit,
just not work for an array.

2690
02:32:03.271 --> 02:32:07.420
It just stops working like a budget kills all that.
It just stops.
Yeah,
for sure.

2691
02:32:07.421 --> 02:32:11.260
If you don't feel like it's,
um,
you could,
you could have a bit that it doesn't,

2692
02:32:11.261 --> 02:32:14.470
you don't feel like it works anymore.
Like it's not funny to you anymore,
right?

2693
02:32:14.471 --> 02:32:16.400
Like it might have worked in the beginning because you,

2694
02:32:16.401 --> 02:32:20.860
you saw the humor in it and then that as that adds like a certain amount of push

2695
02:32:20.861 --> 02:32:24.880
to a bit.
And if you all of a sudden decide that it's not for me anymore,

2696
02:32:24.881 --> 02:32:28.540
but it still works,
so I'll keep doing it.
They can sense that.
Well,
yeah.

2697
02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:31.110
<v 1>Vancouver,
what are you talking about?</v>

2698
02:32:31.170 --> 02:32:34.370
I didn't say anything bug you doing in Vancouver,
right.

2699
02:32:34.480 --> 02:32:37.050
Stop like making this about you,
man.
Come on.

2700
02:32:37.430 --> 02:32:38.263
<v 6>All right.</v>

2701
02:32:42.990 --> 02:32:45.190
<v 1>I don't know why you're thinking I'm making it back.
You just try.</v>

2702
02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:46.620
You just change the subject.

2703
02:32:46.770 --> 02:32:49.200
We were talking about creating bits and I don't know where you're like,

2704
02:32:49.201 --> 02:32:52.110
I did good in Vancouver.
You exactly made it about you.
Well,

2705
02:32:52.111 --> 02:32:54.940
you just made it as a reference.
Like I just saw you four months ago saying,

2706
02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:57.000
I just saw you had to go and you look.
Come on man.

2707
02:32:57.001 --> 02:32:59.970
How much better did you get in four months?
Did you get better in four months?

2708
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.800
What?
I just said,
no,
I don't want to talk about this.

2709
02:33:01.801 --> 02:33:04.740
Brian interrupted a God damn conversation.

2710
02:33:04.741 --> 02:33:06.870
We were talking about standup comedy to make it about you.

2711
02:33:07.380 --> 02:33:10.140
That's what you just did.
We had gotten done talking about you.

2712
02:33:10.141 --> 02:33:12.990
We talked about you for a long time and then we started talking about creating

2713
02:33:12.991 --> 02:33:15.360
bits and then you started woo.
I was new,

2714
02:33:15.470 --> 02:33:19.680
but I did get in being so fucking what Jesus quite point was that I didn't do

2715
02:33:19.681 --> 02:33:24.180
good in Vancouver.
He did okay in Vancouver.
I saw.
No,
I saw you Brian,

2716
02:33:24.181 --> 02:33:26.130
and it was four months ago.
I saw it.

2717
02:33:26.340 --> 02:33:28.650
You're saying you're doing so much better now.
I mean,

2718
02:33:28.651 --> 02:33:30.270
how much better did you really get in four months?

2719
02:33:30.300 --> 02:33:35.100
I did good in Vancouver is what I'm saying.
Okay,
so I saw that.
Okay.
Right.

2720
02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:36.233
We're good.

2721
02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:43.680
<v 0>Don't get too attached man.
Don't,
you know,</v>

2722
02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:47.130
defining yourself like that and it's,
it's always ugly.

2723
02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:51.290
<v 1>What do you mean defending myself or finding you're defining yourself as being</v>

2724
02:33:51.291 --> 02:33:54.830
good.
It's not defending Brian I've said had a good set.

2725
02:33:54.831 --> 02:33:57.140
I'm not saying I'm amazing.
Like I'm not saying,
Hey,

2726
02:33:57.141 --> 02:33:58.460
I am the best comic in the road.

2727
02:33:58.461 --> 02:34:01.160
I'm not saying that you wanted to talk saying I had been goods,

2728
02:34:01.250 --> 02:34:05.360
I'm saying had good sets.
Do you not see the distasteful aspect of that,

2729
02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:08.930
that people would find that uncomfortable?
Like that had a good set?
No,

2730
02:34:08.931 --> 02:34:11.750
keep talking about it.
What do you mean talking about it?
I'm not,

2731
02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:17.520
you just fucking interrupted to say you did great.
Interrupted.
Um,
uh,

2732
02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:21.640
20 seconds after you saying something about me.
I said I saw you.

2733
02:34:21.641 --> 02:34:24.070
I didn't say it was bad.
I didn't say anything.
Well,

2734
02:34:24.071 --> 02:34:26.980
you just said you should think you've,
you've done better than Vancouver.

2735
02:34:26.981 --> 02:34:29.230
You think you've done that big of an improvement in four months.

2736
02:34:29.231 --> 02:34:31.980
That's saying that I wasn't doing good in Vancouver.
Not It's saying,

2737
02:34:32.110 --> 02:34:35.090
I saw you write the Vancouver.
That's what I'm saying.
Sorry.

2738
02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:39.490
It's not saying that you weren't good in Vancouver.
You're adding that yourself.

2739
02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:43.150
I said I saw you four months ago,
so if I saw you four months ago roughly.

2740
02:34:43.151 --> 02:34:44.680
I know like what you're doing.
Yeah.

2741
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:48.850
What you're getting at it is I didn't do good in Vancouver.
It's not what I said.

2742
02:34:48.970 --> 02:34:51.490
I said,
I saw it.
You're saying you're doing so great.
I'm like,

2743
02:34:51.491 --> 02:34:53.890
I saw you four months ago.
That's what I saw.

2744
02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:57.340
Well you might want to relisten to it cause how you said it really bullshit

2745
02:34:57.380 --> 02:34:58.840
wasn't clear.
No,
because Brian,

2746
02:34:58.841 --> 02:35:02.110
I don't like when you want to talk about yourself and how great you do not

2747
02:35:02.111 --> 02:35:05.160
trying to take some uncomfortable.
I'm not trying to talk about myself.

2748
02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:10.990
They started this by saying that I heard I had to report back in San Diego so I

2749
02:35:10.991 --> 02:35:12.070
know how you good.
You didn't know.

2750
02:35:12.071 --> 02:35:13.900
It started by you telling me how great everything went.

2751
02:35:14.410 --> 02:35:16.630
I had a good set and that's when I said,

2752
02:35:16.660 --> 02:35:20.050
I heard that sunny knife was kinda rough.
I heard it was rough.
Right?

2753
02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:23.290
It wasn't as rough for you.
It was rough for other people.
Okay.

2754
02:35:23.291 --> 02:35:25.330
But he's a weird show looking at me and saying,

2755
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:29.320
I heard it was rough applying to tell the truth.
When I have a rough show,

2756
02:35:29.321 --> 02:35:31.360
I tell the truth.
I don't just tell you everything is great.

2757
02:35:31.390 --> 02:35:36.250
I tell you about one shitty show one night for 30 minutes where we're having a

2758
02:35:36.251 --> 02:35:37.540
rough day.
It's getting booed.

2759
02:35:37.770 --> 02:35:42.320
<v 2>Uh,
it was doing the dirty at 1230 show,
which is the fucking,</v>

2760
02:35:42.330 --> 02:35:45.120
it's south point casino and it's a great room.
It's a great crowd.

2761
02:35:45.121 --> 02:35:46.260
But I just fucking that you weren't feeling,

2762
02:35:46.261 --> 02:35:48.320
it was like one o'clock in the morning and I fuck a bomb for eight.

2763
02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:51.210
It's like it felt like an hour and a half.
Those are hard shows.

2764
02:35:51.211 --> 02:35:54.150
Married those late night shows.
Late night shows are hard,

2765
02:35:54.210 --> 02:35:57.420
especially if nobody knows you from anything.
They don't want to see you.

2766
02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:02.580
Nothing wrong with bombing.
It's good for you.
Yeah.
You know,

2767
02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:06.270
it sucks at the time,
but God damn,
he gets something out of that.
Yeah.

2768
02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:11.430
We learn my biggest jumps I've ever made in my entire career.
Which for bombing.

2769
02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:12.720
Yeah,
for sure.

2770
02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:16.100
It just makes you reevaluate everything that makes you want to fucking jump on.

2771
02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:21.600
You ever quit on stage like I,
this is it.
It's my lens.
No,
never quit.

2772
02:36:21.601 --> 02:36:24.750
Like this is my last show,
but I walked off before my,
Oh really?
Yeah.

2773
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:28.200
I'm always like mentally in my head I'm like,
fuck this up.
Dot.
Yeah.
It can.

2774
02:36:28.201 --> 02:36:30.570
It can fucking get rough,
dude.
It can get rough.

2775
02:36:30.571 --> 02:36:33.950
I mean that's one of the reasons why it's such an emotionally taxing job.
Yeah.

2776
02:36:34.010 --> 02:36:37.530
It's one of the reasons why people have so much of a hard time doing it.

2777
02:36:37.740 --> 02:36:40.410
It's one of the reasons why people quit too.
Let's start off.

2778
02:36:40.411 --> 02:36:42.690
They'll have a lot of good momentum and then they just bail on it.

2779
02:36:42.691 --> 02:36:45.300
They just can't take it anymore.
You think once it becomes like a business,

2780
02:36:45.301 --> 02:36:46.560
that's when it,
it,
it gets,

2781
02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:49.170
cause when you're in the beginning you're doing it for fun and you're kind of

2782
02:36:49.171 --> 02:36:52.410
going up in between your restaurant jobs.
So it was really like,
once you,
like,

2783
02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:56.070
it becomes a job.
I think it's when it's like,
fuck you should,

2784
02:36:56.071 --> 02:36:59.190
it should never be a job.
If it's a job,
you fucking up.
Well,

2785
02:36:59.191 --> 02:37:02.850
if you have to make money off of it,
yeah.
If it's a job,
you're fucking up.

2786
02:37:03.660 --> 02:37:07.080
If it's a job,
you're,
I mean,
even if you have to make money off of it,

2787
02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:09.510
you can't just think of it as it,

2788
02:37:09.511 --> 02:37:12.480
it's gotta be an art form or it's never going to work.
Right.

2789
02:37:12.510 --> 02:37:17.330
If it's not something that you,
you're excited connected to creating,
you know,

2790
02:37:17.331 --> 02:37:18.350
and it's something that you're,
you're,

2791
02:37:18.351 --> 02:37:22.310
you're passionate about molding and putting together on stage.

2792
02:37:22.820 --> 02:37:24.410
I don't think it's ever going to work if you just like,
yeah,

2793
02:37:24.411 --> 02:37:26.750
I'm just going to punch in.
Right.
Those jokes.

2794
02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:30.170
There's nothing better than the calving.
A new joking,
like just being so excited.

2795
02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:34.020
Like,
I have to call us eat tonight and tell it like that's to me anyways.
Yeah,

2796
02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:37.850
yeah,
yeah.
I can get it can get really thrilling.

2797
02:37:37.970 --> 02:37:42.080
You know it's so wild thing to do with your time man.

2798
02:37:42.650 --> 02:37:44.930
Come up with some shit that you think is going to make people laugh.

2799
02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:47.520
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2800
02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:51.030
<v 2>Cause it distasteful.
Filling this room.
Fill it</v>

2801
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:58.150
Joe carry way over there Brian.
Sorry.
It's all right buddy.

2802
02:37:59.770 --> 02:38:00.603
Happens.

2803
02:38:01.870 --> 02:38:05.590
Just got to recognize how other people would interact.

2804
02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:09.590
Like how other people would respond to people.

2805
02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:14.080
Whenever you say you're really good at anything or doing great in anything,
man,

2806
02:38:14.081 --> 02:38:14.620
there's a to

2807
02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:15.990
<v 1>do that.
I'm setting a good it set,</v>

2808
02:38:15.991 --> 02:38:19.270
it didn't seem as great at is a way to do that and there's a way to not do that.

2809
02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:23.010
It's not just that.
You said you had a good side,

2810
02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:26.340
you were talking about them manager writing you a letter and saying you did so

2811
02:38:26.341 --> 02:38:30.030
awesome.
Had a good set.
I know,
but you see that where that is,
it's like,

2812
02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:33.900
well if you're sticking that in people's faces,
you gotta be careful.

2813
02:38:34.170 --> 02:38:38.550
<v 2>Okay.
I mean am I,
am I wrong?</v>

2814
02:38:40.730 --> 02:38:45.260
<v 1>After you just said,
I had a bad set.
Sorry.
I had a report card.</v>

2815
02:38:45.290 --> 02:38:47.600
I heard it wasn't just you.

2816
02:38:47.690 --> 02:38:51.680
I heard several people on that show didn't do very well.
I heard it was tough.

2817
02:38:51.980 --> 02:38:55.790
I'm saying you gotta be honest about that too.
I mean on is,
I'm saying that,

2818
02:38:55.820 --> 02:38:58.010
you know what though?
When I got off stage,
people clapped.

2819
02:38:58.730 --> 02:39:01.190
It wasn't like I had a bad set where no one was like,
oh,

2820
02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:04.950
they're happy you were done.
Okay,
now you're just,

2821
02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:09.110
now you're just flipping the fish.
Look,
I had to say that Brian,

2822
02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:13.070
I can't just let you brag.
I have to.
I have to stop you for your own good.

2823
02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:13.933
I wasn't bragging.

2824
02:39:15.290 --> 02:39:19.010
<v 2>Justin Foster,
do you know what Bragen sounds like?
I don't know.</v>

2825
02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:21.380
Near the neck of the woods.
Do they have different,

2826
02:39:22.580 --> 02:39:24.690
different handles on what Bragen is?

2827
02:39:27.290 --> 02:39:29.930
I can't get weird for a second.
Can we wait for a second?

2828
02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:33.110
I felt like were like when mom and dad fight that just get real quiet.
Well,

2829
02:39:33.111 --> 02:39:34.220
you know what it is,
man.

2830
02:39:34.310 --> 02:39:39.310
It's like there's a lot riding on success and failure on stage and you know,

2831
02:39:39.951 --> 02:39:42.330
when you doing well,
which Brian's doing well,
you,

2832
02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:46.730
you want to let people know you're doing well.
That's what it is.

2833
02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:49.640
It's normal.
Just gotta be careful about it.

2834
02:39:49.820 --> 02:39:53.960
<v 1>I said that stuff after you said what you said.
I didn't say that.</v>

2835
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.970
I don't know if that's true.

2836
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:56.660
I don't know if that's true and I don't think you do either.

2837
02:39:56.720 --> 02:39:58.970
I don't really remember a hundred percent open to what it is.

2838
02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:01.910
I think you were saying how great it went and I said,

2839
02:40:01.970 --> 02:40:06.290
I heard Sunday night was rough and then I said,
no,
it wasn't rough.

2840
02:40:06.291 --> 02:40:10.220
I had a good weekend,
I had good sets.
Justin even said I,
he wrote Blah,
blah,
blah.

2841
02:40:10.250 --> 02:40:14.160
Right.
But,
but I said that I heard that Sunday night was rough and it was

2842
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:17.850
<v 2>rough.
And I would,
if you said that,
that to me,
I'd be like,
Ooh,
yeah,</v>

2843
02:40:17.851 --> 02:40:21.030
I kind of eat dick on Sunday,
Sunday.
I just couldn't feel it.

2844
02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:24.660
They weren't failing me.
But that's not what you did.
You.
You went on to,

2845
02:40:24.980 --> 02:40:28.730
<v 5>I didn't eat a dick Sunday.
I had,
I had a c plus set.</v>

2846
02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:32.480
I had a middle of the line.
Normal set,
nothing to write home about.

2847
02:40:32.481 --> 02:40:35.510
Nothing that went,
oh,
that was horrible.
People didn't boo,
you know.

2848
02:40:35.860 --> 02:40:39.410
No one booed me once.
No.
Or they groaned.
Is that what they did?
Yes.

2849
02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:42.200
A woman grown when I was talking about fucking a dolphin.

2850
02:40:43.250 --> 02:40:46.840
I think that's something that a woman would that warrant.
So

2851
02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:52.860
<v 2>those women,
I have the whole thing on tape.</v>

2852
02:40:52.861 --> 02:40:56.970
If you went to the fucking tape crime.
Any,
no,

2853
02:40:56.971 --> 02:40:58.140
I don't need any proof band.

2854
02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:01.530
I mean my point wasn't whether or not you were doing good or not doing good.

2855
02:41:01.770 --> 02:41:05.070
My point was whether we discuss it on a podcast like that.
I know

2856
02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:08.790
I'm trying.
I can't think about anything else.

2857
02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:12.850
<v 5>You could see the hilarity of my horrible set tomorrow at the Irvine Improv.
Oh,</v>

2858
02:41:12.851 --> 02:41:13.940
I like how you worked at it and

2859
02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:19.090
you can moan at me and little Esther and Tony Hinchcliffe and Sarah Tiana.

2860
02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:23.050
<v 2>Oh,
how dare you.
That's a good show.
It's a great show.</v>

2861
02:41:23.250 --> 02:41:26.040
Tony Hinchcliffe was with me at Irvine.
Uh,
all last weekend.

2862
02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:29.610
Fucking kids getting funny.
He's really funny.
But man,
it's a great round too.

2863
02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:31.560
I don't want to say anything with that thrift store bit.

2864
02:41:31.561 --> 02:41:34.410
I won't say anything about what the bid is,
but that's fucking great man.

2865
02:41:35.430 --> 02:41:40.290
It's true too.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that Irvine Improv's fantastic.

2866
02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:40.840
Great.

2867
02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:44.020
<v 5>Do you like it?
Is that your favorite?
One of the Improv's around this town?</v>

2868
02:41:44.050 --> 02:41:48.700
It's a great club man.
Everyday.
Like the Ontario and the like all the other ones.

2869
02:41:49.330 --> 02:41:52.960
Cause we have like three really good improv's within like an hour and an hour

2870
02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:53.793
and a half away.
It's,

2871
02:41:54.310 --> 02:41:57.040
<v 2>yeah,
there's a,
there's a ton of them.
There's the Hollywood one,</v>

2872
02:41:57.041 --> 02:42:01.300
which is always awesome.
There's the Irvine,
there's the Ontario,
the Braya.

2873
02:42:01.810 --> 02:42:03.880
They're all fantastic.
They're all great.
Yeah.

2874
02:42:05.140 --> 02:42:08.950
Improv's are fucking amazing clubs,
man.
They're there.
There's so many of them.

2875
02:42:08.980 --> 02:42:10.540
There's all over the country.
You know,

2876
02:42:10.541 --> 02:42:13.300
a lot of people think that it's like kind of a a chain thing.

2877
02:42:13.301 --> 02:42:15.400
They're fucking up and ruling in comedy,

2878
02:42:15.401 --> 02:42:18.140
but they're also providing you a lot of God damn work.
Right.

2879
02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:21.940
There's work everywhere.
I was work all over the country.

2880
02:42:22.210 --> 02:42:25.240
The only thing that I don't like as if like they tell you that you're not

2881
02:42:25.241 --> 02:42:27.970
supposed to work the other club in town or one of those deals

2882
02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:33.930
that can be a problem.
Did it,
does it happen to you a lot,
you know?
Right.

2883
02:42:33.931 --> 02:42:37.800
And not to me it happens to some people.
Yeah.
Some,
some clubs,
you know,

2884
02:42:37.810 --> 02:42:40.650
they won't let you work the other club in the town and you know,

2885
02:42:40.651 --> 02:42:45.490
and that's all I know.
You,
you've had that happen before for sure.
Texas.
Uh,

2886
02:42:45.530 --> 02:42:48.460
no,
not in Texas,
but I,
but it was saying it's like somebody like you,

2887
02:42:48.461 --> 02:42:51.700
they put it probably it doesn't really,
they were like,
you know,
yeah.

2888
02:42:51.701 --> 02:42:54.280
If you can sell tickets,
they'll let you slide with stuff.

2889
02:42:54.281 --> 02:42:57.310
But if they felt like they can control you and some sort of a way,

2890
02:42:57.311 --> 02:43:00.670
they would definitely try to do it.
I think it's,
um,
it's,
you know,

2891
02:43:00.671 --> 02:43:05.671
it's a natural business practice and trying to get on the train to fucking lock

2892
02:43:05.711 --> 02:43:10.210
it down.
You know,
especially like if you're there on a week where no one's there,

2893
02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:12.020
that's when it becomes apparent.
Like if

2894
02:43:12.020 --> 02:43:15.640
<v 0>you like the other side of town has a great comic and then this side of town,</v>

2895
02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:17.500
you know the,
the,
the club suffering,

2896
02:43:17.770 --> 02:43:20.950
they have to decide what they're going to do because if you're going to work one

2897
02:43:20.951 --> 02:43:21.401
or the other,

2898
02:43:21.401 --> 02:43:25.060
if you work in one and they're doing well or you're working on the other club

2899
02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:27.370
and then the other clubs doing well,
like they have to be well,
hey,

2900
02:43:27.371 --> 02:43:30.160
well we're sucking it right now and we're sucking it because the guy that we

2901
02:43:30.161 --> 02:43:34.000
hire is now over there working for our enemy.
So,
right.
The fuck.
Yeah.

2902
02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:37.630
That's the problem when you got business,
you know,

2903
02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:40.780
business mixed with the idea of art.

2904
02:43:44.300 --> 02:43:47.920
Okay.
It's just fucking kiss.
Yes.
Problematic.

2905
02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:50.050
But you can't be a socialist comedian either.

2906
02:43:51.970 --> 02:43:55.840
Just give away your comedy for free.
Right.
Bring me food.
I'll tell you jokes.

2907
02:43:55.930 --> 02:44:00.910
Right.
Show was basically over about 15 minutes ago.

2908
02:44:01.390 --> 02:44:05.830
We're just droning on.
Hopefully we can recover from this.
Brian,
why?

2909
02:44:05.831 --> 02:44:10.030
I'm fine.
I'm not,
I'm not,
this is,
no,

2910
02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:12.100
he's still mad about rails.
I'm not,
no,
not at all.

2911
02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:14.080
But this thing went off the rails.

2912
02:44:14.140 --> 02:44:16.390
I'm the one who has to sort of like turn it into a podcast.

2913
02:44:17.300 --> 02:44:20.290
You know people love this shit anyways.
Some people love the ship.

2914
02:44:20.291 --> 02:44:23.000
Those people are annoying.
And those two,

2915
02:44:23.001 --> 02:44:24.730
those people are responding me on Twitter.

2916
02:44:25.030 --> 02:44:29.500
And guess what context I'm just going to block.
You.
Don't jump in.
Oh look,

2917
02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:33.110
I'm going to block this guy.
He's got a fucking swastika on his logo.
Yeah,

2918
02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:38.000
sorry.
Fuck face kind of block you.

2919
02:44:39.470 --> 02:44:42.850
<v 1>It's a little logo.
Yeah,
it's got a fucking swastika.
It's putting it out there.</v>

2920
02:44:42.851 --> 02:44:45.270
I don't know how it's like youtube,
there was a,

2921
02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:47.650
somebody sent me a video and only wants to hit the knee.

2922
02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:52.090
It was an inward music video time times two or something like that with thing

2923
02:44:52.110 --> 02:44:55.620
was called.
And it was just a guy dressed up like typical,
like,

2924
02:44:55.650 --> 02:45:00.100
like almost racist black slave style.
And the song was just inward,
inward,
inward.

2925
02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:02.170
And it was just,
it was a black guy doing it.

2926
02:45:02.171 --> 02:45:04.870
So I think that maybe that's the only reason why I could stay on Youtube.

2927
02:45:04.871 --> 02:45:09.310
But I was very shocked when people have like Twitter avatars and stuff like
that,

2928
02:45:09.311 --> 02:45:10.980
like really racist symbols.
And

2929
02:45:11.630 --> 02:45:15.060
<v 0>how was that?
How did they get away with that shit?
You could get away with a lot.</v>

2930
02:45:15.210 --> 02:45:18.480
If you're a black guy and you want to talk about black people,
right?
You know,

2931
02:45:18.481 --> 02:45:21.000
you can get a lot of your white guy and you want to talk about why people,

2932
02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:25.210
but Nan you,
uh,
I just don't,
yeah,

2933
02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:29.110
I can't wear black face and go to school.
Right.
Wrong.
It'd be Mr t I wonder if,

2934
02:45:29.111 --> 02:45:32.370
think I tried to it was it at one of her is at a party or if wonder if he went

2935
02:45:32.371 --> 02:45:33.470
to school as Mr [inaudible].

2936
02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:38.540
<v 1>God,
I hope he did go to
because I think it was a day,</v>

2937
02:45:38.541 --> 02:45:42.290
right?
It was a,
it was a school day.
The Halloween fell on,

2938
02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:43.820
could he get in trouble?

2939
02:45:43.821 --> 02:45:46.760
Say he was at a house party with adults and some I snapped a picture of him.

2940
02:45:46.761 --> 02:45:48.560
Could he get,
he could still get in trouble for that.
Right,
right.

2941
02:45:48.570 --> 02:45:49.910
I think probably how you think.
Yeah.

2942
02:45:49.911 --> 02:45:51.930
I don't think he would want stroll into class with black.

2943
02:45:51.950 --> 02:45:55.980
I pity the fool maybe did.
Maybe he's like,
look,
I'm Mr T.
Right,

2944
02:45:56.510 --> 02:45:57.680
and that's ballsy.

2945
02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:01.310
He said the the the lounge and they all drinking coffee together.
No,

2946
02:46:01.311 --> 02:46:04.900
it's not to do it.
What the fuck man.
All the other teachers like,
we're not gonna,

2947
02:46:05.270 --> 02:46:08.840
we're not going to get into this today.
Yeah.
They're like,
you can't do that.
Oh,

2948
02:46:08.841 --> 02:46:10.150
come opinion.
Full

2949
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:14.270
<v 2>painful.
Isn't that funny that that guy,</v>

2950
02:46:14.330 --> 02:46:19.160
like he's like one of the only guys that you associate with like a giant chunk

2951
02:46:19.161 --> 02:46:20.690
of gold chains around your neck.

2952
02:46:20.990 --> 02:46:25.310
Like immediately you think of mister t like he made that as hook where I go,

2953
02:46:25.311 --> 02:46:29.420
if a guy had more than one chain,
you'd go,
we've got to Mr t starter kit.
Right,

2954
02:46:29.450 --> 02:46:32.800
right.
Some,
some guy,
if you were heckling him and you know,
the,

2955
02:46:32.801 --> 02:46:35.480
the chains were fake because the teacher couldn't afford that on a teacher

2956
02:46:35.481 --> 02:46:40.220
salary.
It seems like if this happened when the team was really popular,

2957
02:46:40.221 --> 02:46:42.470
that when it first came out in that time area,

2958
02:46:42.860 --> 02:46:45.770
that wouldn't be a big deal right now.
You can't do anything though.

2959
02:46:45.771 --> 02:46:47.700
Especially if you're a teacher.
Like my brother just got,

2960
02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:49.520
he had to delete his whole Facebook page.
He's like,

2961
02:46:49.521 --> 02:46:53.030
I'm not even gonna take any fucking chances.
Right.
So that guy should,

2962
02:46:53.060 --> 02:46:56.480
he should know better.
You can get in big trouble for almost anything.

2963
02:46:56.930 --> 02:47:01.310
Almost anything if you,
if you do anything that's non PC outside of work.

2964
02:47:01.460 --> 02:47:06.460
Some girl got fired because they took a picture on her Facebook of her boyfriend

2965
02:47:06.501 --> 02:47:10.250
holding her tit and they let her go.
Yeah,
they fired her.
She was a teacher.

2966
02:47:11.090 --> 02:47:14.170
I was holding her tit.
I mean it wasn't even like holding nipple.

2967
02:47:14.171 --> 02:47:17.630
It wasn't like Penn just grabbing a tet squeezing like some bottom meet

2968
02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:21.770
the fuck man.

2969
02:47:22.130 --> 02:47:25.610
There's a weirdness going on in the world where people are just super fucking

2970
02:47:25.611 --> 02:47:27.510
sensitive,
super duper sentence.

2971
02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:30.230
They want people want to get other people in trouble too.
That's the thing.

2972
02:47:30.231 --> 02:47:33.470
Everybody's wants to be the first to like catch somebody doing something,
an act.

2973
02:47:33.471 --> 02:47:37.790
It'd be the first to,
you know,
get somebody fired.
Right.
Yeah.
That's a thing too.

2974
02:47:37.791 --> 02:47:40.550
They want to catch people and things so there's a lot of miserable fucks out

2975
02:47:40.551 --> 02:47:44.300
there working stuck in jobs they don't like and it just,
Ooh,

2976
02:47:44.380 --> 02:47:48.050
they got this built up and if they can point it at you and get you in trouble

2977
02:47:48.051 --> 02:47:50.660
for something because there's a whole bunch of rules that everybody has got to

2978
02:47:50.661 --> 02:47:54.620
follow in.
A lot of them are ridiculous rules.
They feel better.
You the PC police,

2979
02:47:54.621 --> 02:47:57.230
it's just so out of control.
But you know,

2980
02:47:57.231 --> 02:47:59.810
in some ways it's got to be there because if you're working,

2981
02:47:59.811 --> 02:48:02.420
like say if you're a woman and you're working in some fucking office with some

2982
02:48:02.421 --> 02:48:04.100
guy who tells Dick Jokes all the time,

2983
02:48:04.101 --> 02:48:07.490
it talks about fucking like you shouldn't have to deal with that.

2984
02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:09.620
You shouldn't have to go in there but,

2985
02:48:09.770 --> 02:48:12.710
but because there's Douche bags that ruined that shit,

2986
02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:17.090
then there's always going to be like,
you can't have a funny joke either.

2987
02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:19.160
Like sometimes someone's not a Douche bag,

2988
02:48:19.161 --> 02:48:22.370
but they have the funny thing to say and it's just the right time.
Right,

2989
02:48:22.371 --> 02:48:24.560
and it's inappropriate,
but you know they don't mean it,

2990
02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:27.260
but they can get away with it.
That's like the problem with humor.

2991
02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:30.170
Like in a workplace you can't take that chance.

2992
02:48:30.510 --> 02:48:34.190
I think it has to do a lot of who the person is to the charming you are,

2993
02:48:34.191 --> 02:48:35.420
the more you can get away with.

2994
02:48:35.690 --> 02:48:39.710
The creepy guy at the office can say the same thing and people are like,
ah,
no,

2995
02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:42.330
it's gets stifled.
You know it.

2996
02:48:42.370 --> 02:48:45.620
It's gets stifled because it has to get stifled because if you just go free

2997
02:48:45.621 --> 02:48:48.200
range,
wild,
wild west,
die with your jokes,

2998
02:48:48.470 --> 02:48:50.720
like you're doing a podcast or something.
Right.
You know,

2999
02:48:50.721 --> 02:48:53.020
some people are going to get really fucking offended at you,
but who,

3000
02:48:53.180 --> 02:48:55.540
but my question is like what PR is and here's what it was,

3001
02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:58.640
was probably a parent of a teacher that she'd probably be reprimanded.

3002
02:48:58.900 --> 02:49:00.790
It was like,
oh,
this be telling me how to raise my kids.

3003
02:49:00.791 --> 02:49:02.450
Scrolling through a Facebook page and go on.

3004
02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:07.590
How dare lady with a boyfriend with having fun.
Tell me how to raise kid.

3005
02:49:07.620 --> 02:49:09.750
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
That could definitely be it.

3006
02:49:09.751 --> 02:49:14.490
Some woman doesn't want some fucking slut reasoner religion.
That could be it.

3007
02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:18.080
Or some checkers just upset that she's hot enough for someone to grab her tits

3008
02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:20.950
and she hasn't gotten laid since her fucking husband cheated on it.
Dirty Bitch.

3009
02:49:20.951 --> 02:49:24.510
Yeah.
Grabbing tin on Facebook.
I'll show her.
That could be that too.

3010
02:49:25.470 --> 02:49:28.260
All right.
Justin Foster people can find you on Twitter.

3011
02:49:28.261 --> 02:49:32.480
It's Justin comic on Twitter.
Yup.
And do you have a website too?
Yeah.

3012
02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:34.560
Justin comic.
Justin Connolly.
Yup.

3013
02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:37.500
You were the only Justin comic to scoop that shit on.
I was the first.

3014
02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:40.530
It had to be somebody else who thought that up.
So get you to buy it from me.

3015
02:49:40.820 --> 02:49:44.100
Do you find that there may be an issue with people remembering the name foster?

3016
02:49:44.370 --> 02:49:48.090
Uh,
Nah.
I don't think so.
I hope not.
All right.
Thanks for having me.

We made up buddy.
Yeah,

3019
02:49:55.470 --> 02:49:57.210
I was just trying to help everybody here folks.

3020
02:49:57.211 --> 02:50:00.360
I just have a a very strong opinion on certain things.

3021
02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:03.690
I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings.
We don't mean to just,

3022
02:50:03.691 --> 02:50:07.200
we smoke a little weed and sometimes we just talk.
Sometimes shit goes awry.

3023
02:50:07.770 --> 02:50:10.980
Just like comedy set by Justin Foster.

3024
02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:15.520
All right,

We'll be back.
