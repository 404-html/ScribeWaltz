1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like,</v>

4
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:05.874
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of energy that people get from wanting to prove other</v>

6
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:11.544
<v Speaker 1>folks wrong.</v>

7
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

9
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.601
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

10
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

11
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

12
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>it can,</v>

13
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.350
<v Speaker 1>it can help you in some ways.</v>

14
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>It can certainly help you,</v>

15
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>but I think sometimes even like,</v>

16
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about the benefits you had a cocaine,</v>

17
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>like there's benefits to it.</v>

18
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>There's like you could say things and do things he ordinarily wouldn't be able</v>

19
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

20
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

21
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>this is the motivation of,</v>

22
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>of like proving people wrong.</v>

23
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.561
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you,</v>

25
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you said I was going to be shit,</v>

27
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:34.914
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you.</v>

28
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Like you get to a certain point in time that could kind of play against you too,</v>

29
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

30
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

31
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>It could backfire because then it becomes it for me it becomes like an a,</v>

32
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>and I definitely did my last,</v>

33
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>not the album I did mom before last with that,</v>

34
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>that angry,</v>

35
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you quite full like villain this energy,</v>

36
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

37
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>And I was able to make some really great records,</v>

38
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>but it was the most aggressive music I had ever made.</v>

39
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

40
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.601
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

41
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:04.434
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>some of it was the most aggressive and a lot of levels,</v>

43
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>not even in a mean way,</v>

44
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.881
<v Speaker 1>but just like,</v>

45
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:09.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>just the music itself.</v>

47
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

49
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.890
<v Speaker 1>and I benefited the,</v>

50
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

51
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

52
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>what I set out to do,</v>

54
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>it all benefited,</v>

56
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:18.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

58
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.733
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

60
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the normal way I went about making an album,</v>

61
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>so it was weird,</v>

62
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:25.741
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

64
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>and it was something that I took a step backward afterwards and then drop the</v>

65
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:30.361
<v Speaker 1>second album and like,</v>

66
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:30.541
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

67
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:31.171
<v Speaker 1>this one's not.</v>

68
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:31.591
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

69
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't really feel like I'm,</v>

71
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm like going,</v>

72
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 1>up against the masters.</v>

74
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Like I really have something to prove here.</v>

75
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>This is more just like about like just being at some type of peace,</v>

76
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>and just having things sorted out once all the madness is all done and just</v>

78
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>kinda dislike.</v>

79
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Now it's just like,</v>

80
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.863
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

81
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

82
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.611
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

83
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I did indicat another satellite flight.</v>

84
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:53.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

85
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:57.240
<v Speaker 1>cause I feel like in the cup was me just figuring out how to produce,</v>

86
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>and make records and then satellite fight was me having it mastered and finally</v>

88
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>putting together something that was just like fine tune but in a different</v>

89
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>structure where I have like some instrumentals and then,</v>

90
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>w you know,</v>

92
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>the kind of like interludes and then you know,</v>

93
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>records that would just completely,</v>

94
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>format it in different ways.</v>

96
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not the three verse two Hook formula and maybe just one long verse in one</v>

97
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>altro and you know,</v>

98
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe no hook at all,</v>

99
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe no drums for the first minute and 30 seconds,</v>

100
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>but there's like wraps,</v>

101
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>just experiment and then try and things,</v>

103
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>not that I have that expertise for creating a record,</v>

105
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

106
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.931
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever,</v>

107
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

108
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>listened to the brand new heavies?</v>

109
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I know some records here,</v>

110
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.640
<v Speaker 1>the brand new heavies did this rap thing where they're gods.</v>

111
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 1>It was trying to remember the name of it.</v>

112
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

113
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.601
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

114
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>but it was along those lines,</v>

116
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>like very experimental.</v>

117
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>And this is like back in like the early nineties.</v>

118
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>They did like Kool g rap did one of them.</v>

119
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>And did it like to like some like actual music behind it?</v>

120
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

121
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty interesting stuff.</v>

122
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>But I remember that and I remember thinking like,</v>

123
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

124
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>like why don't more people do like Weird Shit with music?</v>

125
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people are thinking the way you're thinking?</v>

126
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:14.584
<v Speaker 1>Like saying like,</v>

127
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.861
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

128
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>how about we just do no drums for like the first minute and a half and then just</v>

129
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>start rapping and then the drums kicking like these kinds of things where you</v>

130
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>just like coming up with,</v>

131
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>like just a different approach,</v>

133
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>slightly different entry.</v>

134
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I think people are just a little scared that they'll lose the audience's</v>

135
00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:31.541
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

136
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 1>And which is the very,</v>

137
00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:35.220
<v Speaker 1>a real fear.</v>

138
00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:35.431
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

139
00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:35.551
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

140
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:36.384
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

141
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:03:37.341 --> 00:03:39.270
<v Speaker 1>but it also goes back to what I was saying.</v>

143
00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

144
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>I've just been blessed with a family stat.</v>

145
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.034
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

146
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.880
<v Speaker 1>it's into what I'm doing no matter what,</v>

148
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.391
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

149
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

150
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.913
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

151
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.300
<v Speaker 1>that's just dope.</v>

152
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:03:48.631 --> 00:03:49.560
<v Speaker 1>but the average artist,</v>

154
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:49.741
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

155
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.120
<v Speaker 1>they can't just experiment.</v>

156
00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:54.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's this fear where they might not sell records and then that's bad for</v>

157
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:55.530
<v Speaker 1>business and this is a business,</v>

158
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.491
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

159
00:03:56.491 --> 00:03:57.324
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

160
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.991
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

161
00:03:57.991 --> 00:03:58.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.363
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

163
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

164
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.430
<v Speaker 1>it's understood why most guys don't really do it.</v>

165
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

166
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.230
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see people do it.</v>

167
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:05.064
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's,</v>

168
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.170
<v Speaker 1>that's not an excuse.</v>

169
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a way where people can be a little bit more creative and</v>

170
00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>push the envelope a lot more with the music,</v>

171
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.691
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

172
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:13.770
<v Speaker 1>where it fits in,</v>

173
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:14.220
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

174
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.580
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

175
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.110
<v Speaker 1>in a way that makes sense.</v>

176
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's true to their,</v>

177
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.790
<v Speaker 1>their art and their formula.</v>

178
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the,</v>

179
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.961
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

180
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:26.961
<v Speaker 1>there's always a way to try something new and be innovative and bring something</v>

181
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:29.610
<v Speaker 1>different to the table if anybody wants to check out that,</v>

182
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>that brand new heavies that I was talking about,</v>

183
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:33.750
<v Speaker 1>it's called heavy rhyme experience.</v>

184
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.561
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

185
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:36.210
<v Speaker 1>and it was the brand new heavies.</v>

186
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:39.150
<v Speaker 1>It was 92 way back in the day when I was,</v>

187
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I was living in New York and um,</v>

188
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.800
<v Speaker 1>my friend God,</v>

189
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.643
<v Speaker 1>goddammit,</v>

190
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.820
<v Speaker 1>trying to remember his name,</v>

191
00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:46.260
<v Speaker 1>standup comedian told me about him.</v>

192
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.551
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

193
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:47.311
<v Speaker 1>you gotta listen to this shit.</v>

194
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:48.630
<v Speaker 1>These guys are doing some weird stuff.</v>

195
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.230
<v Speaker 1>They did a Doula with Kool g rap.</v>

196
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.011
<v Speaker 1>They did a,</v>

197
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:54.650
<v Speaker 1>one of them with a uh,</v>

198
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.613
<v Speaker 1>gangstarr.</v>

199
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty bad ass that a bunch of different collaboration.</v>

200
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:02.160
<v Speaker 1>So like jazz singers with like rap,</v>

201
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:03.000
<v Speaker 1>like serious,</v>

202
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.070
<v Speaker 1>like best of the class back then hardcore rappers rapping over their uh,</v>

203
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:09.360
<v Speaker 1>their ride or their music.</v>

204
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.960
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty cool.</v>

205
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

206
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.963
<v Speaker 1>AH,</v>

207
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

208
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

209
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.040
<v Speaker 1>but your,</v>

210
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>your point about having the fan base that allows you to fuck around and practice</v>

211
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.360
<v Speaker 1>and take chances,</v>

212
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.440
<v Speaker 1>that is huge,</v>

213
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:19.801
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

214
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Like this,</v>

215
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>the mentality that you know,</v>

216
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.680
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

217
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>they like you as a person as well as like your music so that,</v>

218
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:27.330
<v Speaker 1>and they want you,</v>

219
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>they want to see where you go with it.</v>

220
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to do your best know it comes from a pure place to,</v>

222
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

223
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like they know me as a top 10 single say no,</v>

224
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to make some cool shit that they can connect with.</v>

225
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's the extent every time it doesn't go beyond that and the minute it</v>

226
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:43.121
<v Speaker 1>tries to,</v>

227
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>it just starts getting frustrating.</v>

228
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Like start thinking about a radio record to please somebody at the label.</v>

229
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Then it gets frustrating if I started thinking about this and that for this.</v>

230
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>And it gets frustrating if I keep it just based on like,</v>

231
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>amen,</v>

232
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 1>this sounds gnarly and this,</v>

233
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>make sure it's not too trippy in this.</v>

234
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Make sure it's not to this and not do that.</v>

235
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

236
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

237
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>effortless combination of everything all at once,</v>

238
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

239
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.111
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

240
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

241
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>and that's really what these past couple of years for me have been like.</v>

242
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Just mastering that technique is a producer and,</v>

243
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:16.844
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

244
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.951
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

246
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:20.110
<v Speaker 1>really just,</v>

247
00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

248
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>going all out creatively and just trying new things because I also internally</v>

249
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:27.880
<v Speaker 1>don't feel like I have anything else to prove,</v>

250
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.943
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

251
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>as a musician.</v>

252
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Speaker 1>But I have that itch,</v>

253
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>like I need to create,</v>

255
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's like working out for me.</v>

256
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like doing reps and stand mentally fit,</v>

257
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>creatively fit,</v>

258
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.241
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

259
00:06:45.241 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

260
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>so when it comes time to do an album,</v>

261
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I got some new powers I've acquired in the past year,</v>

262
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.471
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

263
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:51.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

264
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>from just dicking around in the studio for a couple of months.</v>

265
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 1>It's going everyday and making beats,</v>

266
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>whether I'm in the studio for five hours or two hours,</v>

267
00:06:58.911 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm making something.</v>

268
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:04.961
<v Speaker 1>I'm making at least like on average I make about making the studio.</v>

269
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm making at least two to four beats a day.</v>

270
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And when I say beats,</v>

271
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about completed,</v>

272
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 1>sequenced,</v>

273
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

274
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.180
<v Speaker 1>instrumentals that I could make records on.</v>

275
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.931
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

276
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:18.651
<v Speaker 1>not just some shit.</v>

277
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 1>I started a little bit and then it's kind of cool and I'll get back to it later.</v>

278
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I have probably like a Baker's dozen of those in one session,</v>

279
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 1>but I'll have like four that are officially like,</v>

280
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.221
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

281
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>these jams are dope.</v>

282
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sit and live with these and see what comes up.</v>

283
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 1>So when you sit down to write music,</v>

284
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:34.911
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

285
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>do you sit down and do you have an idea in your head or did you select,</v>

286
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>let it come to you while you're there?</v>

287
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you know how to start?</v>

288
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

289
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.693
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

290
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>it comes different every time.</v>

291
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

292
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.491
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

293
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:47.324
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

294
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.523
<v Speaker 1>it depends.</v>

295
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>It could be a baseline that I'm thinking of it that inspires me.</v>

296
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Or it could be me not have anything in my mind and just going through the</v>

297
00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:57.854
<v Speaker 1>sounds,</v>

298
00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.293
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

299
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.200
<v Speaker 1>or it could be like a rhythm are heard or,</v>

300
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:04.731
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

302
00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 1>It could be a movie I'm watching.</v>

303
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.161
<v Speaker 1>I like to,</v>

304
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:07.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 1>produce while I'm watching movies with the sound off.</v>

306
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

307
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:11.791
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

308
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 1>that kind of helps me with scoring.</v>

309
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

310
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:14.920
<v Speaker 1>when I get in the scoring and the,</v>

311
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

312
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 1>doing as my next step,</v>

313
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to get more into scoring movies and sound design.</v>

315
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

316
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's all,</v>

317
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.583
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

318
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.030
<v Speaker 1>it's all just experimentation and just seeing what happens and,</v>

319
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

320
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not any pressure.</v>

321
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>And when you hear a beat,</v>

322
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 1>like when you're making a beat and you're creating it,</v>

323
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing lyrics.</v>

324
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Are you hearing,</v>

325
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.310
<v Speaker 1>are you thinking about,</v>

326
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

327
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.161
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

328
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>

329
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.713
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

330
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

331
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.673
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

333
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>when I'm hearing something,</v>

334
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I hear a completed,</v>

335
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.363
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

336
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.560
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm starting to record and I feel like I got some of my right song,</v>

337
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.530
<v Speaker 1>like I feel like in this back to what you were talking about,</v>

338
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:52.530
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>

339
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.481
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

340
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.260
<v Speaker 1>time doesn't really exist.</v>

342
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 1>So an hour from now is happening right now.</v>

343
00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

344
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>So there's songs that are created that I haven't made yet.</v>

345
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm in the studio I feel like I have this small like peek into this</v>

346
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 1>other world in this window that I can hear the song.</v>

347
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.310
<v Speaker 1>But it's my job in the present to find the pieces to make it some.</v>

348
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it might come out exactly like what I'm hearing and sometimes it</v>

349
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>might not,</v>

350
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but there's never,</v>

351
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 1>it's never really spot on.</v>

352
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.760
<v Speaker 1>And I just hear glimmers of what the song completed sounds like until it's</v>

353
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.231
<v Speaker 1>completed.</v>

354
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:28.891
<v Speaker 1>And Dennis just,</v>

355
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>everything's perfect.</v>

356
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 1>But that's how I can sit there and listen to a mix and be like,</v>

357
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:32.784
<v Speaker 1>something's off.</v>

358
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Because in my completed version,</v>

359
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

360
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:36.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like a coloring book.</v>

361
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Every record starts off in one way,</v>

362
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:39.151
<v Speaker 1>just blank.</v>

363
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just filling in all the colors and then there's one color is still</v>

364
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:42.594
<v Speaker 1>missing.</v>

365
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

366
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 1>that's what's happening in the final,</v>

367
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:45.741
<v Speaker 1>in the ninth in.</v>

368
00:09:45.741 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 1>And you know when,</v>

369
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.041
<v Speaker 1>when mix knob them,</v>

370
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's still some colors that just not in there yet.</v>

371
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going through sounds and I find the colors and everything is full,</v>

372
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>then I'm cool or I might not find the exact color but some close enough I'm</v>

373
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:57.324
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

374
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 1>And like that's literally where it's at,</v>

375
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>where you have to make the executive decision.</v>

376
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:01.691
<v Speaker 1>Like all right,</v>

377
00:10:01.691 --> 00:10:02.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with this.</v>

378
00:10:02.231 --> 00:10:05.370
<v Speaker 1>So I'll be sitting for another two weeks trying to sit with this mix cause I'm</v>

379
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:08.580
<v Speaker 1>really anal about it and if I don't just back away and let it be,</v>

380
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:09.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

381
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:10.650
<v Speaker 1>we'll never hear any news.</v>

382
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a fascinating insight into the creation of music.</v>

383
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.281
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>

384
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:14.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

385
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody that does that like,</v>

386
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>well where they could tell me about the entire process from the beginning to,</v>

387
00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:23.760
<v Speaker 1>and so it's interesting to get a window into that world because I always</v>

388
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 1>wondered and I also always wondered like,</v>

389
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.341
<v Speaker 1>I Know James,</v>

390
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 1>he never writes his lyrics down and it keeps them all in his head.</v>

391
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

392
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you do that or do you actually write them down somewhere?</v>

393
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

394
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.233
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

395
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'm sometimes,</v>

396
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of my hooks are in my head,</v>

397
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.180
<v Speaker 1>but I need to write,</v>

398
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:40.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

399
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 1>certain things down to just Kinda make sure I'm making sense.</v>

400
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I used to do a lot of my earliest stuff just off the dome,</v>

401
00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 1>just freestyle and Shit,</v>

402
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:48.781
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

403
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

404
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.330
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes that works good with melodies.</v>

405
00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I do that a lot.</v>

406
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll go in there and just hum flows and try different things like that and</v>

407
00:10:55.381 --> 00:10:56.214
<v Speaker 1>melodies.</v>

408
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 1>But it's really just a combination.</v>

409
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 1>It's never the psych,</v>

410
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>always like writing off the dome.</v>

412
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:04.771
<v Speaker 1>Like some balance.</v>

413
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll write completely off the dome.</v>

414
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

415
00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't need paper for a ballot,</v>

416
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 1>but like if the [inaudible] off the dome,</v>

417
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.341
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

418
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:12.091
<v Speaker 1>that's a great term.</v>

419
00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna use that from now on.</v>

420
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Whenever there's a joke that I have,</v>

421
00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:15.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not written down anywhere.</v>

422
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be off the dome.</v>

423
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

424
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.350
<v Speaker 1>that was the end.</v>

425
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that it Kinda like,</v>

426
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

427
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.250
<v Speaker 1>gets people to understand that this is some,</v>

428
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

429
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.530
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

430
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

431
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.280
<v Speaker 1>the spontaneousness of it,</v>

432
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.060
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

433
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

434
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.390
<v Speaker 1>is that something alternative rappers use all the time or is that your term off</v>

435
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 1>the dome?</v>

436
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:31.883
<v Speaker 1>Is that yours?</v>

437
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

438
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.933
<v Speaker 1>I can't say.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know the guy came home off the dome.</v>

441
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:41.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a very popular phrase amongst the younger now,</v>

442
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.130
<v Speaker 1>but it all came out of kid.</v>

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.571
<v Speaker 1>You're essentially,</v>

447
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:49.370
<v Speaker 1>you're open.</v>

454
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>creating the beats you put in the work,</v>

457
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>whatever way it comes up.</v>

458
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Where it comes up all in your head when it comes up writing it down on paper and</v>

459
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:06.061
<v Speaker 1>the sessions are really me and my engineer in and occasionally I have like my</v>

460
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:07.990
<v Speaker 1>brother from another mother.</v>

461
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:08.231
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

462
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:10.030
<v Speaker 1>The genes coming through who,</v>

463
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:10.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

464
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 1>it was an abandoned I came up with a couple of years ago and that,</v>

465
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

466
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 1>we kind of just put together because we wanted to try something outside of the</v>

467
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

468
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 1>We were already making music in,</v>

469
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you know it's this,</v>

470
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>the sessions are really small.</v>

471
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I got 20 dudes in there.</v>

472
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.173
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

473
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of sad sessions.</v>

474
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.080
<v Speaker 1>They're really sad and probably not sad.</v>

475
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Why was wondering I anything,</v>

476

479
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.171

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:12.521
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

510
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:12.761

513
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Time is of the essence.</v>

514
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 1>This is what we hustled and worked hard for.</v>

515
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

516
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:19.870
<v Speaker 1>and I have to,</v>

517
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.290
<v Speaker 1>I had to remind myself as like,</v>

518
00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 1>man this has turned into a fucking party and I moved here for work.</v>

519
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.270
<v Speaker 1>So also have this like really gnarly work ethic.</v>

520
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

521
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>cause I've been working since I was 15 my first job was Wendy's.</v>

522
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I remember why I wanted to work.</v>

523
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It was because I want it in my own shit.</v>

524
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I was tired of asking my mom for stuff and also didn't think it was fair,</v>

525
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

526
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:42.580
<v Speaker 1>to ask my mom for stuff because I know we didn't have much.</v>

527
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

528
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

529
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I just had that work for me is always like one of those things that's very</v>

530
00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

531
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

532
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 1>But like there was also some jobs that I didn't fucking take seriously,</v>

533
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 1>like American apparel,</v>

534
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:54.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 1>where I was like coming in late and I didn't give a shit.</v>

536
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 1>And then like when my boss fired me,</v>

537
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.850
<v Speaker 1>like he took me to like this office and kind of told me and when he said he's</v>

538
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:03.941
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

539
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:04.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna have to let you go.</v>

540
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:04.841
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

541
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:05.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

542
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I figured that they knew it because I didn't give a fuck.</v>

543
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:08.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

544
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:08.711
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

545
00:14:08.711 --> 00:14:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I now I can go to the studio.</v>

546
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Well it's probably not,</v>

547
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>can make it work and like work on my craft and then maybe find a better paying</v>

548
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:15.600
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

549
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:15.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

550
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.610
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have me in the fucking basement of some building,</v>

551
00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:18.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

552
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 1>sweating my ass off phone,</v>

553
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:20.560
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

554
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Everybody says you should always do your best at every job you do.</v>

555
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.140
<v Speaker 1>A champion in life is a champion and everything they do.</v>

556
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to mop floors,</v>

557
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:27.791
<v Speaker 1>do your best,</v>

558
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:29.980
<v Speaker 1>and my pores Motha fuck out of those floors.</v>

559
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.660
<v Speaker 1>That's great on paper.</v>

560
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is when you're a young man,</v>

561
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.890
<v Speaker 1>it's sometimes it's good to fuck off at something.</v>

562
00:14:35.891 --> 00:14:36.371
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

563
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever want to do that again.</v>

564
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>They fire you and then you learn and there's some,</v>

565
00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:41.740
<v Speaker 1>there's some value in that.</v>

566
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.700
<v Speaker 1>It's unfortunate,</v>

567
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but we don't all learn the best way.</v>

568
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we got to get fired from American apparel.</v>

569
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

570
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.793
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

571
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>At least I didn't get fired for like stealing something.</v>

572
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I got fired for being a Shitty landscaper.</v>

573
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Scalping people's lawns that will fuck somebody as emotions.</v>

574
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 1>I would hurt my feelings if somebody just,</v>

575
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 1>if that was like the word around town that I've been,</v>

576
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:02.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

577
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Speaker 1>my main bread and butter I've been doing invest in my life and just shitty yet</v>

578
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

579
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:08.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

580
00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:13.781
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't invested in being a landmark toddler boy landscaper.</v>

581
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:14.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

582
00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:15.141
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

583
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:15.741
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying,</v>

584
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

585
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.890
<v Speaker 1>It said there's a completely different thing when you're creating your own</v>

586
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:19.281
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

587
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:20.510
<v Speaker 1>We were working for yourself.</v>

588
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like a focus,</v>

589
00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:23.181
<v Speaker 1>like an obsession,</v>

590
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.230
<v Speaker 1>almost type focused,</v>

591
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.310
<v Speaker 1>like the laser beam.</v>

592
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I love that term.</v>

593
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 1>The lab too.</v>

594
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:29.420
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my favorite terms from the rap,</v>

595
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.530
<v Speaker 1>the rap world.</v>

596
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.150
<v Speaker 1>They love talking about being in the lab,</v>

597
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.520
<v Speaker 1>creating material who are like an inventor scientist.</v>

598
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

599
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

600
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.360
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda like I treat it and that'd be sense of the word.</v>

601
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:41.941
<v Speaker 1>And every since that,</v>

602
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:42.170
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

603
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.440
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

604
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.273
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

605
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

606
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Speaker 1>that term I asked me know lab,</v>

607
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:47.600
<v Speaker 1>it's like where I'm working,</v>

608
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.550
<v Speaker 1>it's working and almost don't like playing around and in the studio like that,</v>

609
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

610
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.130
<v Speaker 1>cause it is a place for work.</v>

611
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.881
<v Speaker 1>It is an office,</v>

612
00:15:55.881 --> 00:15:56.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.290
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're trying to write,</v>

614
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to write things there too as well.</v>

615
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.310
<v Speaker 1>He tried to write lyrics and dudes are all jumping around and not even that.</v>

616
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 1>What if I'm not even just me sitting there,</v>

617
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I might not have an idea yet,</v>

618
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.060
<v Speaker 1>even if I might just in silence.</v>

619
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:08.601
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

620
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:08.871
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

621
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:09.200
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

622
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I might just need fucking silence for a little bit.</v>

623
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:11.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

624
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:12.141
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

625
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to any sort of a recording studio where anybody was doing</v>

626
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:17.690
<v Speaker 1>anything like serious like that.</v>

627
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 1>But I would imagine it's very difficult to avoid the party.</v>

628
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.741
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

629
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:22.041
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

630
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:24.520
<v Speaker 1>we're in studio and guys come to visit you come on by,</v>

631
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.191
<v Speaker 1>come to visit.</v>

632
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:25.851
<v Speaker 1>We did that.</v>

633
00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:28.740
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I did that now it's like,</v>

634
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was,</v>

635
00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:34.010
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing that's like do music professionally since like 2123 going to</v>

636
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 1>studios and having those moments with the bugs because in the beginning it's</v>

637
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 1>like you want your boys around.</v>

638
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.360
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of got that out of my system and now it's like,</v>

639
00:16:41.361 --> 00:16:42.194
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

640
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 1>30 year old Scott goes with studio by himself.</v>

641
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:45.740
<v Speaker 1>He's got his book bag,</v>

642
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>he's in there for maybe five,</v>

643
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:50.030
<v Speaker 1>six hours and then he goes home that smart and you know what I'm saying?</v>

644
00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:51.950
<v Speaker 1>And then he's like Friday night,</v>

645
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

646
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.331
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

647
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 1>and good for you in bed by like 11 1130 and Kapow Fuck,</v>

648
00:16:57.231 --> 00:16:58.064
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

649
00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.630
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

650
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

651
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.281
<v Speaker 1>no may man.</v>

652
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:02.390
<v Speaker 1>That's how you get shit done.</v>

653
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 1>That is how you get shit done.</v>

654
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm just psycho.</v>

655
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 1>We didn't man those music videos though when they showed the recording studio,</v>

656
00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:09.500
<v Speaker 1>it's always a giant table.</v>

657
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.690
<v Speaker 1>There's like all those little switches that nobody understands.</v>

658
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get a mixing board.</v>

659
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's,</v>

660
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.610
<v Speaker 1>everybody's standing in front of all the switches and then everybody's partying.</v>

661
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's in the background,</v>

662
00:17:17.751 --> 00:17:18.590
<v Speaker 1>having a good time.</v>

663
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:21.260
<v Speaker 1>But that could also be when the album's done and then celebrating it.</v>

664
00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what also happens.</v>

665
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Like when I'm done with,</v>

666
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.030
<v Speaker 1>say I finished maybe eight songs and I feel like I've got the album,</v>

667
00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:29.211
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

668
00:17:29.211 --> 00:17:31.280
<v Speaker 1>and I just need maybe a couple more jams.</v>

669
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.110
<v Speaker 1>You start inviting people to come here,</v>

670
00:17:33.111 --> 00:17:34.770
<v Speaker 1>which you got and get their hands.</v>

671
00:17:34.771 --> 00:17:36.080
<v Speaker 1>So you had those moments too.</v>

672
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.110
<v Speaker 1>So you might see that happen and,</v>

673
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

674
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 1>but there's a year and a half of just studio by myself before that happens,</v>

675
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:44.601
<v Speaker 1>like I don't really,</v>

677
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:45.640
<v Speaker 1>and maybe a case that happened,</v>

678
00:17:45.641 --> 00:17:46.520
<v Speaker 1>one or two friends,</v>

679
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:46.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

680
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:47.803
<v Speaker 1>maybe some,</v>

681
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.810
<v Speaker 1>one of my director friends are,</v>

682
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

683
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.060
<v Speaker 1>my fellow actors.</v>

684
00:17:51.061 --> 00:17:52.170
<v Speaker 1>So I just kinda want,</v>

685
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.210
<v Speaker 1>who have never really got a chance to have been in,</v>

686
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 1>be in the studio,</v>

687
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 1>come by and just see,</v>

688
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:57.721
<v Speaker 1>get to experience.</v>

689
00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:58.441
<v Speaker 1>But they're not in,</v>

690
00:17:58.441 --> 00:17:59.310
<v Speaker 1>they're distracting me.</v>

691
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.670
<v Speaker 1>They're just watching and paying attention and want to just be a fly on the</v>

692
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:02.980
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>

693
00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.813
<v Speaker 1>See how it works.</v>

694
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

695
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Well a lot of people were really curious about it cause it's a,</v>

696
00:18:07.501 --> 00:18:12.501
<v Speaker 1>it's almost a sort of a mysterious type of creativity if people aren't involved</v>

697
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:14.100
<v Speaker 1>in especially the creating of music.</v>

698
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 1>It's such a cultural,</v>

699
00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:16.711
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

700
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Speaker 1>it's such a cultural influence.</v>

701
00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's such a powerful influence.</v>

702
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Like your music has,</v>

703
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.590
<v Speaker 1>it inspires people.</v>

704
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Like when you listening to music at the gym,</v>

705
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 1>it can make you work out better.</v>

706
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you put your headphones on and you play some awesome songs.</v>

707
00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't give a fuck that you're on some stupid stamp machine,</v>

708
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:33.960
<v Speaker 1>like a hamster.</v>

709
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.050
<v Speaker 1>You just keep going.</v>

710
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.193
<v Speaker 1>And then music,</v>

711
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.890
<v Speaker 1>you liked the music so much.</v>

712
00:18:37.891 --> 00:18:39.330
<v Speaker 1>You get into it and it's only,</v>

713
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:40.164
<v Speaker 1>it's in your head,</v>

714
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.700
<v Speaker 1>drowning out everything else.</v>

715
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you don't even realize how heavy your breathing until you,</v>

716
00:18:44.781 --> 00:18:45.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

717
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:46.380
<v Speaker 1>you take the earplugs out,</v>

718
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:46.591
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

719
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

720
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting it in working here.</v>

721
00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.440
<v Speaker 1>It's because of nothing else like hits you like that.</v>

722
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Like people's words,</v>

723
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.740
<v Speaker 1>they don't sustain that way.</v>

724
00:18:55.741 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't like read incredibly passionate essay and it sustains you through a</v>

725
00:19:00.121 --> 00:19:00.954
<v Speaker 1>workout like that.</v>

726
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

727
00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:01.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

728
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

729
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.800
<v Speaker 1>it needs to be just something that like,</v>

730
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.140
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like music in that respect.</v>

731
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:07.590
<v Speaker 1>It has,</v>

732
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.570
<v Speaker 1>it has an impact that very few things do.</v>

733
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.740
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

734
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.150
<v Speaker 1>that process of creating it is always fascinating and mysterious to people like</v>

735
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:17.790
<v Speaker 1>me that don't have any musical talent at all.</v>

736
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:18.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

737
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

738
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.603
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

739
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I just approached it in a different way,</v>

740
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:23.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

741
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.401
<v Speaker 1>because I'm,</v>

742
00:19:24.401 --> 00:19:25.234
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

743
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I do feel like I'm just,</v>

744
00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:28.310
<v Speaker 1>every time I'm in the studio,</v>

745
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.030
<v Speaker 1>it's me just,</v>

746
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

747
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.041
<v Speaker 1>trying to create the,</v>

748
00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 1>uncreate it and it's a very private thing sometimes.</v>

749
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.583
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

750
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.483
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

751
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to,</v>

752
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

753
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.940
<v Speaker 1>have my privacy when I do that.</v>

754
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

755
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.260
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

756
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:43.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

757
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:43.711
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

758
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I totally do.</v>

759
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:48.120
<v Speaker 1>You do all your writing and everything and the studio or do you sometimes sit at</v>

760
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:48.540
<v Speaker 1>home?</v>

761
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

762
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it comes whenever a man,</v>

763
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:50.640
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

764
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in the shower.</v>

765
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any of the shower?</v>

766
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of some shit,</v>

767
00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:54.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

768
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:54.691
<v Speaker 1>give a,</v>

769
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:57.120
<v Speaker 1>use that a note app on the phone,</v>

770
00:19:57.121 --> 00:19:58.530
<v Speaker 1>on your phone where you're talking to it.</v>

771
00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

772
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.181
<v Speaker 1>record memos.</v>

773
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

774
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:00.871
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

775
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:01.501
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the time.</v>

776
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:02.041
<v Speaker 1>Not even that.</v>

777
00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:02.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean the note app,</v>

778
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:05.840
<v Speaker 1>you can talk to it and a voice recognition.</v>

780
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.510
<v Speaker 1>None of them.</v>

781
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of see if I'm recording something as a melody.</v>

782
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

783
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.310
<v Speaker 1>If I'm thinking of some missing mail,</v>

784
00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like thinking of wraps like other days.</v>

785
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 1>It's less about that now and it's more about like,</v>

786
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

787
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 1>like melodies and coming up with songs and structure.</v>

788
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 1>You want to hear the sound and then the lyrics come next because the music is</v>

789
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:26.880
<v Speaker 1>just going to tell me what to say,</v>

790
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

791
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

792
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.000
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

793
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking wild.</v>

794
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.201
<v Speaker 1>That's so cool.</v>

795
00:20:31.201 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Now how much of your creation is done under the influence of marijuana?</v>

796
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.493
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

797
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't smoke to create,</v>

798
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I've come up with a lot of Shit's sober sometimes when I'm fresh,</v>

799
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:44.490
<v Speaker 1>waking up in the morning.</v>

800
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes the most ideas that like 8:00 AM sometimes people say that a lot</v>

801
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:52.000
<v Speaker 1>of writers like Stephen King I believe does all of his writing in the morning.</v>

802
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I think he doesn't like nine to noon every day.</v>

803
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like man,</v>

804
00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm fresh in the morning with something,</v>

805
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.200
<v Speaker 1>some melody.</v>

806
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.680
<v Speaker 1>And it usually comes as walking through the house and making breakfast and you</v>

807
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.660
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

808
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.710
<v Speaker 1>it could be whenever it dropping a Deuce,</v>

809
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:06.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

810
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll come up with just melodies here and there and I record them all if</v>

811
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:11.830
<v Speaker 1>something really catches me.</v>

812
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Cause if I don't record them immediately and not lose them.</v>

813
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:14.621
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

814
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:15.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

815
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I got to record them somehow.</v>

816
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.311
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

817
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:19.031
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

818
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:19.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

819
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.433
<v Speaker 1>I'm always,</v>

820
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm always thinking about music as much as like I like to deny it and you know,</v>

821
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 1>go shoot a movie and shit.</v>

822
00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:27.814
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

823
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I always think about music.</v>

824
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed with the idea of just making,</v>

825
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

826
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.700
<v Speaker 1>the most beautiful songs that like,</v>

827
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

828
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:41.110
<v Speaker 1>really make people feel some type of comfort or some type of understanding</v>

829
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:42.310
<v Speaker 1>because the world is so fucked.</v>

830
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.713
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

831
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

832
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I just really am obsessed with that idea.</v>

833
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm always going to be,</v>

834
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm just trying different,</v>

835
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.190
<v Speaker 1>different ways of doing that.</v>

836
00:21:51.191 --> 00:21:52.024
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

837
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.440
<v Speaker 1>we did the rap shit,</v>

838
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.550
<v Speaker 1>we did the rock album.</v>

839
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:55.131
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

840
00:21:55.131 --> 00:21:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to be this like weird instrumentalist,</v>

841
00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

842
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:01.630
<v Speaker 1>and I don't really know when that's going to be,</v>

843
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:02.620
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just really,</v>

844
00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I guess in the process learning how to produce better too,</v>

845
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:05.944
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

846
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:06.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

847
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.390
<v Speaker 1>is something that,</v>

848
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

849
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to,</v>

850
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I always want to be better,</v>

851
00:22:10.271 --> 00:22:14.230
<v Speaker 1>so it's good to be learning and getting better as I'm creating.</v>

852
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any other things like other than music,</v>

853
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:21.961
<v Speaker 1>do you have any other hobbies or things that like I'm also get locked into a,</v>

854
00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I like design and sometimes like,</v>

855
00:22:24.461 --> 00:22:25.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

856
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 1>and I wouldn't look at myself as like a fashion designer,</v>

857
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:28.624
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

858

<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to write a little bit more.</v>

884
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.950
<v Speaker 1>It's just staying creative,</v>

885
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

886
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Like realizing like a book or like blog entries.</v>

887
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean?</v>

888
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Like a TV show or TV shows,</v>

889
00:23:10.151 --> 00:23:11.380
<v Speaker 1>horror movies,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

891
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.570
<v Speaker 1>ideas I've had in my head for a while.</v>

892
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll just start jotting them down and,</v>

893
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

894
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:20.920
<v Speaker 1>just everything right now it's just me just expressing whatever comes to mind,</v>

895
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:21.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.010
<v Speaker 1>anything that creatively strikes me.</v>

898
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:24.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

899
00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:24.551
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

900
00:23:24.551 --> 00:23:28.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a dream job for people to be able to just come up with things all the</v>

901
00:23:28.751 --> 00:23:29.340
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

902
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Just work on creating your,</v>

903
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:32.380
<v Speaker 1>your entire day spent.</v>

904
00:23:32.381 --> 00:23:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Mostly just concentrating on creating.</v>

905
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing anything with those things.</v>

906
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:35.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

907
00:23:35.261 --> 00:23:35.980
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

908
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.731
<v Speaker 1>it's stimulating,</v>

909
00:23:36.731 --> 00:23:37.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

910
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:41.440
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that I'm going to have some TV show tomorrow or up or anything,</v>

911
00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:42.910
<v Speaker 1>or it's just for me,</v>

912
00:23:42.911 --> 00:23:43.090
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

913
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:43.923
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

914
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.561
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

915
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:45.470
<v Speaker 1>it's stimulating,</v>

916
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:45.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

917
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:46.151
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

918
00:23:46.151 --> 00:23:46.984
<v Speaker 1>and Shit,</v>

919
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.171
<v Speaker 1>knowing me,</v>

920
00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck around on my right,</v>

921
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.000
<v Speaker 1>the next shit,</v>

922
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

923
00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:51.203
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

924
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.040
<v Speaker 1>or something that could lead me to assumption going,</v>

925
00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.100
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

926
00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.933
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

927
00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

928
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.010
<v Speaker 1>and it probably also helps you,</v>

929
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.421
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

930
00:24:01.421 --> 00:24:03.380
<v Speaker 1>your creativity in the other areas as well.</v>

931
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

932
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:04.910
<v Speaker 1>But then on top of that,</v>

933
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 1>I was the king of being like,</v>

934
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

935
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:08.271
<v Speaker 1>I have this idea,</v>

936
00:24:08.271 --> 00:24:08.661
<v Speaker 1>but Nah,</v>

937
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:09.440
<v Speaker 1>that's not for me.</v>

938
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:09.741
<v Speaker 1>Or No,</v>

939
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:10.574
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that.</v>

940
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

941
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

942
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 1>music is my thing.</v>

943
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:12.171
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

944
00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:13.004
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that.</v>

945
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.470
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm like pass that now.</v>

946
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:18.130
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing if it pops into my mind and I can fucking do it.</v>

947
00:24:18.131 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Cause I thought about it for a reason.</v>

948
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:25.150
<v Speaker 1>So now it's just about finding time for certain projects and I'm not no rush.</v>

949
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:25.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

950
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I been worried about being pigeonholed.</v>

951
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:27.920
<v Speaker 1>You're saying?</v>

952
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.251
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

953
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

954
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I think I've done enough strong arm and then let me get,</v>

955
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:32.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

956
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 1>my space as an artist where I can kind of do whatever I want now at this point</v>

957
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:37.910
<v Speaker 1>she reached out to me.</v>

958
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I just want us to be good though.</v>

959
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.081
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>

960
00:24:40.081 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm always feeling like I'm vulnerable to make some bullshit.</v>

961
00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I'm invincible.</v>

962
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

963
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.220
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of artists do get to that point where they feel invincible.</v>

964
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I am very capable of making some weak shit.</v>

965
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Y'All motherfuckers don't hear it.</v>

966
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:54.591
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

967
00:24:54.591 --> 00:24:57.410
<v Speaker 1>and who you ask because I'm sitting there and making sure that this is not weak</v>

968
00:24:57.411 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 1>shit and scrapping the ones that are and,</v>

969
00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:00.031
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

970
00:25:00.031 --> 00:25:02.600
<v Speaker 1>and working on the ones that started off weak,</v>

971
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:03.081
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

972
00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:05.870
<v Speaker 1>making sure that they were where they needed to be before you heard it.</v>

973
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

974
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.430
<v Speaker 1>do you have there,</v>

975
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.061
<v Speaker 1>are they like,</v>

976
00:25:08.061 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 1>you gotta know when to abandon them?</v>

977
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:09.981
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

978
00:25:09.981 --> 00:25:13.010
<v Speaker 1>You all know when to abandon some shit immediately and certain feelings you get,</v>

979
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.630
<v Speaker 1>you know when some shit is the right one and when it's not this,</v>

980
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.970
<v Speaker 1>there's jokes like that too.</v>

981
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Very similar.</v>

982
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

983
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.980
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>

984
00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Some of them you just kind of let go.</v>

985
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

986
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.680
<v Speaker 1>And then you can't infer songs.</v>

987
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

988
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.330
<v Speaker 1>it's much more emotional to let go some shit that you like because it might be</v>

989
00:25:26.331 --> 00:25:31.070
<v Speaker 1>on the right track to being something gnarly like the shelf maybe he visited.</v>

990
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:31.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

991
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:32.780
<v Speaker 1>I go back every year.</v>

992
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I go back and listen to the shit that I made the year before.</v>

993
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.840
<v Speaker 1>How do you categorize them?</v>

994
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:36.121
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

995
00:25:36.121 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 1>do you make notes or do you need,</v>

996
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 1>they're all numbered.</v>

997
00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:39.723
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] numbered.</v>

998
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.330
<v Speaker 1>You just say you go back and you go,</v>

999
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:41.511
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1000
00:25:41.511 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 1>this is from 2013 then we just listened to what I was doing.</v>

1001
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.050

1002

00:25:45.681 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell him,</v>

1004
00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.830
<v Speaker 1>pull up everything and we'll just listen to things one by one flag.</v>

1005
00:25:48.831 --> 00:25:51.440
<v Speaker 1>The ones that are good and are there ones that you know,</v>

1006
00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.131
<v Speaker 1>cause that's the thing.</v>

1007
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You always got to give yourself a break and uh,</v>

1008
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 1>it's always good to listen to stuff with fresh years.</v>

1009
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>I find.</v>

1010

1015
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting in the studio for hours listening to the same old shit,</v>

1016
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 1>like the same old beat,</v>

1019
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:09.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1020
00:26:09.981 --> 00:26:13.690
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of like you need to back off a second and like,</v>

1021
00:26:13.691 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I like to work on a record,</v>

1022
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:17.833
<v Speaker 1>bounce him,</v>

1023
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.590
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1024
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1025
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.700
<v Speaker 1>bouncing means kind of compressing all those sounds to one track to make that MP</v>

1026
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:23.603
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

1027
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what you bounced on a file.</v>

1028
00:26:25.191 --> 00:26:26.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what you guys get on your,</v>

1029
00:26:26.661 --> 00:26:27.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.950
<v Speaker 1>iPods is a bounce down file of all of all the files.</v>

1031
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1032
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.470
<v Speaker 1>so I bounced down everything.</v>

1033
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:34.993
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1034
00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 1>every one of the ones that I feel like we're close to being finished or</v>

1035
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.520
<v Speaker 1>reasonable enough for me to listen to and write too.</v>

1036
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1037
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I won't to him that night.</v>

1038
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I'll wake up the next day and while I'm making breakfast on my listen to him,</v>

1039
00:26:47.271 --> 00:26:49.200
<v Speaker 1>then with fresh ears and I'll be like,</v>

1040
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.681
<v Speaker 1>aw shit.</v>

1041
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time it's like,</v>

1042
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:50.880
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1043
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.713
<v Speaker 1>this is dope.</v>

1044
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Because the night before I'm just saying,</v>

1045
00:26:53.431 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

1046
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.391
<v Speaker 1>this shit sucks.</v>

1047
00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:54.721
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1048
00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I listen to it tomorrow,</v>

1049
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:55.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:56.400
<v Speaker 1>cause I've been in an hour,</v>

1051
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I've been in the studio for hours,</v>

1052
00:26:57.721 --> 00:26:58.260
<v Speaker 1>be too close,</v>

1053
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm by myself and I don't have nobody to tell me like,</v>

1054
00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:00.931
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1055
00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:01.621
<v Speaker 1>that shit was fresh.</v>

1056
00:27:01.621 --> 00:27:03.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just like me and my own expertise.</v>

1057
00:27:03.931 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 1>And just like right now I think this is all shit,</v>

1058
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.460
<v Speaker 1>but I'll bounce it down and I'll listen to it tomorrow and see.</v>

1059
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:09.294
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>

1060
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.740
<v Speaker 1>and almost every time I do that,</v>

1061
00:27:10.741 --> 00:27:11.670
<v Speaker 1>if I bounce it down,</v>

1062
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:12.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like dope.</v>

1063
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.240
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of this shit could be for someone else and not from me.</v>

1064
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

1065
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1066
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.630
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing about music too,</v>

1067
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:23.310
<v Speaker 1>it seems like when there's a song that I really like at any genre,</v>

1068
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 1>it's like a really like it,</v>

1069
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I like it at first and then I started really liking it.</v>

1070
00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:28.051
<v Speaker 1>When I keep hearing it,</v>

1071
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I hear it a bunch of times.</v>

1072
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Then as I'll hear it like the fourth or fifth time,</v>

1073
00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:32.750
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'll really get into it.</v>

1074
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting how music does that.</v>

1076
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:36.504
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>

1077
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 1>there's songs that you need to hear a bunch of times.</v>

1078
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.460
<v Speaker 1>That's why people don't like new shit.</v>

1079
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Like if the rolling stones go on tour,</v>

1080
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.510
<v Speaker 1>like they better play those fucking classics.</v>

1081
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to hear some weird shit even right.</v>

1083
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And Keith.</v>

1084
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:50.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's good.</v>

1086
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.970
<v Speaker 1>I learned,</v>

1087
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I learned the hard way.</v>
