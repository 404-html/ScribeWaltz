1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It really does bring to mind this incredible verse in the Bhagavad Gita where</v>

3
00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Krishna is revealing his true form to our June who's like the warrior figure.</v>

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.120
<v Speaker 1>this is Oppenheimer's quote,</v>

6
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.040
<v Speaker 1>this is Oppenheimer's quote.</v>

7
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.431
<v Speaker 1>When he did,</v>

8
00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 1>he said after the atomic bomb went off,</v>

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.780
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a quoted this part of the Bhagavad Gita where he said,</v>

10
00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I have become death,</v>

11
00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>the destroyer of worlds,</v>

12
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.100
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't stop there.</v>

13
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Krishna's sang to Argentina,</v>

14
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>something along the lines of,</v>

15
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>look in my teeth there you will see them,</v>

16
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>everyone on this battlefield because I'm eating them right now.</v>

17
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.150
<v Speaker 1>So this is like,</v>

18
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.691
<v Speaker 1>this is like Chris,</v>

19
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like,</v>

20
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.341
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

21
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:46.530
<v Speaker 1>you really want to see what I'm saying?</v>

22
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Cause they've just been friends hanging out and stuff and he like suddenly</v>

23
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>became the force of all destruction in the known universe.</v>

24
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.810
<v Speaker 1>And the point of the thing was,</v>

25
00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:56.644
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

26
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.200
<v Speaker 1>all of this is already chewed up.</v>

27
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>It's already been devoured.</v>

28
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Speaker 1>It's already gone.</v>

29
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Game over.</v>

30
00:01:04.091 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>

31
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.660
<v Speaker 1>No Kurzweil is going to get you new blood cells.</v>

32
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>It's going to keep this going to keep you alive at some point.</v>

33
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I will come to you wearing the costume of your death.</v>

34
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And that is an inevitability.</v>

35
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.110
<v Speaker 1>So just surrender to that and you're going to be a lot less freaked out if you</v>

36
00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>just accept that that's the way it is.</v>

37
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:26.791
<v Speaker 1>Because if your war that you're engaged in right now is the war to live forever.</v>

38
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>If you're a war that you're engaged in right now is a war to try to make some</v>

39
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>lasting change in a universe that's defined by impermanence and change,</v>

40
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.930
<v Speaker 1>then you're fighting the wrong war.</v>

41
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a better war to fight,</v>

42
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:40.534
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually the way you fight it is by surrendering,</v>

44
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:43.780
<v Speaker 1>not by fighting,</v>

45
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 1>by letting go and sinking into the actual hum of the universe,</v>

46
00:01:48.701 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 1>the way it really works,</v>

47
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:51.010
<v Speaker 1>not the way you wish it work,</v>

48
00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>not the way that you are hoping that the universe worked where uh,</v>

49
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:59.290
<v Speaker 1>lions and hyenas rescue little boys like air,</v>

51
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>like an ice age,</v>

52
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 1>but the cartoon.</v>

53
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>But the way it actually works,</v>

54
00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:07.090
<v Speaker 1>the way the university actually works as everything comes into existence,</v>

55
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>it exists for a little while and then it dies</v>

56
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 2>than most things come out of explosions,</v>

57
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 2>eh?</v>

58
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.491
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

59
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:15.181
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget that.</v>

60
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:15.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Most things come out of big fucking blast,</v>

62
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 2>including the whole universe itself.</v>

63
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

64
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

65
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Whole Universe itself is predicated upon a violent event.</v>

66
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

67
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 2>It has to have a violent event.</v>

68
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

69
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 2>That's big bang.</v>

70
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.400
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't be the slow expansion of beautiful life giving particles throughout</v>

71
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 2>the universe now,</v>

72
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

73
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a big fucking bang.</v>

74
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.971
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

75
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>it was a big fucking bang and it keeps it,</v>

76
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>it keeps going.</v>

77
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 1>The big bank keeps going and is,</v>

78
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like this,</v>

79
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

80
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.470
<v Speaker 1>If you want to dig your heels in and sync your claws into the expanding universe</v>

81
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>and try to keep that fucking thing from expanding,</v>

82
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get ripped apart.</v>

83
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way it works.</v>

84
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to let go and merge into the thing,</v>

85
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>if you want to allow yourself the fantasy that you're not some individual with a</v>

86
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>social security number and a name and parents,</v>

87
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.790
<v Speaker 1>but allow yourself the fantasy that you're 13.8 billion years old and you're</v>

88
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.951
<v Speaker 1>part of this incredible ocean of happening instead of just this one individual,</v>

89
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and just let yourself experience that for a second.</v>

90
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>The glorious knowledge that you are a never ending,</v>

91
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.050
<v Speaker 1>ever changing flow of matter that's temporarily manifested with the ability to</v>

92
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>express love and do a dimension where things are supposed to be cooling off,</v>

93
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>then that's a fun way to spend your time here before you end up getting eaten by</v>

94
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>a lion or have a heart attack or whatever happens.</v>

95
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just a backflip.</v>

96
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.753
<v Speaker 1>This is uh,</v>

97
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>this is like a high dot.</v>

98
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>This is like when you see people come off of a high dive and you get like a few</v>

99
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.251
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

100
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just some cool fucking tricks.</v>

101
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what you get here.</v>

102
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:56.341
<v Speaker 1>We're like dolphins jumping out of the eternal and we into time and while we</v>

103
00:03:56.491 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>were shoot up into time,</v>

104
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>we get a chance to do a couple of back flips,</v>

105
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>a couple of Chirps,</v>

106
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's our life's work.</v>

107
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>And then we plunged back into infinity again.</v>

108
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Do it all over again.</v>

109
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're creating characters for fiction and the idea that you can't</v>

110
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:11.790
<v Speaker 2>create a con,</v>

111
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.970
<v Speaker 2>you know you can't make a slot.</v>

112
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.340
<v Speaker 2>You can't make a girl who's all fucked up in the head.</v>

113
00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:16.621
<v Speaker 2>Well they,</v>

114
00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:17.840
<v Speaker 2>they exist in life.</v>

115
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

116
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.730
<v Speaker 2>And if you're making fiction,</v>

117
00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:23.420
<v Speaker 2>your fiction doesn't necessarily have to represent anything other than what's in</v>

118
00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:24.080
<v Speaker 2>your head.</v>

119
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.060
<v Speaker 2>What's the wacky story you're trying to get out?</v>

120
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.700
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any obligation to use a certain amount of Asians.</v>

121
00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.550
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any obligation to use a certain amount of white people or black</v>

122
00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:32.150
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

123
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Your obligation is to make something cool up,</v>

124
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.840
<v Speaker 2>make it up,</v>

125
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.673
<v Speaker 2>pull it out of your head.</v>

126
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.573
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

127
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.650
<v Speaker 2>people are worried about entertainment like that.</v>

128
00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:40.340
<v Speaker 2>That's a very,</v>

129
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.360
<v Speaker 2>that one I was religious.</v>

130
00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:42.194
<v Speaker 2>That was our,</v>

131
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

132
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Jehovah's Witness Dude,</v>

133
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:46.800
<v Speaker 2>like every fucking thing I watched like smart,</v>

134
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.060
<v Speaker 2>like a smurfs was off limits for some fucking bullshit reason.</v>

135
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.331
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

136
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.650
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't let you watch the SMURFS.</v>

137
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:52.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

138
00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:52.551
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

139
00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:53.390
<v Speaker 2>so what it really,</v>

140
00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:53.811
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

141
00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where there's some demonic thing with that and it's all these</v>

142
00:04:56.931 --> 00:04:57.351
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

143
00:04:57.351 --> 00:04:57.621
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

144
00:04:57.621 --> 00:04:57.731
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

145
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 2>I remember the Simpsons,</v>

146
00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.810
<v Speaker 2>somebody came in and gave a talk,</v>

147
00:04:59.811 --> 00:05:00.770
<v Speaker 2>brother Tucker,</v>

148
00:05:00.771 --> 00:05:01.604
<v Speaker 2>his name was,</v>

149
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.061
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

150
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:03.980
<v Speaker 2>the traveling overseer was his title.</v>

151
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

152
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.110
<v Speaker 2>And he would come and like give talks in the congregate.</v>

153
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I was in meetings like three nights a week.</v>

154
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 2>So he gave this whole fucking talk about all the shit that,</v>

155
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 2>like how Iti was bad because he,</v>

156
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:15.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

157
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.600
<v Speaker 2>because he healed the boy and you're like,</v>

158
00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:17.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

159
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.970
<v Speaker 2>who do we know is the only person who can heal?</v>

160
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Like I might start believing ut is the real Jesus.</v>

161
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.153
<v Speaker 2>That's the fear.</v>

162
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 2>And then the Simpsons had rebellion against authority with bar and disrespect of</v>

163
00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:31.790
<v Speaker 2>like your elders.</v>

164
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.950
<v Speaker 2>So that's something I could hear the mother's,</v>

165
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.401
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

166
00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like my kid.</v>

167
00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Watch it.</v>

168
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I could hear them chattering after that.</v>

169
00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what this shit is now.</v>

170
00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:40.334
<v Speaker 2>It's like what is,</v>

171
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.610
<v Speaker 2>what's the representation?</v>

172
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not propaganda.</v>

173
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.280
<v Speaker 2>So Shit,</v>

174
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.113
<v Speaker 2>just candy.</v>

175
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.720
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

176
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 2>So we were talking about this before the podcast to,</v>

177
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 2>do you think that some like overtly upset PC people that what they're doing is</v>

178
00:05:53.961 --> 00:05:58.961
<v Speaker 2>almost like a form of like protecting almost like a form of fighting against</v>

179
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 2>blasphemy that like I remember it goes to my church,</v>

180
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I remember all of them that were like,</v>

181
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:08.040
<v Speaker 2>oh well you something like every logistical one,</v>

182
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 2>that same behavior.</v>

183
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 2>I believe that 100% I think you're right.</v>

184
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 2>You is the exact same thing.</v>

185
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:13.724
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

186
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.361
<v Speaker 2>I don't even listen.</v>

187
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.194
<v Speaker 2>I don't even mind them.</v>

188
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 2>As long as you are trying to get me fired,</v>

189
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't it,</v>

190
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 2>you can say whatever you know.</v>

191
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to criticize,</v>

192
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against criticism.</v>

193
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

194
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

195
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

196
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Just do I have to be fired?</v>

197
00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Just can we not do that part of it?</v>

198
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.331
<v Speaker 2>Well that,</v>

199
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:26.550
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

200
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 2>that is where you find out like exactly what kind of people they are.</v>

201
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Like what exactly are they trying to accomplish?</v>

202
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Are they trying to engage in discourse with a reasonable person?</v>

203
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 2>You're reasonable guy,</v>

204
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 2>you'll have conversations with people,</v>

205
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 2>but that's the thing they want you instantly labeled as an unreasonable person</v>

206
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 2>who's not to be debated.</v>

207
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.931
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

208
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't even have to bring it up.</v>

209
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 2>You should just know what the right thing is to do.</v>

210
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Remember the Anti Seinfeld Seinfeld,</v>

211
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Chris Rock said the same thing,</v>

212
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.081
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

213
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:54.914
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

214
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 2>But he's allowed to.</v>

215
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

216
00:06:56.961 --> 00:07:00.050
<v Speaker 2>That was not an in Seinfeld comes down and it's like,</v>

217
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.261
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

218
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 2>he's irrelevant and an old man something,</v>

219
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.823
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

220
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 2>that's like saying someone's fat.</v>

221
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

222
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the difference in that common him.</v>

223
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.701
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

224
00:07:08.701 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

225
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's diffusing his,</v>

226
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 2>his argument and what he's saying is,</v>

227
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:12.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:07:12.511 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 2>what Jerry Seinfeld was saying was that the colleges are too PC and they'll call</v>

229
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 2>you on everything with his daughter of these days.</v>

230
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know what the fuck these words mean and what constitutes that.</v>

231
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

232
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly right.</v>

233
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

234
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that PC ruins comedy.</v>

235
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Like people who are funny are still funny.</v>

236
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 2>It kind of fucks up audiences.</v>

237
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

238
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 2>So we both,</v>

239
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I have the same goals,</v>

240
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 2>one of these PC Beulah.</v>

241
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 2>I think people should be more sensitive to each other and all that shit I do as</v>

242
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

243
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.540
<v Speaker 2>But their system is not going to create that.</v>

244
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to create fucking people that shut down at buzzwords.</v>

245
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

246
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.950
<v Speaker 2>So that's not helping.</v>

247
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.863
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

248
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
