<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even matter.</v>

18
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>The point is the Lakers suck.</v>

19
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well the hell's fan.</v>

21
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker 1>We made it stuck around for the first time in history.</v>

22
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Look at New Orleans Pelicans.</v>

23
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>How did you get to be a fan of the,</v>

24
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>because they started in North Carolina when I was there.</v>

25
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Then they moved and then they change your goddamn name.</v>

26
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.001
<v Speaker 1>It's all a mass,</v>

29
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Don't go.</v>

30
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>The wife of the guy who owns it,</v>

31
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>he owns a good franchise as a fucking billionaire.</v>

32
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Smart Guy who makes up the fucking living for himself and he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You want to name the team?</v>

36
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Then all of these men have to fucking support.</v>

37
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.493
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

38
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.431
<v Speaker 1>Is that really what happened?</v>

39
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened to your variant.</v>

40
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>

41
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:09.624
<v Speaker 1>Very upset.</v>

42
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>What would you have called that if you were attracting</v>

43
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the bath mats?</v>

44
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a better fucking name than the Pelicans.</v>

45
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I had to research all the time,</v>

46
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>but like vicious Pelican behavior so I could get behind a little bit.</v>

47
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>They are vicious though.</v>

48
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Belly ducks hole.</v>

49
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>They'll eat ducks hole.</v>

50
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>They'll go down there.</v>

51
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>It's going to go fuck off.</v>

52
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I could watch that.</v>

53
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

54
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:29.994
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

55
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we're going to watch hip Pelican eats a duck,</v>

56
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>but no one thinks of that.</v>

57
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>When you think of a Pelican,</v>

58
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

59
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>You think of like a cute thing that brings babies.</v>

60
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:38.604
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.663
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

63
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

64
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.023
<v Speaker 1>Back that up.</v>

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

70
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

71
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>they're just trying to drive them off.</v>

72
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>The other ducks mad like,</v>

73
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.100
<v Speaker 1>give me back.</v>

75
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.933
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

76
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.501
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's down.</v>

78
00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.401
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

79
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>he's just swamped to stop.</v>

80
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>One more time.</v>

81
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Let me see that again.</v>
