00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.640
<v Speaker 1>What's hard for people to grasp is that you don't know what's next.</v>

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.721
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>

4
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:07.441
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>

5
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>It freaks people out.</v>

6
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.713
<v Speaker 1>So they seek,</v>

7
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>they seek help with pills and booze and bullshit and bad relationships and drama</v>

8
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>at work and all this nonsense that you just filling up your stupid head with</v>

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.200
<v Speaker 1>just to distract herself from this ultimate fascinating existence that we find</v>

10
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in where we,</v>

11
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea what's coming next.</v>

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what's going on right now anywhere except what's right in front of</v>

13
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:31.801
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

14
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>And even then the wheels of perception,</v>

15
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.871
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

16
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

17
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.590
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

18
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>the ebb and flow depending on what chemicals even deuced into your body,</v>

19
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he smoked a joint or ate a mushroom or you know,</v>

20
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot going on here.</v>

21
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not just as simple as this flat consciousness that we all agree upon</v>

22
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not entirely sure that other people have the same experience that I</v>

23
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

24
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>When I look at like some country music and I look at like some TV shows and I</v>

25
00:00:59.221 --> 00:00:59.851
<v Speaker 1>looked at some,</v>

26
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even say country music,</v>

27
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pop music.</v>

28
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I actually probably like more country music now than I even like hot music.</v>

29
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>We spent some good times in a country.</v>

30
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big Dwight Yoakam fan and I,</v>

31
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I like my dog's named Johnny Cash.</v>

32
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean I like some country music,</v>

33
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>but there's some really stupid shit out there.</v>

34
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Why is it,</v>

35
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>is it because they're dumber than me or they see in a different reality is</v>

36
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:21.751
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

37
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Just like your nose.</v>

38
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Your nose is a nose.</v>

39
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:24.781
<v Speaker 1>My nose,</v>

40
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:25.141
<v Speaker 1>his nose.</v>

41
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>But if my nose was on your face,</v>

42
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:27.211
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

43
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>what do you do different?</v>

44
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>You did something different and if you put your nose on my face you'd be like,</v>

45
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>does some on your nose looks different or something?</v>

46
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.251
<v Speaker 1>It would be,</v>

47
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>we both have a notes.</v>

48
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>It's very recognizable.</v>

49
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Neither one are distinct.</v>

50
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>There's does nothing.</v>

51
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 1>like w w we don't flatten boxers,</v>

53
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.073
<v Speaker 1>noses or anything.</v>

54
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>They're both pretty normal.</v>

55
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>But I know my nose and I know your nose and I know your nose is in my nose.</v>

56
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>How do I know that that's not like reality,</v>

57
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>that reality?</v>

58
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:52.254
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

59
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>What other people see?</v>

60
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>They're seeing it through a filter that makes things that suck come in at,</v>

61
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>come out the bit a better shape.</v>

62
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>They have a better smell to it.</v>

63
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Things that seems stupid to you,</v>

64
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.441
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

65
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>It all just fits right into this neuron and this,</v>

66
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>this uh,</v>

67
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.951
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

68
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:08.131
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>ability to interact with light,</v>

70
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>accepts this shape better than that shape for some strange with orange has</v>

71
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>always been my favorite color.</v>

72
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Are you seeing the same color?</v>

73
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:16.801
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

74
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Cause Ahrens such stupid.</v>

75
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>How do you like orange?</v>

76
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.131
<v Speaker 1>You want an orange car?</v>

77
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:20.964
<v Speaker 1>You fucking Weirdo.</v>

78
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.103
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

79
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean?</v>

80
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

81
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>why would you like orange?</v>

82
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.251
<v Speaker 1>Is it a,</v>

83
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

84
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>is it a taste thing or is it a taste thing and your world is different than</v>

85
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>mine?</v>

86
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're mentioning is really one of the key lessons that,</v>

87
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>but I'm mentioning his pot smoking nonsense.</v>

88
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:39.234
<v Speaker 1>I was just telling</v>

90
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 2>when I was on that,</v>

91
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 2>when I did my,</v>

92
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.440
<v Speaker 2>my last Iowasca trip in Peru and I had the vision of the Eagle and that was the</v>

93
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:52.120
<v Speaker 2>secret that he basically gave me is I'm flying along with this Condor Eagle and</v>

94
00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:53.230
<v Speaker 2>the Eagle says to me,</v>

95
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.540
<v Speaker 2>you want to know how to see better.</v>

97
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.050
<v Speaker 2>You see through everybody else's eyes and the there was that everybody has their</v>

98
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>own perception.</v>

99
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 2>And to really understand what you're going through,</v>

100
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 2>what they're going through and seeing,</v>

101
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>you have to see what they see through their lens of perception.</v>

102
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 2>And if you can do that,</v>

103
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 2>all a lot of this hate and a lot of this anger goes away.</v>

105
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.140
<v Speaker 2>What you feel instead can be maybe pity.</v>

106
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for this human look at the way the world appears to them.</v>

107
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Look at the way you know that person is so quick to anger,</v>

108
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 2>so quick to hate when really you know,</v>

109
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 2>they could look at the same situation with love and feel happiness.</v>

110
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 2>And so it shifts your,</v>

111
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 2>your kind of opinion on things,</v>

112
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 2>but no doubt about it.</v>

113
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 2>We look at things a different way and the recent studies on epigenetics will</v>

114
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.594
<v Speaker 2>show that,</v>

115
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 2>things you can change the way things appear,</v>

117
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 2>probably not only on a mental level but probably a genetic level based on your</v>

118
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 2>epigenetic manipulation of belief.</v>

119
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.091
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

120
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 2>and what you see.</v>

121
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.741
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

122
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

123
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Lipton's doing a lot of good research in that and that's a really exciting</v>

125
00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:58.661
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>

126
00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

127
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 2>just because you have a certain lens of perception doesn't mean that that can't</v>

128
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 2>change with your choices and with your belief.</v>

129
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>And that that change would help you.</v>

131
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.971
<v Speaker 1>We want to,</v>

132
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:13.170
<v Speaker 1>we want to hang onto the way we are so badly because we don't want to admit that</v>

133
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:15.600
<v Speaker 1>we were ever wrong if we'd met wherever wrong.</v>

134
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:18.510
<v Speaker 1>And then we have this reevaluation of the value of self.</v>

135
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Cause the value of self is very important.</v>

136
00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:23.070
<v Speaker 1>And one of the important things a lot of people have said,</v>

137
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.943
<v Speaker 1>they're right.</v>

138
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.930
<v Speaker 1>They want to be right.</v>

139
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.351
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

140
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:28.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times you get in an argument with someone and if a certain point in</v>

141
00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:29.251
<v Speaker 1>that you're like,</v>

142
00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:30.084
<v Speaker 1>why are we even,</v>

143
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.380
<v Speaker 1>why am I upset about this?</v>

144
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I have nothing to do with this lizard that lives in fucking the Komodo</v>

145
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:35.070
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>

146
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing to do with them.</v>

147
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.640
<v Speaker 1>But you're insisting that it lives all over the place.</v>

148
00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:39.211
<v Speaker 1>And I'm telling you,</v>

149
00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:41.370
<v Speaker 1>it only lives there and it's fucking zoos.</v>

150
00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:41.641
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

151
00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:42.630
<v Speaker 1>why is this even,</v>

152
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>why is this upsetting?</v>

153
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.390
<v Speaker 1>What is it about this?</v>

154
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>What's really going on here?</v>

155
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.241
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

156
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:48.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

157
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.230
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

158
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.430
<v Speaker 1>we develop patterns,</v>

159
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>and attachments.</v>

161
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

162
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 2>and attachments to your,</v>

163
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 2>attached to the persona of the guy who's right about random facts,</v>

164
00:04:58.001 --> 00:04:58.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 2>so when you're attached to that and it gets challenged,</v>

166
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 2>you identify with it,</v>

167
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:03.581
<v Speaker 2>that's part of you.</v>

168
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually threatening a piece of view,</v>

169
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:09.030
<v Speaker 2>which triggers the kind of fear mechanism.</v>

170
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.911
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

171
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>When you talked to someone in you,</v>

172
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm mean,</v>

173
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

174
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

175
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I would never say that I'm absolutely free of that.</v>

176
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

177
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not free of any human emotion or so,</v>

178
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

179
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

180
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty good at controlling that impulse.</v>

181
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>And I'm also pretty good at not being attached to ideas until I've like really</v>

182
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>extremely vetted them out and also vetted out the opposing idea.</v>

183
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>But I've had conversations with people where they'll say something and be like,</v>

184
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with this kid where he was talking about a psychedelic</v>

185
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and he disagreed that he was like very adamant,</v>

186
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:41.381
<v Speaker 1>very smart kid,</v>

187
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:41.831
<v Speaker 1>very young,</v>

188
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>probably like maybe 20.</v>

189
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking to me about how,</v>

190
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:44.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with turnips.</v>

192
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>We can as a stoned mushroom theory.</v>

193
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.281
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

194
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it's too simplistic.</v>

195
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:49.841
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

196
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>it ignores the fact that there's so many different strange things that are Uber</v>

197
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>complex all throughout the universe.</v>

198
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

199
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

200
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 1>why should we assume that human beings got this way because of one compound?</v>

201
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.321
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

202
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:01.154
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

203
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>The fuck do I know my,</v>

204
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know nothing about.</v>

205
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

206
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

207
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.001
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

208
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:05.181
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

209
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I can respect that.</v>

210
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.381
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

211
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:06.591
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

212
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:06.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

213
00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:06.971
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

214
00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>what did I do the research?</v>

215
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Am I,</v>

216
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

217
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good idea.</v>

218
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea is sound,</v>

219
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>because I think that chimps,</v>

220
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>obviously they think,</v>

221
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>and mushrooms make me think in a completely unique way.</v>

222
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if a chimp ate mushrooms,</v>

223
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably affect the way he thinks.</v>

224
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

225
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>it just seems to make sense to me.</v>

226
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:25.161
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>

227
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:25.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

228
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>we can see it.</v>

229
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

230
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:27.224
<v Speaker 1>you look at,</v>

231
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>you look at the pictures of the dolphins who are just doing that fucking the</v>

232
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>puffer fish toxin.</v>

233
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 1>They're going to the surface and looking at their reflection,</v>

234
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.351
<v Speaker 1>at that,</v>

236
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:37.184
<v Speaker 1>at that point,</v>

237
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 1>that has to be changing.</v>

238
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Some of the usual usual pattern is probably fine,</v>

239
00:06:41.971 --> 00:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Trish.</v>

240
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Trish,</v>

241
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>let's find fish.</v>

242
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

243
00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:44.140
<v Speaker 1>let's play.</v>

244
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

245
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>let's talk.</v>

246
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.401
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

247
00:06:45.401 --> 00:06:46.234
<v Speaker 1>Fix Your fucking,</v>

248
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden they stop all that and it quiets and they say,</v>

249
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

250
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.951
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>

251
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking dolphin.</v>

252
00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And then it's a different pathway that opens up and that's what happened to</v>

253
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>these monkeys to at a certain point or humanoids or whatever,</v>

254
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>what stage they were on.</v>

255
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>At certain point they're like,</v>

256
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

257
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
