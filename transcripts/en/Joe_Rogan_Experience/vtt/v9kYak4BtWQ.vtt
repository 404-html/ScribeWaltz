00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.610
<v Speaker 1>what's hard for people to grasp is that you don't know what's next.</v>

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.721
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>

4
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:07.441
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>

5
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>It freaks people out so they seek,</v>

6
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>seek help with pills and booze,</v>

7
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and bad relationships and drama at work and all this nonsense that you</v>

8
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>just filling up your stupid head with just to distract yourself from this</v>

9
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>ultimate fascinating existence that we find ourselves in where we see we have no</v>

10
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>idea what's coming next.</v>

11
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what's going on right now anywhere except what's right in front of</v>

12
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>us and even then the wheels of perception,</v>

13
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:34.871
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

14
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:35.170
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

15
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.560
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

16
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.150
<v Speaker 1>they eat ebb and flow depending on what chemicals even deuced into your body or</v>

17
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

18
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>He smoked a joint or ate a mushroom or you know,</v>

19
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot going on here.</v>

20
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not just as simple as this flat consciousness that we all agree upon</v>

21
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not entirely sure that other people have the same experience that I</v>

22
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

23
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 1>When I look at like some country music and I look at some TV shows and I look at</v>

24
00:00:59.581 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>

25
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even say country music,</v>

26
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pop music.</v>

27
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I actually probably more country music now than even like hot music,</v>

28
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.181
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>

29
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>good times in the country,</v>

30
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a big dwight Yoakam fan.</v>

31
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I like my dog's named Johnny cash.</v>

32
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I like some country music,</v>

33
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>but there's some really stupid shit out there.</v>

34
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Why is it?</v>

35
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Is it because they're dumber than me or are they seeing a different reality is</v>

36
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:21.751
<v Speaker 1>reality?</v>

37
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Just like your nose.</v>

38
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Your nose is a nose.</v>

39
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:24.761
<v Speaker 1>My nose,</v>

40
00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:25.141
<v Speaker 1>his nose,</v>

41
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>but if my nose was on your face,</v>

42
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:27.211
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

43
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>what do you do different?</v>

44
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>You did something different and if you put your nose on my face,</v>

45
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

46
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>do some gum on your nose.</v>

47
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Looks different or something.</v>

48
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>

49
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>We both have a notes.</v>

50
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>It's very recognizable.</v>

51
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Neither one are distinct.</v>

52
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>

53
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

55
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>w we don't flatten.</v>

56
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.241
<v Speaker 1>Boxers,</v>

57
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:43.074
<v Speaker 1>noses or anything.</v>

58
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>They're both pretty normal,</v>

59
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.880
<v Speaker 1>but I know my nose and I know your nose.</v>

60
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Your nose isn't my nose.</v>

61
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>How do I know the test?</v>

62
00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Not like reality.</v>

63
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>That reality.</v>

64
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:52.254
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

65
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>What other people see?</v>

66
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>They're seeing it through a filter that makes things that suck come in at,</v>

67
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.621
<v Speaker 1>come out there,</v>

68
00:01:58.621 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>but a better shape.</v>

69
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.980
<v Speaker 1>They have it as a better smell to it.</v>

70
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Things that seemed stupid to you,</v>

71
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.471
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

72
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>It all just fits right into this neuron and this,</v>

73
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

74
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.561
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:07.951
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

76
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:08.131
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>ability to interact with light,</v>

78
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>accepts this shape better than that shape for some strange with orange has</v>

79
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>always been my favorite color.</v>

80
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Or are you seeing the same color I am because aren't stupid?</v>

81
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>How do you like orange?</v>

82
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.131
<v Speaker 1>Want an orange car?</v>

83
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:20.964
<v Speaker 1>You fucking Weirdo.</v>

84
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean?</v>

85
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

86
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>why would you like orange?</v>

87
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Is it a,</v>

88
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

89
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>is it a taste thing or is it a taste thing and your world is different than</v>

90
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>mine?</v>

91
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're mentioning is really one of the key lessons.</v>

92
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>What I mentioned it his pot smoking nonsense</v>

93
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.320
<v Speaker 2>when I was on that,</v>

94
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.213
<v Speaker 2>when I did my,</v>

95
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.420
<v Speaker 2>my last Iowasca trip in Peru and I had the vision of the ego and that was the</v>

96
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:51.650
<v Speaker 2>secret that he basically gave me his up flying along with this condor eagle.</v>

97
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 2>And the Eagle says to me,</v>

98
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.520
<v Speaker 2>you want to know how to see better.</v>

100
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 2>You see through everybody else's eyes and the there was that everybody has their</v>

101
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 2>own perception and to really understand what you're going through,</v>

102
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 2>what they're going through and seeing.</v>

103
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>You have to see what they see through their lens of perception.</v>

104
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 2>And if you can do that,</v>

105
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 2>you know all a lot of this hate and a lot of this anger goes away.</v>

106
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.790
<v Speaker 2>What you feel instead can be maybe pity I feel bad for this human look at the</v>

107
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 2>way the world appears to them.</v>

108
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Look at the way you know that person is so quick to anger,</v>

109
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 2>so quick to hate when really they could look at the same situation with love and</v>

110
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:31.324
<v Speaker 2>feel happiness.</v>

111
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 2>And so it shifts your,</v>

112
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 2>your kind of opinion on things,</v>

113
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 2>but no doubt about it.</v>

114
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 2>We look at things a different way and the recent studies on epigenetics will</v>

115
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 2>show that you know things.</v>

116
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 2>You can change the way things appear,</v>

117
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 2>probably not only on a mental level,</v>

118
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:51.601
<v Speaker 2>but probably a genetic level based on your epigenetic manipulation of belief in</v>

119
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.150
<v Speaker 2>what you see and I think,</v>

120
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Lipton's doing a lot of good research in that and that's a really exciting</v>

122
00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:58.661
<v Speaker 2>field,</v>

123
00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

124
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 2>just because you have a certain lenses of perception doesn't mean that that</v>

125
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 2>can't change with your choices and with your belief.</v>

126
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

127
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:06.931
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

128
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:08.250
<v Speaker 1>that change would help you.</v>

129
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.000
<v Speaker 1>We want to,</v>

130
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 1>we want to hang on to the way we are so badly because we don't want to admit</v>

131
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:14.100
<v Speaker 1>that we were ever wrong.</v>

132
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.630
<v Speaker 1>If we met wherever wrong,</v>

133
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>then we have this reevaluation of the value of self because the value of self is</v>

134
00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:23.300
<v Speaker 1>very important and one of the important things a lot of people have at the</v>

135
00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:24.030
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

136
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.930
<v Speaker 1>they want to be right.</v>

137
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of times you get in an argument with someone and at a certain point</v>

138
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:29.251
<v Speaker 1>and that you're like,</v>

139
00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:30.084
<v Speaker 1>why are we even.</v>

140
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Why am I upset about this?</v>

141
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Like I have nothing to do with this lizard that lives in fucking the Komodo</v>

142
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:35.071
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>

143
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:35.904
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing to do with them,</v>

144
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.300
<v Speaker 1>but you're insisting that it lives all over the place and I'm telling you it</v>

145
00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:41.630
<v Speaker 1>only lives there and it's fucking zoos and like,</v>

146
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.600
<v Speaker 1>why is this even?</v>

147
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Why is this upsetting?</v>

148
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.390
<v Speaker 1>What is it about this?</v>

149
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>What's really going on here?</v>

150
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.533
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

151
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.430
<v Speaker 1>we develop patterns</v>

152
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>and attachments.</v>

153
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Attachments to your attached to the persona of the guy who's right about random</v>

154
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:58.001
<v Speaker 2>facts,</v>

155
00:04:58.001 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

156
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 2>so when you're attached to that and it gets challenged,</v>

157
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 2>you identify with it.</v>

158
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:03.581
<v Speaker 2>That's part of you.</v>

159
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually threatening a piece of view which triggers the kind of fear</v>

160
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 2>mechanism.</v>

161
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating when you talk to someone in you.</v>

162
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm mean I,</v>

163
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I would never say that I'm absolutely free of that.</v>

164
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not free of any human emotion,</v>

165
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

166
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty good at controlling that impulse and I'm also pretty good at not</v>

167
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>being attached to ideas until I've like really extremely vetted the mount and</v>

168
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>also vetted out the opposing idea.</v>

169
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>But I've had conversations with people where they'll say something and be like,</v>

170
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with this kid where he was talking about a psychedelic</v>

171
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and he disagreed that he was like very adamant,</v>

172
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:41.381
<v Speaker 1>very smart kid,</v>

173
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:41.831
<v Speaker 1>very young,</v>

174
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>probably like maybe 20.</v>

175
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.540
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking to me about how,</v>

176
00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:44.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with Terence Mckenna's stoned mushroom theory.</v>

178
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.281
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

179
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it's too simplistic.</v>

180
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:49.830
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

181
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>it ignores the fact that there's so many different strange things that are uber</v>

182
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>complex all throughout the universe.</v>

183
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

184
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

185
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 1>why should we assume that human beings got this way because of one compound?</v>

186
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.321
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

187
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

188
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>the fuck do I know I don't know nothing about.</v>

189
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

190
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

191
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

192
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.181
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

193
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.014
<v Speaker 1>I can respect that.</v>

194
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.381
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

195
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:06.601
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

196
00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

197
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.461
<v Speaker 1>what did I do?</v>

198
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:08.730
<v Speaker 1>The research am.</v>

199
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

200
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good idea.</v>

201
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:15.821
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea is sound because I think that chimps obviously they think and</v>

202
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms make me think in a completely unique way.</v>

203
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if a chimp ate mushrooms,</v>

204
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>it'll probably affect the way he thinks.</v>

205
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

206
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:24.580
<v Speaker 1>it just seems to make sense.</v>

207
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.161
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>

208
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:25.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

209
00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:26.151
<v Speaker 1>we can see it.</v>

210
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:26.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

211
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>you look at,</v>

212
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>you look at the pictures of the dolphins who are just doing that fucking the</v>

213
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>puffer fish toxin.</v>

214
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>They're going to the surface and looking at their reflection at that,</v>

215
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.213
<v Speaker 1>at that point.</v>

216
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 1>That has to be changing.</v>

217
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Some of the usual usual pattern is probably fine.</v>

218
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:42.711
<v Speaker 1>Fresh fine fish,</v>

219
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:43.544
<v Speaker 1>let's find fish.</v>

220
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

221
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.000
<v Speaker 1>let's talk.</v>

222
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.833
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

223
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden they stop all that and it quiets and they say,</v>

224
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

225
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:51.921
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>

226
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking dolphin.</v>

227
00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And then it's a different pathway that opens up and that's what happened in</v>

228
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 1>these monkeys to at a certain point,</v>

229
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>irb humanoids or whatever,</v>

230
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>what stage they were.</v>

231
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>On a certain point,</v>

232
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:06.490
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

233
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

234
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
