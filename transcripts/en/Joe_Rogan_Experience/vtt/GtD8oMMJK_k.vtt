00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.421
Gentlemen,

2
00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:05.421
Tait Fletcher and Andy's time otherwise known as Andy stumps 77 [inaudible] 76

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:11.350
75 74 although it's taken or was it all taking date?

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.820
I'm the only person on Twitter who put the year of my birth after their name.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.770
Spring Hall is pretty fancy,
but some guys just go with 69 that's standard.

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.040
I would bet if you search for it's AOL account,

7
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:26.350
it was a spike man 69 and it was a,

8
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.250
it was a guy I was living with at the time.
He's like,

9
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.780
well I've got this extra account and I'm like spike that.

10
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:35.520
I'm like what is this all about?
And I guess he like Shit,
chat rooms and stuff.

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.140
So that was it for a while until I was like,

12
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:41.850
I had to send a legitimate email and I'm like this can't be what I'm doing then

13
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:45.210
I to do business.
I smartly went to rather choke you out,

14
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.270
which looked even when I got into film stuff,

15
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:50.430
it looks super weird cause you have to send that to makeup,

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.420
wardrobe and everybody.
And then it was the end.

17
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:57.060
It was early in grappling so people didn't know really about fighting.

18
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:01.140
So you're a sex freak that just likes to choke me.
And I was like,
okay.

19
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.440
And then I got it.
It's funny that you did.

20
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.780
It would be a sex freak and not a violent person.

21
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.870
That just shows you what the circles you're traveling it and that's how small it

22
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:14.670
was.
Not Sexual at all.
I'm looking over at Tate,
he was like 300 pounds,
rip,
steal.

23
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:15.504
I'm like,

24
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.960
very few people associate choking with sex this and if you send it into a

25
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:25.830
wardrobe lady,
it's way better to have her think of you.
Okay.

26
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.790
In this way than that way though.
Right?
I prefer that.
So I just gave,

27
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.890
you know that kind of energy to it,
but then you put that vibe out anyway.
Thanks.

28
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.520
I a sex freak.
Crazy.

29
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.510
What's wrong with being a six free food free?
How come being a food freaks.

30
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:46.610
Okay with being a sex freak freak is a problem.
It's true.
I mean,

31
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.610
because the puritans,

32
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:50.460
they can justify food more and then people get mad if you're,

33
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.740
if you're sexually free.
Nobody's happy about that.

34
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:55.440
People get all weird about that man.
You know,

35
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.350
I've had Dr Chris Ryan on a bunch of times.
He's that guy that wrote that book,

36
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.520
that Guy,
man,
he's fantastic.
He's amazing.
He's,
his book's fantastic.

37
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.770
He's just a cool dude too.

38
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.060
But we always wind up talking about like this weird thing that people have with

39
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:12.330
people that enjoy pleasure,
like certain pleasure you're allowed to enjoy,

40
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:14.660
like you're allowed to go get a massage and go,
ah,

41
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.970
the best massage as fucking lady.
She knew how to dig in there and,
but you know,

42
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.270
you say that about getting your Dick Sucked,
right?

43
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.570
You're some sort of a piece of shit,
something wrong with you and yeah,

44
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.660
he's watching this.
You did he,
I had him on out too long ago.

45
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:29.000
You're talking about all the time.
Yeah,

46
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.830
I've had them on twice in the last couple of months and he's that he's another

47
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:35.200
guy that confirms everything that I'd heard about Spain like that.

48
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.870
That's the going,
if you were going to move,

49
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:41.700
so if you could only live in one place,
that that place is fantastic.
Yeah,

50
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:44.910
he loves it there,
man.
And He's been everywhere.
I mean,
when I met him,

51
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:48.240
he was living in Vancouver and he was in,

52
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.060
he's in Portland now and then he moved to La for a bit,

53
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:54.810
but he's been everywhere and he just says,
Barcelona's a spot.
That's dope.

54
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.110
But he knows how to live man.
That dude knows how to chill and he's free.

55
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.970
He's free of the constraints of,
of,

56
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.500
of social norms affecting him and hit him caring too much about what anybody

57
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:05.831
thinks.

58
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:09.400
He's probably outlived his parents and whomever that he might've been like.
He,

59
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:11.950
I'm a little embarrassed if they know I had a threesome or whatever.

60
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:15.740
You know what I mean?
People live under bondage of other people's opinions.

61
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.980
You just go on blast because he's exactly,
his jar flux is just empty.
Yeah.

62
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.390
I could just sit down some gay stuff.
He doesn't care.
He's like,

63
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.560
whenever I talked to you guys Dick,
or whatever saying he did,
I'm just saying,

64
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:28.480
you know,
fuck bro.
I didn't know he did some gay stuff.

65
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.013
It doesn't,

66
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.840
it doesn't have to smell really should clean these.

67
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.780
It's one thing that I do not like about these sponges.
I keep thinking I'm,

68
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.500
I'm using the same sponge all the time.
I'm spitting in this thing,

69
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.860
but there's a certain amount of that comes out of your mouth,

70
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:48.790
no matter what you do.

71
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.810
It's like how much Joey Diaz is probably putting it online or two into that had

72
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.870
to dry out,
but we don't do anything.

73
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.530
I think there's like a way to deal with this and we're not doing it.

74
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.130
We're not doing a damn.
At least I'll breeze it or something.

75
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.430
Jamie was telling me that he,
he replaces them all the time.
He's got a box or

76
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.640
come off these fucking things on these shores.
This is like,
Hey,
I made that.

77
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:16.000
I made it up.
I made it up.
They probably have a replacement,
right?

78
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.980
There's also cleaner.
I think we can get for it.
Stop it.
You can't,
he can't clean.

79
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:24.430
This allows you to take these outside to clean stuff that you sponges.

80
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.200
Do you know what you used to clean the sponge?
The garbage.

81
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.300
I mean it is a sponge,
right?
That's what these things are.
These are sponges.

82
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.420
The end game for cleaning.

83
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.040
I think it would a guy like Chris Ryan and the part of it is that he's like,

84
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:42.610
he celebrated for his openmindedness.
Yep.
So it's like,

85
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.550
it's not just something that he has but he doesn't have to hide anymore.

86
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.820
It's something that a,
he embraces cause other people go.
Thank you.

87
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.540
Finally finding the voice of reason.

88
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.400
Everybody agrees with it to that extent to a certain extent.

89
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.660
It's kind of like being a fighter.

90
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:58.140
I think in a way is where people are looking at and they're like,

91
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.660
I would've liked to have taken that chance.
I would've,

92
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.510
whenever you're doing anything that people are reticent to jump into and they
go,

93
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.790
man,
I would've liked to join the seals.

94
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:09.760
I would've liked to have done whatever the thing is in the window closed or

95
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:11.890
whatever happened.
They didn't have the courage to pull the trigger on it.

96
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.900
But then they see a guy like that and they're like,

97
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.650
he's expressing and manifesting in a way that I would like to be able to do,

98
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.100
but I just can't do it.
I'm caught up in all this other stuff.
Yeah,

99
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.730
people get stuck.
They get stuck in who they are and you know,

100
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:27.190
they have these ideas of what they would like to be and they just never,

101
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.310
they just never get after it.
They just never,
never hit the gas.

102
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.040
They just never get out of their lane.
They never,

103
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.120
that's a big problem with these huge about freedom man.
People,
people don't,

104
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.930
there's a great argument to be made that people don't want to be free.
You know,

105
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:45.040
we talk a lot about freedom,
but motherfuckers liked to have handcuffs on.

106
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.070
They'd like to have a wife that's basically like a game warden.
You know,

107
00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:52.430
it tells them what they can bag and when they can come home and you know what

108
00:05:52.431 --> 00:05:55.950
the up it's nighttime,
put the guns away.
I mean most people,

109
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.100
most people to be free would rather

110
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.060
<v 1>be polyamorous or something like that for sure.
Like,
yeah,</v>

111
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.700
that's how we live comfortably.
But they don't want their wife to do it,

112
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.520
but they don't want anybody to be hurt.
Yeah.

113
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.040
They don't want anybody getting feelings.
Hurt is a lot.
That's the downside.

114
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.090
People's feelings.
That's it.
That's what we walk around really.
You know,

115
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.150
if you're conscious and there's the guys that don't give a fuck.
But yeah.

116
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:20.060
And then there's also people that hold you captive with their feelings because

117
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:24.170
they're so fucking ultra sensitive.
Bye Bye.
Ah,

118
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.100
that's such train.

119
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.200
<v 2>It's hilarious.
The guy like you before this podcast,</v>

120
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.590
you're talking about Tate fighting like you could,
like,
I would never do that.

121
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.030
Never do.
But how could you say that when you were a seal?
I mean,
you,

122
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.010
you were involved in gun fights are in seal team six.

123
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.620
<v 1>I tell you this jumping knows what he's talking about.</v>

124
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.790
He's talking with his buddy John Wall born.
And then,
um,
with this guy that's a,

125
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.810
I don't know if he's a swat team leader,
but he's on the second one is watching,

126
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.930
right?
And,
and he's like,
he and Scott goes,

127
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.010
yeah.
You know,
uh,
and he's the Swat team guy.
He's like,
you know,

128
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:01.730
shooting my MP five or something like that.
And he looks over like disgusted,

129
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:06.530
like Vietnam called they want their guy,
what?
Come on,
what is that four?
And he's,

130
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:10.160
and he's like,
well no,
like target shooting.
And he says,
Oh okay fine.
He says,

131
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:10.971
cause I was walking in,

132
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:14.390
I hit a guy five times in the chest with that and he didn't even really fall

133
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:16.340
down and he went into the other room and everything.
He's like that.

134
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:19.070
And that's unacceptable as a weapon.
So the only way I'm,

135
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.360
and I'm looking at this and I'm like,

136
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.950
the only way he sees weapons is worthwhile is their stopping power of a human.

137
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.940
And then he's like,

138
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.560
you really got to hit a guy just under the eyes and just above the teeth.

139
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:32.210
And when you said above the teeth,
I was like,

140
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.640
that's some next level shit to had referenced.

141
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.590
<v 2>Sure.
Never forget it.
I'm a little bit and be five.</v>

142
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.930
I didn't say I shot anybody then be five because like I said,

143
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.050
I trained on him in the 90s and then realize that you know,

144
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:48.410
the turn of the century came so we can put the muskets and the MP fives away.

145
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.980
Wow.
And pickup some other fire number.
No,
I didn't never know.

146
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.440
Catapult still have stopping power.
That's true.
They do
super good.

147
00:07:57.441 --> 00:08:01.100
Bring him back.
I mean,
Gee,
imagine if somebody shot a catapult me,
I'd be like,

148
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.170
I'm out.
You know you're going to,

149
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:04.840
you're going to live another day like a flame thrower.

150
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.750
If you have a flame thrower blocking you when I like,

151
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.750
I'm not going to go into that.

152
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.580
When you were in the 90s and all the hairspray and everything,

153
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.130
all my money went into beauty products,
which most of us still does.
Honestly.

154
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.340
One of the darkest things that ever heard about warfare was in the Dan Carlin

155
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:25.790
hardcore history series about the Mongols.
We talked about Mongols lighting,

156
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.990
lighting bodies on fire and launching them with catapults onto the rooftops and

157
00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:34.460
these buildings,
because they had thatched roofs and human bodies,

158
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:37.490
they get their fatty,
you know,
and the light on fire.
Good.

159
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:42.410
And they stay lit and they use a bit,
but
it says a guy,

160
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.160
this is great.
Yeah,

161
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.040
so I heard it on a podcast and then I had a guy sitting next to me that also had

162
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:53.990
experience,
allegedly,
allegedly you need celery.
But I mean I think about it,

163
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:57.900
think about the,
the impact that that would have being on the receiving end.

164
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.130
You're like,
you fucking win.
Like you know,
if you want to,

165
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.500
all of a sudden your dad comes through the roof.
I mean,

166
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:06.810
I'm not going to say there's an argument to be made for doing that,

167
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:11.250
but what if you could do that once and not have to fight to more battles because

168
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.590
the people you want to fight against see that and they're like,
nope,

169
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.820
check you win.
That's the ethical argument for being ruthless,
right?

170
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.300
The ethical argument is if you could be ruthless in a in a short amount of time

171
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:25.740
and just absolutely stop all the bullshit that you will actually save lives.

172
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.980
Mitigate.
Just cut it.
Yeah.
They look at the atomic bomb,
right?

173
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:30.240
I mean that was the theory behind that.

174
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.630
We're just going to turn so many people in the glass that your country is going

175
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:35.280
to want to back away before it happens again.

176
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.840
Didn't they kill as many people with those atomic bombs as they did in like

177
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.490
years of rec?
Traditional warfare?
Sure.

178
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.560
<v 1>And then I read something too that Japan had already been orchestrating a piece</v>

179
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:47.720
and a settle

180
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.310
<v 2>that and they're like,
we're already out in line with this.</v>

181
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:51.144
We've got to try them out.

182
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.070
Like the little kids giddy for their Christmas present.

183
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.640
They wanted to see what would happen.
Knowing what I know about the u s military,

184
00:09:57.641 --> 00:10:00.240
I'd say there's likely some trans troops.

185
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.610
<v 1>She was talking to a friend of mine and he was saying also,</v>

186
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:05.370
he says they want an elongated war.
They don't want.
He's like,

187
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.630
he was a like a force recon guy and he said,
we'd go in and he says,
for example,

188
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:11.940
there's a house of bad guys,
we know the bad guys are there,

189
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.640
but we get stand down,
just relax.
And then I said,
why?
And he said,

190
00:10:16.641 --> 00:10:20.070
this is a modern day.
Yup.
He said,
because they want it to go longer.

191
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:23.520
And so then they'd send the regular marines around until they'd get blown up on

192
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:26.520
the road and then they'd blow up another one and they'd stretch it out for as

193
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:28.360
long as they could get public opinion of,

194
00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:31.470
of deaths and this and that before they would send guys in and they,

195
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:33.390
and he said that dates back though to Vietnam.

196
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.220
He said there's a hill that's a famous hill,

197
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:37.740
I forget the name of it that they retook 15 times.

198
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.630
<v 2>So yeah,
there's actually,
I think a couple of those,</v>

199
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:42.660
they made a movie out of one and pissed,
I can't think of the name,

200
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:44.160
but it's like six oh seven or something like that.

201
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:47.460
Hamburger Hill might've actually been in the movie,
but yeah,
I dunno man.
That

202
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.740
<v 1>once you get war gone,
man,
that's big money.</v>

203
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.140
And I mean now that we have a boogie man of terrorists,

204
00:10:52.141 --> 00:10:56.370
you can say that about anything really.
Yeah.
When you have the word terrorists,

205
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.030
that's

206
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.050
<v 2>to open ended thing.</v>

207
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.020
Cause it's not like there's a country with a leader and you'd take over the

208
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:02.700
leader and that's it.
You're done.

209
00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:05.550
And then I have to take the inspiration of the government.

210
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.000
It takes the expiration date off because then it's like,
well I don't know.
Yeah,

211
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.100
how long are we going to be there?
What if they move?

212
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.990
Cause then you know what I mean?
It becomes a chess game,

213
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:16.350
but you're not on a board anymore where the board just exponentially increased.

214
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.980
So how frustrating is that as a soldier?
I mean,
that's gotta be this,

215
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:25.220
it seems to me that like as a soldier you would want an obvious opponent where

216
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:29.520
once it's defeated,
you're done,
you have an objective,
the objective is reached.

217
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:30.420
Everybody can go home.

218
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:33.990
Like you remember that World War Two photo of the soldier that's kissing the

219
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:36.870
girl was at a sailor.
He's kissing the girl title the street.

220
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.900
And everybody's like,
yes,
it's over.

221
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:45.150
Our generation is then denied that we were denied that in Desert Storm.

222
00:11:45.151 --> 00:11:49.620
It's sort of happened because it happened.
It was like so quick.
It's just boom,

223
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:54.340
boom,
boom,
boom,
and he gave everybody this idea like,
well,
the way we do war today

224
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.890
<v 3>is wasn't that big a deal.
We lose a couple of people,</v>

225
00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:59.380
but basically we just go in there and we fuck everything up real quick and

226
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:02.020
everybody quit.
No,
not anymore.

227
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.620
Now that after that time it became this very murky thing.

228
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:07.060
It's not going to war with Iraq.

229
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.110
We're going to war with any country is going to war with Isis and they're all

230
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:15.550
over the place.
There are these,
these boogie men,
Ben,
before that,
al Qaeda.

231
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:16.480
And then before that she got,

232
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.590
and then it's the whole thing becomes a like a subterfuge and going,

233
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.980
well now we need to be intrinsically laden into these different governments

234
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.380
because they could be,
they're a little bit for ants and they're a little bit,

235
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.370
and then the military industrial complex just grows and grows and grows.

236
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.050
And we take,
I had the benefit though to answer your question because like,

237
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:39.430
I can't even describe the amount of respect that I have for like conventional

238
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:43.650
forces and the shit that is forced upon them given their job description.
I mean,

239
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.300
we could spend hours talking about and just like being in an impossible

240
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:48.760
situation and he's given more decisions to make,

241
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.310
not necessarily horrible decisions,
but they're,

242
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.650
they're trying to the best of the ability that they can,

243
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.260
but there's no time or money or equipment to continue sharpening the blade.

244
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.900
Right?
So they're,

245
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.030
they're large mechanized units or they got to walk around and they'd go out and

246
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:08.200
they're told to go own battlespace w you know,
and some of the battle is passive.

247
00:13:08.201 --> 00:13:09.670
And some of it's aggressive and it's just,

248
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.790
it's a job where the local people don't want you to be there.

249
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.820
You probably don't want to be there at Super Connecticut and they have to

250
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:18.940
fucking live there,
you know?
And they,
to them,

251
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.000
I don't know how you define victory to those forces.
For us,

252
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:25.570
I think we had a little bit of a benefit and it was less frustrating because it

253
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:30.430
was targeted.
I mean,
we would have a list,
a target list where,
you know,

254
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.960
uh,
like in Iraq in 2005 that we were on full,
like vampire schedule.

255
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:37.750
I'd sleep all day long,
get up right before the sun went down,

256
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.700
go ahead and workout,
hit dinner,

257
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:42.580
and I just go sit down in the office and you know,

258
00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:44.290
the cell phone network would crack on it.

259
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:48.380
It's just who you want to get for just rack and stack them.

260
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.930
So how does that work?
Like you,
you will,

261
00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:55.720
you say the cell phone network would go on?
Yeah.
You know,
uh,
a lot of this stuff,

262
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.930
a lot of the target Nate we would do would be electronic based.
You know,

263
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.540
it's no big Meta data like knowing where the phones are,

264
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.110
knowing where they want the ability to triangulate their location.

265
00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:07.690
It's the same way that your iPhone works.
You know what I mean?
You can,

266
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:11.170
if you turn on people who think that if you're carrying around an electronic

267
00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:14.320
device and there's not a way to track it,
like this is so open source too.

268
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:15.310
I mean it's,
you know,

269
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.070
people believe me that Kim conspiracy theorists could go nuts with this,

270
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:22.030
but with a buddy of mine,
his wife tracked him with a find my phone.
Totally.

271
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.460
I mean what's what and what's the difference?
Right.

272
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.630
It's going off the same thing.

273
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:28.290
So the phone is communicating with other satellite stuff.

274
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.720
So some phones will become active,
other phones wouldn't,
you know,

275
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:35.200
you could look at the lines of warfare that we were trying to go down and the

276
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:38.080
things that we were trying to affect and we're like,
cool.

277
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:42.130
That guy's number one on the list and it's role.
And for us when we roll.

278
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.470
Now when you decide who's number one on the list,

279
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:47.760
is that you guys as a group come together?

280
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.280
Is there a guy telling them this is more like kind of looking at the battlefield

281
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.290
and I made,
and the best analogy I could be with like a tree,
right?

282
00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:57.590
So the root of the tree,
so we'll go even bigger like bin Ladin Right.

283
00:14:57.591 --> 00:14:58.760
Like he's right at the base.

284
00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:01.490
Like we're trying to get there but all we can really see is a little branches

285
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:03.650
and all the out wedding stuff.
So we've got to work our way back.

286
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.370
So it'd be where they are in relationship to the branches and the leaves.

287
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:08.450
Like how close can we get,

288
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.100
cause it usually starts with a low level guy who you can roll up and you know it

289
00:15:12.101 --> 00:15:14.750
leads to another guy and it's just,
it's a compounding thing.

290
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:19.280
I mean really that is how as a,
as a,
as a team six guy,

291
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.480
like are you guys as that coming from on high or you guys decided no,

292
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.230
this is the guy that is closest to our objectives as a country.
Both.

293
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.880
It can be both.
A lot of the times,
uh,
like the target deck,
it's you still,

294
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:35.360
even overseas you work for like a battle space commander and they have

295
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:38.030
objectives that they're trying to get achieved in that battle space.

296
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.750
So you have to justify what you're going to do against what they're trying to do

297
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.651
right now.

298
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:45.380
But if there are certain high level individuals that like if that individual

299
00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:45.831
pops up,

300
00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:47.870
you're going to stop everything you're doing and you're going to go after him.

301
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:49.970
Like Zaas out here,
he was one of them in Iraq.

302
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.490
But you know when we would roll out like a magician is grades are hearing,

303
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.900
we'd roll out and I had a football sleeve on like Tom Brady did with a guy's

304
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:01.790
picture with stats,
you know,

305
00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:04.850
the picture was fucking completely inaccurate 99% of the time.

306
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:07.580
Sometimes we didn't have a picture,
she'll be an empty silhouette,

307
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.320
dark haired guy,
bigger than that silhouette.

308
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.490
So I have the droppings on it like a mustache or maybe this guy has to go,

309
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.100
I withdraw,
draw my own little target picture.

310
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:20.580
But so if the have the building it would have known associates.
So like I,

311
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.340
I had a much more defined end state so we would go and maybe he would be there

312
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.290
and maybe he wouldn't.
So it was,
you know what I mean?

313
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:31.670
Like at the end of the night you would be able to gauge success or failure to a

314
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:34.730
small degree as opposed to just occupying a battle space.

315
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.200
Is there ever a time when you got a guy and it wasn't that guy like,

316
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.700
and I know that never happens.

317
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.180
They look just like the picture that I drew on my arm,
but Lauren,

318
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.770
it's like the time to get the donuts guy or they'd be like,

319
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.180
his name is a boost Smith,

320
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:54.770
which means son of Smith and like everybody's fucking name and the city is a

321
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.450
Buddhist Smith.
So you roll the dude up and you get back and you're like,

322
00:16:56.451 --> 00:16:58.640
this is not,
you know,
these are not the droids you're looking for.

323
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:01.520
It happens all the time.
But this guy,
what had poor manners.

324
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.700
That's a big argument for Guantanamo Bay,
right?
That Guantanamo Bay,

325
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:07.850
there's a lot of people over there that were just guilt by association or they

326
00:17:07.851 --> 00:17:11.750
went to school in the wrong place and they attended the wrong meetings and they

327
00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:15.860
just got shackled up and putting some orange jumpsuits and stuffed into some

328
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:18.650
holes.
So what do you do with them now?
That's a good question.

329
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:19.920
Especially once you've had them there for,

330
00:17:19.921 --> 00:17:22.580
for shooting is cause they just released a guy.
Yeah he just,

331
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.810
cause we can go down the rabbit hole and this one,
this is a,

332
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.250
this is a tough portion of the question that I don't think people think about

333
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:28.790
like what do you,

334
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.590
what do you do with a guy who was guilty by association or not but got caught in

335
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:34.424
the net,

336
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.840
got sent to a place like Guantanamo or other detention facilities around the

337
00:17:38.841 --> 00:17:42.950
world became radicalized and you know,
if you let him out,

338
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.850
he,
he,
if he was in this room,
he would try to kill all three of us right now.

339
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.220
And you know that.
But he hasn't actually done anything yet because

340
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.730
<v 2>he was put in there by action,
by accident,
by association.
Do you let the guy out?</v>

341
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.500
It's a true,
we'll do you,

342
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.680
I mean it's a very tricky situation depending on what your objectives are.

343
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.160
Are you,
is your objective justice or here's your objective,

344
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.390
making sure that you keep people safe.
Justice [inaudible] yours,

345
00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.450
yours,
but you're saying I'm good but you're not in the military.

346
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:12.800
I had him go Tate and also America's,
you say let them go though.

347
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.100
If he is innocent for sure.
We turn it on.
Sorry,

348
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:19.470
I'm saying he was innocent when he got there.
For sure.

349
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:22.920
We've turned everybody that isn't.
If I'm in one tunnel Bay for 14 years,

350
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.870
I'm for sure going to have some feelings.
You're,
you're,

351
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.230
you're going to be totally on the other side,

352
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.930
but correct not for sure until I do that.
Yeah.

353
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:32.880
I mean ethically you have to turn them.

354
00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:38.460
Typically you have to at the very least wait for something bad watching them.

355
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.390
I might have a sniper attributed to that guy.
Oh,
stop it.
Oh,
for what?

356
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:45.780
The fucking 10 yards.
He walks to a vehicle and then disappears into the network.

357
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:48.750
I mean,
what,
okay man,
come on.
Whatever the thing is.

358
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.550
But the thing is is I can't based on like,
I think that he's going to do this.

359
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:56.220
Like if we don't live that way,
so then say he does,

360
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.070
so let's say it not a nine 11 scenario,

361
00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:01.680
but say he becomes the guy who goes to France and starts hacking boots with a

362
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:04.700
machete and you knowingly let them go because you believe in justice.
Yup.

363
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.450
Who's responsible for that happening?

364
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.660
The guy that hacked him up with the machete.
But you're the [inaudible] isn't it?

365
00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:13.080
But it wasn't also the people that turned him into that is really responsible

366
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:16.500
parties.
You want to run it up the top of the chain,
then it's Dick Cheney,

367
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.970
then it's guys that put him there.
That's guys that didn't,

368
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.500
it's Obama that didn't let them out.
That's a real problem.

369
00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:25.770
I mean that's been a problem since the beginning of time.
It's a rabbit hole,
man.

370
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.360
You can go down and around and around.
Well what at the end of the line,

371
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.430
it's you guys,
you guys are the tip of the spear.
What is the attitude?
Yeah.

372
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.470
What do you think amongst like seal team six,

373
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:42.471
like how do they feel about these guys that were inaccurately portrayed or

374
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.560
inaccurately assessed and then wound up being stuffed into these hell holes for

375
00:19:49.231 --> 00:19:53.520
years,
tortured,
beaten.
Who knows what the fuck they're doing to those guys?
Look,

376
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:58.140
we know what happened,
uh,
with those photos that got leaked for what?

377
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.260
I mean,
what the fuck,
man?
It's just a little naked,

378
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:04.850
pure and some dogs and whatever,

379
00:20:04.851 --> 00:20:08.760
like chemical waterboarding and all this stuff.
Those guys,
I mean,

380
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.450
we know about all that,
right?
So I don't really speak for myself,
you know,

381
00:20:12.451 --> 00:20:17.070
I can't speak for the military,
anybody else,
but you know,
to me it's a very,

382
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:20.250
very simple decision.
Um,
I'd fucking kill him.

383
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.040
He would kill him because you would think that they would go out and I would

384
00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:27.890
rather err on the side of killing somebody who hasn't done anything than allows

385
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:31.230
somebody to go out there and perpetuate violence and somebody else straight

386
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:35.640
across the board.
So you don't think that someone who hasn't done violence,

387
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:37.560
who has been locked up against their will,

388
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:39.180
you don't think that they deserve a shot.

389
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:42.840
You don't think that they deserve like an opportunity to prove that they're not

390
00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:45.660
radicalized or radicalized like that.

391
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.280
It's know you just killed Mandela,

392
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.410
<v 3>right.
And his Mandela,
Nelson Mandela,
Gandhi,</v>

393
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.610
like anybody.
You know what I mean?

394
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:58.060
It's like those guys also are in that kind of a position.
It's a good point.

395
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.240
It is a good point.
And like I said,
I can only speak for myself,

396
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:04.050
and this is probably why I'm not in the position of making policy and I don't

397
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.903
control,

398
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.560
but you're also a guy who has to make split second decisions to save your life

399
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:11.290
and the life of all the people you love and care for because they're all around

400
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:13.030
you and they're all in,
in the firefight.

401
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.090
I've seen what these radical people can do,
like firsthand,

402
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.320
like there's what people think that these people will do and then there's the

403
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.950
lowest form of gnarly shit.

404
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:27.160
Not even the way that the things that they'd done against the u s but like some

405
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:30.400
of the things that I've seen of how they treat each other in their countries and

406
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:34.420
these super radicalized areas that are hard to get into.
Like,
I mean it's just,

407
00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:36.310
I don't even know how to describe it.
It's for instance,

408
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:40.840
give me chaining Mongolian like inbred kids to fucking beds and leaving them in

409
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:41.231
rooms.

410
00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:46.231
Like in just the way that they'll treat women or like I'd be like,

411
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.830
I entered a room and I didn't even recognize what the the being was and it was

412
00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:54.940
fucking chained to a floor in a room that I went into because it was just

413
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.700
ingrained NBA inbred and they'd go in and know that,

414
00:21:57.701 --> 00:22:01.750
smack it around and throw it some food and like if you're willing to do that to

415
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:05.230
a human being,
like you don't get a second chance for me.

416
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.910
How often is this taking place?
I mean,

417
00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:09.980
how many people are treating inbreds like this is this like,

418
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.150
I mean that's just an easy scenario that I can come back to.

419
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.400
You know what I mean?
Because that one was like seared into my head.

420
00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:17.860
I'm just like,
what in the hell?
You know what I mean?
But you know,

421
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.290
look at what's going on.
If you're a homosexual over in,

422
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.830
uh,
any isis cereals,

423
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.890
it's thrown you off a fucking roof to the top floor and they're chucking people.

424
00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.720
Or here's a better one.
Sex Slaves,
really 12,
13 year olds,
sex slaves.

425
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:39.190
Like come on.
Like those are the only people doing that or the radical ones,

426
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:43.000
you know what I mean?
Like I don't have a problem with and Alabama.
Well,
yeah,

427
00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:46.320
but here's the thing,
radicals and Alabama scare the shit out of me too.
Right?

428
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.780
I don't mind moderates across the board.
Like you can be a Catholic,

429
00:22:49.781 --> 00:22:50.770
you can be a Christian.

430
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.230
I don't care if you're Muslim and you're praying in the corner.

431
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.500
I prefer you not detonate yourself afterwards.
Right.
But I'm okay with it.

432
00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.760
So I got to,
I want to say,
come in.

433
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.990
Where I come from is like I say what I say,

434
00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:06.400
but like I've sure I would have a different view walking in your shoes and,

435
00:23:06.401 --> 00:23:10.930
but that,
yeah,
so it's,
it's the radicals that once you get to that level,

436
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.561
first off,

437
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:15.700
like if you're weak enough to have your mind changed like that and you can't

438
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:20.410
stand for the morals that you know to be true.
Like it's a problem.

439
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.220
Well there's one thing changed and is one thing developed in that environment is

440
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:28.000
a big difference between someone who's changed and another,
when people,

441
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.090
people imitate their atmosphere.
And if that's all you know,

442
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:32.260
and that's the world you know,

443
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.190
and you think that Islam is the truth and you think that the Quran is the

444
00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:40.000
doctrine that you have to follow and the 72 virgins awaiting you in heaven,

445
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.800
then sex slaves are permitted.

446
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.580
Then there's all sorts of things that are [inaudible] that you know,

447
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.420
we would of as being horrific that are totally permitted.
It's,
it's,
it's,

448
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.160
it's societal standards and culture is a,
is a big part of this.

449
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.300
The way people decide what's acceptable,
what's not acceptable.

450
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.780
So to these people.
I think for us growing up in America,

451
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.470
it's almost impossible to understand what it would be like to be living in.

452
00:24:03.471 --> 00:24:06.710
Like one of the most radicalized parts of the world can understand the radical

453
00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:07.071
behavior,

454
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:10.850
which is why I have no problem saying that a guy who went and did nothing but

455
00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:12.660
became radicalized.
Like to me that's,

456
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:17.270
that's a wrote mathematical equation right there.
Like it's a,

457
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.760
you know,
it's a hard one because you know,

458
00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:22.250
people still say to this day and age like,
you know,
you shouldn't,

459
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:24.230
you shouldn't kill,
right.
We need to,

460
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.940
the counterinsurgency strategy is based off of winning the hearts of minds of

461
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:31.760
the people that were going in,
into the countries that we're going into.

462
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.690
And I think the only way that I can describe it that makes sense to people,

463
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:39.980
but it might at least allow them to think outside of the education aspect.

464
00:24:39.981 --> 00:24:43.370
Is that,
and you Kinda,
you,
you alluded to the point a little bit,

465
00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:46.820
but I mean you have daughters,
right?
Do you love your daughters?
Yeah.

466
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.820
Like how much though?
Like articulate for me how much you love.

467
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:54.821
It's impossible for anybody to ever express it in a way that someone who doesn't

468
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:57.960
have daughters would ever understand,
or sons or children.
Totally.
And,

469
00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.450
and so love is a good analogy because if you can understand how hard it is to

470
00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:03.440
articulate that,

471
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.040
then you understand that there's another side of that coin and that there's a

472
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:12.041
community of people somewhere in earth that hates you to the exact same degree

473
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:16.160
that you love your children and can't articulate and would do everything they

474
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:18.140
fucking can to end our way of life.

475
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.550
Because we let women go outside and have their skin exposed.

476
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.280
You can say what you want,
you can think what you want.

477
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.740
And what's the solution to solve that?
It's not books.

478
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.700
There's not as a single,
I could,
I could put you in captivity for 14 years,

479
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:37.670
Joe and I could never convince you not to live your daughters.
Right?

480
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.060
There's this,
it's not our job to change.
But what I'm saying,
hold on,
let me,

481
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.650
so what I'm saying is though,
is that people think that there's this,

482
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.010
they're just like,
oh,

483
00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:48.950
you don't have to go over there and you don't have to fight.
Well,
fuck that.

484
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.740
At some point you have to stand up for what you believe in.
Right.

485
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:56.450
And when it comes to those people that hate you as much as you love your kids,

486
00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.920
again,
there's a small segment of that that you could probably turn with books in

487
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:01.880
captivity,
right?

488
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.790
Which is what's happening to the guys who get radicalized and get mo,

489
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.180
but for the other segment that would like nothing more than to end your life and

490
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:12.810
everything you believe in.
What's the solution?
It's not fucking books.
Yeah.

491
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:17.180
What is the solution to try to turn a guy around once they've reached that
level?

492
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.980
Can't radicalization he can't.

493
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.820
So you either have to find something or believe in something to the point that

494
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:25.550
you're willing to fight for it because here's the deal.
We're x people.

495
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.270
And then there's why people in regardless of what your exes,
your Christian,

496
00:26:29.271 --> 00:26:31.580
Catholic,
whatever your next person,
there's somebody who's a white person,

497
00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:32.840
x and y people are going to fight.

498
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:38.390
If you believe in what you believe enough then to protect that at some point

499
00:26:38.391 --> 00:26:40.700
you're going to have to go beyond the educational aspect of that.

500
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:44.400
But isn't that only the case in a place like a radicalized

501
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.620
<v 2>part of the world?
It's not really the case in America.</v>

502
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:50.430
In America we have people here.
Well they are but what are they doing?

503
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:52.110
They're not doing anything.
You know what I'm saying?

504
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:55.270
Like and maybe it's out of fear and maybe it's out of being outnumbered.

505
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.540
Maybe it's out of the ideal of the people,

506
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.540
but in America if you believe some wacky shit,

507
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:03.750
like if you're a Mooney or whatever the fuck you are,
we like,
yeah,

508
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:07.380
he's poor bastard.
He's out there giving money to l Ron Hubbard who gives a fuck.

509
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.660
You know what I'm saying?
But we'd let it go.

510
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:12.900
I believe that your craziest anything for believing in whatever it is.

511
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.700
I'm not out there trying to change your mind,

512
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.240
but if you look in your neighbor's window,
say if you and you have a daughter,

513
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:20.310
if you looked in your neighbor's window,
you start your neighbor,

514
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:25.490
but putting on a fucking bomb vest and a kneeling towards the east and praying

515
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:27.930
and you had a rifle,

516
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.600
tell me you wouldn't want to put one in his brain right there.
If you,

517
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:33.840
if you that this guy get a check calendar for us to be Halloween.

518
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.990
So let's not jump to conclusions.
I mean Fuck Joe,
I'm not saying murder Jesus,

519
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.910
right?
I understand that you need to come back again.
It's this coffee,

520
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:46.500
it's this fucking caveman coffee.
It's very,
very excitable.
And again,

521
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:48.870
this is a rabbit hole topic to me is the rabbit hole.

522
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.050
You can go round and round and round because people just don't want to say,
yes,

523
00:27:52.051 --> 00:27:56.310
you should kill that person and
I don't,
I'm not,

524
00:27:56.311 --> 00:28:00.300
I have zero problem.
Get up on this thing with end and people like that.

525
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.680
But where do you draw the line and like peop people like it because,

526
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.190
because you can talk all kinds of shit to me.
You can yell at me,

527
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:11.940
you can do all kinds of stuff to me until you come and you grab my girlfriend
or,

528
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.060
or shoved my mom or something like that.
You're safe.
Yeah.

529
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.340
As soon as you cross the line you're fuck yeah,
but don't.
Well,

530
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.730
when you hear someone talking crazy shit though,

531
00:28:20.731 --> 00:28:23.490
you escalate and you put it in them in a category like,

532
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:24.660
oh you give him might be a problem.

533
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.230
Now when you have a whole country filled of you might be a problem.

534
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.390
That's when things get real weird.
Right?

535
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.540
But then the problem is how do they get to be that.
Right.

536
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.630
And that's the one of the big issues with the United States,
foreign policy,

537
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.230
military intervention,
military,
industrial complex.

538
00:28:39.231 --> 00:28:42.540
It keeps fucking with all these different parts of the world and puts good

539
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:46.170
soldiers and good people in jeopardy.
But I for that you'll get,

540
00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:47.370
you'll never get an argument from me.

541
00:28:47.371 --> 00:28:50.850
You'd be amazed at how many people in the military don't necessarily agree with

542
00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:53.550
the foreign policy United States of America.
That's what I was going to ask them.

543
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.560
I know I've talked to them,
I've had emails from them.

544
00:28:55.561 --> 00:28:59.070
I mean I've had a million of those guys and don't think,
don't get me wrong,

545
00:28:59.071 --> 00:29:03.570
like it's after I spent the large majority of my adult life in the military and

546
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:07.860
I disagreed with a fucking large volume of stuff and where I could push back and

547
00:29:07.861 --> 00:29:10.200
impact that I did and other times when I couldn't.

548
00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:12.030
It's like what can you do though?

549
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:15.480
It could say if you're over there and you're always responsible for your

550
00:29:15.481 --> 00:29:19.080
personal actions,
right?
So you know it at the end of the day,

551
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.360
most people don't know in Afghanistan up in the [inaudible] valley,

552
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.810
which is like inaccessible and my sheer of fucking reindeer,

553
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.490
or have a c h 47 and you can go up there,
you know,
like you could ask somebody,

554
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.620
hey,
where's the Sama been loud?
And then I'll be like,
who's this been?

555
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.820
You know what I mean?
There's so detached.

556
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.100
So in those environments or any time that

557
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.040
<v 4>you're actually interfacing with those people or those cultures,</v>

558
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:47.440
like they're looking at you as the United States of America.

559
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.830
So I can at least conduct myself in a manner that is commensurate with the moral

560
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:54.460
values that I have,

561
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:57.700
regardless of my thoughts about the foreign policy of the company or the
country.

562
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.760
You know,
that I'm over there to represent company.
You could say company.

563
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:03.290
That's right.
Well,
don't think there's a lot of money,
but there's a lot,

564
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.350
believe me,
there's a lot of money made off the military.

565
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.070
That's all the in war for.
I mean,
people think it's to go turn the hearts and,

566
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.170
and,
and plant democracy and all that,

567
00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:14.320
but it's only for money and to feed the military industrial complex.

568
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:18.520
There is one down the road with you on that a little bit,
but like not,

569
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:21.890
that's not the only reason that you would think is culpable for one ton animal

570
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:23.920
bay,
uh,
terrorist being made.
I mean,

571
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:28.780
who do you think is culpable for going in and attacking sovereign countries?
Uh,

572
00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:33.360
for oil under the auspices that we're going to find.
So you know,
push,

573
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.140
push back on it a little because there are parts of the world where people

574
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:41.890
become a threat and you have to figure out at what point in time do you step in

575
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.520
and allow these people to get nuclear weapons and do what we did to Japan.

576
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:49.180
Do you allow these people to get to book?
It wouldn't take much.

577
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:53.360
I mean one of the things if you read about history is empires fall all the time.

578
00:30:53.361 --> 00:30:57.780
I always have and we are an empire.
Sure.
You know,
whether we were adjust empire,

579
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.660
not his fucking completely debatable,
but there's,

580
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:05.020
if we fell do it'd be a vacuum and it would be filled.

581
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.190
It's a matter of who would fill it and if you can have something like Isis in

582
00:31:09.191 --> 00:31:13.750
2015 if you can have,
like we saw what happened in Libya was overthrown.

583
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:17.850
We saw the tech dynamic chaos that's going on right now in Iraq.
I mean,

584
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:22.450
they're having a fucking Muslim holy war between the Sunni and the Shia right

585
00:31:22.451 --> 00:31:25.790
now,
2015 godly levels that I guarantee you that,

586
00:31:25.791 --> 00:31:30.280
that the modern day media is like sneaking the 1% of the truth on the ground.

587
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:35.050
Those those guys are fucking insane.
Yeah,
that's,
so this is going on right now.

588
00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:39.700
And we assumed that because the United States of America is the dominant

589
00:31:39.701 --> 00:31:41.290
superpower in the world because we have so much,

590
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.630
and the way we look at things is different.

591
00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:46.120
If you walk through the streets of New York and Los Angeles,

592
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:47.410
you're relatively safe,

593
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:50.330
much more safe than any human being has ever been in any other time.

594
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.790
We assume that this is static.
This is going to stay this way,
but not,

595
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:59.050
not as if there's a bomb.
So it's like that everywhere else.
But yes,
you're right.

596
00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.880
That's a very good point.
That's a very good point.

597
00:32:00.881 --> 00:32:04.990
And that's what sort of dictates our ideas about how the rest of the world

598
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:07.360
should and shouldn't behave or how we shouldn't,

599
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:10.420
shouldn't interface with the rest of the world.
But if some shit went down,

600
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.920
fucking nuclear bomb gets dropped in Chicago.
Oh yeah.
Levels the city,
uh,

601
00:32:14.921 --> 00:32:18.910
the infrastructure gets crushed.
The power grid goes down for a couple of weeks.

602
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.120
Chaos,
starvation,
and then an army attacks,
you know,

603
00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:26.500
whether it's the army attacking with fucking drones or satellites or who knows

604
00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:31.150
what the fuck could happen,
right.
But a significantly diminished armed forces,

605
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.350
significantly diminished country.
The whole world could fucking change overnight,

606
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.160
overnight,
overnight.
A natural disaster.
Yellowstone blows,

607
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.430
whole world changes over night.
And we're living like the Mongols.
I mean that,

608
00:32:42.431 --> 00:32:45.920
that literally could happen inside of a year,
inside of a year,

609
00:32:45.921 --> 00:32:48.650
a whole world to do a total one 80.
Yup.

610
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.870
So the United States armed forces or any armed forces that is in a position of

611
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:56.740
power that has a,
a moral,

612
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:02.630
a moral and ethical imperative.
If they're looking at people like isis,

613
00:33:02.631 --> 00:33:04.910
they're looking at,
regardless of how they were created,

614
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:08.360
regardless of whether or not these guys were formed in Guantanamo Bay against

615
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:12.740
her will,
you got to figure like,
what,
what's the end game here and how do we,

616
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.450
how do we engineer the future?

617
00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:19.290
<v 1>But do we have a moral and ethical,
uh,
government or,
or military,
I mean in,</v>

618
00:33:19.291 --> 00:33:23.040
in those ways it's like,
or is it chasing greed?
I mean,
at the,
at the,

619
00:33:23.041 --> 00:33:24.810
at that point,
I,
I look at it and I go,

620
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.830
is our best course then to go out and eradicate people or is it to change our

621
00:33:28.831 --> 00:33:33.750
foreign policy?
And,
and to not be kind of,
um,
bullish in the world?

622
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:34.701
<v 4>It's a good question,</v>

623
00:33:34.701 --> 00:33:38.150
but you kind of got to deal with what the table is right now in 2015

624
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.590
<v 3>Norwood's like at your doorstep.
But I think there's truth to what,</v>

625
00:33:41.591 --> 00:33:45.660
what do you feel?
Yeah,
I think there's,
well,
I'm not in it anymore.
Uh,

626
00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.170
I think there's truth to both.
I liked like Joe Sam,
like if,

627
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.440
if the pizza guy's ringing your doorbell,
you know,

628
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:57.450
you might want to go handle that,
but at the same time,
you know it,

629
00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.020
you need to go and think about,

630
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.500
I personally believe you need to think about the things that is causing and

631
00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:06.460
shaping the world.
Like,
let's draw isis back.
Where did it come from?

632
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.240
<v 5>Okay.</v>

633
00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.190
<v 3>Well it didn't,
we build them to fight Syria.</v>

634
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.440
I wouldn't say we built him to fight Syria,

635
00:34:13.441 --> 00:34:15.150
but like let's take it back to nine 11 right?

636
00:34:15.151 --> 00:34:18.540
Like why did we go to Afghanistan in the first place?
Why did we go to Iraq?

637
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.730
Right.
Go to Saudi Arabia First Party.
What's it?
Yeah.

638
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.440
So as far as Afghanistan though,

639
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:27.520
like you want to talk about something that I think,
you know,

640
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.260
they definitely were,
it was a,
it was a,
not a breeding ground,

641
00:34:31.261 --> 00:34:36.261
but it was a place where people felt safe to go and train to do harm to the

642
00:34:36.631 --> 00:34:37.464
United States.

643
00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:42.640
So going there to push that out of Afghanistan I think was a solid move.
Right,

644
00:34:42.641 --> 00:34:44.190
right.
But you know,

645
00:34:44.191 --> 00:34:49.050
you fast forward 14 years and I think we largely self created the problem,

646
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.260
right?
Because we occupied,
we push them out

647
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:54.303
<v 5>now</v>

648
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.160
<v 3>they're like fuck you.
And then they learn just like we do.</v>

649
00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.080
Like it's an amazing game of chess.
It's just like,
the only difference is,

650
00:35:00.081 --> 00:35:02.380
is like playing chess and a drying machine and it's on.

651
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.260
So the board is constantly shifting and you got to keep track of all your
pieces.

652
00:35:05.261 --> 00:35:08.260
So we went in and invade,
we push out.
Uh,

653
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.500
now they know they're not safe in Afghanistan and they know it's no longer safe

654
00:35:11.501 --> 00:35:13.990
to,
you know,
cohabitate in one area.
So what do they do?

655
00:35:13.991 --> 00:35:17.180
They disaggregate and then they get Iraq and Afghanistan.

656
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:20.290
Then they dis-aggregate,
you know,
and all the other areas around the world,

657
00:35:20.291 --> 00:35:21.760
they start communicating with the Internet.

658
00:35:21.761 --> 00:35:26.380
So we actually made the problem exponentially harder for ourselves with the best

659
00:35:26.381 --> 00:35:29.080
of intentions or did we have the intention to make it harder?

660
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:31.020
<v 4>Obviously you can choose,</v>

661
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:36.420
you can choose any of the that I think people are opportunists and this is like

662
00:35:36.421 --> 00:35:38.310
the argument nine 11 being an inside

663
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.140
<v 2>job,
right?
I think it's much,</v>

664
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.730
much more likely there was incompetence and then that people capitalize on an

665
00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:47.430
opportunity to do something they've always wanted to do.

666
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:52.110
You know that I've Afghanistan and you know that Dick Cheney and Bush had been

667
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:55.200
talking about going into Iraq and trying to form a strategy.

668
00:35:55.201 --> 00:35:58.860
If you're going to Iraq for a long time,
nine 11 comes around and they're like,

669
00:35:58.861 --> 00:35:59.930
look,
we got it.
Here's our,

670
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:04.860
here's our reason that the idea that that was all orchestrated is a very

671
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:09.090
convoluted idea and I don't necessarily think the facts support it.

672
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.940
I think the facts,
if you look at human history,

673
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.720
it's way more likely that you're dealing with massive and competence.

674
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.940
Then you're dealing with a massive conspiracy.

675
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.620
What do you think about Arab spring?

676
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:22.590
You ever see Wesley Clark General Wesley Clark?
Yeah.
Fascinating.

677
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:23.840
Well I think that's it.

678
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:28.050
I think he's 100% being honest and accurate about that when he's talking about

679
00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:30.390
all the different plans and the strategies of inventing all these different

680
00:36:30.391 --> 00:36:33.480
places.
But I think that when something like nine 11 comes around,

681
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:37.470
it's a green light for these assholes.
And before this happened,

682
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.470
I think they were just,
they just didn't have a real way to do it.

683
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.450
I think you've got both is what I'm trying to say.

684
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.780
I think you've got both in competence and then you've got people like Dick

685
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.600
Cheney that are clear chicken hawks and was fucking,

686
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.840
I mean you can't be any more transparent than the guy that's running a company

687
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.040
that rebuild shit after we blow it up and then decides to go blow shit up.

688
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.950
I think there's actually a lot of uh,

689
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.130
supporting documentation to like there being a lot of the chicken hawk stuff,

690
00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:04.920
people just standing by like they want to do stuff and they're waiting for the

691
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:08.150
impetus where it's going to be.
The society would be like,
yes.
They'll be like,

692
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.780
be like,
yes.
Okay,
you can go do this.

693
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.140
Because in a lot of that stuff and a lot of that,
you know,
the,

694
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:17.490
the military machine and,
and once it's,
the cart has left the barn,

695
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.790
is it tough fucker to get back in the barn.
So they had definitely had plans,

696
00:37:20.791 --> 00:37:24.600
like there was preexisting plans for the invasion of Saudi and even for Oif,

697
00:37:24.601 --> 00:37:29.040
you know what I mean?
It's,
it definitely existed.
Lf Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Okay.

698
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.280
OEF is Afghanistan.
They since changed the names to,
I don't know what it is,

699
00:37:32.281 --> 00:37:37.281
but I think it's both like nine 11 is it possible that that was a convincing

700
00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.880
conspiracy?
Sure.
Is it plausible?
I don't think so.

701
00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.520
I believe exactly.

702
00:37:44.521 --> 00:37:47.700
You do the gross in competence because I go through the airport all the time and

703
00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:49.500
I see the people who are screening meet this day.

704
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:53.040
And I know for a fact that it was gross in competence because the guy's fucking

705
00:37:53.041 --> 00:37:56.580
drooling looking at the little monitor coming by,
you know what I mean?

706
00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:00.180
Is My bag goes through.
So I think it was a combination of the two,

707
00:38:00.181 --> 00:38:05.100
but I don't know.
I mean,
I think that you're confusing.
I don't know.

708
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:09.870
I'm not gonna say,
I think you're confusing politicians with the military.
Right?

709
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.570
You might be surprised at how little,

710
00:38:12.571 --> 00:38:16.980
I think most politicians have any effect over the military themselves.

711
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.800
I don't think they have a lot of effect over the government either.

712
00:38:19.801 --> 00:38:22.560
I think that the,
no,
they don't.
Right.
And I,

713
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:27.561
and I'm certainly pro military to 1000% think that people get tricked and they

714
00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:29.870
get put in an impossible situation possible to it.

715
00:38:29.871 --> 00:38:33.460
You can only be 100% of anything can be 1000% tape take,

716
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.610
10% doesn't exist Tate.
So Tate's king for a day.

717
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.820
Like I was going to ask you about that.
What was your,
what's your first move?

718
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.760
You're king for a day.
You got 24 hours to set a policy in place.

719
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.550
It's going to last for for 12 months.
You've got 24 hours of time.
Sure it is.

720
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.170
I'm gonna need a couple of weeks.
You have to,
once you fly,

721
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:51.910
you need to grow the mushrooms Obama had,

722
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.880
I need to figure out how to get them to the Middle East.

723
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.340
I need some time and just,
yeah,

724
00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:00.460
I need to figure out a way to starve these people to get them to eat mushrooms.

725
00:39:00.461 --> 00:39:03.340
I'm going to get them covered in chocolate or camel or whatever the fuck they

726
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:04.900
eat.
But it's a tough question,
right?

727
00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:07.840
Because everybody will sit back and they'll tell you how it's fucked up.

728
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.420
But like,
all right,
right.
What would you do?
What did you do?
What would you do?

729
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.240
Well,
I think you got to destabilized corporations and,
and that kind of

730
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:18.430
anarchy talk from a guy who drives a Toyota.

731
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:21.890
What's the fuck are you going to ride a camel to work around?

732
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.360
Did you stabilize and corporations change Tesla,

733
00:39:25.361 --> 00:39:28.130
you looking at anything like that?
Mother,
the fuck is a corporation.

734
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.650
But the idea that it's different if you have a corporation with,
uh,

735
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:37.660
unabashed drive for profit,
you're in a bad place.
And that's where we are.

736
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:41.000
Well,
that's what's wrong with our country for sure.
Yeah.
Well,

737
00:39:41.001 --> 00:39:44.630
when you have unlimited growth and that's you,
that's your motto.
Yeah,

738
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.750
that is a real issue.
That's a real issue because of Bart and tonic,

739
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:49.570
just behind your corporation.
That's different.

740
00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:53.770
But right now we have politicians that are simply a shadow of corporations with

741
00:39:53.771 --> 00:39:58.030
is also,
is also a problem that when a corporation does something fucked up,

742
00:39:58.031 --> 00:40:00.820
the people inside the corporation aren't held responsible.

743
00:40:00.821 --> 00:40:05.230
Like individuals do have a diffusion of responsibility.
Well you guys,
you know,

744
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.450
cause you're not a bad guy.
You're not a bad guy.
I'm not a bad guy.

745
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.870
We're all just pushing her pen this way,
in that way.
Right?

746
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.810
So you can do a certain number of,
okay,
like let's look at caveman coffee.

747
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.490
Caveman coffee is a small company,
right?
Well,

748
00:40:16.491 --> 00:40:19.900
what if caveman coffee grows to be something like Folgers and Maxwell House and

749
00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:22.750
we find out that you,
you guys are chatting people,
right?

750
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:27.730
But how does that happen?
How does a company like Halliburton come about?

751
00:40:27.731 --> 00:40:32.500
How did,
how does it get from an idea to a few employees read an Ego,
right?

752
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.980
I CAS greed is a big one.
And then the business model is a big one,
right?

753
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.360
And then the ability to justify and rationalize fucked up decisions,
right?

754
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.100
The diffusion of responsibility that comes from a large group acting in a fucked

755
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:48.850
up way.
Yup.
Yeah,
exactly.
So let me ask you this,

756
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:53.050
because as a decorated veteran who's seen combat,

757
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.480
what if in hindsight is of course 2020 not,

758
00:40:56.481 --> 00:40:58.300
not criticizing any decision that had been made,

759
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:03.630
but if you saw not what you've seen and you see nine 11 happened today,

760
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.400
what's the move?
What do you do?
Do you invade Iraq?
You know,

761
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.820
I am guilty of personally believing the spin that was on the Iraq war.

762
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:20.390
You know what I mean?
It's a,
you'd be believe it currently or you believe that?

763
00:41:20.391 --> 00:41:22.720
I believed it at the time.
You know what I mean?
Everybody did.

764
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:26.740
Colin Powell was on TV so credible and my dad would be like,

765
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:30.880
he was at this hurt your dad.
My Dad is a Vietnam vet.
He'd be like,
no,
this is,

766
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:34.160
this is fucked.
This has got all your dad thought

767
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.560
<v 3>that he did.
He,
what did he think?
What was his name?
He was just like,
no,</v>

768
00:41:36.561 --> 00:41:38.390
this is bullshit.
We have no business going in there.

769
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:39.560
There's two aren't connected.
Right.

770
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:42.560
Cause they tried to tie then know Kate is from Afghanistan to Iraq.

771
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:47.270
And I would argue with them,
you know,
and,
and,
and I believe it.

772
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.650
I mean the first target we hit in Iraq was the number one chem bio target in

773
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:55.420
that country.
And it was a fucking agricultural school.

774
00:41:55.421 --> 00:41:57.610
It was growing tomato plants.
Wow.

775
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:03.020
So was that just bad intelligence?
You know,

776
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:06.270
we looked at that target for a couple of weeks.
We had schematics,

777
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.290
we had experts on air conditioning coming and telling us,
you know,
like,

778
00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:11.690
look at this,
look at all the air conditioning that they have.
It's like,

779
00:42:11.691 --> 00:42:14.330
it's for the ventilation system.
And now in hindsight,
I'm like,

780
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.740
it's really hot there in the summer.
That's probably why they had all that.

781
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:22.640
It gets like 140 fucking degrees in the shade,
you know,
and then like,
oh,

782
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:25.610
but look,
you know,
there's this tube that comes out twice a year.
It was,

783
00:42:25.611 --> 00:42:30.530
which is to the greenhouse,
you know?
Uh,
so I mean,

784
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:33.770
not only did I believe it,
but we were pursuing it as,
you know,

785
00:42:33.771 --> 00:42:37.490
we were going after chem bio stuff.
Now,
in hindsight,

786
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.080
uh,
I don't think I would have myself personally if I,
you know,
if I was,

787
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.990
I thought I was king for the day,
I wouldn't have invaded either.

788
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.090
If I could use modern day technology.

789
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:50.360
And this is still what I think I personally would do today is I would pull back

790
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:54.950
all the US forces in Afghanistan and the ones that are in near Iraq and instead

791
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:56.240
of occupying,

792
00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.800
which has been proven to be ineffective time and time and time again.

793
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.270
I mean it creates enemies.
Oh my God.

794
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:05.990
Well just ineffective but effective in creating enemies.
You know,

795
00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:09.110
it's like look at the Russians death by a thousand paper cuts,
right?

796
00:43:09.111 --> 00:43:12.980
Way Worse than a blow to the head that ends it initially.
So I would,

797
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:16.250
I would pull that out and not go down that road and I would go very,

798
00:43:16.251 --> 00:43:18.680
very surgically and I would,

799
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.310
I would develop the intelligence,
uh,

800
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:24.770
to be certain of the people that were looking for.
You know,

801
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:26.490
you got to leverage the assets and in,

802
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.790
so sometimes you might be wrong with the surgical strikes,

803
00:43:28.791 --> 00:43:31.190
but I'm okay with that.
But I would go surgically as,

804
00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:35.510
as opposed to occupying and I would leverage all the resources to do it that way

805
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.690
as opposed to putting an infrastructure in place that cost billions of dollars

806
00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:43.160
to support.
Cause you're a goddamn American.
Andy's done last time I'm back.
Yes.

807
00:43:43.161 --> 00:43:46.640
I was not like these cock suckers that put us into this.
God Damn.

808
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:51.660
And that's the American surface.
But I got,
I'm [inaudible] Sam 15 yeah,

809
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.070
exactly.
I'm looking at this in the rear view mirror and I was just as guilty.

810
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:58.820
I'm like fucking God dammit of some a bin Ladin is in Baghdad.
I'm like,

811
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:01.400
that's like that's where everybody thought he was.
Not at all.

812
00:44:01.401 --> 00:44:02.990
But you know what I mean.
They made the connection,

813
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:06.260
they made the connection that al Qaeda has a loose connection.

814
00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:11.320
But you know,
again it's fuck hindsight's 2020 but again,

815
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.630
you just can't occupy.
You cannot occupy cause it doesn't work.

816
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:15.980
Now do you believe that?
Like,

817
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.860
so when you say go in and you kind of change policies and your,

818
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:22.610
you're working assets that are there,
you get more assets.
If you're judicious,

819
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.560
right?
You get more assets.
Do you believe?

820
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.860
Do you believe in a universal justice and harmony and that way of like if

821
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:30.770
America is behaving in a proper and appropriate way in the world,
yeah.

822
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:32.070
There's to be radical assholes

823
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.120
<v 2>that are here and there and whatever,</v>

824
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.280
but there's going to be assets within those countries that are going,

825
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.450
this is working for righteousness for all people.
Is that a thing?

826
00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:40.261
I don't it to be,

827
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:43.650
I don't think that the scales would balance in that regard because you're

828
00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:47.310
talking about the difference between rational thought and irrational thought and

829
00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:49.680
irrational people.
Just take it too far.
You know what I mean?

830
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:53.070
You got to pound on one side and then an irrational guys got two pounds,

831
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.400
so you could have a million people,
you know,

832
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.730
rationally thinking or nine people with fucking box cutters,

833
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.460
irrationally thinking and you can look at,
you know,
what happens,
you know?
I mean,

834
00:45:02.461 --> 00:45:06.300
did scale is just don't,
they don't balance themselves the way human nature is.

835
00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.560
As you always look at it,
it's all,
you only vote for what you don't like.

836
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:12.640
You don't really vote for what you liked them.
You know?
It's like,

837
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.170
that's Kinda how we're cut in a way.
Well,

838
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:17.520
it's easier to point out things that are mistakes and it's easier for me to

839
00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:20.920
articulate bad leadership and be like,
good leaders should be like,

840
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.560
what is it that he's doing?
How difficult is it to,

841
00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:29.370
to try to formulate correct intelligence about a country in the other side of

842
00:45:29.371 --> 00:45:32.310
the planet and what are you doing to get,

843
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:34.180
that's one of the things that's always gotten me like what are they using the

844
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.120
using satellite imagery,
the of your knowledge and everything.

845
00:45:37.121 --> 00:45:42.121
Each of the architectural schematics of the buildings we try CIA guys on.

846
00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:44.280
They're not very accurate.
I mean,

847
00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:49.500
what can you do to try to figure out what they're doing?
Like,
you know,

848
00:45:49.501 --> 00:45:52.530
I had this conversation with someone about Isis,
like yeah,

849
00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:54.600
we need to just go over there and take care of that.
I'm like,
what are you,

850
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:57.630
what are you saying?
Like where are they?
Yeah,
exactly.
So go ahead.
To me a,

851
00:45:57.631 --> 00:45:59.130
draw me a map of where this,

852
00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:02.850
this isis that you'd like to have taken care of is and when you realize it's

853
00:46:02.851 --> 00:46:06.480
populated across multiple countries and they communicate over an electronic

854
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:09.210
medium that we can't control and they don't get together cause they understand

855
00:46:09.211 --> 00:46:11.940
what happens when they do get together and they communicate through fucking

856
00:46:11.941 --> 00:46:13.830
photographs that you could send on Instagram.

857
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.550
They could send a photograph on Instagram or on Youtube that can send a video

858
00:46:17.551 --> 00:46:21.900
and have metadata in that photo that you have to eat.
They have to take it.

859
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.180
Then they send it through a filter and they figured out what you're trying to

860
00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:26.840
say.
Well you could send them a picture in an email,
hey man,

861
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.030
just chill in here and fucking Canoga park eating a sub,

862
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:31.590
you know and have you with a smile.

863
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:35.880
The meatball sub and there's metadata in that they can transcribe and then they

864
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:37.440
figure out what the fucking messages,

865
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:41.520
I mean that that was a lot of how they were communicating back and forth was

866
00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:45.330
with encrypted data is almost like,
uh,

867
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.560
like gang is con savagery there.

868
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:52.880
5,000 guys are going in and turning 50 thought a city of 50,000 away and they're

869
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:56.300
running before they get there.
Oh yeah.
Those,
those guys can find,

870
00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.940
they put dudes in cages with a trail of gas and we designed them on fire like

871
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:04.200
damn dude.
Like that's,
and they filmed it in slow motion.
Yeah.

872
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.330
I mean they like to use high tech equipment.

873
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.300
That's the other thing is that they have access to equipment and in the high

874
00:47:09.301 --> 00:47:14.020
tech technology that,
you know,
technology has reached,

875
00:47:14.021 --> 00:47:18.690
this is such an incredible level that the average person has access to some

876
00:47:18.691 --> 00:47:20.370
pretty fucking significant shit.

877
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:24.600
And if you're an evil person on the other side of the planet,

878
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.620
you can keep track of a lot of stuff going on.
Mean drones.

879
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.540
Fucking anybody can buy a drone now,
right?

880
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.940
You could have drones up in the air with video cameras and the guys are good at.

881
00:47:33.941 --> 00:47:37.120
Um,
yeah,
I mean you could do,
they operate on cell phones.
You know,

882
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.570
they have drones now that work on virtual reality headsets.
I've,
I've used them.

883
00:47:40.571 --> 00:47:43.870
You put a virtual reality headset on and you have a drone flying around and he's

884
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.220
fucking see everything.
Yeah.

885
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:50.500
I mean there's so much that we can do now as like regular consumers.

886
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:53.890
You've got to imagine what the amount of money that a group like isis has.

887
00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.110
I mean,
they'd been stealing money for a long time.

888
00:47:56.111 --> 00:47:57.970
Now they have fucking billions of dollars.

889
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:02.380
And that's why I think occupation doesn't work.
I mean it's,
it may be,
you know,

890
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:05.920
maybe have a presence at a base nearby so you can have a staging point.

891
00:48:05.921 --> 00:48:09.940
But I think we're,
I think that everything has changed from,

892
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.450
I don't think you're going to see these mature battle areas anymore.

893
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:16.530
He made me mature areas of war because it's all gonna be surgical.

894
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:18.100
At least I hope because that,
again,
that's,

895
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.720
that's the direction that I would go with it.

896
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:24.721
I mean it's lower risk than exposing a large force over a truncated time period.

897
00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:31.140
And isn't there also a big issue right now with our drawn out sort of cold war

898
00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:36.280
battle being brought back to life.
We've got a real issue now with Russia,
right?

899
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:40.830
I mean this,
this whole Putin thing,
it seems,
it seems like there's a,

900
00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:45.940
there's a real animosity between Russia and the United States that is rekindled

901
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.790
that we didn't feel for decades.
You know,

902
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:53.590
Putin has kind of brought this back to life and strategically if he should

903
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:58.650
decide to align himself with people that are the friends of Isis,

904
00:49:00.101 --> 00:49:02.110
like not unnecessarily isis themselves,

905
00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:06.070
but just close enough and close enough proximity that he can sort of fuel that

906
00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:10.870
fire.
Whether it's with information,
with strategy,
with money,
arms,
equipment,

907
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:14.900
like nuclear bombs.
I mean that's the ultimate,
right?
That's what everyone's more,

908
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:19.750
more terrified of than anything is that some radicalized crazy fucking group

909
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.350
gets a hold of a bomb and decides to blow Paris up or decides to blow.

910
00:49:23.351 --> 00:49:26.080
Can you imagine whatever downtown New York and somebody clocks one of those

911
00:49:26.081 --> 00:49:28.630
things off.
I think that's the spot,
right?
New York is a spot.

912
00:49:28.631 --> 00:49:31.180
If you want to get a lot of attention,
they've hit it twice.
Right?

913
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.710
That's the spot.
That's the,
the,
that's the,

914
00:49:33.711 --> 00:49:36.490
the epicenter of attention for terror in the world.

915
00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.930
If you want to really make a fucking big splash,
you go to New York,
but not,

916
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:45.040
it's been there twice,
allegedly.
Who knows.
Moves are ghost,

917
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.530
could be still alive.
Tate loves this Bin.
Ladin like two bucks.
Yeah.

918
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.390
I mean,
look,
there's,

919
00:49:52.391 --> 00:49:56.560
there was a great article from a fucking during when the,

920
00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:58.870
when bin Laden was involved with the Mujahideen,

921
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:00.520
I forget what publication it was in,

922
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:05.470
but somebody posted it recently and it was when bin Laden was our ally.
And,

923
00:50:05.471 --> 00:50:05.920
uh,

924
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.920
there was this like puff piece on bin Ladin and real important it is that bin

925
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:14.830
Ladin see,
see if we could find that Jamie,
if you find it.
I,
it was,

926
00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:19.860
it was during the time when Russia was invading Afghanistan and we were arming

927
00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:25.471
the mujahideen and we were training them and helping them to fend off the Soviet

928
00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:29.300
Union because we don't want to rush and pipeline.
Yeah,
yeah.

929
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:33.920
It's a classic enemy of our enemy.
Exact scenarios.
What played out exactly,

930
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:38.660
and they were making it out like this guy who was CIA trained,
this guy,

931
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:41.150
Osama bin Ladin was,
you know,

932
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:46.310
was it a real hero and then turned on America and you know,

933
00:50:46.311 --> 00:50:49.400
to them it's the best piece of evidence.

934
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:54.590
If you look at the way we respected and trained and thought of Osama bin Laden

935
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.560
and then Osama bin Ladin became our number one enemy.

936
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:02.360
It's the best piece of evidence that the United States is evil and corrupt to

937
00:51:02.361 --> 00:51:03.500
them.
I mean,
it's like,
look,

938
00:51:03.501 --> 00:51:07.370
this is the guy that was your number one guy over there.

939
00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:10.340
He was the guy that you trained to fight off the Russians and now he's saying,

940
00:51:10.341 --> 00:51:13.100
you know,
the Russians were a problem.
The United States is a bigger problem.

941
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:15.980
This is the real problem.
And then boom,

942
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.850
everybody is the story of the prodigal son gone bad.
Do you think that they,

943
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.571
what do you,

944
00:51:20.571 --> 00:51:25.040
what is your thought on the Osama bin Ladin the killing of Osama Milan and

945
00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:28.030
dumping them in the ocean?
Two thumbs up,
but not necessarily.

946
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:31.480
I would imagine that.
But I mean,
do you think that definitely happens?

947
00:51:31.481 --> 00:51:32.570
Cause I've talked to guys,

948
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.290
I've talked to special ops guys that don't even believe that happened.
They go,

949
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:37.600
I think that goes dead.
They like,

950
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:41.680
we think that guy was dead for a while and they think that that's why isn't his

951
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.110
fucking Cryo chamber somewhere in Pakistan?
Pictures of him.
There's no,

952
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.560
there's no any,
there plenty of pictures of him.
No.

953
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:52.850
But I know guys who have firsthand sounds like Ufo people.
I've seen the photos.

954
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:56.990
Yes.
Seven 47 when they fly over a spraying chemical con trails as well too.

955
00:51:56.991 --> 00:52:00.750
It's not just the condensation in the air though.
He knew.
No,

956
00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.960
I haven't personally seen him.
Uh,
you know,
I wasn't there.

957
00:52:02.961 --> 00:52:05.000
I had left the command long before that actually happened.

958
00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:06.650
But if talking to people that were there,

959
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.520
I have no reason to doubt the people that I've talked to that were physically

960
00:52:10.521 --> 00:52:12.320
present when it happened.

961
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:16.350
And so you've talked to people that were there for sure as it happened.
Yeah,

962
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:20.330
absolutely.
100% by the official narrative.
Yup.
Okay.

963
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.910
I'll banded my conspiracy.
I mean that's like,
no,

964
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.950
but what is in there with a conspiracy is that he was there,

965
00:52:28.951 --> 00:52:32.250
he was dead and that they were waiting for a strategic time to,

966
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.290
what's the value of killing us on Milan.

967
00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:38.360
It was when the election or reelection was happening,
I could buy it.
Okay.

968
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.150
So you think it was purely a political play?
That's,

969
00:52:41.151 --> 00:52:45.710
that's the conspiracy theory comes about because why do you make his body

970
00:52:45.711 --> 00:52:49.490
disappears or nobody can ever see that there's not genetic testing all that.

971
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.650
That wasn't the idea.
Yeah,
we'll do it.
And then there was DNA taken.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh,

972
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.070
and I can tell you the reasons that I was told is,
you know,

973
00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.560
by leaving the body there,
it would have basically turned that into a new,

974
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.390
I don't want to say it,
Maca cause that's the wrong word,

975
00:53:02.391 --> 00:53:06.770
but a new shrine to whatever he stood for.
So they removed the body,

976
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:11.210
uh,
gave it the Muslim burial that it deserved or did not,
depending on,
you know,

977
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:15.110
which way you swing on that opinion.
And what's the Muslim burial?
I think it,
uh,

978
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:17.930
I'm not an expert on,
but I believe it's a requires a certain amount of washing.

979
00:53:17.931 --> 00:53:21.210
You have to be shrouded in a certain way.
And then,
yeah,
I mean,

980
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.980
I would rather have that,

981
00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:25.890
I would rather either cremate the body and get rid of it somewhere or put it

982
00:53:25.891 --> 00:53:30.870
somewhere that people can't go to and,
and worship some douchebag.
Right.

983
00:53:30.871 --> 00:53:33.570
You know what I mean?
If you look at what's happened since then,

984
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:38.000
it was effective because even though,
I mean he is a,

985
00:53:38.001 --> 00:53:40.020
a revered guy in that culture,

986
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:43.170
there isn't a spot where you can go to the,

987
00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:47.340
they think of as this holy spot where he died and even though he has been a

988
00:53:47.341 --> 00:53:50.100
martyr,
there's,
there's no images.
They probed around social media.

989
00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:54.480
So they did mitigate that.
Yeah.
By not releasing the images,

990
00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:58.230
I think it's better.
Right.
I know,
I know for a fact that they did DNA testing,

991
00:53:58.231 --> 00:53:58.381
you know,

992
00:53:58.381 --> 00:54:02.100
he has relatives that have come to the u s it wouldn't be impossible to get a

993
00:54:02.101 --> 00:54:05.850
DNA strand that you could match back to the guy.
So,
you know,

994
00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:08.970
as far as the execution goes,
I mean,
I think,
I think it went really well.

995
00:54:08.971 --> 00:54:12.120
What did it have a political gain?
I think you can't argue that it didn't,

996
00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.820
you know,
it definitely did.
But in my own mind,

997
00:54:14.821 --> 00:54:17.760
I don't know if that's enough to justify a conspiracy.
I buy the,
you know,

998
00:54:17.761 --> 00:54:20.190
maybe I'm an idiot,
but I buy the,
uh,
you know,
no,

999
00:54:20.191 --> 00:54:24.150
the official narrative makes sense.
I just,
it's,
conspiracies are fun.
I get it.

1000
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:26.280
I get excited about them.
I mean,
that's,

1001
00:54:26.281 --> 00:54:31.020
I think that's what it gets a little people wrapped up in bigfoot or chem trails

1002
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:37.020
like for sure,
like,
like going into Iraq.
You're like,
for sure that's bullshit.

1003
00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:40.820
Like for sure.
Now I say that.
I wasn't saying that,
but there's,

1004
00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:44.280
there's stuff we're billions of dollars goes towards that.

1005
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:49.530
The devastation of millions of people and all that stuff for not,
not,

1006
00:54:49.531 --> 00:54:52.810
not for the,
just cause that we think of it.
You know,
what we know about,

1007
00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:56.700
how about we know about for sure,
like the negotiation of the,
the,

1008
00:54:56.701 --> 00:55:00.360
the hostages in Iran during the Carter Administration.

1009
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:04.440
They made sure those hostages were not released until after Reagan was
president.

1010
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:08.160
Yeah,
that's a fact.
We all know that.
We all know that for political gain,

1011
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:12.060
they left those Americans in trapped that we know that.
Let's be honest,

1012
00:55:12.061 --> 00:55:15.780
if anybody thinks of politician is out for anything other than themselves or

1013
00:55:15.781 --> 00:55:18.000
their own,
you know things that are good for them,

1014
00:55:18.001 --> 00:55:22.350
then you're probably operating from a not a really good standpoint.
Say that,

1015
00:55:22.351 --> 00:55:24.930
but if you seen Bernie Sanders photo of him with Jesus,

1016
00:55:24.931 --> 00:55:26.550
because I don't know what the fuck you're talking about now.

1017
00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:30.120
Now you're talking crazy D's get Jesus is literally his homeboy.

1018
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:33.180
I have the same picture in my office.
Joe,
you don't.
I'm getting one.

1019
00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.160
Does a guy who's making them,
he's making prints.

1020
00:55:35.161 --> 00:55:39.180
We're going to hang out up in the office.
I said,
what did I say?
Bernie Sanders.

1021
00:55:39.181 --> 00:55:42.720
Bernie Sanders.
Did I say Bernie Sanders?
Dammit.
They're all crazy to me.

1022
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.000
They're all interchangeable.
I should have said Hillary Clinton.

1023
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.490
You've achieved another level.
Well,

1024
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.760
when he's do it as an abstract watercolor painting of Jesus loving your
shoulder,

1025
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:54.720
it's not abstract.
It's as it happened to go.
Okay.
Got It.

1026
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:56.910
It was actually just in life,
not Bernie Sanders.

1027
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.420
<v 1>I think that we need a fucking a Brian Stann Press Fox next.
Really,</v>

1028
00:56:00.421 --> 00:56:02.010
because I feel like the next president,

1029
00:56:02.011 --> 00:56:05.190
if it Putin is the real deal in that and he is man,

1030
00:56:05.191 --> 00:56:07.230
that dude is a g like he's scary.

1031
00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:12.390
You need to have a guy as president that's willing to get on a horse and joust

1032
00:56:12.391 --> 00:56:14.370
him to death or something like that.

1033
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.680
Like you gotta have somebody viable up there.

1034
00:56:16.681 --> 00:56:20.190
It can't be these fucking people that are available now for us.

1035
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.053
That's not going to work.

1036
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:25.180
<v 2>Well.
Could you imagine what like if Putin and Obama had a fight to the death,</v>

1037
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:28.320
how embarrassed we would.
That's what I'm saying.
We need Brian stands.

1038
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.260
How quickly would Putin trip Obama and have him on his back and just be beaten?

1039
00:56:32.261 --> 00:56:34.960
His brain can't believe you actually had to make that analysis can be stuck in

1040
00:56:34.961 --> 00:56:36.700
my head.
It's just what it would have been.

1041
00:56:36.701 --> 00:56:41.701
The idea clinch up on his back mount of time out elbows to the eye sockets,

1042
00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:46.900
just death.
It would be horrible.
I mean we are,
I mean,

1043
00:56:46.901 --> 00:56:49.990
we would never grow our dicks back in America.
Is that a problem?
And we do.

1044
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.200
Do we need a leader that knows how to find yas everybody?

1045
00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:59.860
Teddy Roosevelt.
Who?
Who's the last guy?
Ronald Reagan was probably like,

1046
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.100
like a guy that you would think of as being a tough guy,
but he was up,

1047
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:06.690
it goes down.
He pretended to be a tough guy.

1048
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:11.100
You do is backwards.
So who else?
George George W.
Walker.
Yeah.

1049
00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:13.840
He killed a bunch of motherfuckers knife in your yeah,
he would,

1050
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.180
he would kill you with a pen.
Yeah.

1051
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:22.000
He's forgot special pens made the first g Bush.
Yeah,
the old dude.
Yeah.

1052
00:57:22.001 --> 00:57:26.380
He was the head of the CIA.
Yeah,
that's,
it was bad ass.
He was legit.
He was legit.

1053
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:30.670
So who else?
George W.
No,
but you look at,
yeah,
it's so sad.
It is teddy,

1054
00:57:30.671 --> 00:57:34.300
Teddy Roosevelt
who go Chavez.
Putin.

1055
00:57:34.301 --> 00:57:37.600
And you look at all these other leaders there.
They're like,
you're like,

1056
00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:40.000
that dude's probably about some shit dark guys.
And you're like,

1057
00:57:40.001 --> 00:57:42.310
that's an impotent old dude.
Bill Clinton,
I bet.

1058
00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:45.100
Could make some fucking phone calls.
That's true.
He might not be.

1059
00:57:45.101 --> 00:57:45.851
I'll kill you himself,

1060
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:48.970
but I bet Bill Clinton make some phone calls and he could charm the socks off

1061
00:57:48.971 --> 00:57:52.960
you.
I don't know about all that.
Come on.
I don't think so.

1062
00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.680
I know too much.
I don't know too much and look at his eyes.

1063
00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.610
I would see him Mcdonald's eating fucking jog and motherfucker jog.
I remember,

1064
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:06.130
I remember the old days,
I don't give a fuck with this new Vegan Clinton.

1065
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.530
This new guy was buying the China study,

1066
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:13.210
which by the way it's been disproved bills.
Go read into it.
Biased information,

1067
00:58:13.211 --> 00:58:16.550
sir.
Kevin used to be mad all the time.
I'm like,
are you trying to study?
Yeah,

1068
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.020
like he would post shit like that.
I'm like,
you need to read more books.
Well,

1069
00:58:20.021 --> 00:58:22.810
the China study makes some good points about the American diet.

1070
00:58:22.811 --> 00:58:26.740
The typical American diet is terrible.
All that other stuff like conspiracies.

1071
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.310
It's like there's enough truth mixed in with all this other stuff.
Yeah.

1072
00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.500
What's this bias information?
You know,
you buy a sampling,

1073
00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.110
pick the stuff that you want that supports your idea.

1074
00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:37.370
Look like good food is good for you.
You know,

1075
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:40.960
eat a lot of vegetables is great for you,
but eat only vegetables.

1076
00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.200
There's not really a lot of evidence that says that's the way to go unless you

1077
00:58:44.201 --> 00:58:48.790
have a specific bio situation.
You know,
like some people do have issues,

1078
00:58:49.930 --> 00:58:54.130
million people in the u s that many.
It's like statistics,
statistics.

1079
00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.370
You can mean,
I know people that like,
like their body processes fish better.

1080
00:58:57.371 --> 00:59:00.360
They eat meat.
They far too much.
They don't like it.
Yeah.

1081
00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:04.750
You can justify any argument you want with a little study statistics.

1082
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:10.420
That's not
Dr. Tate.

1083
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:15.190
That conspiracy.
Yeah.
Well people love conspiracies,
man.
Hey lesson.

1084
00:59:15.191 --> 00:59:18.030
You just admitted that you fucked up about Iraq so you can't tell

1085
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:20.620
others fucked up.

1086
00:59:20.621 --> 00:59:24.020
And I was unwittingly caught up in the next [inaudible] your mind.
Fuck you.

1087
00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:29.680
I don't unwittingly.
We're just very lucky.
Eddie Bravo is not here right now.

1088
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:33.200
He will tell you.
Oh my God.
That's why I brought that up.

1089
00:59:33.201 --> 00:59:34.790
I heard somebody talking about it the other day,

1090
00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:39.350
like while pointing at the aircraft,
it's apparently spraying agricultural style.

1091
00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:41.600
I'm like,
what does southwest airlines,
yeah,

1092
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:46.520
well it's this Guy Mick West that runs a site called metal bunk.
Oh God.

1093
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:48.570
It's a debunking website.

1094
00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:53.580
It explains in very objective detail why most conspiracies bullshit and

1095
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:59.900
explains,
you know,
and that's why it's called Metta bunk.
And uh,

1096
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.350
he,
he calls it the training wheels of conspiracies and he's like,

1097
01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:06.200
cause it's right there.
It's up in the sky and you know,
you look,

1098
01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:07.280
you think about your childhood,
you go,

1099
01:00:07.281 --> 01:00:10.340
I don't remember those being there when I was young and just decided that they

1100
01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:11.174
weren't there.

1101
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.810
I'm not as photos from like old Clint Eastwood Movies where this Ken trails in

1102
01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:18.720
the background or country in the background.
I'm a western Joe.
Yes.
No,

1103
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:21.290
they didn't have planes bang out.
I know,
but that's what's fucked up.

1104
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:22.250
These dummies,

1105
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:26.670
they're out there doing films and above them in the skies fucking controls.

1106
01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:32.210
That's a curious,
that was a gassy oxen.
Well this real,

1107
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:36.810
this real conspiracies.
I believe in all of them.
Well the,
the best one is asking,

1108
01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:39.500
right?
All of course he is.

1109
01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.460
[inaudible] there's no way you can know everything.
Right.

1110
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.320
That's part of the problem.
There's no way.

1111
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:49.250
And we know that people have done some DV Shit in order to make money in order

1112
01:00:49.251 --> 01:00:54.020
to cover their tracks or in order to,
I mean,

1113
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:58.250
it's just,
that's why when someone finds out about something like weapons of mass

1114
01:00:58.251 --> 01:01:00.320
destruction in Iraq not being real,

1115
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:04.490
and they immediately go to the conspiracy angle where a guy like you who was on

1116
01:01:04.491 --> 01:01:06.410
the ground can say,
well look,

1117
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:11.090
we really thought that was the case and it's really hard to gather up that

1118
01:01:11.091 --> 01:01:14.750
information.
I mean,
it's embarrassing to say looking back,
but I mean that's,

1119
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.510
that's where our head was at.
Those are guys on the ground.

1120
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.700
It's easy to convince guys on the ground of stuff.

1121
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.490
I'm saying the guys that put you on the ground,
do you know what I mean?

1122
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.960
It's like they knew
that they couldn't find it.

1123
01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.180
What they said,

1124
01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:32.000
there's no evidence that there's no weapons of mass destruction there,

1125
01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:34.190
like time and time again.
And that's why,
what's her name?

1126
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:38.720
The CIA agent got outed by those mother fuckers by,
uh,
yeah,

1127
01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:40.380
that was buying 10 star.
Right.

1128
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.410
And so there's that.
Right?
Because her husband gene,

1129
01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:49.250
her husband was supposed to come back with evidence,
says I w and George says,

1130
01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:51.800
I want you to find weapons of mass destruction here.
And he's like,

1131
01:01:51.801 --> 01:01:53.010
there's just not.
Yeah.

1132
01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.110
And then she's an undercover CIA operative and they outer in Africa while she's

1133
01:01:57.130 --> 01:02:02.120
undercover.
When the world was turning off.
Valerie plot ballet plume.

1134
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:06.020
Yeah.
Wow,
man.
You get it.
Steel trap memory over there,
Joe.
I remember some,

1135
01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:07.850
she lives in Santa Fe.
Does she?

1136
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:12.740
Why you out or your address?
Tate.
She's,
what does she do?

1137
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:18.500
Where does she take her?
[inaudible] she's not into zoom.
Osha does crossfit.
Okay.

1138
01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.040
Oh Jesus.
Which I've heard

1139
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.410
<v 3>is Joe's favorite,
but that's one of my favorite things to do.</v>

1140
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.860
He just doesn't know enough.
Well,

1141
01:02:25.861 --> 01:02:29.000
I do a lot of the exercises that they do on the cross and that Joe.
Okay.

1142
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.390
You're a crossfit guy,
right?
Sometimes I'm,

1143
01:02:31.391 --> 01:02:34.350
I'm more endorsed for that company for eight years.
For crossfit.
Yeah.

1144
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.730
What's up with the did number one dude being fat?
He's in good shape.

1145
01:02:38.731 --> 01:02:41.430
I just saw him this summer.
There's no way.
It looks great.

1146
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:45.690
Not like this mother fucker come on.
Who is like that?
Hey,
you know,
it's uh,

1147
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:50.760
I like it when you do the one bicep and then the this and then the

1148
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.700
fucking nice.
You know what I mean?
The program came from between his ears,

1149
01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:01.710
you know what I mean?
So,
okay.
So it's knowledge is as opposed to,
yeah.

1150
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:04.710
A lot of experience doing it.
Is that g though,
man,
he's,

1151
01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:08.130
he's changed the lives and he's changed the face of fitness for,
uh,

1152
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.170
for everybody.
Like he's,
he's definitely,

1153
01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:11.970
if you want to talk about somebody that is exact,

1154
01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:14.340
a change upon the American population and diets,

1155
01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:17.700
that's the guy man done done some huge,
huge way,

1156
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.450
but his company has done it right.
And then when people see him,
they go,

1157
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:26.460
hey,
yeah,
come,
you don't look like you do it.
I mean,
it's a tough one.

1158
01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:28.980
I don't know what he would say if you asked him straight to his face.

1159
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:33.150
I don't know what he would say if you asked him to partake in crossfit work.

1160
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:35.820
He's Kinda like a bad body.
Right?
Something wrong with him.
Right.

1161
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:40.050
He's got a bum leg.
Yeah.
And he was like,
he was right.
That was what he,

1162
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:43.770
he bicycle,
he has a passion for bicycling.
Right?
Oh,

1163
01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:45.270
I don't think he ever did it competitively,

1164
01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:49.320
but it was just the flight fly forum or so I did,
I started off the fly planes.

1165
01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.110
I got about 3000 hours flying me some jets.
Wow.

1166
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.250
I dabble in a lot of the shit that company for a long time.
For four years.

1167
01:03:56.251 --> 01:03:58.230
I taught at the,
uh,
the seminars just teach,

1168
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:03.260
like basically spreading Greg's conceptual foundation all over the world when

1169
01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:04.141
all over.

1170
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:08.510
And then I manage the licensing and sponsorship deals when I came back off of

1171
01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:12.300
military deployment in 2010.
So I've managed the Reebok deal that crossfit has,

1172
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:17.100
uh,
and then started flying again and then flew him for like three years as well

1173
01:04:17.101 --> 01:04:20.430
too.
So I was,
I was in the military doing all that double dipping while I was in.

1174
01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:22.320
What is your feeling on crossfit?

1175
01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:28.230
You can't argue with the effectiveness of the methodology.
Like it totally works.

1176
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:29.400
I S I mean,

1177
01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:34.170
the days of pumping iron and Arnold Schwarzenegger were awesome.

1178
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.771
You know what I mean?

1179
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:38.130
And I'd rather have people do that than sit on the couch and eat Doritos.

1180
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:41.880
But I think the argument for functional fitness and the ability to actually be

1181
01:04:41.881 --> 01:04:44.130
able to do something with all the hard work you're doing,

1182
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:49.270
you can't argue against it really.
Right.
It's,
it's form over physique.
Uh,
and I,

1183
01:04:49.271 --> 01:04:52.620
I it,
I need to be able to do it to do the activities that I still do.

1184
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:57.330
Like I'm outside all day long,
you know,
eaten shit all the time.
Uh,
so yeah,

1185
01:04:57.450 --> 01:05:01.920
I mean,
again,
a long,
long answer to a short,
short question.
Uh,
I do it.
Yeah.

1186
01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:06.180
The argument against it by guys who are very knowledgeable about strength

1187
01:05:06.181 --> 01:05:09.900
conditioning is that you shouldn't do power lifting exercises for large amount

1188
01:05:09.901 --> 01:05:12.180
of reps and that it's damaging for the body.

1189
01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:16.320
That's like with Steven Mandell's says,
he says Olympic lifting,
power lifting.

1190
01:05:16.321 --> 01:05:17.760
There's a distinction.
Okay,
well,

1191
01:05:17.761 --> 01:05:22.100
dead lifts and cleans like that kind of shit or lifting,
right?

1192
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.880
It's cleans and snatches are thing is more like dead lifting.

1193
01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:28.060
Olympic lifting is like the tiny and make opening and closing like the snatch,

1194
01:05:28.061 --> 01:05:31.180
the corral,
all that stuff.
Can you get,
can you go overboard?
Sure.

1195
01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.250
But you need to kill yourself drinking too much water too.

1196
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.870
I mean you've got to put that in perspective.

1197
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.640
Well Maxwell's problem with it has always been that it's a competition for

1198
01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:43.330
exercise where he feels like exercise should be used to get you in better shape

1199
01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.650
for competition and then having a competition out of lifting weights,
you know,

1200
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.770
and for a bunch of repetitions is silly.
It is silly.
But I also,

1201
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.160
I would also say that's a bastardization of what the company actually stands
for.

1202
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:58.420
The competition aspect was in a group classroom setting.

1203
01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:00.370
And if you take that and expand it beyond that,

1204
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:05.350
it stops making sense at an exponential rate.
It was just about putting,
you know,

1205
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.980
a number on a board and holding you accountable for your performance.

1206
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:12.700
If you're racing,
if all three of us are doing,
if I'm doing something by myself,

1207
01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:13.520
uh,

1208
01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.210
that has a time component to it and then you to come in the room and we're all

1209
01:06:16.211 --> 01:06:18.490
going to do it together,
you know,
damn well,
I'm like,

1210
01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.510
let's Jelly doing over there so that it's not necessarily you're competing and

1211
01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:26.350
exercise.
It was the competition aspect of the workouts that would enhance,

1212
01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:30.190
not enhance but dry people to perform brings you into a deeper level of
yourself.

1213
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:35.110
It also,
yeah,
it was never supposed to be about competing and exercise,

1214
01:06:35.111 --> 01:06:38.210
so that's a,
that's a a slight misunderstanding of what the,

1215
01:06:38.211 --> 01:06:39.370
the concept of the program,

1216
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:44.860
<v 1>I think the crossfit games is crossfit and they make a collusion with those and</v>

1217
01:06:44.861 --> 01:06:49.610
that's just not true.
It's an erroneous idea.
The,
the,
the idea of crossfit is,

1218
01:06:49.611 --> 01:06:52.420
is getting somebody to not die a diabetes anymore.

1219
01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:56.470
That crossfit is to change people's lives and to have that spread through

1220
01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:57.580
communities and go,
God,

1221
01:06:57.581 --> 01:07:01.060
my mom's doing this and now she dropped 50 pounds and she stopped taking
insulin.

1222
01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:04.420
I thought the idea of crossfit has just not being able to shut the fuck up about

1223
01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:08.620
crossfit all the time.
You're a cross fair.

1224
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.910
That's too,
all the best stuff is culty.

1225
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:17.290
And I think that ideas like Maxwell's spreading like from what I'm hearing in

1226
01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:20.580
that way is just bread of ignorance.
It's like an ID.

1227
01:07:20.581 --> 01:07:25.030
I guess I can say it is.
I dare you.

1228
01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:28.180
I dare because of my education,
I guess.

1229
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:32.980
[inaudible]
you know,
bitch,
you know how I roll.

1230
01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:34.780
I will walk through this motherfucker.

1231
01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:39.900
Darin allow me to dare what happened in that one American guy who,

1232
01:07:40.841 --> 01:07:44.290
uh,
I think it was from Los Angeles,
had dropped the weight on his neck.
Kevin,

1233
01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:48.640
no guard hair lies.
He's just,
and he's got the best goddamn attitude ever.

1234
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:51.070
He's like,
I saw him this song or two and he's a fucking,

1235
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.940
he is a solid motherfucker.
He's great dude.
You should talk to him and the,
uh,

1236
01:07:54.941 --> 01:07:58.520
the bar and landed on his neck right.
And landed on his back and it,

1237
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.320
<v 3>yeah,
it was gnarly.
It,
I mean,
it was a clean break.</v>

1238
01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.540
Like I think he was paralyzed from that incident.

1239
01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:06.060
It wasn't like an onset and you know,
they're like,
oh,

1240
01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:09.930
we'll wait until the swelling goes down.
Snapped.
Yeah.
Wow.
It's crazy.

1241
01:08:09.931 --> 01:08:14.400
At a bar just dropping on.
You can do that 300 pounds.

1242
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.850
It can do that.
So,
yeah.
And so there's no hope for him.

1243
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:20.810
That's just it.

1244
01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:24.500
<v 1>Oh,
he's leading a whole new life.
He's got an epoch in his life and he's leading,</v>

1245
01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.270
uh,
these athletes that are mitigated by different,
uh,
paralysis and all that.

1246
01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:33.200
And he's,
he's a,
he's a signal,
like he's become a symbol of hope.

1247
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:37.610
And I'm connectedness in this whole other,
um,
regime like in,

1248
01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:39.470
in my gym had undisputed,
in Santa Fe,

1249
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:44.390
we've got four athletes that are in wheelchairs that compete and that drive,

1250
01:08:44.391 --> 01:08:46.100
and they get through this,
you know,
for those,

1251
01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:48.030
Kevin went right into it because he was already an athlete.

1252
01:08:48.031 --> 01:08:51.800
He already had that competition,
competition,
mind.
But,
um,
you know,

1253
01:08:51.801 --> 01:08:54.830
a lot of those guys,
they go,
they have an accident,
they go through drugs,

1254
01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:58.820
they go through suicidal ideas,
and then after they're paralyzed for a while,

1255
01:08:58.821 --> 01:09:00.950
they go,
you know what,
maybe I need to,

1256
01:09:00.951 --> 01:09:03.580
I'm going to live this way a long time and maybe I need to change my life.

1257
01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.870
And there's a whole group of community that's doing it

1258
01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:09.190
<v 3>less from the neck,
down the waist,
the waist down.
Kevin is,</v>

1259
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:12.710
it's amazing to me though,
how people take those,
you know,

1260
01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.240
horrible circumstances and it changes their life.

1261
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.670
He's one of the most beautiful lights ever.
Man,
that guy,

1262
01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.020
I don't think I would go down that road.

1263
01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.930
I think I'd be looking for salvation and the bottom of the bottle and then just

1264
01:09:22.931 --> 01:09:26.350
suck.
Starting a pistol in the morning.
Suck starting a pistol.

1265
01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:29.740
That's a nice way to like every morning.
And if that happened to me,
I'd be like,

1266
01:09:29.741 --> 01:09:31.210
toothbrush,
six shooter.

1267
01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:35.500
Like how the fuck did you get involved in this wing suit?
Craziness.

1268
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.330
How the fuck did you tell Tate on a previous podcast?

1269
01:09:40.331 --> 01:09:43.420
You wouldn't jump out of an airplane with me.
Oh,
oh,
I just won't,

1270
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:47.980
I'm just a hair pins are really good for flying and it's just not a good idea to

1271
01:09:47.981 --> 01:09:52.380
jump out of him.
You,
you got,
you got,
you got into it because you were,
uh,

1272
01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.550
you will have the answer.

1273
01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.760
How did you get into like tasty answers are amazing to me.

1274
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.760
Tell me about where I was born.
The,
that I wreck.
Why don't you jump instructor?

1275
01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:08.350
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.
And so is that the first time you started jumping?

1276
01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.980
So I started jumping,
you know,
seal stands for sea air land.

1277
01:10:11.981 --> 01:10:14.700
So you train for a variety of things.
And when I first got,

1278
01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:18.990
never knew that you didn't know that.
I don't know.

1279
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:21.640
He's fucking with me or not.
That's honest.
I don't know that.

1280
01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:25.670
So one of the rare things I did know,
okay,
to see Ireland,

1281
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:28.360
we're going to focus on the air portion.
That,
all right.
So you know,

1282
01:10:28.361 --> 01:10:31.720
you get to the seal team,
keep it together till you take,
keep it together.

1283
01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:35.740
Three of those fucking Nitros,
two cups of regular caveman.

1284
01:10:35.741 --> 01:10:39.070
He's sat off the tilt and let him talk.
I'm trying.

1285
01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:43.840
So you get to a seal team and you're brand new and nowadays when you get,

1286
01:10:43.841 --> 01:10:46.750
you're trying to pin that is the designator or that makes you a seal.

1287
01:10:46.751 --> 01:10:49.990
You have to go through the jump training before you go through static line,

1288
01:10:49.991 --> 01:10:54.310
which is analogous to jumping off the roof of this building with no parachute to

1289
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:56.290
freefall jumping,
which is awesome.

1290
01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:59.680
You're falling through the year and you're like,
you know,
like the point brick,

1291
01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:04.210
you know,
point your toes Johnny fly,
you know,
that's the good stuff.

1292
01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.210
So when you get to the seal team though,
when I got into 97,
uh,

1293
01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:09.790
because I was in freefall qualified,

1294
01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:12.730
all we had to do or all we could do with static line jump.

1295
01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.140
So we'd on the plane with the free fall guys and they would just sit there and

1296
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:17.760
laugh at us as we left the plane.

1297
01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:21.690
I like 1200 feet are a little parachute walking off the ramp with our static

1298
01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:24.750
line and m and like just eat shit into the ground.

1299
01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.450
And after about a week of that,
I'm like,
okay,

1300
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:31.950
I've had enough of this static line shit.
So I went out founded uh,

1301
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:35.460
civilian skydiving,
drop zone by my house,
uh,

1302
01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:39.840
and went through the six hours of required ground training and then seven jumps.

1303
01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:43.440
It took me all of two days to do that and then started jumping on my own,

1304
01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.790
got about 500,

1305
01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:48.960
jumps myself and then challenge the military curriculum instead of having to

1306
01:11:48.961 --> 01:11:51.270
wait the five years to go to get military free fall.

1307
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:55.410
Qualifacts I was just tired of auguring in on the static line jumps and then I

1308
01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:56.244
just really liked it.

1309
01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:00.390
And then I pursued a development group was great for it because of like,

1310
01:12:00.391 --> 01:12:03.250
what do you want to do?
I'm explaining what development group was,
uh,

1311
01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.780
developing group of seal team six there.
Uh,

1312
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:08.260
I think in this day and age largely interchangeable.

1313
01:12:08.261 --> 01:12:09.240
It didn't used to be like that,

1314
01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.940
but they'd allow you to pursue stuff that you wanted to do.

1315
01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:14.400
And I had a great boss and he was like,
you like to jump,

1316
01:12:14.401 --> 01:12:16.500
so you need to go to this school,
this school,
this school,
this school.

1317
01:12:16.501 --> 01:12:19.230
It's where I learned how to do tandems.
It's where,
you know,

1318
01:12:19.231 --> 01:12:21.990
instead of being the jumper,
I was the guy putting the guys out of the aircraft.

1319
01:12:21.991 --> 01:12:25.980
So it just kind of led to a very diverse,
uh,
jump experience like I've had,

1320
01:12:25.981 --> 01:12:29.420
I've had my toes in a lot of different like jumps stuff.
Uh,

1321
01:12:29.421 --> 01:12:30.690
and then a buddy of mine was like,
hey man,

1322
01:12:30.691 --> 01:12:35.010
you gotta check out these wingsuits at first.
And at first thought,
I'm like,
yeah,

1323
01:12:35.011 --> 01:12:36.810
that looks like you're jumping in a straight jacket man,

1324
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:40.590
because you're zipped up here.
Just like wobbling around.
You look like a little,

1325
01:12:40.591 --> 01:12:43.260
you know,
a triangle flying through the air.
Uh,

1326
01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.500
and then I went and I started base jumping and the guy who taught me how to base

1327
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:49.680
jump,
it was just raving about him.
I'm like,
all right,
that's it.
I'm going to go,

1328
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:51.060
I'm going to go figure out how to do this.

1329
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:56.520
And so I ordered a suit that would not be recommended for a normal student

1330
01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.670
because it was big.
Like the more fabric,

1331
01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:01.830
the more performance you can get out of it,

1332
01:13:01.831 --> 01:13:04.240
but the more bent out of shape you can get to if you,

1333
01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.740
if it gets a little squirrely.
Uh,
so they're like,
you should start on this suit.

1334
01:13:07.741 --> 01:13:09.990
I'm like,
yeah,
but this one looks way better.

1335
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.520
So I'm gonna order this one and then I'm going to eventually jump at this one

1336
01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.670
and this looks way better.
So I'm going to order both at the same time.

1337
01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.770
So I order both at the same time.

1338
01:13:19.771 --> 01:13:23.580
Did seven jumps in the suit that I was wildly underqualified to jump in and then

1339
01:13:23.581 --> 01:13:28.020
just put the big one on.
Look back.
What was the first jump link?

1340
01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:30.810
It wasn't that bad.
I was actually in my head,

1341
01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:32.820
I thought it was going to be way worse because I mean,

1342
01:13:32.821 --> 01:13:35.880
I like to be able to do this,
you know,
like move around and you're in the suit,

1343
01:13:35.881 --> 01:13:39.110
you're just like locked in,
you're locked in.
So,
and I'm,
I like,

1344
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.020
I had never exited a plane with all that material that I was afraid I was going

1345
01:13:42.021 --> 01:13:44.880
to go out and just get smacked up into the wing or in the tail wing,

1346
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:48.960
which has having guys who hit their head and they're just done.
Yeah.
It happens.

1347
01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:53.340
Uh,
so I was all freaked out and then I go out and it's like laying on an air

1348
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:57.710
mattress on your stomach.
I just kind of relaxed and I saw the ground moving.

1349
01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:01.260
I'm like,
Holy Shit.
This is awesome.
You're just flying.
You're flying.

1350
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:06.090
I was flying really inefficiently.
Here we go.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

1351
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:10.710
That's from 36,500 feet.
36,500 feet.

1352
01:14:10.711 --> 01:14:13.390
Do you have oxygen?
Oh yeah.
That's the condensation coming out.

1353
01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:18.040
So the exit I'm about to display for you is not very good.
Why?

1354
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:24.340
Well,
I caught my foot on the door start.
So you go upside down?
Yeah.

1355
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.000
Oh yeah.
And the gets worse.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
You're spiraling.
Wow.

1356
01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.290
How do you correct that?
Uh,

1357
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:35.730
you have to dive the suit so you gotta get the suit die.

1358
01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.600
They get speed and then I'm like,
okay,
here we go.

1359
01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:42.690
So you figured out how to dive down and then that that's stops the spin it,

1360
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.510
you got to think of the wingsuit,
like an aircraft wing.
If you stall it,

1361
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:50.920
it'll spin.
So wingsuits likes speed,
they just want to go fast.

1362
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:52.990
The faster it goes,
the more power you have.

1363
01:14:52.991 --> 01:14:56.230
And I can actually gain altitude in my wingsuit so I can go down and then flare

1364
01:14:56.231 --> 01:14:59.580
back up and gain a couple hundred feet.
How far get a couple hundred feet.

1365
01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.840
Can you continually do that?
Like when does it end?
Uh,

1366
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.590
like for this particular jump,
this was in August.

1367
01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:08.890
That was 18.25 miles is what I traveled horizontally,

1368
01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:14.050
not do you know,
do you know what your speed is when you're going?
Do you know?

1369
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:18.700
Uh,
not really.
You don't have a readout or anything like that on that jump?

1370
01:15:18.701 --> 01:15:21.040
Not only did I not have to read out,
I didn't have an altimeter.

1371
01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:24.760
All I had was an audible in my ear because I didn't,
uh,

1372
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.110
I didn't want to have anything else.

1373
01:15:26.111 --> 01:15:28.540
I was afraid that the oxygen hose was going to rap over it.

1374
01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:32.050
There was just too many other complications.
So I just went,
went uh,

1375
01:15:32.051 --> 01:15:35.740
off of the audible and then I calibrated camera one,
camera two before I left.

1376
01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:40.060
So when you're doing this the first time you're doing this,

1377
01:15:40.061 --> 01:15:43.120
are you doing it from this high?
Like how high were you the first time he did it?

1378
01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:47.560
So most skydiving is like 13,000,
500 feet.
That's,
that's pretty much about it.

1379
01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:51.820
But I mean this was,
this took a lot of time in the making like I was,

1380
01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:55.000
that's an airplane,
right?
That was an airplane.
But I was started,
you know,

1381
01:15:55.001 --> 01:15:57.220
making the preparations for that in January of this year.

1382
01:15:57.221 --> 01:15:59.800
And I did that in August.
That was a world record.
Yeah.

1383
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.960
That was the farthest distance flown in a wingsuit,

1384
01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.720
which is a completely irrelevant,

1385
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:09.360
completely irrelevant measure of horizontal distance,
but right.

1386
01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:11.110
You know and what time,

1387
01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:15.010
like how much time he's spending from the time you jump out until the time you

1388
01:16:15.011 --> 01:16:15.750
land.

1389
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:19.870
A I was in free fall for just over eight minutes and then probably under canopy

1390
01:16:19.871 --> 01:16:24.280
under the parachute for less than a minute.
That's it.
I pulled a little bit low.

1391
01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:26.920
I didn't have an altimeter on.
So like I said,

1392
01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:30.450
I had an audible in my ear that was set to go off at certain altitudes in it.
Uh,

1393
01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.390
the lower beep did not go off so,

1394
01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.460
but I account I calibrated my camera's before I went or like camera one,

1395
01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:39.310
camera two,
camera one,
camera two.
Let's go.
So it was calibrated.

1396
01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:43.420
What does that mean?
Camera one,
camera two.
You're calculating my eyes.

1397
01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:45.790
Camera one's calibrated camera too.
Let's go.

1398
01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:49.180
How do you do that when you look at the ground?
I'm like,
Holy Shit,

1399
01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:51.640
this is getting really big.
Yeah.
Wow.

1400
01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:55.060
Cause I had just gotten back from a month base jumping in Europe where I was

1401
01:16:55.061 --> 01:16:56.980
used to pulling it like 400 feet.

1402
01:16:57.310 --> 01:17:00.490
So I had seen those visuals of the ground coming up and I had an altimeter

1403
01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:04.060
alerts set for 10,001 set for 5,500 in my last one,

1404
01:17:04.061 --> 01:17:07.900
I wanted to go off at three so I got the 10,000 foot alert.
No problem.

1405
01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:12.890
5,000 foot alert goes off,
no problem.
And then you kind of have like this mental,

1406
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:15.620
it's going to be after a while,
you know how long it's going to be.

1407
01:17:15.621 --> 01:17:19.820
So I'm just like flying,
flying.
I'm like,
hmm,

1408
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:23.270
okay Ma,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna wait.
Right.
Cause you know it's important.

1409
01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:25.340
I'm going for distance.
I'm just gonna keep waiting and keep waiting.

1410
01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:29.810
And I'm like Ha,
tree down there is way too big.
I'm Outta here.

1411
01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.920
Wow.
So yeah,
you ever hear about these guys that want to land them?

1412
01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:37.640
I'm one of those guys.
You want to land one without a pair of shoes.

1413
01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.820
And they were saying they land.
I don't think it's possible that landed in boxes.

1414
01:17:40.821 --> 01:17:41.031
Right?

1415
01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:44.450
The guy in Europe did he put a neck brace on and put up some big cardboard boxes

1416
01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:47.890
and fluid right into the box.
And how's he doing?
He's fine.
Walk out of it.

1417
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:50.151
There was another guy,

1418
01:17:50.151 --> 01:17:53.690
Jeb Corliss who was talking about like basically taping a skateboard to his

1419
01:17:53.691 --> 01:17:55.190
stomach and making this really long.

1420
01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:58.910
That sounds like something a guy named Jeb would do.
Jesus fuck his brother.

1421
01:17:58.911 --> 01:18:01.180
I going to get all the trucks for the board together.

1422
01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:05.380
My cousin cliff is going to try to,
I mean to me though,
man,
I'm like,
yeah,
that,

1423
01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:06.860
I mean I would probably give it a go.

1424
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:09.850
If I could rationalize it and figure out a way to like it,

1425
01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:13.340
it would be at least plausible or possible.
I'd give it a go.

1426
01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:14.690
What would be the way,

1427
01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:18.260
I mean I could see maybe in the ocean and it can land in the water now because

1428
01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:22.920
you're gonna be stuck in that suit.
Oh,
it's,
it's like a buck 20.
Hey,
yeah,

1429
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:26.530
whack.
There's 20 guys that are doing that this year.
Yeah.

1430
01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:29.120
And there's no more of that start.
How many are doing it next year?

1431
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.280
We'll the skydiving in the base jumping,
basic jumping like that.
Uh,
I think

1432
01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.673
18 or 19.

1433
01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.210
Is there a way that you could have a wing that's not fixed that's like may be

1434
01:18:41.211 --> 01:18:45.320
expandable?
Like,
uh,
like you would reach a,
a certain point,
you know,
you're,

1435
01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:47.660
you're,
you've got your wing like this,
right?
And you're flying around.

1436
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.561
Is there a way,

1437
01:18:48.561 --> 01:18:51.470
like maybe you could release something that would give you a bunch of extra

1438
01:18:51.471 --> 01:18:54.290
fabric and you would just,
it was slow.
You,

1439
01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:58.550
I think I've seen this in the bed than fat man.
Hey Siri,
Siri is,

1440
01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.070
I didn't even say,
Hey Siri was series transcribing that.

1441
01:19:01.071 --> 01:19:03.350
If you noticed that series that will,

1442
01:19:03.351 --> 01:19:05.480
the Chinese are trying to figure out what you got going on.

1443
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:08.180
The Chinese are doing,
it already broke captain of my shit.

1444
01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:12.730
I think I saw that on Batman returns.
That same concept that we're talking about,

1445
01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.020
but you're going to have the electro gloves.
Yeah.

1446
01:19:15.021 --> 01:19:18.680
Well that was thinking that maybe a way that you could release more fabric in

1447
01:19:18.681 --> 01:19:21.050
the wings and it would slow you down considerably.

1448
01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.950
Like you could get to a point where you could hit it and it would puff back and

1449
01:19:24.951 --> 01:19:26.660
then you could almost like hit the ground running.

1450
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:29.410
They're for sure going to do it.
Somebody has good body,

1451
01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.850
but I don't know how long has wingsuits been around?

1452
01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:34.520
I mean there's a lot of impossible sisters.
I think

1453
01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.810
the technological advances in those 20 years are insane.

1454
01:19:38.811 --> 01:19:43.070
Like it was literally before a fabric loop that went around your thumb and like

1455
01:19:43.071 --> 01:19:47.230
a twin sheet,
but a guy so do his suit and was like,
crikey,
crazy box.

1456
01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:51.500
That's like me jumping off the garage with two garbage can.

1457
01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:56.970
But it has happened.
It has happened.
It's done it.
So the,
yeah,
the pioneers.
Yes.

1458
01:19:57.470 --> 01:20:01.700
Here's an interesting statistic of like the 80 people who are credited with

1459
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:04.220
developing wingsuits.
80 of them are dead.

1460
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.130
Is that Jesus Christ and then it's not old age either.
No,
no.

1461
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:14.070
But I bet you they went out with a smile on their face.
How?
I bet they didn't.

1462
01:20:14.370 --> 01:20:15.630
How about that?
I bet they did not.

1463
01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:17.160
Right before they realize they were going to die.

1464
01:20:17.161 --> 01:20:19.350
They had a smile on their face up until that point.

1465
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:24.480
When were smiling right now say that your court doesn't go off when you're at

1466
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.980
2000 feet or wherever you are and you pulled,
are you still smiling after that?

1467
01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:30.360
Well and that jump that we watched,

1468
01:20:30.361 --> 01:20:34.740
I mean I have a reserve so I have a plan B on base jumping and the how close do

1469
01:20:34.741 --> 01:20:36.150
you have to get to the ground before it's too late?

1470
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:40.680
I mean I had about a five second canopy ride in Europe,

1471
01:20:40.681 --> 01:20:44.810
so I was probably 150 feet off the ground when I pulled.
And you then that's,

1472
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.820
that was emotional courage and it was a bit,

1473
01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:49.830
that was a visually intense experience for me.

1474
01:20:49.831 --> 01:20:53.340
That was the lowest I've ever opened.
A parish is so low,
it's so low.

1475
01:20:53.341 --> 01:20:56.850
That's like how many seconds is that from the ground that you're following?

1476
01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:58.410
More than 155 seconds.

1477
01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:01.200
Well because you're only going about 30 down in your wing suit,

1478
01:21:01.201 --> 01:21:03.090
you got more than four speed.
Right.
Okay.
Not,

1479
01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:06.540
not like big drive to canopy opening.
I mean,
it opened and I hit the ground.

1480
01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:10.380
Like four seconds later I sat down and thought about what the fuck I was doing

1481
01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.780
for awhile after that one.
Oh my God.

1482
01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.570
And that for me it was not enjoyable.

1483
01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:18.840
Like I do this stuff because I love it and because it,

1484
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:22.260
I mean it makes my head right.
Like if I didn't do that type of stuff,

1485
01:21:22.261 --> 01:21:26.120
my head would be,
it wouldn't be like,
I won't be able to think as clear.
It just,

1486
01:21:26.121 --> 01:21:29.430
it,
I can't articulate,
uh,
the clarity that it provides for me.

1487
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:34.110
How so is it like you think you need to do dangerous shit because now your past

1488
01:21:34.111 --> 01:21:35.670
experience can then,
let me ask you this,

1489
01:21:35.671 --> 01:21:39.210
why do you have a sensory deprivation tank?
Well,

1490
01:21:39.211 --> 01:21:44.211
because it allows me to be alone alone with my thoughts are literally alone.

1491
01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:45.920
Yeah.
Like you're,

1492
01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:48.750
are you present in the moment when you're there and you're alone?

1493
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:52.860
Up until the moment where I start tripping.
Okay.
For me,

1494
01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:57.060
when I'm standing on like the edge of a cliff,
I,

1495
01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:02.120
it provides for me just a moment of clarity and being present in that moment.

1496
01:22:02.821 --> 01:22:06.450
Like the closer you get,
and again this is,
I can only speak for myself,

1497
01:22:06.451 --> 01:22:09.030
but the closer you get when in the bay shopping world for me,

1498
01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:12.720
like when I'm getting ready to jump and I'm zipping up my sleeves and I'm doing

1499
01:22:12.721 --> 01:22:16.500
my checks,
like I'm not thinking about my checking account balance anymore.

1500
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.250
You know,
I'm not worried about fuck I got to transfer money over,
blah blah,
blah,

1501
01:22:20.251 --> 01:22:21.084
blah,
blah.

1502
01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:25.410
It just slowly starts kind of fading away and then you step up to the edge and

1503
01:22:25.411 --> 01:22:30.300
it's,
I mean,
I've never seen color so clearly in my life,
I've never,
it just,

1504
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:35.360
it's a laser like focus on the next three seconds in my life.

1505
01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:38.400
You're not worried about a minute down the road,

1506
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:40.580
you're not thinking about what you had for lunch,
right?

1507
01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:43.530
Because if you rock forward and step off,

1508
01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:45.940
you better be ready for full speed life per match.

1509
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:49.530
It you got the rest of your life to figure out what the fucks about to happen.

1510
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:54.060
And it's not that I like to in dangerous stuff and don't get me wrong,

1511
01:22:54.061 --> 01:22:57.420
I love the sensation of flying and it's great to be able to fly next to a cliff

1512
01:22:57.421 --> 01:23:02.100
or down through set of trees.
It's awesome.
But that,
that moment of clarity,

1513
01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.170
the only other time I've ever had that is on like a helicopter at about the one

1514
01:23:05.171 --> 01:23:10.171
minute out where you lose all of the past and all you're thinking about is the

1515
01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:14.140
absolute present moment and the next thing that you have to do what you're

1516
01:23:14.141 --> 01:23:16.460
saying one minute out,
me and him about to go into combat.
Yup.

1517
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:20.380
Because you're not worried about your checkbook then either.
It's just that it's,

1518
01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:24.040
it's a narrowing,
but an expansion at the same time you're narrowing your focus.

1519
01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:28.000
But I'm expanding the amount of information that I can process.

1520
01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:29.960
So it's almost like an altered state.
Like you're,

1521
01:23:29.961 --> 01:23:32.590
you're reaching like a very high level of concentration,

1522
01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:36.310
almost like akin to like a deep,
deep meditation.
Yeah.
I don't know.

1523
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:40.150
She'd be nothing deep,
deep meditation.
Uh,
but yeah,
it's definitely,

1524
01:23:40.151 --> 01:23:44.710
it's as close to,
you know,
one of those states that I can imagine.
I mean,
I,

1525
01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.450
I love it.
It makes me better a better person in ways that make no sense.
Like it,

1526
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:51.640
it gives me more patients around my kids.

1527
01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:55.480
It gives me more patients dealing with idiots that I don't,
you know what I mean?

1528
01:23:55.481 --> 01:23:57.310
Because,
and I don't know why.

1529
01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:01.450
Just those few seconds or moments provide that for me.
But it does make sense.

1530
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.640
It balances it out.
You know?

1531
01:24:03.641 --> 01:24:07.300
It makes sense that it gives you this unbelievably extreme experience.

1532
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:10.540
So it's like,
it drains your need for that.

1533
01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.010
I felt like that the first time I did a stick fight and like stick for a cause.

1534
01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:17.350
I don't think it's unique to the jumping.
I think everybody,

1535
01:24:17.351 --> 01:24:19.510
I think when you start,
because don't get me wrong,

1536
01:24:19.511 --> 01:24:24.220
like when I'm standing on the edge,
like every alarm bell in my body is like,

1537
01:24:24.221 --> 01:24:28.030
you're an idiot.
You're an idiot,
idiot.
Your hearts discharge,
you get here,

1538
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:29.140
you're on the quip.
Oh yeah,

1539
01:24:29.141 --> 01:24:31.090
here's this guy trying to be all tough and talk right.

1540
01:24:31.091 --> 01:24:35.080
And you're like [inaudible] are you ready to go?
Like you're spitting sawdust.

1541
01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:38.560
But I think if you spit and Sada,
so for me,
right,

1542
01:24:38.561 --> 01:24:42.160
that that's the point where I have that experience.
But like you're saying take,

1543
01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:43.780
it could be,
it could be stick fighting.

1544
01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:47.230
That's why to me like you guys are fucking crazy to go in the octagon like no

1545
01:24:47.231 --> 01:24:48.064
way.
Like,

1546
01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.940
but maybe you guys get that when you're getting ready to square off with the

1547
01:24:51.941 --> 01:24:52.780
dude in the octagon.

1548
01:24:52.781 --> 01:24:56.890
I think that there's something in who we are as human beings that wants us to

1549
01:24:56.891 --> 01:25:00.110
search for that,
but everybody finds it in their own way.
Yeah.

1550
01:25:00.370 --> 01:25:05.350
There's something about human beings and wants you to run from comfort and that

1551
01:25:05.351 --> 01:25:09.490
you,
you learn from you about yourself.
Some are cleaved comfort.

1552
01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:11.560
Well the ones that are interesting,
the interesting,

1553
01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:16.090
the really interesting ones to me are the ones that the the seek out these

1554
01:25:16.091 --> 01:25:17.230
difficult moments.
Yep.

1555
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:20.520
<v 1>Cause I know that I've seen combat like you to that degree that that kind of a</v>

1556
01:25:20.521 --> 01:25:21.354
soldier,

1557
01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:26.010
that fight are all like they have to get worked up like 10 candidates.
Yeah.

1558
01:25:26.011 --> 01:25:28.980
Like Tim and Brian Stann are both guys that have talked like that about it,

1559
01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:32.490
that they have to get worked up there to calm before they go into that

1560
01:25:32.491 --> 01:25:36.390
experience.
They need to get jazzed up because they're so used to like a higher,

1561
01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:37.800
a heightened sense of constant.

1562
01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.850
<v 3>Well let's be,
let's be honest to me like there,
there's some,
uh,</v>

1563
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:44.470
there's some great attributes that come from operating in a high risk,

1564
01:25:44.471 --> 01:25:46.510
high threat environment with high consequences,

1565
01:25:46.511 --> 01:25:50.950
but it also changes you as a human being to like a graze you in areas that maybe

1566
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:55.150
like empathy for me is one I struggle with like maybe what you were talking

1567
01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:57.790
about before about Guantanamo Bay,
about these radicals coming out.

1568
01:25:57.791 --> 01:26:01.680
You've got to kill him for me and for me the Santa,
yeah,
I shit you not it,

1569
01:26:01.681 --> 01:26:04.040
it'd be as easy for me is to say is to pick up a gun

1570
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.710
<v 2>and blow dude's head off right there.
If he was one of them,</v>

1571
01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:10.640
no problem and go fucking sleep like a baby.
Not a problem.
But you know,
there's,

1572
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:14.410
there's issues that can arise from that to like,
and I recognize,

1573
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:19.070
I recognize some of it in myself.
Like for me,
I struggle with empathy.

1574
01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:20.750
Like,
you know,

1575
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.150
my kids will fall down and they'll hurt themselves and I'm just like,

1576
01:26:23.151 --> 01:26:26.960
just like an,
I don't verbalize it,
but on my couch get up.
You know what I mean?

1577
01:26:26.961 --> 01:26:27.810
It doesn't have to be my kids.

1578
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:32.030
It's like I don't have a lot of tolerance or empathy for people who are in pain

1579
01:26:32.031 --> 01:26:34.670
because the reality is it's just fucking get up and get on with what you got

1580
01:26:34.671 --> 01:26:38.070
going on.
You know what I mean?
That's,
that's what's ingrained in who I am.
Well,

1581
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:40.250
it's,
your spectrum is different than there.
That's what I'm saying.

1582
01:26:40.251 --> 01:26:42.900
But my spectrum is different now.
You know what I mean?
So,

1583
01:26:42.901 --> 01:26:45.770
and that impacts your ways.
And that's going to be like that I think for me,

1584
01:26:45.771 --> 01:26:48.640
for the rest of my life.
And it's interesting.
It's,
it's just,
uh,

1585
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:51.830
it's like a hiccup that I recognize sometimes and then most of the time I'm

1586
01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:53.060
completely oblivious to it.

1587
01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:55.880
So there's some great things that came from being in that environment.

1588
01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:59.090
And then there's some just odd quirks that you got to deal with too.
I mean,

1589
01:26:59.091 --> 01:27:01.100
there's two sides to every coin.
You know,

1590
01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:05.360
the empathy aspect of it completely makes sense because if you're used to

1591
01:27:05.361 --> 01:27:08.090
operating in extreme tolerances,

1592
01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:12.830
tolerating extreme weather conditions,
danger,
violence,

1593
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:16.970
loss of friends,
injuries,
all,
all of the above.

1594
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.850
And then you see someone who just twist their ankle and they're crying like a

1595
01:27:19.851 --> 01:27:22.670
bitch,
you know?
I mean,
we all seen your friend below.
Yeah.

1596
01:27:22.671 --> 01:27:27.560
And then somebody falls like,
yeah,
but we all have seen,
I mean to a much,

1597
01:27:27.561 --> 01:27:28.550
much lesser extent,

1598
01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:32.090
the people who train in Jujitsu or martial arts and they're used to getting

1599
01:27:32.091 --> 01:27:35.300
banged up.
You know your injuries,
you have a different perception of them.

1600
01:27:35.301 --> 01:27:38.020
Like I've talked to people that go,
well,
how many surgeries you had?
I'm like,

1601
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:42.050
Oh fuck no.
Three knees knows this.
They start going through all the,

1602
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:44.920
why do you keep doing it?
Why would you keep doing it?
Like,
well,

1603
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:48.850
you just get it fixed.
As people stop talking,

1604
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:52.780
you're talking about exactly the same mechanism.
It's a rewiring.
Once you get,

1605
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:56.360
once you get to that point where you know,
like everybody is like,
hey,

1606
01:27:56.361 --> 01:27:59.510
you should stop.
And you start driving on like things start getting rewired,

1607
01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.390
right.
You know,
and I don't know man.
Dapped right?
Oh yeah.

1608
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:06.240
They fucking adapt in the craziest ways.
One,

1609
01:28:06.241 --> 01:28:08.670
you've got to push yourself into that.
You've got a premise that brought,

1610
01:28:09.850 --> 01:28:14.060
all right fun.
We'll have it taints on.
Number five,
he just cracked.

1611
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.900
And this is,
I'm in America.
We're not in Iraq anymore.

1612
01:28:17.901 --> 01:28:19.760
I can fucking do what I want.
I have a bad Iraq.

1613
01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:23.450
You've got a back of them over there for us.
I mean,
we got 30 more.
No problem.

1614
01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:27.710
You [inaudible] they don't,
they sell them at a Saks.
Now

1615
01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:34.490
what I've been meaning to ask you this,
this stuff is delicious,

1616
01:28:34.491 --> 01:28:38.240
but what the fuck is going on in there?
And what does [inaudible] means?
Nitrogen,

1617
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:42.120
<v 1>the nitrogen.
Uh,
uh,
our roaster,</v>

1618
01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:47.700
David's entertained over at,
via Miriam and caveman coffee,
a warehouse.

1619
01:28:47.701 --> 01:28:52.680
He made a mechanism.
He and another engineer friend of ours that came in,
Joe,

1620
01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:57.390
and they infuse nitrogen into the canyon process.
And so there's gas,

1621
01:28:57.391 --> 01:29:00.930
there's gaseous nitrogen that's in here that causes a little bubbles kind of

1622
01:29:00.931 --> 01:29:02.010
like Guinness like effect

1623
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:06.940
<v 0>and um,
I dunno the science behind it,
uh,</v>

1624
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.700
of how it all works but can only be candid.

1625
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:13.920
It can't be bottled in the same degree to that,
um,
to,
to where we want to get it.

1626
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:17.610
And I think those little bubbles get you a little high off caffeine better.
Yeah.

1627
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.500
Is there any science behind that or is it just that's guesswork.
Very sense.

1628
01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.460
My own science.
Typical tastes good.
It tastes great.

1629
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:25.620
And then how you want to get you fucking jacked.

1630
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:27.750
I throw one of these down before I hit the gym.

1631
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.380
I think David was telling me,
I could be wrong on this,

1632
01:29:34.381 --> 01:29:36.540
but I think he said there's three times the caffeine of a red bull.

1633
01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.840
All woe be enough to stop your heart.

1634
01:29:43.450 --> 01:29:46.450
He's a fucking true.
How's that possible?
Don't kill you man.

1635
01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.480
Did she stop numbers?

1636
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:53.520
How many milligrams are exes of your a weed?

1637
01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:58.210
Brownie d I mean moderate kill some people when it goes.
Some people,
Joe,

1638
01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:02.140
the weak ones can when it comes to weed,
the edible weed.
I'm a moderate Amani.

1639
01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:05.370
When you talked to Joey Diaz,
he's a radical.
I'm a moderate.

1640
01:30:05.371 --> 01:30:08.180
He almost killed his poor guy,
Liam saying these PSI.

1641
01:30:08.181 --> 01:30:11.460
It tried to hang with him and I was and I was like,
you've become retarded.
No,

1642
01:30:11.461 --> 01:30:14.970
not just even tried to hang with them.
Joey mixes up the edibles.

1643
01:30:15.090 --> 01:30:18.060
He'll take a 500 milligram one,
pull it out of the wrapper,

1644
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:21.630
put it in a 200 milligram one and tie it up and hand it to him.

1645
01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:25.020
So He's more than double dosing them.
Oh yeah,

1646
01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:29.880
you would call a chemical.
That sounds awesome to me.

1647
01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:34.170
That's right in my wheelhouse.
Before we got boring suits man.

1648
01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:36.620
Like how did you go from uh,

1649
01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:40.530
from being a hobbyist and kind of a professional training guys to how to get in

1650
01:30:40.531 --> 01:30:43.200
with suits.
Let them ask that.
But before we forget about this,

1651
01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.640
how many milligrams we talking about in this caffeine,

1652
01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.160
because this isn't a red bill,

1653
01:30:47.161 --> 01:30:52.160
like 200 fucking milligrams is equivalent to like three cups of coffee right
now.

1654
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:55.580
Yeah.
Yeah.
I see.
If he has this been tested,
we'll test it.

1655
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:59.250
And we're doing it right now,
Joe.
Well,
I mean like,
like a laboratory.

1656
01:30:59.251 --> 01:31:01.470
I don't think we're close but tested for a lot of different things.

1657
01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:05.880
My very scientific study go,
um,
gangrene.

1658
01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:08.040
I think we should probably find out.

1659
01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:12.930
I want to know where do you want into like an altruistic idea of going,

1660
01:31:12.931 --> 01:31:15.830
I want to help these guys in the navy seal foundation and,

1661
01:31:15.831 --> 01:31:18.090
and where that whole idea came from and you're like,
here's,

1662
01:31:18.091 --> 01:31:19.830
I want to still serve and how can I serve?

1663
01:31:19.831 --> 01:31:22.200
Because the reason you're not as you're medically discharged,
right?

1664
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:25.590
So then how do I keep being a soldier in this way?

1665
01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:29.080
<v 3>How did you get medically retired?
Uh,
you know,
uh,
so,
uh,</v>

1666
01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:33.390
I was in for one month shy of 17 years,
so 16 years and 11 months.

1667
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:37.710
I figured the Gov you can spot me 30 days.
So I just say 17 years.
Uh,
but it was,

1668
01:31:37.711 --> 01:31:40.560
uh,
you know,
it's bumps and bruises along the way.
Uh,

1669
01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:45.060
a bunch of combat deployments blown up a few times,
close to breaching charges,

1670
01:31:45.570 --> 01:31:49.820
helicopter crashes,
vehicle crashes.
I got shot in the hip in 2005.
So it's like,

1671
01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:54.510
it's succotash of injuries that add up,
you know,
ounces becomes pounds become,

1672
01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:57.450
you're done.
You can't do it anymore.
Uh,

1673
01:31:57.630 --> 01:32:00.760
so I got medically retired and this actually ties into the question that

1674
01:32:00.761 --> 01:32:04.450
[inaudible] asked me.
I got medically retired and when I first got out,

1675
01:32:04.451 --> 01:32:06.400
I got out the last day of June,
2013.

1676
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:10.810
And I remember driving onto the base on is like,
awesome.
You know,

1677
01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:13.900
all I ever wanted to do since I was a little kid,
as be a seal since I was 11.

1678
01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:18.460
Can't articulate why,
it's just what I knew I wanted to do.
And,
uh,

1679
01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:22.330
so I left.
I'm like,
this is,
this is awesome.
I got to do,
I've got to prove myself.

1680
01:32:22.331 --> 01:32:25.300
I got to experience pre nine 11.
I got to experience war time,

1681
01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:29.290
which a lot of guys hang their hat way too much on the combat stuff,
you know,

1682
01:32:29.291 --> 01:32:31.090
because it's,
it's really a matter of timing.

1683
01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.790
The guys after Vietnam before nine 11 got nothing.

1684
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:37.500
It doesn't mean they're not good seals are good soldiers.
Uh,
and I,

1685
01:32:37.501 --> 01:32:39.940
I felt like we had accomplished a lot.
Like,
like I was saying,

1686
01:32:39.941 --> 01:32:44.530
like we had very black and white,
uh,
metrics for success.

1687
01:32:44.531 --> 01:32:45.221
Did we get the guy,

1688
01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:48.310
did we not get the guys so you can kind of rack and stack the stuff that you did

1689
01:32:48.311 --> 01:32:50.560
throughout your career?
And I was like,
cool,

1690
01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:53.890
didn't pay attention to a whole lot of stuff for like six months and then

1691
01:32:53.891 --> 01:32:56.170
started watching the news after six months.
And it's just,

1692
01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:02.100
it's like every story that I hear about isis taking back Ramadi and you have to

1693
01:33:02.281 --> 01:33:06.820
starts in northern Iraq and then they take back Ramadi.
It's like,
fuck,
you know,

1694
01:33:06.821 --> 01:33:11.740
it's,
I equate it to watching the tide go out.
It just a little bit at the time.

1695
01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:15.700
But the problem for me is that that tide that's eroding is the literal blood

1696
01:33:15.701 --> 01:33:15.971
sweat.

1697
01:33:15.971 --> 01:33:19.060
And Tears of people that I was with and people that I still know their overseas

1698
01:33:19.810 --> 01:33:21.490
and even though I'm out of the military now,

1699
01:33:21.491 --> 01:33:25.790
like I'm never going to lose that desire to fight like I,
you know,

1700
01:33:25.791 --> 01:33:29.430
and I want to go over there and kill those people.
I do ev,

1701
01:33:29.530 --> 01:33:31.480
I think about it every day,
every day.

1702
01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:35.140
I wish I could go over there and just canoes somebody's head for threatening our

1703
01:33:35.141 --> 01:33:38.140
country and what we stand for and people can hate me for that if they want to.

1704
01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.960
I don't give a shit.
That's who,
that's what I stand for.
It's who I am.
You know,

1705
01:33:40.961 --> 01:33:42.280
you're very open about it.

1706
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:47.170
There's not a lot of people express it in such an honest and an open way.

1707
01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:51.970
What kind of repercussions of you had from talking about it like that to my
face.

1708
01:33:51.971 --> 01:33:56.680
Nothing.
Of course
on the intranet,
people go,

1709
01:33:56.681 --> 01:33:59.620
they'll lose their shit.
I'll get laid and the comments on,
Oh yeah,

1710
01:33:59.650 --> 01:34:02.830
well right now I'm sure if we opened up Twitter it would probably be a fucking

1711
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:06.880
bloodbath.
But here's the thing though,
but it's not,
it is nonsense man.

1712
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:08.500
Because how can you know to put my,

1713
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.620
like put yourself in like every guy that I know,
man.

1714
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:16.060
And I've had the pleasure to know a few guys that are in Spec ops and that way

1715
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:19.480
there's not anybody that hasn't seen shit that's so horrific.

1716
01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:21.550
And that is like there's people that need to get erased.

1717
01:34:21.551 --> 01:34:24.600
And I'm with that thinking man and God bless you.
You know,

1718
01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:28.450
I think I'm open with it because I finally came to the conclusion that I don't

1719
01:34:28.451 --> 01:34:31.030
have any time in my life to be anything other than myself.

1720
01:34:31.210 --> 01:34:35.470
And the one thing that I do know about myself is I know what I believe in and I

1721
01:34:35.471 --> 01:34:38.800
believe in it enough to fight for it.
And I believe in it enough to die for it.

1722
01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:41.950
And I certainly believe in it enough to end other people's life for it.

1723
01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:44.800
And I don't care if people like that or not.
That's,
but that's me.
You know,

1724
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:48.040
I would love to see you have a conversation cause you're so intelligent and

1725
01:34:48.041 --> 01:34:48.640
articulate.

1726
01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.610
I would love to see you have a conversation with like a hardcore passivist.

1727
01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:54.160
I can start a pacifist,
new violent person,
very easy.

1728
01:34:54.161 --> 01:34:56.530
I just put a gun to their kid's head.
They're not a pacifist anymore.

1729
01:34:57.230 --> 01:34:58.430
I've seen plenty of pacifists

1730
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:01.280
<v 4>who fight for their life.
There's a lot of hippies that talk all that piece.</v>

1731
01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.800
Shouldn't tell somebody scuffs their toes.
Well,
it's the idea.

1732
01:35:03.801 --> 01:35:06.590
I think what we're moving towards as a race,

1733
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:11.620
I think we're moving away from being cave men to moving to some higher ideals,

1734
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:13.250
which like we're talking about today,

1735
01:35:13.251 --> 01:35:16.070
is the safest time pretty much ever in human history.

1736
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:19.670
It's about as safe as it can get more people than ever before,

1737
01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:22.620
but the likelihood of you experiencing violence is probably lower than ever

1738
01:35:22.621 --> 01:35:24.680
before.
It's still exists of course,

1739
01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:29.370
but there's less of it and statistically it's almost odd.
Obsolete.
But I don't,

1740
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:32.540
don't you feel that the,
I mean,
people still need to feel accountable.

1741
01:35:32.541 --> 01:35:33.560
It's like the only dickheads.

1742
01:35:33.630 --> 01:35:36.320
If you found a real dickhead that's over 30 years old,

1743
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:39.040
that guy's never been punched in the mouth at a certain slightly.

1744
01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:42.680
Nicole got a find their accountability and it takes,
sometimes for some dudes,

1745
01:35:42.681 --> 01:35:45.770
they just need to get exed out.
Well,
there's a lot of people that don't,

1746
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:48.980
they've never experienced any kind of violence or any kind of conflict.

1747
01:35:48.981 --> 01:35:50.030
And because of that,

1748
01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:54.800
they're really flippant about the words and they get in front of the computer

1749
01:35:54.801 --> 01:35:57.980
screen,
you know what I mean?
And that,
and that's the thing,
like,
go ahead.

1750
01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:02.690
Why saw a guy take a picture of chuck of a Rashad Evans Rather,
you know,

1751
01:36:02.691 --> 01:36:06.800
Rashad is a famous photo Rashad shot when he was knocked out by Lyoto Machida.

1752
01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:07.641
And,
uh,

1753
01:36:07.641 --> 01:36:12.020
this guy handed him this photo with a big smile on his face and asked him to

1754
01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:16.790
sign it.
It's like one of the most painful moments of Rashad's career.
And,
uh,

1755
01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:17.271
you know,

1756
01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:21.290
this guy standing right in front of Rashad and Rashad grabbed the picture and

1757
01:36:21.291 --> 01:36:24.740
crumpled it up right in his face and like looking at him like,
dude,

1758
01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:28.190
what the fuck are you doing?
You're,
you're in.
He,
well,
he couldn't

1759
01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:32.810
like out,
you know what I'm saying?
But you know what I'm saying?

1760
01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:36.020
They ain't gonna help you.
But here's a guy that,
let's put that in the revenge.

1761
01:36:36.021 --> 01:36:39.290
He knows,
but he knows that he's going to get away with this.

1762
01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:41.330
Like this is a guy doesn't respect the,

1763
01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.510
doesn't respect what he's standing in front of.
Like you're,

1764
01:36:44.511 --> 01:36:48.590
you're petting a fucking lion.
You just smacked the line in the face.
You just,

1765
01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:52.970
you did just did some space to a professional fighter at the highest caliber.

1766
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:55.030
I mean,
he's a former world champion and you're,

1767
01:36:55.031 --> 01:36:58.700
you're standing in front of him mocking him with one of his most devastating

1768
01:36:58.790 --> 01:37:00.680
defeats and that,

1769
01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:05.750
that comes from not experiencing conflict,
not being punched in the face.

1770
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:11.510
He can't punch somebody in the face.
They know your special,
everybody's special.

1771
01:37:11.511 --> 01:37:15.100
Like,
I want a participation trophy just for this conversation.
You will get one

1772
01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:20.310
of us get an equal participation one right now.
Mother fucker.

1773
01:37:20.670 --> 01:37:22.550
I've talked about this tape that like,
uh,

1774
01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:27.110
one of the things that we appreciate about guys who have trained and guys who,

1775
01:37:27.170 --> 01:37:31.850
uh,
if competed even more so is that they have,
there are some of the,

1776
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:35.330
I mean this,
there's outliers,
there's Douche bags,
but for the most part,

1777
01:37:35.331 --> 01:37:39.200
pretty respectful people are pretty cool.
Yeah.
I mean fun and competitive,

1778
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:42.950
but that's not a hobby.
Hobbyists,
maybe you'll find a few dickheads in there,

1779
01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:47.210
but guys that are competitors,
man,
fuck,
that's rare.
I don't,
you know,

1780
01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:51.020
it doesn't come up because you have to face your demons in order to get better.

1781
01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.290
And you can't pretend.
You can't pretend and you know what it is.

1782
01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.130
You know what it is to have laid yourself

1783
01:37:56.130 --> 01:38:00.000
<v 0>all out there and not come up rich on the day.
You don't even know what it is.</v>

1784
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:03.420
How many dickhead black belts in Jiu Jitsu if you met God damn,

1785
01:38:03.421 --> 01:38:07.230
it's not even 1% yeah,
no,
it's not even 1%.
And here's the thing though.

1786
01:38:07.231 --> 01:38:07.741
More and more.

1787
01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:10.410
There's more people that are becoming black belts that shouldn't be probably now

1788
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:13.800
maybe that there's a lot of people that I really don't like that are out there

1789
01:38:13.801 --> 01:38:17.490
that get black belts and that they don't,
they've never competed.

1790
01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:20.010
This idea that like everybody,
if you stick around long enough,

1791
01:38:20.011 --> 01:38:22.050
we'll get a black belt.
Well No,
fuck that you shouldn't,

1792
01:38:22.051 --> 01:38:23.610
you don't deserve a fucking black belt.

1793
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:26.830
Like there's a lot of people that don't deserve fucking black belts and man,

1794
01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:28.800
you know what I mean?
And you don't carry yourself like that.

1795
01:38:28.801 --> 01:38:30.330
I don't even care if you're the best guy in the mat.

1796
01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:32.880
You still don't deserve it if you don't carry yourself well in life.

1797
01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:36.030
Or if you injure people on the tensions,
a ton of things,
right.

1798
01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:40.890
Especially if you enjoy like blue belts rolling against this guy's.
It was,

1799
01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:43.480
there was always a guy in every school,
they're like,

1800
01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:46.410
will injure people and people will avoid them.
Like get away from that guy.

1801
01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:46.761
I mean,
I,

1802
01:38:46.761 --> 01:38:50.430
I valued Jujitsu so much that I feel like if you're not carrying that well and

1803
01:38:50.431 --> 01:38:54.120
representing that well and you're a bully in the street or you're this or you're

1804
01:38:54.121 --> 01:38:56.900
that like you need to walk right man.
That like that is a,

1805
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000
that's a honorable thing that's on us to carry your fucking shoulders and if

1806
01:39:02.371 --> 01:39:04.140
you're not,
then that's a problem for me.

1807
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:05.870
<v 3>Like,
like you're saying,</v>

1808
01:39:05.871 --> 01:39:09.110
the guy who wanted him to sign a photo at one of his worst moments,

1809
01:39:09.230 --> 01:39:11.360
the guy asking him to sign that photo,

1810
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:15.920
had he taken the effort and the thought and put the work in and of himself

1811
01:39:15.921 --> 01:39:17.620
become one of the black belts that you're talking about,

1812
01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:20.300
the less than 1% he'd never would have never asked him to do it.

1813
01:39:20.301 --> 01:39:24.770
There's something in that exploration of who you are that brings something out

1814
01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:29.090
and I think it,
I,
I dunno,
it,
it drives me insane.

1815
01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:34.820
I like my sons will have visceral physical experiences.
They can push themselves,

1816
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.950
they will be competitors.
I'm not going to shy away from that.

1817
01:39:36.951 --> 01:39:38.630
They're not going to get a participation medal.

1818
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:42.650
They're going to get told when their performance was subpar because that's the

1819
01:39:42.651 --> 01:39:46.820
way the world is.
And I don't want them being that dude like,
hey here,
chill.

1820
01:39:46.821 --> 01:39:48.250
You just got knocked out.
Can you sign that picture?

1821
01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:51.600
<v 0>Yeah.
But when you get out of school and you find out that participating doesn't</v>

1822
01:39:51.601 --> 01:39:53.470
matter in that,
you know,
and that and that.

1823
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.320
I think that's the difference though too with being a,

1824
01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:58.980
and to say it in a different way,
a participant versus a spectator.

1825
01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:02.460
Like there's people that are about it and are about shine in their life up into

1826
01:40:02.461 --> 01:40:06.000
a whole different way,
don't want to have a common experience and all that stuff.

1827
01:40:06.001 --> 01:40:07.710
And then they're pushing themselves towards that end.

1828
01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:12.960
And then there's people that are just spectators and fuck you.
Like that's why

1829
01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:21.560
people will be like,
people,
people fight for the fans and this,
that.
And I'm like,

1830
01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:25.170
you don't have any fucking idea.
That makes me angry.

1831
01:40:25.171 --> 01:40:26.970
When people say that you should fight for the fence,

1832
01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:31.320
you're not going to fight smart.
And fighting for the fans to put on a show is,

1833
01:40:31.321 --> 01:40:34.490
hey,
you get fucking brain damage.
And they don't care anyway.
The fungal fucks,

1834
01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:35.510
they don't care.
They'll,
well,

1835
01:40:35.511 --> 01:40:38.400
they'll forget about you if you have a poor performance in your next fight.

1836
01:40:38.401 --> 01:40:40.670
If you get knocked out in the next fight that defines you.
Right?

1837
01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:41.910
How could you even do that?

1838
01:40:41.911 --> 01:40:45.280
How could you even get in there and the mindset of I'm going to give us to have,

1839
01:40:45.610 --> 01:40:46.443
there's a lot of,

1840
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:49.230
there's guys that demanded stand up fights because they were like,

1841
01:40:49.231 --> 01:40:51.990
that's more exciting.
So they weren't very good at striking and then,

1842
01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:54.130
but that went a,
when I was fighting at that

1843
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:56.410
<v 1>time,
that was a huge thing when guys weren't very well rounded.</v>

1844
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:58.090
There were really great wrestlers are great at this.

1845
01:40:58.091 --> 01:41:01.930
They wanted to show off their striking skills whether they were there or not and

1846
01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:03.910
they put themselves in bad predicament.
I have a friend

1847
01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:07.310
<v 2>who I love dearly,
a great guy who was talking about,</v>

1848
01:41:07.311 --> 01:41:10.460
he's a fighter and he made some crazy post about,
uh,

1849
01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:15.050
he like fuck technical striking.
I just get out there and bang and I was like,

1850
01:41:15.051 --> 01:41:17.950
Jesus Christ dude.
Like what are you talking about?
Like,
first of all,

1851
01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.240
get out there and Bang Ludwig,
like to have that kind of technical,
yeah.

1852
01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:23.240
Like you want to be a high level striker,
like bang.

1853
01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:27.200
I think he was as frustrated as at a low point in his life when he said that.

1854
01:41:27.201 --> 01:41:29.540
But you,
you,
that's not an option.

1855
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:33.190
If you're fighting and Anderson Silva or you know,
a go cotton sock,
those guys,

1856
01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.380
real technical strikes.
Yeah.
They hope you get crazy and come out and just do it.

1857
01:41:36.381 --> 01:41:37.970
They're going to slice and dice you to pieces.

1858
01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:42.200
But you think you could do that to Floyd Mayweather?
I think no one's tried.

1859
01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:46.980
Right?
Like,
of course they've tried
anybody else.

1860
01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:51.740
Two people have even hit him and his whole fucking career,
you know,
I mean,

1861
01:41:51.741 --> 01:41:56.741
but this idea that you should do that and risk yourself and bang it out to like

1862
01:41:57.321 --> 01:42:00.800
be more exciting that you're only being exciting to fools who don't understand

1863
01:42:00.801 --> 01:42:05.240
what it is.
Right.
It's like saying,
forget about,
uh,
you know,
all the buildup to,

1864
01:42:05.241 --> 01:42:07.680
uh,
you know,
figure out,
you know,

1865
01:42:07.681 --> 01:42:11.690
it is a figure out a song that has like a build up.
Like,
I'm a free bird.

1866
01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:12.780
Forget all that buildup.

1867
01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:16.310
Just go right into that guitar solo or forget about all the point.
Is the core,

1868
01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:17.280
be open to the chorus.

1869
01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:20.660
We get all the parts of Rambo that set up the fact that he's angry.

1870
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:25.400
Let's just have a two hour movie of Rambo cutting heads off one side of his lip

1871
01:42:25.401 --> 01:42:29.480
up.
Just fucking,
yeah,
that's the whole movie.
No,

1872
01:42:29.481 --> 01:42:31.670
it doesn't work that way.
That's not,
you know,

1873
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:35.600
there's wild crazy moments in fights where guys decide to open up,

1874
01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:37.340
but they decided to open up ticket.
It's a,

1875
01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:40.370
it should be a calculated risk fueled by emotion

1876
01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.101
<v 1>as,
I mean,</v>

1877
01:42:41.101 --> 01:42:45.030
the best example of that that I remember seeing live is when we went and it was

1878
01:42:45.031 --> 01:42:49.110
the first time I saw Anderson fight live and he fought Chris Leben.
Oh yeah.

1879
01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:53.400
Chris is a savage and he's great.
He's got good boxing,
he's powerful.

1880
01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:58.080
He's all that stuff and he was so outclass that he almost knocked himself out.

1881
01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.310
Anderson had such great footwork and he was so fluid that he would fall.

1882
01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:04.770
He fall down like six times without Anderson touching them.

1883
01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:08.160
Like it was just like he'd load up for a punch and then Anderson wasn't there

1884
01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.500
and then Chris is catching himself on the fence and I was like,

1885
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:11.820
this is next level.

1886
01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.660
<v 2>Well he was just,
it was a,</v>

1887
01:43:13.730 --> 01:43:18.230
that was a perfect example of the two opposite ends.
Right?
Right.

1888
01:43:18.231 --> 01:43:21.740
Like one guy who's just hard ass,
hard,
powerful,

1889
01:43:21.741 --> 01:43:25.130
just tough goes after it every time.
Face first.

1890
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:26.690
And the other guy who was a master,

1891
01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:31.100
it was just a master and a master of that moment to a master staying calm in

1892
01:43:31.101 --> 01:43:32.990
that moment and capitalizing

1893
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.620
<v 1>it wasn't like that.
I mean some of the auto move right out of the way.</v>

1894
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:40.430
Tito go in for a double leg and it's just all facing the fence and it's like

1895
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:41.420
little is not there anymore.

1896
01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.200
<v 2>So basically one guy's playing checkers and the other guys playing chess.
Yeah.</v>

1897
01:43:45.201 --> 01:43:47.900
And the reality is with those guys,
it's like there's,

1898
01:43:47.901 --> 01:43:49.790
there's guys out there that are better than that.

1899
01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:52.130
That's the thing when it comes just ended up striking

1900
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:54.710
<v 0>is when evolution,
like in five years,</v>

1901
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:56.710
those guys aren't even going to be relevant anymore.

1902
01:43:56.750 --> 01:44:00.230
They won't even be able to compete at the lower levels and that was an elite
guy,

1903
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:05.480
<v 4>guys in the UFC that have the kind of standup that maybe like yachts and Cli has</v>

1904
01:44:05.481 --> 01:44:06.710
or Giorgio Petrosian

1905
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:10.980
<v 0>or maybe Keanu Reeves in the matrix,
like you're going to see crazy,
crazy,</v>

1906
01:44:10.981 --> 01:44:11.814
crazy shit.

1907
01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:17.230
<v 4>Shut up.
Don't look at me like
shut up with your not talking.</v>

1908
01:44:17.231 --> 01:44:19.170
It's still the thing of you know this,

1909
01:44:19.171 --> 01:44:22.470
this idea that you're supposed to be doing it for the fans.
Well,
what's fans?

1910
01:44:22.530 --> 01:44:23.510
Because the real fans,

1911
01:44:23.530 --> 01:44:26.690
the people that actually understand and appreciate the technical aspect of the

1912
01:44:26.691 --> 01:44:29.910
sport,
you do it for your teammates and for your coaches and you hope that,
yeah,

1913
01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:34.050
you can honor their flag.
Did you see Timothy Bradley's fight this weekend?

1914
01:44:34.590 --> 01:44:37.950
Teddy Atlas?
Yeah.
That's the answer to that.
Sorry to interrupt you,

1915
01:44:37.951 --> 01:44:41.340
but that's okay.
That was the the,
yeah,
I was going to tell a way long,

1916
01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.330
more long winded version of that,
but he just said he answered his own question.

1917
01:44:46.410 --> 01:44:48.930
Did you see the Timothy Bradley fight this past week?
I didn't.

1918
01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:50.820
Teddy Atlas is his coach now.

1919
01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:54.750
Teddy Atlas came out of retirement for Timothy Bradley and Timothy Bradley put

1920
01:44:54.751 --> 01:44:58.200
on the best performance of his career and tech and Teddy Atlas is fucking

1921
01:44:58.201 --> 01:45:01.230
screaming at them in between corn in the,
in,
in the corner,

1922
01:45:01.231 --> 01:45:04.270
in between rounds like before he stopped him and he's like,

1923
01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:08.550
<v 0>are you ready for the fight?
The fires common with firemen.
We don't,</v>

1924
01:45:08.610 --> 01:45:12.750
we don't run away from the fire.
We went towards the fire.
We live in the fire.

1925
01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:14.760
You see Timothy Prize,
I guess coach has coach

1926
01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:18.570
<v 4>and his goes out there and he just stellar performance,</v>

1927
01:45:18.571 --> 01:45:20.490
best performance of Timothy Bradley's career.

1928
01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:25.650
But it's this appreciation of the technical aspect being coached by a real

1929
01:45:25.651 --> 01:45:29.370
master and Teddy Atlas and the guy who he really respects.
He's like,

1930
01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:32.730
and he was talking about it before the fight,
like no cell phones in the gym.
No,

1931
01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:36.010
no music,
no nothing.
Put all that shit aside.
There's no one in there.

1932
01:45:36.011 --> 01:45:39.120
It was just him and Teddy Atlas and they showed them work and adjust those to

1933
01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:41.430
jump.
Yeah,
just working,
just working,

1934
01:45:41.431 --> 01:45:44.190
men's working and you know also you know sparring partners and all that stuff

1935
01:45:44.191 --> 01:45:44.401
too.

1936
01:45:44.401 --> 01:45:48.330
But like when when their their work and there's no bullshit and showing pictures

1937
01:45:48.331 --> 01:45:52.260
of play that play this because this is fucking intense.
This is fucking intense.

1938
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:55.380
<v 6>Are you ready for the pilot</v>

1939
01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:01.560
doesn't bother us.
We live in a,

1940
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:05.670
when you go rent a home,

1941
01:46:09.570 --> 01:46:10.403
what do we do?

1942
01:46:18.670 --> 01:46:23.290
<v 0>I want to go beat someone's ass.
Fucking goosebumps.
What's going?</v>

1943
01:46:23.291 --> 01:46:26.340
Holy Shit.
That's like coach Man Jack.
Greg Jackson was like that.

1944
01:46:26.350 --> 01:46:28.420
We get comfortable where other men are uncomfortable.

1945
01:46:28.530 --> 01:46:31.360
You've got gotta become make that make that discomfort your living room.

1946
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:36.470
But he's fucking screaming and he's got that scar across his face where he's

1947
01:46:36.471 --> 01:46:39.460
been bottled but he's getting the reaction he was looking for like it's an

1948
01:46:39.461 --> 01:46:42.400
effective peace.
He's firing that dude up.

1949
01:46:42.401 --> 01:46:45.340
I mean where you jump and that you're explaining that like what do you think?

1950
01:46:45.341 --> 01:46:50.030
Like I was talking with Brendan,
Brendan Gibson and bout it and,
and

1951
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:55.040
<v 1>like the idea of to throw all caution to the wind and let your training take</v>

1952
01:46:55.051 --> 01:46:56.400
over and get into that place.

1953
01:46:56.550 --> 01:47:00.150
Cause you see guys fight too cautiously and when a guy walks out savage,

1954
01:47:00.151 --> 01:47:03.120
they like you and you see that like with the Vandelay Silva never had a problem

1955
01:47:03.121 --> 01:47:04.180
doing that.
And,
and,

1956
01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:09.600
and what do you think to throw yourself into that experience without being

1957
01:47:09.601 --> 01:47:13.110
thoughtful of it?
Does training takeover and take care of you?

1958
01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:16.280
<v 4>Depends on who you're fighting to.
You know some guys you can,</v>

1959
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:17.540
some guys you can do that too.

1960
01:47:17.541 --> 01:47:20.090
And some guys you can't like how about Vandelay versus Cro cop?

1961
01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:22.340
Like it didn't work right?
You can't do that.

1962
01:47:22.341 --> 01:47:26.410
Cro Cop was just such a much better technical striker and Vandelay was Chad.

1963
01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:29.960
He was like two 18 just a,

1964
01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:33.050
he was a 99% Mexican supplements going in there.

1965
01:47:33.051 --> 01:47:34.770
He was barely a human supplements.

1966
01:47:34.771 --> 01:47:38.660
He's coming there guns blazing and just tell he's not Mexican.
He's Brazilian.

1967
01:47:38.690 --> 01:47:41.330
That's where you get that shit though.
Mexico Bro.
You get it from Mexico.

1968
01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:42.680
What do you think when you jump?

1969
01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:46.430
I mean these might be underwhelmed sometime not a lot,

1970
01:47:46.690 --> 01:47:49.730
but I think is a different thing because the only opponent is your nerves and

1971
01:47:49.731 --> 01:47:54.200
your mind and worried about one or two years if it translated to other avenues

1972
01:47:54.201 --> 01:47:55.120
of that kind of flow.

1973
01:47:55.610 --> 01:48:00.080
Finding is like the technical aspects of fighting are so unique and that you

1974
01:48:00.081 --> 01:48:03.860
have all these choices of how to engage,
what to do with how do you agree?
Fine.

1975
01:48:03.861 --> 01:48:07.170
You have to,
you got to shuffle those based off of what you're seeing.
Like yeah,

1976
01:48:07.250 --> 01:48:10.520
I mean it and you guys wonder micro decisions all the time.

1977
01:48:10.521 --> 01:48:13.130
You guys eyes are unpredictable and diverse.

1978
01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:15.500
You wonder why I think you guys are nuts.
Like

1979
01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:21.810
<v 1>I tell you,
man,
I like,
I think,
I dunno.
To me,
I think every little boy out there,</v>

1980
01:48:21.811 --> 01:48:22.680
it's like,
man,

1981
01:48:22.681 --> 01:48:26.640
it'd be dope to be a navy seal or whatever or all that kind of stuff.
Man.
I mean,

1982
01:48:26.641 --> 01:48:30.780
I got such an admiration for you dude.
For sure.
Yeah,
for sure.
I mean that's,

1983
01:48:30.810 --> 01:48:34.560
that's one of the most difficult and dangerous things a human being and choose

1984
01:48:34.561 --> 01:48:39.200
to do.
And I get offended a little bit when you go,
oh no,
what you guys,

1985
01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:43.920
it's like I don't understand at all what you guys go through and like the,

1986
01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.460
the positions that you've been in,
the kind of consequences that are there,

1987
01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:51.240
your brothers lives in your hands and fucking God bless you man.

1988
01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:55.510
<v 4>Think Andy might be a little humility here and take,
don't be so sensitive.</v>

1989
01:48:55.511 --> 01:48:59.420
All right.
Tell him either get a lot offended or don't get it.
It's just not,

1990
01:48:59.470 --> 01:49:03.160
it's just,
there's no comparison being it,
it was a part of it though,
right?

1991
01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:08.470
The emotions and the whole thing.
It's an interesting life to lead.

1992
01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:12.240
But the most important question of today is how do I get you out of an airplane

1993
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:13.143
happening?

1994
01:49:13.230 --> 01:49:17.950
But there's no way a lot of shit already go watch,

1995
01:49:17.951 --> 01:49:19.680
go cheer you waiting on ground.

1996
01:49:20.130 --> 01:49:20.970
<v 1>Cause I feel like,</v>

1997
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.180
I feel like it's like going swimming with the guys that are the best watermen in

1998
01:49:24.181 --> 01:49:27.060
the world.
It's kind of like nobody better to save me.

1999
01:49:27.930 --> 01:49:30.390
<v 4>You can go shoot,
I'll put you in the harness back.</v>

2000
01:49:30.450 --> 01:49:33.910
You excited about it after you told me that everybody who invented those fucking

2001
01:49:33.911 --> 01:49:36.020
things is dead.
I didn't say my take you for a wingsuit,

2002
01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:39.070
John on a window that's on your mind.
That's where it's going.
Listen,

2003
01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:42.640
I don't know me well.
We'll walk retarded.
We'll walk hand in hand together.

2004
01:49:42.641 --> 01:49:46.210
I don't push you backwards and like harness.
That's me to let that shit go.

2005
01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:47.553
Let Shit go

2006
01:49:48.450 --> 01:49:52.840
<v 3>man.
See your ass at all in that.
By the way,
that kill cliff stuff,</v>

2007
01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:54.220
that stuff is fucking delicious.

2008
01:49:54.221 --> 01:49:59.221
Isn't all like sponsored or created by military people like who's a former seal?

2009
01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:01.450
Who is the founder and then the president,

2010
01:50:01.451 --> 01:50:02.710
I don't know how they're sending it to me,

2011
01:50:02.711 --> 01:50:05.560
but they've been sending that to me forever.
People Send me Shit.

2012
01:50:05.561 --> 01:50:08.620
I don't even know how to get my address,
but I get that.
That stuff is good.

2013
01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:13.480
That mean that Shit's fun right there.
So they're sponsoring you this kill cliff.

2014
01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:17.150
So this was all based around and never got,
never answered.
Tate's question.

2015
01:50:17.151 --> 01:50:19.060
So like the footage,
the first jump you watched,

2016
01:50:19.061 --> 01:50:21.940
that was all based as a fundraiser.
He actually was uh,

2017
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:25.300
talking with you about it I think on like seven oh five or something like that.

2018
01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.970
And he's like,
hey,
you want to jump out of play?
And you're like,
fuck that guy.

2019
01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:31.240
Exactly.
So,
uh,

2020
01:50:32.110 --> 01:50:33.940
kill cliff [inaudible] there,

2021
01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:38.350
my sponsor for jumping and they have a commitment to the navy seal foundation of

2022
01:50:38.351 --> 01:50:41.850
$250,000 a year to try to give back to the guys.
You know?

2023
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.420
And when Tate asked me like,

2024
01:50:43.450 --> 01:50:47.170
how did I come up with the idea of doing something to raise money,

2025
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:51.220
it all comes to the fact that like I can't get rid of,

2026
01:50:51.221 --> 01:50:54.640
like I was telling you about my desire to go fight and do and continue to stay

2027
01:50:54.641 --> 01:50:57.220
involved,
but I can't physically do it anymore.

2028
01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:01.270
So the only thing I could think of to do was to do something to try to help the

2029
01:51:01.271 --> 01:51:03.520
guys who are doing it and this is what I'd normally do.

2030
01:51:03.521 --> 01:51:05.110
So I just tried to tie the two together.

2031
01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:07.750
What are the injuries that keep you from doing?
Like how,

2032
01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:09.160
like you seem like so fit.

2033
01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:11.680
You're doing something that this video is showing you doing all these chin ups

2034
01:51:11.681 --> 01:51:13.240
and rowing and all this crazy shit.

2035
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:15.580
So I can't feel my left leg from the knee cap down.

2036
01:51:15.670 --> 01:51:19.720
I have from [inaudible] I got so the round missed my femur,

2037
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:21.760
but wow.
What an experience.

2038
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:24.610
They don't know if he had clipped a psychotic nerve or you know,

2039
01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:27.430
have you ever seen the gelatin that gets shot by a bullet and has the
shockwaves?

2040
01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:31.840
Either way it short circuited the electrical circuitry down my leg.

2041
01:51:31.841 --> 01:51:33.850
So from the point of impact,
all the way down to my foot,

2042
01:51:33.851 --> 01:51:37.210
it was just completely fried.
I had dropped foot for a year.
What's drop foot?

2043
01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:40.300
Can't pick your foot up.
I could always Dorsiflex I could always put down,

2044
01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:40.991
push my foot down,

2045
01:51:40.991 --> 01:51:44.020
but I couldn't lift my foot up so I had to like have a little plastic brace

2046
01:51:44.021 --> 01:51:46.800
underneath my foot.
It was gnarly.
Uh,

2047
01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:51.250
and then for about six months it felt like I dip my leg and gasoline and lit it

2048
01:51:51.251 --> 01:51:55.030
on fire.
They,
yeah,
this is all just promo stuff leading up to it.
Uh,

2049
01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:58.030
so basically what I can do is,
I mean,
I can hide it really well.

2050
01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:59.290
It happened over 10 years ago,

2051
01:51:59.291 --> 01:52:04.291
so I can train around it and I try to stay as physically fit as possible so I

2052
01:52:05.231 --> 01:52:07.870
can keep doing this stuff longer.
So to this day,

2053
01:52:07.930 --> 01:52:10.110
that leg is still numb from the knee cap down.
Yeah,

2054
01:52:10.130 --> 01:52:12.940
the sciatic part of the nerve,
when it wraps over the top,
it's really bizarre.

2055
01:52:12.941 --> 01:52:16.510
Like you can scratch your fingernails across it and I'll get a delayed
sensation.

2056
01:52:16.511 --> 01:52:19.210
But it happens like six or seven seconds later.
It feels super odd.

2057
01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:20.980
And when it first happened,

2058
01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:25.780
I'd be distracted during the daytime and then I would lay down at night time to

2059
01:52:25.781 --> 01:52:29.560
try to go to sleep.
And it was,
it was,
it was hell I could,

2060
01:52:29.561 --> 01:52:32.950
it would just felt like my leg was on fire and you know,
I went and I got it.

2061
01:52:32.951 --> 01:52:36.100
That's actually how I found crossfit was rehabbing from the injury because the

2062
01:52:36.101 --> 01:52:40.780
navy's was like Percocet,
Vicodin,

2063
01:52:41.290 --> 01:52:44.700
Ambien,
something else that was blue.
And I'm just like,

2064
01:52:46.230 --> 01:52:50.780
Ryan Viagara probably that last blue one probably cannot see what I do when

2065
01:52:50.781 --> 01:52:54.770
you're all jacked up on Percocet,
ranger,
Captain Morgan.
Right.

2066
01:52:54.771 --> 01:52:58.610
Then I'd go with Captain Morgan.
It's fun.
Yeah,
that'd be good experiment.

2067
01:52:59.430 --> 01:53:04.310
So I'd fist a bottle of captain Morgan every night I go down the bottles.

2068
01:53:04.630 --> 01:53:07.670
I was taking like four or five ambien and not being able to sleep like that's

2069
01:53:07.671 --> 01:53:12.530
how far I was playing around with my own pharmaceutical.
A buffet,

2070
01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:13.790
if you will,
for how long?

2071
01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:17.870
About six months they had me on antiseizure medicine for kids,

2072
01:53:17.871 --> 01:53:20.930
which has a secondary side effect of neuropathic pain control,

2073
01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:25.640
but it also suppresses your central nervous system functioning.

2074
01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:29.330
So I still remember the day we were living in Virginia Beach and my mom,

2075
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:33.320
my wife asked me a very simple math question and I just was like,

2076
01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:38.630
I couldn't do it.
Whoa.
And so I was like,
okay.
And I s I got myself and that's,

2077
01:53:38.690 --> 01:53:39.051
you know,

2078
01:53:39.051 --> 01:53:41.990
I started going to the gym and just working out on my own and I weaned myself

2079
01:53:41.991 --> 01:53:46.430
off all this stuff and had to really graduate myself off the antiseizure stuff

2080
01:53:46.431 --> 01:53:49.670
cause you can't just stop.
And why,
why did they have you on antiseizure stuff?

2081
01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:50.533
Because the,

2082
01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:54.800
the medicine had a secondary effect of neuropathic pain control.

2083
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:56.810
So they were trying to control the burning in my leg,

2084
01:53:56.811 --> 01:54:00.020
but there was nothing that could really target it directly.
So it was for kids.

2085
01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:01.850
But if I had just stopped cold Turkey,

2086
01:54:01.851 --> 01:54:05.240
it would have drastically increased my likelihood of just having a seizure even

2087
01:54:05.241 --> 01:54:08.840
though I'm not susceptible to do it.
So it took me about another sick.
It was,

2088
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:13.040
it was,
it was gnarly.
Like my,
I can't imagine the Shit my wife put up with.

2089
01:54:13.041 --> 01:54:16.030
I would literally drink all night and just play,
you know,

2090
01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:19.640
Pez dispenser with a variety of colors that would come at me.
Couldn't sleep,

2091
01:54:19.641 --> 01:54:22.220
sleep during the daytime.
I mean,
it was a mess.

2092
01:54:22.221 --> 01:54:26.520
And what are we doing when you were up and just surfing the Internet?
I mean,

2093
01:54:26.521 --> 01:54:29.750
I don't,
I don't even remember.
I was just loaded,
you know,
and it was,

2094
01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:31.110
there wasn't a lot of,
uh,

2095
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:35.240
it wasn't a lot of mechanisms for support back then.

2096
01:54:35.241 --> 01:54:38.130
And he was 2005 it was a little bit earlier than the,
the,

2097
01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:40.460
the medical systems that are in place now.
I mean,
I,

2098
01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:43.430
I still have never had a surgery.
I've never had stitches.

2099
01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:47.450
They left everything in a,
and some of it works its way out over time.

2100
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:50.390
They flew me to Germany.
I mean,
fragments.
Yeah.

2101
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:53.750
I got about 300 pieces of frag and my left leg and then the round is still in my

2102
01:54:53.751 --> 01:54:55.920
pelvis.
Uh,
it was gnarly.
I mean,
I,

2103
01:54:55.921 --> 01:55:00.350
is there a reason to leave it in there or so because there's retained Farris

2104
01:55:00.351 --> 01:55:01.310
metal in my body,

2105
01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:05.240
they can't really image me with the magnets to get a precise location.

2106
01:55:05.241 --> 01:55:09.380
So they gave me the option when I was in the hospital in Baghdad.
They're like,

2107
01:55:09.381 --> 01:55:13.130
hey,
you know,
we can try to take it out.
I'm like,
okay,
please describe to me,

2108
01:55:13.131 --> 01:55:15.590
tell me more.
What does this process look like?
They're like,
okay,

2109
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:19.040
tube down your throat,
knock you out,
flip you over on your stomach.

2110
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:23.210
Two dimensional X-ray,
start cutting in through your ass,
pulling apart,

2111
01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:24.970
looking for the crop.

2112
01:55:27.170 --> 01:55:29.840
So I was like made a good choice,
Andy.
Yeah.
I'm like,

2113
01:55:29.841 --> 01:55:33.650
can you please describe to me the possible consequences of leaving in?

2114
01:55:33.651 --> 01:55:34.311
And he's like,
oh yeah.

2115
01:55:34.311 --> 01:55:37.220
Well the body will encapsulate it in calcium and as long as you don't have bone

2116
01:55:37.221 --> 01:55:40.160
contact with the metal,
you should be fine.
I'm like,
well fuck man,

2117
01:55:40.161 --> 01:55:43.040
why didn't you leave with that?
It's awesome.
That seems like nothing.

2118
01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:46.710
So in comparison,
there's a hard spot in my ass.
Fuck.

2119
01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:49.670
So anybody who's complaining about that,

2120
01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.690
but let's just say about what I've been fucking been through.

2121
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:55.770
Reorganize my ass golf ball in your ass.
So I left it.

2122
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:59.610
I left it,
flew to Germany,
stayed in the hospital in Germany for two days,

2123
01:55:59.611 --> 01:56:03.210
check myself out of the hospital.
It took a taxi to the airport,
flew home.

2124
01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:06.910
It was home like 48 hours after it happened.
Whoa.
It,

2125
01:56:06.911 --> 01:56:08.430
my squadron was still forward,
deployed.

2126
01:56:08.431 --> 01:56:10.650
So it was kind of on a little bit of an island by myself.

2127
01:56:10.651 --> 01:56:14.400
Not by any malicious intent of anybody,
but I was just there like,

2128
01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:16.050
I mean that was the navy's thing.
They're like,
here,

2129
01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:19.710
this is the solution to your problem.
Like some pills.
Oh yeah,
go figure it out.

2130
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:22.200
Yeah.
And you know,
what can they do other than that you would have,

2131
01:56:22.201 --> 01:56:25.680
it'd be like a project.
They would have to have a bunch of people.

2132
01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:27.900
It was really help you.
Like I said,
it was early.

2133
01:56:28.110 --> 01:56:31.950
I think now they probably have a protocol maybe specifically for neuropathic

2134
01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:34.470
pain control that they've learned over,
you know,

2135
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:38.280
over the decade that we've been fighting.
Like look at amputations,
right?

2136
01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.710
You never used to survive a single,
let alone a double amputation.
But now it,

2137
01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.260
medical advances are so far down the road that,
you know,

2138
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:46.920
triple and quad amputees are actually surviving,

2139
01:56:46.921 --> 01:56:48.720
which would never make it off the battlefield.

2140
01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:52.860
So maybe they have something now that that would help.
But that was it.
And then,

2141
01:56:52.890 --> 01:56:57.300
so I basically started working out and would exhaust myself and that's how it's

2142
01:56:57.301 --> 01:56:57.750
sleep.

2143
01:56:57.750 --> 01:57:00.990
And that's how I found crossfit and got introduced to the founder cause they

2144
01:57:00.991 --> 01:57:03.930
were founded in my hometown.
So with nerve damage,

2145
01:57:03.970 --> 01:57:08.580
there's like a tiny amount of improvement that you get one millimeter a day.

2146
01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:11.730
Yeah.
That's that drop foot coming back.
Right.
That's why it takes that,

2147
01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:14.790
it takes that long in the doctor's guys who had gone for,
you know,

2148
01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:17.850
multiples of the number of years of school that I have under my belt,

2149
01:57:17.851 --> 01:57:22.560
it would be like,
Eh,
I dunno.
Maybe that's the answers that I would get him like,

2150
01:57:22.561 --> 01:57:26.920
hey man,
am I gonna be able to walk again?
And they'd be like,
perhaps it's a,

2151
01:57:26.970 --> 01:57:30.960
it's a practice,
not a science.
Wow.
That was your drop foot cleared.

2152
01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:34.170
It's better.
I can hide it.
Like,
uh,
it's funny,

2153
01:57:34.171 --> 01:57:35.820
like if I were more like a dressy shoe,

2154
01:57:35.821 --> 01:57:37.650
you can hear my left foot hitting a little bit more.

2155
01:57:37.651 --> 01:57:40.680
But what really gets me and was one of the biggest things from my military

2156
01:57:40.681 --> 01:57:44.250
retirement is that I have a really hard time controlling a roll of the ankle to

2157
01:57:44.251 --> 01:57:48.270
the outside.
And the majority of the time when we're overseas,
I'm heavy.

2158
01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:52.200
I'm like body weight plus 80 to 120 pounds on my back.
Right.

2159
01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:54.420
So you get that off kilter at all.

2160
01:57:54.421 --> 01:57:56.550
And I have snapped my ankle over so many times,

2161
01:57:56.551 --> 01:57:58.980
almost to the point where I almost called a medivac and it was just like the

2162
01:57:58.981 --> 01:58:01.800
purple and the size of a grapefruit.
I just couldn't do it anymore.
You know,

2163
01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:06.720
people have like an abstract idea of what it's like to do what you guys do with

2164
01:58:06.810 --> 01:58:10.180
a heavy pack on.
If he never wore a pack like yeah,

2165
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:13.740
I work out with a 40 pound weight vest sometimes and I can't wait to get that

2166
01:58:13.741 --> 01:58:14.940
fucking thing off it.
It does.
It does.

2167
01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:17.910
When people that triple that and then go for a five kilometer walk

2168
01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:23.610
right into your body,
not something extended off.

2169
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.060
You're off balance and I'll hide around the corner and think about,

2170
01:58:27.061 --> 01:58:30.610
I'm going to access the enemy with a heavy ass fucking pack on it.
Yeah.

2171
01:58:30.630 --> 01:58:33.450
I mean we packed that elk out.
That's out there in the hallway.

2172
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:37.770
I had that on my back.
I probably had like 160,

2173
01:58:37.771 --> 01:58:40.650
170 pounds and I only had to walk a half mile,

2174
01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.940
which that weight at a half a mile would destroy it.

2175
01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:46.270
And I was exhausted and I couldn't.
And I'm like,
well,

2176
01:58:46.271 --> 01:58:51.271
these motherfuckers are going five kilometers a day with more than that on their

2177
01:58:51.341 --> 01:58:56.341
back and get to getting shot and to get to work and getting shot at you up.

2178
01:58:56.770 --> 01:58:59.740
Like my friend Cam,
Cam Haynes,
he uh,

2179
01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:03.070
w to prepare for elk hunting.
He'll do,
he takes a rock.

2180
01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:06.910
He has this hundred 35 pound rock and he puts it in a backpack.

2181
01:59:07.210 --> 01:59:09.400
He straps himself in and he goes up mountains with it.

2182
01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:11.020
I've seen it and he's got a particular rock.

2183
01:59:11.021 --> 01:59:13.690
I've seen his Instagram and he's like,
he's like,
yeah,
I got the rock today.

2184
01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:17.800
And what's his name?
Rob Set up.
You got to have a name for it.
It probably does.

2185
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:20.080
You know,
he probably won't tell it.
I know probably some curse.

2186
01:59:20.090 --> 01:59:22.750
You're on your own.
You're on your own to train for us like you can do.

2187
01:59:22.751 --> 01:59:25.780
There's guys who do the triathlete route.
There's guys who do the Arnold route,

2188
01:59:25.781 --> 01:59:27.640
there's guys who did the cross throughout the function.

2189
01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:31.030
Like it's everything in between.
It's put that pack on you and send you out.
Yep.

2190
01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:34.290
Now are these like a,
they have like load lifters.
Are they like,

2191
01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:37.060
like Paul on the harness it,
I mean,
so I had,

2192
01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:40.150
I basically made my own because I had all my special things that I wanted to

2193
01:59:40.151 --> 01:59:43.540
take with me and they would only fit in like the Vietnam especially

2194
01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:48.550
have missiles that I showed you the video.
Oh my God does send you that video.

2195
01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:53.060
Know what video is this?
It's awesome.
These is,

2196
01:59:53.490 --> 01:59:57.280
there's these assholes that have come and attack the base and then they go out

2197
01:59:57.281 --> 02:00:00.880
just far enough where they know a rifle round while you texted me that,

2198
02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:05.020
cause those are the things that I'm,
this t javelin missiles,

2199
02:00:05.110 --> 02:00:07.630
a javelin missile until he found boxes of those.
Right.

2200
02:00:07.810 --> 02:00:09.640
So Welborn was telling me something.

2201
02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:12.670
So I went over there and I went to the school to fire those things and I was in

2202
02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:14.170
the east coast and forgot about it.

2203
02:00:14.170 --> 02:00:17.380
And we got to Afghanistan in 2010 and I'm looking around,
I'm like,

2204
02:00:18.670 --> 02:00:20.350
those are javelin missiles,
son of a bitch.

2205
02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:23.110
I need to find a launching mechanism for those things.

2206
02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:27.640
So I went to an army unit and traded him straight up for a half shell.

2207
02:00:27.641 --> 02:00:32.641
Ballistic helmet costs $400 for the launcher cost 50,000 we did a straight up

2208
02:00:32.681 --> 02:00:35.320
trade.
I think I got a good head and a pretty good deal.

2209
02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:38.500
Took it back to the base and then hook the thing up,

2210
02:00:38.501 --> 02:00:41.350
test fired one to make sure it was all still good to go and then just started

2211
02:00:41.351 --> 02:00:42.280
carrying them in the field with me.

2212
02:00:42.281 --> 02:00:45.370
But I had to make a backpack that we carry them because that would carry two of

2213
02:00:45.371 --> 02:00:48.310
the job ones.
And then I'd have my 300 win mag on top of that too.
So that's,

2214
02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:50.170
that was my special things that I took with me.

2215
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:54.040
Jesus Christ or Jimmy had just sent it to you.
That is rad.

2216
02:00:54.330 --> 02:00:58.960
Those missiles are gnarly.
This thing that set this up.

2217
02:00:58.961 --> 02:01:03.460
So then you're aware when you're firing this and you hit that truck.

2218
02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:07.970
The truck was like two and a half kilometers away on a hill.
But I mean I,

2219
02:01:07.971 --> 02:01:10.810
I think I ended up shooting like 12 or 13 of those things.

2220
02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:13.000
They're about hunter 50 thal pot money.

2221
02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:17.290
We'll spend $150,000 a pop in the shot.
12 of them,

2222
02:01:17.291 --> 02:01:21.520
she's got $1 million where the brown plus in an afternoon,
you're welcome.

2223
02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:24.870
Not In an afternoon.
It was like an eight month time.
But dude,

2224
02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:28.570
they were so devastating because again,
we're not fighting dumb people.

2225
02:01:28.571 --> 02:01:31.540
The idiots that will go in the street and shoot an AK 47 at a predator.

2226
02:01:31.541 --> 02:01:33.880
They were gone like a week into the conflict.

2227
02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:37.450
It's a mature theater of war and they're like,
oh these guys have five,
five,

2228
02:01:37.451 --> 02:01:40.790
six they can't hit us.
So will lob seven six two.
And so they'll stay out at like,

2229
02:01:41.470 --> 02:01:46.270
you know,
1500 2000 law PK rounds in,
which is basically,
you know,
300 women gives,

2230
02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:49.700
right?
Cause you're a hunter.
It's basically a belt fed 300 win Mag gnarly.

2231
02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:50.690
It will get your head down.

2232
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:53.510
Well these missiles can go out to like three kilometers.

2233
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:56.720
So I would go out there and I let these guys sit up and high ground positions

2234
02:01:57.140 --> 02:02:00.800
and they'd be over watching our guys in the low ground and I'd wait until they

2235
02:02:00.801 --> 02:02:03.300
got a group of them together and then I would just send one of these things.

2236
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:07.330
So they're designed to uh,
hit tanks.
They're anti take,

2237
02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:08.570
it's got a double shape charge.

2238
02:02:08.571 --> 02:02:12.980
The first one's supposed to go through the smile on his face and he starts

2239
02:02:12.981 --> 02:02:16.070
describing this,
all of those things.
I wish I had one at home,

2240
02:02:17.210 --> 02:02:19.870
but you would want to shoot it.
You'd try and want to find a target?
I would,

2241
02:02:19.871 --> 02:02:22.070
I would,
but I had to get an,
I'd go to jail,
but I still would shoot it.

2242
02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:26.030
I think I need one of these new levels.
I'll have one of these with you.

2243
02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:28.370
We have a bottle opener channel.
We've got a lighter.

2244
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:30.170
So I'd let these guys go out there,
man.

2245
02:02:30.290 --> 02:02:33.920
And I'm not even get into the best part of the story because it's right before

2246
02:02:33.921 --> 02:02:37.640
it hits.
That's the best part of the story.
The uh,
you know,

2247
02:02:37.970 --> 02:02:41.210
I got tired of getting shot at and having an organic weapon on me that couldn't

2248
02:02:41.211 --> 02:02:45.200
reach him.
So I started bringing him and you know,
if you want to end a firefight,

2249
02:02:45.710 --> 02:02:46.820
you shoot one of these things.

2250
02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:50.160
I can't describe how loud great freedom to do that.

2251
02:02:50.750 --> 02:02:53.630
I mean to be like they're getting at me and I can't get at them.
And you're like,

2252
02:02:53.631 --> 02:02:57.100
you know what,
here's my solution.
And they think they can regulate them.

2253
02:02:57.110 --> 02:03:01.310
So they're just like,
oh,
what's up?
And you didn't you,
you launched this thing.

2254
02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:04.430
Yeah.
They're like,
you're just beyond my reach.
You're like,
Oh really?
And Joe,

2255
02:03:04.431 --> 02:03:06.830
here's the best part.
It has to two settings.

2256
02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:09.530
It has top attack or direct attack,

2257
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:13.730
so it'll go up and come straight down so you're not even safe hiding behind

2258
02:03:13.731 --> 02:03:18.410
things or it'll go direct attack right at the guy regardless.

2259
02:03:18.411 --> 02:03:21.350
The best part of it is,
is about a quarter of a second before it hits.

2260
02:03:21.351 --> 02:03:24.890
They make the o face,
right?
They're doing their thing.
They go,
oh shit.

2261
02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:27.860
Shinar done best part about it,
which is better for you,

2262
02:03:27.861 --> 02:03:32.600
the top or the direct top when they're hiding behind stuff.
And then to you,

2263
02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:38.240
how do you judge the drop?
Uh,
it just depends on what you [inaudible].
It's a,

2264
02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:41.390
it's a thermal camera.
You're looking through the warhead.
After you activate it,

2265
02:03:41.391 --> 02:03:43.790
you lock it on by making this box gets smaller,

2266
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:47.780
it flashes cross hairs and then you pull the trigger and it will hit whatever is

2267
02:03:47.781 --> 02:03:48.620
the cross hairs are on.

2268
02:03:48.621 --> 02:03:52.160
So you just look at the terrain and where they're at and then so it changes.

2269
02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:55.130
It makes it,
no,
you have to pick,
you have to pick when you shoot.

2270
02:03:55.131 --> 02:03:57.470
So like if they were hiding behind a wall or something that I,
you know,

2271
02:03:57.471 --> 02:04:00.230
I didn't have a direct access to them,
I would just drop it in over the top.

2272
02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:03.570
But you can drop it right where they are.
Jim.

2273
02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:08.510
It doesn't come.
What do you think of that beer right there?
It's delicious.

2274
02:04:08.690 --> 02:04:11.690
It's got damn good.
That's what we make that New Mexico.
That's one of my points.

2275
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:16.400
Is it nice.
So Joe,
those reminders,
those are my special things,
dude.

2276
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:19.250
But again,
I did that because it was out of necessity.

2277
02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:21.860
I was tired of getting shot at from a range I could do nothing about.

2278
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:25.070
And what I found was if you shoot one of those things,

2279
02:04:25.071 --> 02:04:27.350
they would leave us alone for the rest of the day.
It's the same.

2280
02:04:27.351 --> 02:04:30.050
It's the same theory is why would you kill a fly with a sledgehammer?

2281
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:31.810
It's so the other flies take notice,

2282
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:34.370
not because the sledgehammers anymore effective than any,

2283
02:04:34.610 --> 02:04:37.470
any other weapon system.
It truly works.
So you know,

2284
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:41.490
I would say I would say an argument was made that I saved life by using those.

2285
02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.170
Absolutely.
I would think that too.

2286
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:46.770
And I think that what's awesome is that you had the autonomy to be able to do

2287
02:04:46.771 --> 02:04:48.420
that.
Whereas like if you're a regular soldier,

2288
02:04:48.421 --> 02:04:52.530
you pride don't get choices like that.
They're just going off buddy.
You'd be,

2289
02:04:52.531 --> 02:04:55.350
you'd be running that up the chain of command for sure.

2290
02:04:55.890 --> 02:04:59.970
I think what's interesting too is what you told me that one day at the gym when

2291
02:04:59.971 --> 02:05:02.520
you're,
when I asked you about PTSD and things like that,

2292
02:05:02.521 --> 02:05:05.640
and that's fascinating to me.
And I,
and I'd heard,

2293
02:05:05.670 --> 02:05:09.560
I don't know who it was speaking about it,
but they said that PTSD wasn't really,

2294
02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:13.470
they don't like it being called Ptsd.
That it's because it's not hate it.

2295
02:05:13.471 --> 02:05:16.110
I don't like the d on the end cause it's not a disorder.
Right.
That's what,

2296
02:05:16.111 --> 02:05:18.150
that's what this guy was saying,
that it's not a disorder,

2297
02:05:18.151 --> 02:05:21.690
that it's a thing that is,
uh,
going to pass by and that you can get through.

2298
02:05:21.690 --> 02:05:23.370
And that's not,
not,
it may not pass,

2299
02:05:23.371 --> 02:05:27.030
but that's like we were talking about to change,
right?
In your body,

2300
02:05:27.570 --> 02:05:30.690
it's not a disorder.
If you get sick and you don't get a fever,

2301
02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:34.530
that is a disorder.
If you get sick and you get a fever,
that's totally normal.

2302
02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:37.920
So if you go out and you do these things that are not necessarily considered

2303
02:05:37.921 --> 02:05:42.000
normal or you push yourself beyond that threshold and there's a reaction that

2304
02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:45.210
your body has is that does disorder?
I don't think so at all.

2305
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:49.460
I think it should be expected at a time for you to adapt,
uh,

2306
02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:51.610
and be able to heal from some of this stuff,
you know?

2307
02:05:51.670 --> 02:05:53.790
But as soon as you label it disorder,
people shut down.

2308
02:05:53.970 --> 02:05:56.460
So do you think about it like by defining it in that way,

2309
02:05:56.461 --> 02:05:59.160
that it limits how people recover from it?
I don't,
well,

2310
02:05:59.161 --> 02:06:00.840
I think by defining it as disorder,

2311
02:06:00.841 --> 02:06:03.240
you're completely miss characterizing it because it's not,

2312
02:06:03.241 --> 02:06:06.150
I think it's a natural reaction to the human body to being in some of those

2313
02:06:06.151 --> 02:06:09.050
environments.
So do you think that like the way they used to describe it,

2314
02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:10.980
like shell shocked,
that's probably like better.

2315
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:14.490
I don't know if it's necessarily better.
I,
you know,
maybe don't put a,

2316
02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:17.220
maybe don't put a precise definition on it.

2317
02:06:17.221 --> 02:06:20.130
Maybe just work on having a better understanding that maybe you guys are gonna

2318
02:06:20.131 --> 02:06:22.260
need some time and some more so than others.

2319
02:06:22.261 --> 02:06:26.310
Because I think this was Tate was getting at in this special ops community.

2320
02:06:26.311 --> 02:06:30.540
I think the instance of post traumatic stress is much lower because we are in

2321
02:06:30.541 --> 02:06:32.940
control of what we do like I,

2322
02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:38.720
the horrific environments that I saw some of these guys getting into like in

2323
02:06:38.761 --> 02:06:43.740
Afghanistan in 2010 was a sequential series of the most dangerous months because

2324
02:06:43.741 --> 02:06:47.880
of iets improvised explosive devices throughout the history of the conflict up

2325
02:06:47.881 --> 02:06:49.260
to that point,
vehicles,

2326
02:06:49.261 --> 02:06:53.700
we're just getting vaporized in some of these army guys had a job of patrolling

2327
02:06:53.730 --> 02:06:55.720
up and down route one which is the main corridor,

2328
02:06:55.721 --> 02:07:00.721
an Afghanistan and they would get in these vehicles and sit there and wait and

2329
02:07:01.891 --> 02:07:03.600
maybe something would happen and maybe it wouldn't.

2330
02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:06.060
Maybe it hit the vehicle in front of him,
maybe to hit the vehicle behind him.

2331
02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:09.120
Maybe it would go a little order and it just flip them over and fuck them all
up,

2332
02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:10.860
but they're sitting there when you said they're waiting,

2333
02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:12.810
they're waiting to be attacked there in the back.

2334
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:16.070
They're sitting there and I can't even imagine that the,
the,

2335
02:07:16.150 --> 02:07:20.040
the geometry going on in the brain of trying to just just rectify that and just

2336
02:07:20.041 --> 02:07:22.110
dealing with,
they're basically waiting to be victimized.

2337
02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:26.490
I don't like to describe it like that because I don't think that's the right

2338
02:07:26.491 --> 02:07:29.670
term,
but maybe my vocabulary is not deep enough to describe it better,

2339
02:07:29.671 --> 02:07:32.850
but they're sitting there waiting for an event to occur to them.

2340
02:07:32.970 --> 02:07:36.370
They have to be reactionary.
Yeah.
And for,
uh,

2341
02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:39.790
I heard a psychologist describe it once.
It's called the locus of control.
Like,

2342
02:07:39.791 --> 02:07:44.140
so the guys in the tin can,
they don't have any control there waiting when we go.

2343
02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:48.340
And like I said,
we have a much more structured,
much more regimented target deck,

2344
02:07:48.370 --> 02:07:51.880
much more regimented success or failure.

2345
02:07:52.330 --> 02:07:57.330
What I go 99.9% of the time that I've been involved in a violent event overseas,

2346
02:07:57.731 --> 02:07:59.440
it was at my control.

2347
02:07:59.470 --> 02:08:03.820
I initiated the violence because I'm going to come to you at the most

2348
02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:07.060
advantageous time for me in the least advantageous time for you.

2349
02:08:07.090 --> 02:08:07.990
It's going to be nighttime.

2350
02:08:07.991 --> 02:08:11.080
I'm an exploit all of the advantages that I have and I'm not going to fight
fair.

2351
02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:16.090
Like that's the way it goes.
And I control that.
And so after,
I mean,

2352
02:08:16.091 --> 02:08:19.390
just imagine the difference between the two being the pit bull or the guy who's

2353
02:08:19.391 --> 02:08:23.410
acids in the pit bull's mouth.
I mean,
like that's in my mind,
and again,

2354
02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:26.800
this is just me talking about it.
I think that's why there's such a huge,

2355
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.691
or not a huge,

2356
02:08:28.691 --> 02:08:32.590
but a greater incidence of post traumatic stress in those units that had little

2357
02:08:32.591 --> 02:08:35.980
to no control over what was going on.
Right.
Like the,

2358
02:08:36.010 --> 02:08:40.450
the instance of that one guy that was having a bunch of,
uh,

2359
02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:44.410
who's diagnosed several times a PTSD had been deployed and then wound up killing

2360
02:08:44.411 --> 02:08:48.700
all the civilians.
That was the,
one of the most horrific.
And um,

2361
02:08:49.210 --> 02:08:53.050
one of the most popularized,
uh,
incidents of someone,

2362
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:57.010
quote unquote snapping.
Yeah.
And it's that same kind of thing,
right?

2363
02:08:57.100 --> 02:09:00.130
Like just constantly waiting for something to happen,

2364
02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:03.460
dealing with being attack with no control and you just,
you know what I mean?

2365
02:09:03.461 --> 02:09:07.150
Like,
I mean,
they were bearing 2000 pound charges.

2366
02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:10.320
They would flip these multitenant thousand pound charge.
Yeah.

2367
02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:15.420
So Afghanistan in 2003 we rode around in high lux trucks with no armor

2368
02:09:15.521 --> 02:09:18.670
whatsoever because there was no threat of an IED on the ground.

2369
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.470
And then we started doing armored Humvees.

2370
02:09:20.471 --> 02:09:23.890
But the overmatch or the size of the charge that will destroy a Humvee is like

2371
02:09:23.891 --> 02:09:28.090
four pounds because it's flat.
Right?
So then they went to the v shape,
right?

2372
02:09:28.091 --> 02:09:29.980
Which the theory is it to flex it out.

2373
02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:34.630
So those survive for a while and then they're like,
well,
50 pounds didn't work.

2374
02:09:34.631 --> 02:09:36.250
Let's try 500 500 didn't work.

2375
02:09:36.251 --> 02:09:40.330
Let's try 2000 and it flips them hundreds of feet into the air and there's

2376
02:09:40.331 --> 02:09:43.030
people inside of the things.
I've seen it where they inverted the Wii,

2377
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:47.600
the Wii on the bottom ended up touching the top of the fucking truth back.

2378
02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:52.570
And that's what those guys are riding around in.
Not knowing if like I,
I can't,

2379
02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:54.850
I can't express enough the respect.

2380
02:09:54.851 --> 02:09:58.270
I have the guys who did that because I couldn't do it again.

2381
02:09:58.271 --> 02:10:02.230
I'd be back toothbrush six shooter,
which ones are going to be,

2382
02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:04.960
that means I wouldn't be able to do it.
I'm not tuned to do that job.

2383
02:10:06.070 --> 02:10:11.000
It's such a crazy level of stress and that's why they snap.
I mean,

2384
02:10:11.410 --> 02:10:12.370
there's got to be,

2385
02:10:12.371 --> 02:10:15.760
everybody's got a cup that's going to overflow at some point and everybody's cup

2386
02:10:15.761 --> 02:10:19.120
is a little bit different and some people develop mechanisms that helped them

2387
02:10:19.121 --> 02:10:21.400
lower down the amount in that cup and others don't.

2388
02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:24.440
Is there any help for them while they're there?
Does it,

2389
02:10:24.441 --> 02:10:28.510
does there any counseling or any like psychological training or preparation

2390
02:10:28.511 --> 02:10:31.120
training?
I can't speak to the conventionals,

2391
02:10:31.121 --> 02:10:32.950
but I can say it was there and available for us.

2392
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:35.600
I can only hope that it was there and available for them.

2393
02:10:35.601 --> 02:10:39.410
But do you want to admit that in front of your peers?
You know what I mean?

2394
02:10:39.411 --> 02:10:41.890
There's some stigmatisms that come with,
I mean it's a very,

2395
02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:44.830
<v 1>I'd heard that too.
Is that like if I go to say,
hey man,</v>

2396
02:10:44.831 --> 02:10:49.240
I'm having some psychological stuff from here,
then you're unfit to lead anymore.

2397
02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:52.450
If you're in a command position because they can't put you back in because if

2398
02:10:52.451 --> 02:10:55.660
something happens then somebody can come back and say,

2399
02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:57.670
he came and said that he wasn't [inaudible].

2400
02:10:57.690 --> 02:11:00.730
So it's like you kind of take yourself out of a job if you admit that,

2401
02:11:00.731 --> 02:11:02.080
is that not right or something like that.

2402
02:11:02.290 --> 02:11:04.480
<v 3>You can,
depending on how far down the road it goes,</v>

2403
02:11:04.481 --> 02:11:07.330
because obviously if you're a complaining about or not complaining about,

2404
02:11:07.331 --> 02:11:11.590
but if you're trying to receive help for a certain level of,

2405
02:11:12.490 --> 02:11:13.600
again,
I don't want to say a problem,

2406
02:11:13.601 --> 02:11:16.150
a certain level of issues that you're trying to deal with at some point that

2407
02:11:16.151 --> 02:11:18.160
impedes your judgment and they have to make the right call.

2408
02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:21.370
But the guys who were overseas,
they don't want to get,
like,

2409
02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:25.210
one of the things that irritated me the most about getting hurt is because I got

2410
02:11:25.211 --> 02:11:29.380
pulled out of the fight and I wasn't,
I wasn't done.
Like I said,
like to this day,

2411
02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:31.830
Joe,
if I could go get on an airplane and go overseas and,

2412
02:11:31.831 --> 02:11:35.050
and affect some difference by going,
getting back on target,
I would do it.

2413
02:11:35.590 --> 02:11:38.320
You know,
almost everyone who does what you do.

2414
02:11:38.830 --> 02:11:41.740
<v 1>That's my friend Jody Mitak.
He lost both his legs from the knees down.</v>

2415
02:11:41.741 --> 02:11:45.430
He's a Canadian special forces sniper.
And he's like,
I love soldiering.
He's like,

2416
02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:48.070
I would love to get back in there and soldier morph.
I could.
Yeah.

2417
02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:51.840
<v 3>And I don't know why I can't articulate that,
but just like,
I can't articulate,</v>

2418
02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:56.490
I wanted to be a seal since I was 11 you know,
I don't,
it's just,
it's some,

2419
02:11:56.850 --> 02:11:59.580
something in me and the people that I worked with that,

2420
02:11:59.581 --> 02:12:02.970
that's just the way that it is.
Is it just because it's life turned up to 10,

2421
02:12:02.971 --> 02:12:07.920
the consequences is so high.
The,
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
For me,

2422
02:12:07.980 --> 02:12:09.210
I mean,
I,
to be honest with you,

2423
02:12:09.211 --> 02:12:12.620
I don't enjoy operating and living in environments where you're constantly at

2424
02:12:12.630 --> 02:12:16.170
risk of losing your life,
which is why I enjoyed being in control.
Right.

2425
02:12:16.171 --> 02:12:20.250
Like knew where we were going,
good intelligence was able to make a plan.

2426
02:12:20.670 --> 02:12:23.970
We were going to execute our plan on somebody who didn't know we were coming.

2427
02:12:23.971 --> 02:12:28.680
Right.
So in control,
uh,
I mean do firefights can be scary as all hell,

2428
02:12:28.710 --> 02:12:31.320
especially start talking about like indoors close proximity.

2429
02:12:31.321 --> 02:12:33.860
Like I don't enjoy living in that environment.
That's sucks.
And in the,

2430
02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:36.960
I mean there's,
yeah,
there's terrifying stuff that happens.
It's so funny.

2431
02:12:36.961 --> 02:12:40.290
Like you'll have an absolutely terrifying moment and then the funniest thing

2432
02:12:40.291 --> 02:12:43.500
he'd ever seen in your goddamn life happens all in the span of 60 seconds.

2433
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:48.120
It's like what?
Like dude's making entry on a room that they use for a bathroom.

2434
02:12:48.121 --> 02:12:52.320
So they slip and slide and fallen human shit and they come out dry heaving and

2435
02:12:52.321 --> 02:12:54.380
I'm just,
I'm leaning up against the wall crying

2436
02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:57.620
<v 1>cause I'm laughing cause they,
they go in there like a bad ass gas</v>

2437
02:12:57.630 --> 02:12:58.480
<v 3>and they come out,
they're just like,</v>

2438
02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:05.370
and it happens in the span of 60 seconds and you're like,
what is going on?
Wow.

2439
02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:08.790
Yeah.
It's,
it's so hard to describe.
Is that in a sense,

2440
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:12.450
similar to this experience that you're getting while you're doing this?

2441
02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:16.380
There's these jumps because it's,
everything is so intense.

2442
02:13:16.381 --> 02:13:17.850
Everything's so cranked up.

2443
02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:24.440
I think I discovered my appetite for the focus and clarity while I was in the

2444
02:13:27.661 --> 02:13:28.320
military.

2445
02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:32.280
And I think maybe it was something that I couldn't articulate when I was young

2446
02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:35.640
that I knew that I was searching for and for whatever reason that particular

2447
02:13:35.641 --> 02:13:38.190
occupation called me to do that.
But it definitely,

2448
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:42.090
that occupation definitely refined that in me.

2449
02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:47.220
And I think I'm at a point now that if I don't have a way to find that focus,

2450
02:13:47.250 --> 02:13:49.180
it would negatively impact my life.
So yeah,
I,

2451
02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.780
I do think that there is a tie in somehow.

2452
02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:53.760
I don't necessarily know if it's linear.

2453
02:13:53.761 --> 02:13:58.440
It does and it is not necessarily the risk of life because,
uh,
you know,

2454
02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:02.700
I can feel very fulfilled without risking my life.
It's,

2455
02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:07.530
I dunno,
maybe it's the impending risk of your life that provides that focus,

2456
02:14:07.590 --> 02:14:08.220
you know,
and there's,

2457
02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:11.010
there's a connection there somehow I just can't articulate it,

2458
02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:12.150
but somehow they're tied.

2459
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:17.250
When you express frustration and looking at what's happening right now,

2460
02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:21.990
places that the military had taken and controlled analysis,
lost control of,

2461
02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:25.770
now that we pulled out of Iraq and that we're pulling out of Afghanistan,

2462
02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:29.070
what do you think should have been done differently?

2463
02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:34.110
Again,
you know,
hindsight being 2020,

2464
02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:39.300
I think occupation was a bad idea.
I,
you know,
it's just,
it's not sustainable.

2465
02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:39.900
I mean,

2466
02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:43.260
what's happening to us in Afghanistan is exactly what happened to the Russians.

2467
02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:48.150
I mean,
it's really just moving the dates on a calendar until it's modern day.

2468
02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:52.860
It's crazy terrain,
right?
I mean,
it's the Hindu Kush and then it's,

2469
02:14:52.861 --> 02:14:55.440
sometimes it's desert.
Like if you get down south in Kandahar,

2470
02:14:55.441 --> 02:14:57.780
there's places that are there and they're beautiful.

2471
02:14:57.781 --> 02:15:01.290
It's like it's desert and there's green and there's river valleys and then you

2472
02:15:01.291 --> 02:15:05.460
get up into the northeast,
like,
you know,
a bad and Jay bad and Kohner it's,

2473
02:15:05.490 --> 02:15:07.710
I mean,
it's,
you can barely walk up.

2474
02:15:07.770 --> 02:15:10.970
Like you gotta be heavier Billy goat qual to get up those hills.
I mean,
it's,

2475
02:15:10.971 --> 02:15:14.910
it's no joke.
Some of the most beautiful country I've ever seen in my life.

2476
02:15:16.710 --> 02:15:21.710
Just seems like an insane place to try to occupy given the fact that we know

2477
02:15:21.931 --> 02:15:25.800
what happened with the Russians.
Yeah.
Well,
again,

2478
02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:29.850
I told you what I would do if I was king for a day that that decision was so far

2479
02:15:29.851 --> 02:15:32.010
above my pay grade like,
but again,

2480
02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:36.330
we also have hindsight being 2020 I don't think that when they plan to go in

2481
02:15:36.331 --> 02:15:40.350
there after nine 11 if you would've asked anybody involved in the planning

2482
02:15:40.351 --> 02:15:44.940
process if we'd still be there in 2015 going into 2016 I don't think a single

2483
02:15:44.941 --> 02:15:47.910
one would have been like,
yeah,
we're still going to be there.
Well,
not just that,

2484
02:15:47.911 --> 02:15:51.840
but it seems like we're involved in an endless quagmire.
It just doesn't,

2485
02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:54.570
it doesn't seem like we're ever getting out of this because we've created so

2486
02:15:54.571 --> 02:15:57.840
many enemies and that's why I would stop and pull every single person out of

2487
02:15:57.841 --> 02:16:01.380
there.
You know what I mean?
It's not going to get,
it's that problem over.

2488
02:16:01.381 --> 02:16:05.850
There is not a problem that you're going to win via education,
via occupation.

2489
02:16:06.210 --> 02:16:09.480
It's just not going to happen.
Yeah.
Well,
what is going to happen,

2490
02:16:09.481 --> 02:16:13.320
this is just going to take generation after generation many lifetimes.

2491
02:16:13.410 --> 02:16:15.630
It's going to go back to I,
in my personal assessment,

2492
02:16:15.631 --> 02:16:19.500
it's going to go back to being exactly what it was before we went.
They,
you know,

2493
02:16:19.501 --> 02:16:23.220
it's like I said that the areas,
Afghanistan is a tribal society.

2494
02:16:23.250 --> 02:16:27.240
They don't understand the democracy that we're asking them to utilize.
You know,

2495
02:16:27.241 --> 02:16:29.620
we want them to play tennis,
but we're giving them golf clubs.

2496
02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:33.490
You know what I mean?
It just doesn't make sense to them.
And you know,

2497
02:16:33.491 --> 02:16:34.870
in Qubole maybe it's,

2498
02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:37.780
it's largely successful because that's where a lot of the population is.

2499
02:16:37.781 --> 02:16:40.690
But as soon as you start splintering out to the areas that have no connection

2500
02:16:40.691 --> 02:16:44.980
with cool,
like you know,
it,
it,
there's no way that it's sustainable.

2501
02:16:45.010 --> 02:16:46.900
I think it's going to go back to being super tribal.

2502
02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:51.090
<v 0>I think it's so strange too that we go on with all these different ideas of like</v>

2503
02:16:51.091 --> 02:16:55.590
what it is that our objectives are and then those objectives get muddied or

2504
02:16:55.591 --> 02:16:58.290
changed throughout time.
And so it's Kinda,
it's Kinda like,

2505
02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:01.940
I mean just oversimplify,
it is like coming into a gym and going,
well,

2506
02:17:01.941 --> 02:17:04.410
what are your goals here?
Do you want self defense?
Do you want weight loss?

2507
02:17:04.411 --> 02:17:04.980
Do you want,

2508
02:17:04.980 --> 02:17:09.600
and it's like those goals become like this malleable thing that they like.

2509
02:17:09.630 --> 02:17:10.590
So now we're nowhere.

2510
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:13.670
<v 3>Yeah.
Don't spend too much time thinking about it.</v>

2511
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:16.370
<v 0>I don't man impact where I can,</v>

2512
02:17:16.371 --> 02:17:20.030
which is right here for us as civilians to be thinking about is one thing.

2513
02:17:20.090 --> 02:17:23.390
But for garlic,
you risked his life over there is walking around with a numb leg.

2514
02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:26.800
Yeah.
It's gotta be even,
there's much more intense connection

2515
02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:30.090
<v 3>to what's happening there is.
And again,</v>

2516
02:17:30.091 --> 02:17:32.490
so to answer your question full circle,

2517
02:17:32.491 --> 02:17:35.880
like why did I start doing the wingsuit stuff and why did I try to set the world

2518
02:17:35.881 --> 02:17:40.110
record?
Because I know I can't physically go over there.
Like,
you know,
my,

2519
02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:42.870
my number one priority would be to go over there and get back in line with the

2520
02:17:42.871 --> 02:17:45.420
guys and do it.
But I can't,
I mean that day has done for me.

2521
02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:50.580
So the wingsuit thing and you know,
and it all comes from like,

2522
02:17:50.581 --> 02:17:53.970
I wake up in the morning and I watched the news.
I'm like,
God dammit.

2523
02:17:54.030 --> 02:17:55.080
Like I want to do something.

2524
02:17:55.081 --> 02:17:57.150
And the only thing I can do now is support those guys.

2525
02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:00.360
Which was the only reason that I wanted to try to break the world record because

2526
02:18:00.361 --> 02:18:03.390
who gives a shit about a wingsuit horizontal distance traveled?

2527
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:06.330
It's totally irrelevant,
right?
That's why I did it as a fundraiser,

2528
02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:08.460
trying to raise money for the seal foundation.

2529
02:18:08.461 --> 02:18:10.020
They told me you were going to donate a hundred k two.

2530
02:18:10.021 --> 02:18:13.550
That's super generous of you.
I really appreciate that Joe.
And then,
uh,

2531
02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.410
he's pissed.
It's adorable.

2532
02:18:17.970 --> 02:18:21.330
Now it's a that mean,
that's why I did it because I,

2533
02:18:21.570 --> 02:18:25.590
I can't get rid of that mechanism of like,
ah,
you know what I mean?

2534
02:18:25.591 --> 02:18:26.460
For me it felt like,

2535
02:18:26.461 --> 02:18:30.660
and when I did that and started going down this road of trying to give back to

2536
02:18:30.661 --> 02:18:31.494
the community,

2537
02:18:31.710 --> 02:18:35.700
I started feeling better again about my station and where I fit in the bigger

2538
02:18:35.701 --> 02:18:38.820
thing.
Because although it's not direct,
it's indirect.

2539
02:18:38.821 --> 02:18:42.030
And those people that I'm trying to support are directly supporting them.

2540
02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:42.893
You know what I mean?
Like

2541
02:18:43.430 --> 02:18:46.040
<v 0>no way I could justify it to myself.
Substitute.
It's like,</v>

2542
02:18:46.041 --> 02:18:49.110
it's like when you say don't overthink and it's like I really don't like all the

2543
02:18:49.111 --> 02:18:51.410
stuff and all this is all a midst us.

2544
02:18:51.710 --> 02:18:55.130
I can exact change in the community and where I am and the people that I love

2545
02:18:55.131 --> 02:18:57.300
and this and then like,
I think that what you're,
that's what,

2546
02:18:57.301 --> 02:18:58.550
so when I met you man,

2547
02:18:58.551 --> 02:19:02.150
and it was just so inspiring that like the change that you can exact with what

2548
02:19:02.151 --> 02:19:06.050
you're doing and with where it goes because you know like the help that's out

2549
02:19:06.051 --> 02:19:06.980
there and that's not out there.

2550
02:19:06.981 --> 02:19:10.430
And what the navy seal foundation does for guys is invaluable because our

2551
02:19:10.431 --> 02:19:13.100
government fails them all the way.
They want everybody to Rah,

2552
02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:14.930
Rah the soldiers until the soldiers come home,
man.

2553
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:18.290
And the fight that you're in is vastly more important than,

2554
02:19:18.350 --> 02:19:20.090
than you being on the ground somewhere.
I think.
Well,

2555
02:19:20.091 --> 02:19:23.450
it was one of the most disturbing things about doing these UFC fight for the

2556
02:19:23.451 --> 02:19:28.340
troops,
is that we were raising money for the Center for excellence,

2557
02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:30.690
<v 3>Nike,
the national trends that,</v>

2558
02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:33.720
so that's where they sent me when I got medically retired.
Yeah,
it was,

2559
02:19:33.890 --> 02:19:37.400
that was the best medical treatment I'd ever received in the military.
Yeah.

2560
02:19:37.401 --> 02:19:40.430
I mean,
it's incredible,
but have you visited it by the way,
sir?
Okay,

2561
02:19:40.490 --> 02:19:43.430
you should go,
man.
I'll show it's right across the street from Walter Reed,

2562
02:19:43.431 --> 02:19:47.720
but I will tell you this.
Is that Bethesda?
Yes.
So it's,

2563
02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:51.200
uh,
Walter Reed directly across the street is Nyco.

2564
02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:52.640
So if you're going to go over there,

2565
02:19:52.730 --> 02:19:54.650
like you need to strap in for what you're going to see,

2566
02:19:54.651 --> 02:19:57.980
because that is the landing point for people who come home and fucked up and

2567
02:19:57.981 --> 02:19:58.860
you're gonna see amputations.

2568
02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:01.910
You're going to see dudes who are three or four days from a really traumatic

2569
02:20:01.911 --> 02:20:02.750
event in their life.

2570
02:20:02.810 --> 02:20:06.980
And what got me when I was there was not seeing the guys because I was used to

2571
02:20:06.981 --> 02:20:08.720
that.
It was seeing their fucking parents,

2572
02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:14.330
like the father wheeling his son into Bethesda for the first time,

2573
02:20:14.331 --> 02:20:16.640
checking them in and he's got like bloody bandages on him.

2574
02:20:16.641 --> 02:20:20.330
Like they're hooked up to all the machines and you can see that the dad is just

2575
02:20:20.331 --> 02:20:21.860
destroyed.
You know what I mean?

2576
02:20:21.861 --> 02:20:25.490
Because his son is never going to be the man that he wanted to be again.

2577
02:20:25.491 --> 02:20:30.080
So I can't recommend to you enough that you go,
but you gotta be ready.
It's,

2578
02:20:30.150 --> 02:20:32.420
it's an emotional event.
Like it,
it crushed me.

2579
02:20:32.421 --> 02:20:36.590
My Dad came out to visit me and it's tough man.
Like I didn't expect that either.

2580
02:20:36.591 --> 02:20:41.330
Like I didn't expect to have that.
I mean I had to go sit down for a little bit.

2581
02:20:41.331 --> 02:20:41.660
I was just,

2582
02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:44.510
and it just rocked me because I can only imagine what happened when my dad got

2583
02:20:44.511 --> 02:20:48.230
the phone call that I got hurt.
You know,
cause I,
I get hurt.

2584
02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:52.370
They're like morphine [inaudible] two liter bottle,
here's a cell phone,

2585
02:20:52.371 --> 02:20:54.830
call your wife.
And I'm like drooling on myself.
Hey honey,

2586
02:20:54.831 --> 02:20:58.790
I'll be home in 36 hours,
you know?
And then she had to call my dad,

2587
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.901
you know,

2588
02:20:59.901 --> 02:21:03.470
and then I can only imagine what that would be based off how much I love my sons

2589
02:21:04.130 --> 02:21:08.780
that Oh,
that gut wrenching moment when you get the call,
Hey,

2590
02:21:08.781 --> 02:21:10.250
your son's okay.
But

2591
02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:15.350
<v 4>God damn the um,</v>

2592
02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:19.450
what I was gonna say was that the intrepid needed someone like the UFC to raise

2593
02:21:19.451 --> 02:21:22.510
the money.
Right.
It was so disturbing.
Like proudly funded.
Yeah.

2594
02:21:22.511 --> 02:21:24.670
How was that not taken care of by the government?

2595
02:21:24.671 --> 02:21:27.220
How do they have all this money to build like the,

2596
02:21:27.221 --> 02:21:30.670
did you say the Pentagon built some $43 million gas station.

2597
02:21:30.671 --> 02:21:33.430
They can't justify why they spent so much.
Oh my God,
I read that too.

2598
02:21:33.490 --> 02:21:35.770
They can't account for it.
It doesn't work.
Yeah.

2599
02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:40.360
0% of the vehicles there use that type of fuel and they can't find the funding

2600
02:21:40.361 --> 02:21:41.490
anyway.
Like,
I mean,

2601
02:21:41.740 --> 02:21:46.720
I remember when I was a kid and it's like you'd hear it all the time that the

2602
02:21:47.390 --> 02:21:51.280
hammer cost $600 if you are,
and stuff like that.
And it's like,
man,

2603
02:21:51.281 --> 02:21:54.910
with that kind of graft and nepotism and bullshit that goes on and then these

2604
02:21:54.911 --> 02:21:58.090
guys are dot.
Are you kidding me right now?
Hold these.
There's so many people.

2605
02:21:58.091 --> 02:22:00.610
I mean,
that's always been the biggest issue with bureaucracy,
right?

2606
02:22:00.611 --> 02:22:03.550
There's so many different people that have their hands in the system and they're

2607
02:22:03.551 --> 02:22:06.550
not accountable.
Like when you pay your taxes,
you don't get a receipt.

2608
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:11.320
Totally told a,
hey Tate,
they,
they used a 500 bucks to go.
Yeah,
I want,

2609
02:22:11.350 --> 02:22:13.870
I want,
you know,
most of my money to go to education.

2610
02:22:13.871 --> 02:22:16.510
I like a little bit to go to fixing the streets.
No,
you don't.

2611
02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:19.210
You don't get that option.
They're just like,
thank you,
thank you.

2612
02:22:19.211 --> 02:22:21.130
And we'll do whatever the fuck we want to do with this money.

2613
02:22:21.131 --> 02:22:22.780
We're not accountable at all.

2614
02:22:23.050 --> 02:22:25.980
So you know when you think 43 million worth of theft,
okay,

2615
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.520
<v 2>if you work for Costco and $43 million is missing.
Andy,</v>

2616
02:22:29.610 --> 02:22:32.280
get into the fucking office,
please.
Yes,

2617
02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:34.230
I'm missing a few pieces of chicken nuggets.

2618
02:22:34.231 --> 02:22:38.310
Would you like to explain yourself $3 million missing a gas station?

2619
02:22:38.311 --> 02:22:41.010
Which is supposed to cost a half a million dollars to build cost,

2620
02:22:41.011 --> 02:22:44.710
43 million total.
So please tell us what happened.
Uh,
you know,

2621
02:22:44.711 --> 02:22:47.470
I'll fucking tax has got to go.
You know,
like,
no,
you wouldn't,

2622
02:22:47.540 --> 02:22:49.350
you'd have to be responsible.
You'd have to be accountable.

2623
02:22:49.351 --> 02:22:53.550
But this is just a blurb in the news and it'll be replaced tomorrow by some new,

2624
02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:57.050
you know,
whatever.
So [inaudible] means [inaudible].
I mean,

2625
02:22:57.090 --> 02:23:00.240
that's where I think about conspiracies.
We'll start a new disaster.

2626
02:23:00.241 --> 02:23:03.290
So it takes your focus off that,
that shit happened.
And meanwhile,

2627
02:23:03.310 --> 02:23:07.530
as Nike is asking for money because they're having problems,
fun,
you know,

2628
02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:10.110
funding the organization and I'm telling you,
it was the best.

2629
02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:12.240
It was the single reason that I got medically retired.

2630
02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:16.200
I didn't have enough stuff in my medical record.
I went there for 30 days,

2631
02:23:16.201 --> 02:23:20.280
had a doctor assigned to me.
My,
my exit interview was like four hours long,

2632
02:23:20.281 --> 02:23:24.930
150 pages from bloodwork to bone stuff to arthritis.
I mean,
it was insane.

2633
02:23:24.931 --> 02:23:27.210
I could do chiropractics,
I could do acupuncture,

2634
02:23:27.211 --> 02:23:30.540
all the stuff that I'd never would have thought that I could do and it was all

2635
02:23:30.541 --> 02:23:35.370
because of the but Netherlands of others.
I mean it's all privately funded.
Yeah.

2636
02:23:35.570 --> 02:23:39.330
If you ever been down to a San Diego and seeing Nia seal training,
no.

2637
02:23:39.390 --> 02:23:43.170
You want to go down?
Yeah.
All right.
I can take,
you can take it.
I've been down to,

2638
02:23:43.171 --> 02:23:45.990
I flew with the blue angels wants,
which is off San Diego.

2639
02:23:45.991 --> 02:23:49.770
You know you grow out to backseat ride.
Yeah,
it was awesome.
I threw up,

2640
02:23:49.950 --> 02:23:53.740
I threw up to [inaudible] to the end though.

2641
02:23:53.740 --> 02:23:55.370
I was so fucking disappointed in myself.
I,

2642
02:23:55.371 --> 02:23:58.740
I kept it together until the end and then I've relaxed too much and then I threw

2643
02:23:58.741 --> 02:24:03.320
up.
Yeah.
It's like I held it solid up until the end and then the end.

2644
02:24:04.370 --> 02:24:07.190
It's like cheese man.
Yeah,
the end I was,

2645
02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:10.200
it was like less at the end that I threw up that I had been through before,

2646
02:24:10.201 --> 02:24:14.140
but I just thought it was the hard part was pretty much over.
Then you got to,

2647
02:24:14.310 --> 02:24:16.900
you got to be hard about it.
What goes on.
It's stress,

2648
02:24:16.901 --> 02:24:21.240
the gs and what got me is not in the turns is about six seconds after the turns

2649
02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:23.460
like your inner ear is adjusting and they just like,

2650
02:24:24.310 --> 02:24:27.410
you know how when you're getting choked,
you know how you getting choked you,

2651
02:24:27.430 --> 02:24:29.640
you kind of like see the lights going dark.

2652
02:24:30.010 --> 02:24:34.140
Well this is a slow version of it.
A slower version.

2653
02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:36.870
Cause you know if you get choked,
if someone like has you in a rear naked,

2654
02:24:36.871 --> 02:24:40.050
it's only like a second or two you have to tap before you going out.

2655
02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:44.280
But this is like three or four seconds.
But it's like an elevator door.

2656
02:24:44.281 --> 02:24:46.920
Like you know what an elevator doors close and you literally see the black on

2657
02:24:46.921 --> 02:24:48.900
both sides and then he hit the barrels hitting a button.

2658
02:24:48.901 --> 02:24:53.640
You're like open up and it goes and then it comes back and then hit a button and

2659
02:24:53.641 --> 02:24:55.600
the elevator doors are shutting,
but then they come out of it.

2660
02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:59.160
You're like hitting the open button so it comes back out.
So you're hooking,

2661
02:24:59.161 --> 02:25:01.080
so you're holding onto the straps and you'll like this.

2662
02:25:03.090 --> 02:25:07.320
You're forcing the blood in your brain and I'm hearing the fucking pilot and

2663
02:25:07.321 --> 02:25:09.930
he's doing it too.
I'm like,
Oh shit,

2664
02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:14.010
he's not doing it like they're getting after it.
Those guys are,

2665
02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:16.980
yeah cause they're not wearing a g suit.
Yeah,
they don't work g suits.

2666
02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:19.340
It'll interfere with their controls of the airplane.

2667
02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:24.100
I want the bus and they're all conscious.
All the dog jacked.
All

2668
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.470
<v 4>those guys were like fucking pit bulls because you have to be strong,</v>

2669
02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:30.130
physically strong to be able to do that.

2670
02:25:30.131 --> 02:25:33.430
Like there's a lot of physicality involved in flying one of those.

2671
02:25:33.490 --> 02:25:35.500
It's an FAA 18 is that what it is?
18 Hornet.

2672
02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:37.510
I can't imagine it because I know guys that even race,

2673
02:25:37.570 --> 02:25:42.220
a race track cars and they're just from turning and they'll be completely

2674
02:25:42.221 --> 02:25:43.054
bruised.

2675
02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:47.590
They'll wear harnesses to keep them straight and I can imagine what a airplane

2676
02:25:47.591 --> 02:25:49.040
that's doing four g like that's,

2677
02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:52.420
we went six and a half and that's just because that's all my bitch ass could

2678
02:25:52.421 --> 02:25:56.440
take.
Like those guys.
They in that category too that I was like,
ah,

2679
02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:59.200
I would like to not do any more of those turns.

2680
02:25:59.201 --> 02:26:01.090
And also where's the inflight bag?

2681
02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:04.690
And it's like it would be harder for you than it is for me cause I'm only five

2682
02:26:04.691 --> 02:26:09.040
eight you're like what three six three six well when you get the tall you are

2683
02:26:09.041 --> 02:26:11.020
the more distance which in your heart and your brain,

2684
02:26:11.260 --> 02:26:15.460
it's hard to get that blood up there.
Short dudes like me,
like all the,

2685
02:26:15.610 --> 02:26:17.740
all the fighter pilots are always so nine,
eight,

2686
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:22.910
five 10 so like when top gun happened and then everybody tried to join the air

2687
02:26:22.961 --> 02:26:23.860
force or whatever it was,

2688
02:26:23.861 --> 02:26:27.550
or the Navy to flying best recruiting tool for the navy and their window was

2689
02:26:27.551 --> 02:26:30.280
like five,
seven to five 11 and then they're like,
nope,
five,

2690
02:26:30.281 --> 02:26:33.040
nine and one quarter or else you're not welcome because there were so many

2691
02:26:33.041 --> 02:26:34.730
peanut at that wanted to join and that's,

2692
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:36.940
that's why that height is that they want that hype.

2693
02:26:36.941 --> 02:26:39.490
For that reason I thought it was the cockpit sizer.

2694
02:26:39.850 --> 02:26:42.670
I think it's a lot of is being able to control,

2695
02:26:42.671 --> 02:26:44.920
well obviously different planes,

2696
02:26:44.921 --> 02:26:47.950
they use different things and some planes that do use g suits,

2697
02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:52.370
but when every plane except for the blue angels actually does.
Yeah.
So that's a,

2698
02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:54.310
it's an easier if you wear a g suit,

2699
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:58.660
but when you're jacked like those dudes like all of them are like these pit bull

2700
02:26:58.661 --> 02:27:02.140
dudes and because of that they can force that blood.

2701
02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:05.590
They could stay conscious and deal with a lot of pressure that crazy.

2702
02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:08.740
You know like some Larry Bird type dude is just not going be able to hand out.

2703
02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:12.160
He's going to go,
I was insane as well.
They're dealing with that pressure.

2704
02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:14.800
Their airplane is from me to Joe.
Yeah.

2705
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:18.580
Like they're looking at a single rivet on the aircraft.

2706
02:27:18.581 --> 02:27:20.560
That's their marker as a single rivet.
So they're like,

2707
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:25.570
who who like Joe's talking about and just,
you know,
formation flying,
no big deal.

2708
02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:28.820
300 knots formation,
flying,
formation flying.
So they're,

2709
02:27:28.821 --> 02:27:31.720
they're like really close to each other.
Really,
really seen him.

2710
02:27:31.721 --> 02:27:33.860
When I was a little kid.
I remember seeing him.
Him come down,

2711
02:27:33.890 --> 02:27:36.760
swoop in and they're like write,
their wings are damn near overlapping.

2712
02:27:36.761 --> 02:27:39.130
It looks like.
I mean visually it's crazy.
Well I remember,

2713
02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:40.360
I mean there's been many,

2714
02:27:40.361 --> 02:27:44.560
many times where especially like in other countries they've done those air shows

2715
02:27:44.561 --> 02:27:48.730
and collide with each other and then they go into the crowd goes with the jet

2716
02:27:48.731 --> 02:27:50.560
suits or the desks.

2717
02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:54.540
I sent you that link on Twitter I sent you to the same night I saw,
well yeah,

2718
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:55.180
these motherfuckers,

2719
02:27:55.180 --> 02:27:57.970
they got jet packs and they're flying next to like a DC 10 or something.

2720
02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.350
Next level.
The new Airbus.
These dudes in Dubai,
they,
it's the next level shit.

2721
02:28:02.351 --> 02:28:05.320
They got rigid wings.
They're doing a formation flight with Airbus.

2722
02:28:05.350 --> 02:28:07.240
They have jet packs and how far can they fly?

2723
02:28:07.630 --> 02:28:11.110
I think they can fly for about 30 minutes.
Whoa.
They were changing positions.

2724
02:28:11.111 --> 02:28:12.460
Going to read it on the plane.

2725
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:17.140
Fucking dude is croll Jamie find that it shouldn't be hard.

2726
02:28:17.141 --> 02:28:18.700
That's like next level stuff.

2727
02:28:18.701 --> 02:28:22.460
30 minutes is a long time and they can go up and then they can,
they can glide,

2728
02:28:22.461 --> 02:28:25.550
they can turn the jets off and they glide down cause it's a rigid wing structure

2729
02:28:25.551 --> 02:28:29.420
on their back.
When I was in Denver,
oh here's a guy.
Here's how.

2730
02:28:29.421 --> 02:28:33.830
Here's why this is so these guys are flying.
How high are they?

2731
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:38.600
Uh,
let's take a look here.
I mean that's like airplane height.

2732
02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:42.650
That's lower though.
That's probably sub 10 oh sub 10.
Okay.

2733
02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:46.880
That's the guy that's looking at picture on TV on the ground.
Oh my God.

2734
02:28:46.881 --> 02:28:49.040
These guys are just flying.
They have jets.

2735
02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:53.180
Are they going to 150 300 how fast are they?
They're in the hundreds.

2736
02:28:53.210 --> 02:28:57.080
They're not all probably talking out of 200 God,
this is insane.

2737
02:28:57.140 --> 02:29:00.500
Your lips are just flapping.
You've got a full screen of yours,
Bro.

2738
02:29:00.980 --> 02:29:03.070
Maybe yours will look at those things.

2739
02:29:04.100 --> 02:29:06.410
Those things would be flapping like this gets you kidding me?

2740
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:09.590
My Lips have a lot of power behind them,
bro.
I heard

2741
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:16.460
that's over that fucking bullshit man.
Made Island areas sinking.
Dude,

2742
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:20.150
what could,
this is nuts,
man.
This is all Dubai,
right?

2743
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:21.780
Where you can just do anything you want.

2744
02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:24.890
The people who pay for this just walk out to the desert and pull out a hundred

2745
02:29:24.890 --> 02:29:29.660
dollar bill.
So this is fucking insane.
Looking at these guys with these suits on,

2746
02:29:29.661 --> 02:29:33.590
they're essentially like human airplanes.
This isn't just a jet pack.

2747
02:29:33.591 --> 02:29:37.520
This is like comic book Shit.
Yeah.
Fucking madness.

2748
02:29:37.550 --> 02:29:41.240
Totally spraying chem trails all over the people of Dubai.
Yup.
Look at that.

2749
02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:45.530
They are chem trail.
Look at this.
Oh my God.
They just separate.

2750
02:29:45.531 --> 02:29:49.640
Look at that guy with his hooping you.
Wow.
That is madness.

2751
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:50.560
It's next level right now.

2752
02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:53.030
How long before that becomes like something we see all the time?

2753
02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:57.840
I think it's cost prohibitive it,
but right now,
right?
Six years.
Skydive.

2754
02:29:57.890 --> 02:30:00.660
Dubai.
That's a place you can go.
Right now they get two drops,

2755
02:30:00.670 --> 02:30:01.970
but on the Gotti Bay,
Ron,

2756
02:30:01.971 --> 02:30:05.180
I know what you're doing and actually into the fucking parking lot.
They,
yeah.

2757
02:30:05.330 --> 02:30:07.640
You know the deal with [inaudible] over there.
It's insane.

2758
02:30:07.641 --> 02:30:10.790
Like you've never seen so many million dollar cars in your life,

2759
02:30:10.820 --> 02:30:14.390
but they're all over the place.
Amazing like that.
When you're like,
oh,
you know,

2760
02:30:14.550 --> 02:30:15.960
I remember asking a long time ago,
I'm like,

2761
02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:18.470
what's it like having money like that?
And you're like,

2762
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:21.320
it's like everything's free.
And it's like,
for those guys,

2763
02:30:21.321 --> 02:30:23.330
what does that look like?
Human life is free.

2764
02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:27.920
Like very like it doesn't matter like a $10 thing,

2765
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:29.720
50,000 for them it doesn't matter.

2766
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:34.750
It really like you meet those really rich guys like then well those are those

2767
02:30:35.121 --> 02:30:38.060
guys also there.
Their wealth isn't public.
It's not like,
you know,

2768
02:30:38.061 --> 02:30:41.240
everyone talks about the wealthiest people in the world and they're not sharing

2769
02:30:41.241 --> 02:30:45.870
that information.
They're not racking and stacking Forbes,
dummy,

2770
02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:49.580
you guys are bitches.
You know what I mean?
Kings,
you wear a tie around.

2771
02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:52.880
I'm wearing leopard.
We have so much money.

2772
02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:57.650
We have so much money that we don't need a list.
You got to gold copper pieces.

2773
02:30:57.710 --> 02:31:02.600
Have you seen my diamond and crusted Ferrari diamond?
Well,

2774
02:31:02.601 --> 02:31:07.490
I remember there was a great fucking story on TV once about this chick that uh,

2775
02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:11.480
she ratted out the sultan of Brunei.
Good idea.
Yeah,

2776
02:31:11.481 --> 02:31:14.750
with terrible idea that going to work out great for that.
In the long run.
Dude,

2777
02:31:15.220 --> 02:31:16.310
my enough film ever,

2778
02:31:16.670 --> 02:31:20.670
he's one of my all time favorite characters in human history because what he did

2779
02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:24.840
was he made his own disco and uh,
he had so much fucking money.

2780
02:31:25.060 --> 02:31:28.050
Me had hundreds of Ferrari.
So you just had just like,
this is insane.

2781
02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:32.640
I'm not kidding.
Hundreds.
And so he made his own disco,
so he has a palace,

2782
02:31:32.641 --> 02:31:33.660
it's an enormous palace.

2783
02:31:33.930 --> 02:31:38.610
And He created this fucking huge elaborate discotheque where,
um,

2784
02:31:38.870 --> 02:31:41.040
it was all just girls that he had flown in.

2785
02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:43.860
So you fly these girls and he'd give them like 50 grand a week.

2786
02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:47.070
They like giving them like Sitcom money and they're all like,
you know,

2787
02:31:47.071 --> 02:31:49.380
these pen house pets and they're all living in.

2788
02:31:49.381 --> 02:31:52.500
And they caught one broad with the fucking laptop and she was like documenting

2789
02:31:52.501 --> 02:31:53.700
it all for a tell all book.

2790
02:31:53.701 --> 02:31:57.090
And they'd given her hundreds of thousands of dollars in jewelry and they took

2791
02:31:57.091 --> 02:31:59.040
all that shift from her and kicked her out of the fucking town.

2792
02:31:59.041 --> 02:32:00.970
And then she did all these interviews,
but the,

2793
02:32:01.050 --> 02:32:04.260
the dude would just come down and his golden underwear and fucking start skating

2794
02:32:04.261 --> 02:32:08.550
around like,
do,
do,
do,
who am I fucking,
I'll take you,
come with me.

2795
02:32:08.730 --> 02:32:11.160
And the rest of them kick rocks.
You know,
tomorrow,

2796
02:32:11.161 --> 02:32:13.460
maybe you'd be lucky and get some more guys like that.

2797
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:17.970
They have hundreds of girls and maybe the most of them,
80% of them,

2798
02:32:17.971 --> 02:32:20.760
he's not even fucking,
it's just like there's just here and there and whatever.

2799
02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:24.150
And they stay there and they form a little community and all these little holes

2800
02:32:24.330 --> 02:32:26.880
just hang out together and pal around.
And this,

2801
02:32:26.881 --> 02:32:30.210
I mean it's just total next level shit because this is happening in current day.

2802
02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:32.340
So they would,

2803
02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:37.340
they would also pay celebrity girls extreme amounts of money to join the hair.

2804
02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:40.950
Fuck,
fuck.
They'd fly him in.

2805
02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:43.730
Floyd Mayweather did that with like Nicki Minaj.

2806
02:32:43.740 --> 02:32:46.860
He's like 50 grand to come up and talk to me for a half hour in my hotel room or

2807
02:32:46.861 --> 02:32:47.101
something.

2808
02:32:47.101 --> 02:32:50.190
There was something like that I read before his last fight and it's like
there's,

2809
02:32:50.191 --> 02:32:54.010
you know,
people will fuck you money like that.
They're like whatever celebrity.

2810
02:32:54.011 --> 02:32:57.420
But he's got their price.
Yeah,
but I think the Nigga mountain mine,

2811
02:32:57.450 --> 02:33:01.260
the amount of money that these guys have over Floyd Mayweather.

2812
02:33:01.261 --> 02:33:04.740
Of course it's like Floyd Mayweather over like the dude who works at Starbucks.

2813
02:33:05.310 --> 02:33:08.710
It's insane.
It's like the,
they have trillions of dollars.

2814
02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:11.610
Like we would think about like the richest people in the world of worth and like

2815
02:33:11.611 --> 02:33:14.250
$90 billion.
What does this champion just pulled up?
This plane?

2816
02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:18.060
That's probably a plus.
Salt number.
Nice plane.
Oh my God.
It's got a pool in it.

2817
02:33:18.930 --> 02:33:21.780
His plane is a pool in it.
Is that a pool where they,
is that like a,

2818
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:26.910
I think it's a glass bottom.
Did is it's a pool.
No.
What is that magic carpet.

2819
02:33:26.911 --> 02:33:29.370
The floor is a giant screen,
which was show the floor.

2820
02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:31.020
It's all fucking squirrely looking.

2821
02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:35.040
Can you make it larger so we could see it better?
That is insane.
Oh,

2822
02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:39.360
it is a floor.
Oh,
I bet you just gotta kick.
They got a camera underneath it,

2823
02:33:39.361 --> 02:33:43.830
probably projecting onto the floor.
Okay.
It's a screen show,
the ground,

2824
02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:46.230
you know that they're going to do that now with planes.

2825
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:49.710
They're going to make the entire roof of the plane and led screen or an LCD

2826
02:33:49.711 --> 02:33:53.250
screen where you're gonna be able to see the actual outside of the plane,

2827
02:33:53.430 --> 02:33:57.790
like the clouds and all the [inaudible] transparent technically.

2828
02:33:58.090 --> 02:34:02.620
Seriously,
yes.
It'll be a screen and this screen will project they've,

2829
02:34:02.621 --> 02:34:06.600
they've already like made prototypes of these and they've shown like videos of

2830
02:34:06.601 --> 02:34:10.110
what the planes of the future would be like.
But the entire top of the plane,

2831
02:34:10.111 --> 02:34:11.280
like from the windows up,

2832
02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:14.760
we'll all just be the actual clouds that are above the plane.

2833
02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:18.000
Saw Buddy he flew to,
he might've wanted to

2834
02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.550
<v 0>buy and they were in first class for whatever that trip was.</v>

2835
02:34:21.551 --> 02:34:24.010
And the whole wall of the plane was clear.

2836
02:34:24.011 --> 02:34:26.590
It was like a huge window and they were like,

2837
02:34:26.591 --> 02:34:29.770
it was almost like their first class was like a,
um,

2838
02:34:30.250 --> 02:34:34.820
like a living room experience is crazy.
Yeah.
Cause I,

2839
02:34:34.821 --> 02:34:39.040
I was talking to Kyle before he left to go fight this weekend and I was like,

2840
02:34:39.041 --> 02:34:41.680
well what's business class like?
And he's like,
dude,
you laid down,

2841
02:34:41.681 --> 02:34:44.560
they come bring you a mattress.
And like,
I'm like,
that sounds awesome.

2842
02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:45.641
And I'm like,

2843
02:34:45.641 --> 02:34:49.300
what's if business class he's describing FirstClass better than first class in

2844
02:34:49.301 --> 02:34:52.960
America on Quantis and,
and uh,
I've done it.

2845
02:34:52.961 --> 02:34:55.360
Firstclass I need to get an apartment.
Yeah.
I was like,

2846
02:34:55.361 --> 02:34:58.720
what's first in department?
It's like a your own pod.

2847
02:34:58.721 --> 02:35:02.230
I remember already posted pictures once.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ari flew with me.

2848
02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:03.620
It's like your own room.
You,
you're,

2849
02:35:03.621 --> 02:35:06.820
you're not only does your chair fully requiring reclined,

2850
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:11.380
but it's turns left and right.
And then you have two TVs just in case.

2851
02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:13.780
I don't really want to have to go to the effort.

2852
02:35:13.810 --> 02:35:17.380
I'll just make my chair like our would come over and sit with me cause it's like

2853
02:35:17.381 --> 02:35:21.500
a fucking 15 hour flight.
It's a ridiculously long flight.
Yeah.

2854
02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:24.780
Dan Ari may or may not have come on board with some pot brownies.

2855
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:28.270
It stunk so bad.
I made him throw them out.
I'm like,
what the fuck are you doing?

2856
02:35:28.450 --> 02:35:31.600
Not the country.
You want to mess around.
I got mad at myself.
Yeah.

2857
02:35:31.601 --> 02:35:34.390
That's the one place where Sylvester Stallone got busted for Hgh.

2858
02:35:34.420 --> 02:35:38.560
Well he came in his private jet with like cases of the shit that,

2859
02:35:38.561 --> 02:35:43.180
that homeboys just fucking mainline.
I just saw a little bit.
But yeah,

2860
02:35:43.181 --> 02:35:46.360
if you come in with,
hey man,
I don't blame him.

2861
02:35:46.361 --> 02:35:49.870
He's my canary in a coal 90,000 years.
That's awesome.

2862
02:35:50.420 --> 02:35:52.880
Him and he going to sell 107 in that,

2863
02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:57.040
in that movie a grudge match or whatever the other night.
And I'm like,

2864
02:35:57.280 --> 02:36:00.940
how do you not get behind the argument to be enhanced?

2865
02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:04.900
Like if you look at a normal seven year old guy and you look at Sylvester

2866
02:36:04.900 --> 02:36:07.960
Stallone and like that's better.
Well,
do you remember that movie that he was in?

2867
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:12.760
Um,
bullet in the head while he was Shah reddit where it's Jason.

2868
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:17.380
Jason Momoa was in it,
right?
I think like Jason Mamoa,
I think 67 years old,

2869
02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:20.860
just as all hell muscular Ini.

2870
02:36:20.970 --> 02:36:24.070
It looks like you had some kind of surgery on his pack or something as long time

2871
02:36:24.071 --> 02:36:27.370
ago,
long time ago.
He all his rocky movies.
You see that too.

2872
02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:31.510
It's almost like he's got like a cable that connects is peck to his shoulder.

2873
02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:34.030
Why not though?
I mean seriously,
like if,
why not?

2874
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:36.250
If it's not a financial barrier to you,

2875
02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:39.640
I mean the only negative side effect of that stuff is you immediately stop
aging.

2876
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:46.030
Instantly say that it's even a cost benefit because of all the stuff that you

2877
02:36:46.781 --> 02:36:50.020
move aside,
that you're going to have health risks at any way that you're not,

2878
02:36:50.050 --> 02:36:54.370
that you take away by being a better conditioner g to do things and enjoy things

2879
02:36:54.371 --> 02:36:57.420
like the idea that like it's,
it's a manly thing.
Like people like,

2880
02:36:57.430 --> 02:37:00.460
well where do you get your testosterone from,
Bro?
I'll give mine from my balls.

2881
02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:05.440
You got to get it from him,
Bro.
No,
but I mean that's like hilarious.
The argument,

2882
02:37:05.441 --> 02:37:09.000
right?
Where did your from Bro,
I'll get my from my balls.
You know like this,

2883
02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:10.990
get that.
Mine goes balls.
What do you,

2884
02:37:11.050 --> 02:37:13.560
where do you get your fucking tooth paste from?
I get it from the grocery store.

2885
02:37:13.570 --> 02:37:17.240
Shut up.
Give it 20 more years and see if you still got the same answer.

2886
02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:20.140
Charles Poliquin and he talks a lot about,

2887
02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:23.350
it's really a Charles Poliquin Polokwane is,

2888
02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:26.960
it is a strength coach like old school dude.
Well how about your boy,

2889
02:37:26.970 --> 02:37:30.440
Louis of Westside barbell.
Awesome.
Awesome.

2890
02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:35.330
God also awesome.
I got his fucking machine back there.
That the reverse.

2891
02:37:36.330 --> 02:37:39.380
That's a game changer.
That fucking like the sweats,

2892
02:37:39.381 --> 02:37:42.830
like who kind of take his uh,
Gospel and spread it.

2893
02:37:42.831 --> 02:37:46.430
Shane sweat and Laura's Phelps sweat lowers the strongest woman in the world and

2894
02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:48.680
how planning is in her last name is sweat.
Yeah,
Dude.

2895
02:37:48.700 --> 02:37:53.510
Well it's Shane's name and shame is probably the best power and speed strength

2896
02:37:53.511 --> 02:37:55.520
coach everybody thinks is just power lifting.

2897
02:37:55.521 --> 02:37:58.010
And Louise like that's such a misnomer.
It's not what I'm about.

2898
02:37:58.190 --> 02:38:02.000
Like he changes the dynamics of whatever kind of athleticism you're into.

2899
02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.970
If you're a cross country athlete,
if you're a swimmer,

2900
02:38:04.971 --> 02:38:07.850
if you're a power fighter and um,
it's a trip.

2901
02:38:07.851 --> 02:38:10.940
I believe that if more MMA guys got into it,

2902
02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:15.870
they would turn in touching boxing into fucking knockout strikes me.

2903
02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:18.680
Matt Brown has done a lot of work.
Yeah.
That's who works with them all the time.

2904
02:38:18.681 --> 02:38:22.640
Him and Shane are really good friends and he and Louis and then,
um,
yeah,
it's,

2905
02:38:22.700 --> 02:38:25.040
it's a,
it's an interesting thing man.
Westside Barbell,

2906
02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:28.010
they'd have more power behind the strike itself are,
yeah.

2907
02:38:28.011 --> 02:38:30.650
They are learning how to turn into it more and they're learning how to

2908
02:38:30.651 --> 02:38:34.940
accentuate their top end power so that they can actually turn that over and as

2909
02:38:34.941 --> 02:38:38.330
opposed to like moving slowly through movements and,
and teaching explosivity.

2910
02:38:38.690 --> 02:38:43.030
Okay.
You know,
I had the bigger,
stronger,
faster guys on.
Yeah,
yeah,

2911
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:47.060
yeah.
And uh,
you know,
Mark's a good friend.
He's a great guy,
great guy.

2912
02:38:47.150 --> 02:38:50.150
Mark's great guy.
And we were just talking about the,

2913
02:38:50.450 --> 02:38:54.440
the stigma that's attached to these substances because of the idea of cheating.

2914
02:38:54.490 --> 02:38:54.920
Sure.
You know,

2915
02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:57.890
when you look at like baseball and you'll look at cheating the great American

2916
02:38:57.891 --> 02:39:00.490
pastime,
right.
You know what's going on with Russia right now?

2917
02:39:00.510 --> 02:39:01.200
We're talking about they're,

2918
02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:03.230
they're literally gonna pull rush out of the Olympics,

2919
02:39:03.470 --> 02:39:08.420
widespread documented cheating program on the state level.

2920
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:12.030
Like they're just cheating.
They're like,
here's the protocol.
That's,

2921
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:13.520
that's what they've always done.
I mean,
that's,

2922
02:39:13.521 --> 02:39:16.540
that's been going on from the beginning of time and then I said what everybody's

2923
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:19.740
been doing at the Olympics,
they found out about it from the Russians though.

2924
02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:23.060
The Russians were the first,
yeah,
that money's Germans,
right?
Yeah.

2925
02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:26.540
Germany was eastern bloc countries.
I feel like that,

2926
02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:29.720
I mean when you started talking and you had that Novitsky dude on here or

2927
02:39:29.721 --> 02:39:33.680
whatever,
and in talking about genetically changing things in the miles stat and

2928
02:39:33.681 --> 02:39:37.970
inhibitors and all that kind of stuff,
it just seems like at a certain point,

2929
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.000
if you want to have natural athletes like saying the UFC in 15 years,

2930
02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:45.380
everybody in the stands is going to be in better shape,

2931
02:39:45.381 --> 02:39:47.740
in better condition than the actual athletes.
So you know what?

2932
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:48.470
It's going to be alive.

2933
02:39:48.470 --> 02:39:51.190
It's going to be like turning your own butter and riding a horse to water.

2934
02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.580
You're mitigating evolution.

2935
02:39:52.581 --> 02:39:56.360
It's like congratulations and the and the reasons that they're doing it are so

2936
02:39:56.361 --> 02:40:00.080
foolish sounding.
They just sound like children.
Well,
I get it.
I get it.

2937
02:40:00.081 --> 02:40:02.420
Because like what you get out of competition,

2938
02:40:02.421 --> 02:40:05.390
if you see a guy who was gone through an eight week training camp,

2939
02:40:05.391 --> 02:40:08.570
he's fighting Chris Weidman versus Luke Rockhold bolt guys,

2940
02:40:08.940 --> 02:40:12.740
we would assume clean,
you know,
training their entire life.

2941
02:40:12.741 --> 02:40:14.040
Getting for this moment,

2942
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:17.460
<v 4>the amount of discipline and focus that's required to get through that fucking</v>

2943
02:40:17.461 --> 02:40:21.570
camp.
God damn brutal.
It's soul searing.
You know,

2944
02:40:21.571 --> 02:40:24.600
these guys are getting up every morning with exhausted bodies and they're doing

2945
02:40:24.601 --> 02:40:26.520
their strength and conditioning.
They're doing their sparring,

2946
02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:27.451
they're doing all their,

2947
02:40:27.451 --> 02:40:30.510
their technical training and they're fucking tired all the time,
man.

2948
02:40:30.511 --> 02:40:33.990
They get through it and it's one of the things that v tour and Weidman had added

2949
02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:36.600
it.
The weigh ins were widened,
pointed the finger at him.
He goes,

2950
02:40:36.601 --> 02:40:40.140
you were fucking using during camp because they did their blood screens and

2951
02:40:40.830 --> 02:40:45.810
Weidman's Vitara had a testosterone use exemption.
Okay.
For the longest time,

2952
02:40:45.811 --> 02:40:48.900
and it's testosterone when he was on was off the charts.
They,

2953
02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:51.630
he would just three times a human jack kind of shit.

2954
02:40:51.631 --> 02:40:55.920
1475 was the highest number that he tested for right during camp,

2955
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:59.880
while they're in camp,
this is after they take his testosterone away.
Okay.

2956
02:40:59.881 --> 02:41:01.170
They say that you can't use it anymore.

2957
02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:06.590
He tested 1200 and Weidman tested 300 and so widens like what the fuck?

2958
02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:09.320
He goes,
you were using during camp.
And he goes,
I'm not,
you know,

2959
02:41:09.330 --> 02:41:11.040
I'm gonna make you fucking pay for that tomorrow.

2960
02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:13.890
And he said it to them after weigh ins and you could see the look in Vitaros

2961
02:41:13.900 --> 02:41:14.733
eyes.
There's like,

2962
02:41:14.820 --> 02:41:18.750
there's a look that a guy has when he's guilty the most color grade,

2963
02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:20.370
the only,

2964
02:41:20.370 --> 02:41:25.320
the only real smart explanation for that,

2965
02:41:25.321 --> 02:41:29.910
for against it was when I listened to Ron to talk about it.
And she goes,

2966
02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.780
they know when they're off it that they can't be like,
yeah,
she knows she's done.

2967
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:38.830
I know I'm 100% me.
Sorry Bitch.
If you come in like that,
right.
You know,

2968
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:40.950
you've already lost.
She's like,
I bought.
And I was like,

2969
02:41:40.951 --> 02:41:42.780
that is huge because the psychological effect,

2970
02:41:42.810 --> 02:41:45.330
we saw it when guys came from pride and they came over,

2971
02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:50.130
they would break and you're seeing guys that are top level savages break and

2972
02:41:50.131 --> 02:41:51.600
then you're like,
that is a different athlete.

2973
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:54.870
Well it's a different human being because you're not enhanced anymore when

2974
02:41:54.871 --> 02:41:58.380
you're a jet.
Like can talks about the ways your belief of course,

2975
02:41:58.381 --> 02:42:01.320
because you know what,
you know what you were capable of.

2976
02:42:01.321 --> 02:42:05.010
These superhuman performance is when you're on it,
their chin would be better,

2977
02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:08.340
everything would be done.
They get it more in the Cape up then hang the,

2978
02:42:08.350 --> 02:42:12.270
hang up the Cape,
hang up and take away the fucking the super ring.
Yeah,
totally.

2979
02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:15.950
Yeah.
I mean once you've tasted that.
Yeah.
I,
and I don't know,

2980
02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:20.570
I guess guys were taking the uh,
well the shitbox guys get their hands on.

2981
02:42:20.590 --> 02:42:23.880
Remember when there was a thing and it was all the chute box guys and they would

2982
02:42:23.881 --> 02:42:27.450
get touched and they would go out and they'd be out and then they get touched

2983
02:42:27.451 --> 02:42:30.630
again and they'd come back on and it was like there's something like as soon as

2984
02:42:30.631 --> 02:42:32.700
he hit the ground,
he popped and it was like,

2985
02:42:32.730 --> 02:42:35.730
it was like almost an impossibility to knock him out.
It was like there,

2986
02:42:36.140 --> 02:42:37.830
that's why I was what they were fucking doing.

2987
02:42:37.831 --> 02:42:42.630
It was so impressive when Vandelay got cro copped.
Yeah.
Cause even all that,

2988
02:42:43.290 --> 02:42:45.020
I mean that was the heaviest Vaneulla he'd ever been.

2989
02:42:45.030 --> 02:42:48.960
He was like two 18 cro cop was only two 14 cro cop is actually lighter than

2990
02:42:48.961 --> 02:42:50.790
Vandelay even though cro cop had fought heavyweight,

2991
02:42:50.791 --> 02:42:53.220
God is his entire career and Vandelay really,

2992
02:42:53.221 --> 02:42:56.460
his optimal weight was 185 and he was fighting as a heavyweight.

2993
02:42:56.461 --> 02:43:01.380
He was 183 pound champion.
Right.
Or the 203 pound champion.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2994
02:43:01.410 --> 02:43:05.700
That's what it was.
Right.
And,
uh,
you know,
get to the UFC drops down to one 85,

2995
02:43:05.701 --> 02:43:09.360
because he's not on the shit anymore,
but when he's fighting or allegedly,

2996
02:43:09.630 --> 02:43:12.160
but when he's fighting cro cop,
even after all that,
but we

2997
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:15.280
<v 2>don't even know what the fought cro cop was doing.
That was one of the biggest,</v>

2998
02:43:15.281 --> 02:43:19.900
strongest guys ever wrestled with.
Like that guy is,
he's,
he's strong.

2999
02:43:19.901 --> 02:43:23.130
He's like one of those different levels.
Shop said to him,

3000
02:43:23.170 --> 02:43:26.580
he said he couldn't believe how strong you are.
He is powerful.
Yeah.
Well,

3001
02:43:26.730 --> 02:43:31.480
I mean his fucking Kao Powers Legendary.
Yup.
You know,
but again,
those guys,

3002
02:43:31.481 --> 02:43:33.730
they just had an open agreement.

3003
02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:36.910
You just do whatever the fuck you won't even open agreement.
You better do it.

3004
02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:39.670
Yeah.
It was in the contract.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Our buddy.
Yeah.
Stop it.

3005
02:43:39.671 --> 02:43:42.430
It was in the contract contracts that we will not test for steroids,

3006
02:43:42.431 --> 02:43:46.540
but our buddy went over there and he was a natural hundred and 70 pounder and

3007
02:43:46.541 --> 02:43:49.460
they wanted him to fight at one 85.
He was like,
I don't even weigh 185 people.

3008
02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:53.410
Totally.
Dylan.
Woody,
we can do this.
I don't want to,
and they're like,
no,

3009
02:43:53.411 --> 02:43:55.310
this you do,
we have the doctor.
Like it's like

3010
02:43:57.430 --> 02:43:58.840
you're not going to not do it.

3011
02:44:01.690 --> 02:44:04.300
The guys at the pinnacle of their game,
if they're not doing that stuff,

3012
02:44:04.330 --> 02:44:07.750
honestly I'm surprised like I have zero problem with that whatsoever.

3013
02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:12.010
Like no problem is it wrecks your endocrine system and after you could show off

3014
02:44:12.011 --> 02:44:14.490
of it you're,
you're done.
I mean these guys are there,

3015
02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:18.580
they're on these hyper human levels in their twenties and then they get off of

3016
02:44:18.581 --> 02:44:22.190
it and their balls don't work anymore.
I see that the teams,
two guys,

3017
02:44:22.610 --> 02:44:27.070
they researched the ingestion portion and they're like,
okay cool.
I'm done.

3018
02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:29.770
No post cycle anything.
And then they're just,

3019
02:44:30.490 --> 02:44:34.390
so what is the protocol when when you're,
you're involved in that,

3020
02:44:34.391 --> 02:44:37.630
like is that like from the top down,
do they tell you about it?

3021
02:44:37.930 --> 02:44:42.760
Like how does the steroid use in the military is against the UCM J so if guys

3022
02:44:42.761 --> 02:44:44.320
are going down that route there,

3023
02:44:44.350 --> 02:44:46.600
they're doing it on their own underneath the radar.
However,

3024
02:44:46.601 --> 02:44:50.440
the drug testing in the military does not test for steroids and it's a very

3025
02:44:50.441 --> 02:44:54.940
specific test it had.
You'd have to be picked out and ping for that reason.

3026
02:44:54.941 --> 02:44:58.570
So they're not going to,
I mean it's kind of like this a known thing.

3027
02:44:59.060 --> 02:45:03.070
It couldn't be done.
You know what I mean?
I know about it.

3028
02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:05.830
How could it not be known?
It was blind.
The blind eyes system,
right?

3029
02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:10.810
Like we want you to be an ally in a sense to go.
Yeah.
Right.
But then the guys,

3030
02:45:10.811 --> 02:45:11.000
you know,

3031
02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.840
they don't have the education or they don't take the time to figure out the post

3032
02:45:13.841 --> 02:45:15.430
cycle therapy stuff and they just go.

3033
02:45:15.650 --> 02:45:18.270
Especially the dudes who were just juicing right before deployment,

3034
02:45:18.290 --> 02:45:21.940
then going to the old Turkey,
right when they get on it.
Oh Daddy.
Oh yeah.

3035
02:45:21.941 --> 02:45:24.520
It's horrible for your morale,

3036
02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:28.870
for you guys on it the whole time they're over.
Well that's Kennedy who say,

3037
02:45:28.871 --> 02:45:31.540
Tim Kennedy was saying that.
He's like,
it's,
it makes you a better soldier.

3038
02:45:31.570 --> 02:45:35.190
I am all for it and it will,
it will make it dries faster,
recover better.

3039
02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:38.560
Talk to team guys that are out now that are like,

3040
02:45:39.010 --> 02:45:42.250
it's shit like guys get popped for that when they're in buds and they're like

3041
02:45:42.251 --> 02:45:44.530
fuck those guys.
But they're like,
when you go over there,

3042
02:45:44.531 --> 02:45:47.800
I want everybody that's next to me to be as big and strong and as alert as

3043
02:45:47.801 --> 02:45:51.490
possible.
So when they go through buds they test them for it.
Now again,

3044
02:45:51.491 --> 02:45:54.910
it's the same.
It's the steroids I don't think would help in buds.

3045
02:45:54.911 --> 02:45:58.870
I think HGH might on the recovery side of the house about like EPO that was

3046
02:45:58.871 --> 02:46:01.830
probably helps out blood doping,
right?
Yeah.
I don't know her.
Nate's,

3047
02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:02.980
you may have more

3048
02:46:04.850 --> 02:46:08.290
balance shuttle damaging thing bugs is from what it sounds like.

3049
02:46:08.291 --> 02:46:10.070
Did I don't think that stuff would help you.

3050
02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:13.550
<v 3>It's not as bad as you think you guys were talking about on that same episode.</v>

3051
02:46:13.551 --> 02:46:16.430
They don't drown you in buds.
Yeah.
I think you were saying that they drown.

3052
02:46:16.431 --> 02:46:19.520
You know they,
we get you as close to drowning as possible,
but it's not her.

3053
02:46:19.521 --> 02:46:23.150
But telling drown the last guy to data buds,

3054
02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:26.690
a aspirate it on his own vomit underwater and was not recoverable.

3055
02:46:26.750 --> 02:46:31.220
But a lot of the,
a lot of the training [inaudible] ago,
probably five years,

3056
02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:34.400
the guy dies.
There are probably about once every five to seven years,

3057
02:46:34.430 --> 02:46:37.280
which is important.
It needs to happen,
right?
Because that means you're taking,

3058
02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:40.520
the training is arduous enough that it's going to do what it's supposed to do

3059
02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:42.920
because they're going to die.
It's a terrible thing to have happen,

3060
02:46:42.921 --> 02:46:46.070
but so a lot of the training we do in the water is to make them uncomfortable.

3061
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.880
Like my favorite,

3062
02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:50.540
one of the evolutions in first phase is you get these huge classes of like 150

3063
02:46:50.541 --> 02:46:53.450
guys and everybody's like teamwork.
We're in this together.

3064
02:46:53.451 --> 02:46:55.970
And you make them jump in the pool,
fully clothed,

3065
02:46:56.450 --> 02:46:59.330
and then the instructors get on the outside and you start pushing them closer

3066
02:46:59.331 --> 02:47:03.090
and closer together.
Right?
So now on the outside of the edges,

3067
02:47:03.130 --> 02:47:04.190
you're in the pool with them.

3068
02:47:04.220 --> 02:47:07.690
So we're making a big circle of students smaller and smaller and smaller teams,

3069
02:47:07.730 --> 02:47:12.560
water 20 feet.
So it drowning each other.
It,

3070
02:47:12.620 --> 02:47:13.970
it doesn't start that way.

3071
02:47:14.110 --> 02:47:18.260
But the teamwork talk goes out the fucking window.
Yeah,

3072
02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:19.970
it cause then it's like dudes like

3073
02:47:21.470 --> 02:47:24.890
foot on top ahead and that's actually the evolution that the guy aspirated in,

3074
02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:26.780
which is why they increase the instructor ratio.

3075
02:47:26.781 --> 02:47:27.920
They didn't notice it right away,

3076
02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:32.420
but that's one of the highest attrition evolutions at buds is that one right

3077
02:47:32.421 --> 02:47:34.790
there where they push everybody together and then once they get them together

3078
02:47:34.791 --> 02:47:36.260
it's like okay,
take off your right boot.

3079
02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:39.230
So then everybody's got to undo their boot and throw it out of the pool.

3080
02:47:39.231 --> 02:47:39.981
Take off your left.

3081
02:47:39.981 --> 02:47:44.210
But so you're like you have a task to do while staying alive without trying to

3082
02:47:44.211 --> 02:47:47.300
kill somebody else.
And just that,
that type of stuff in the water,

3083
02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:50.330
the attrition rate is just through the roof I would imagine.

3084
02:47:50.390 --> 02:47:52.430
And how long you're in there for?
As long as it takes.

3085
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:56.270
How long does it take to do what?
To get a,
you know,
you take all your top off,

3086
02:47:56.271 --> 02:47:59.060
you take your pants off,
you take your boots off,
all that stuff that can take,

3087
02:47:59.650 --> 02:48:04.370
you know,
the pool party it is well,
and obviously we are wearing the UDT shorts,

3088
02:48:04.371 --> 02:48:07.310
which are just completely unexpected.
As soon as I know,

3089
02:48:07.311 --> 02:48:10.090
say they don't wear underwear.
That Bryan singer Guy,
the guy who uh,

3090
02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:14.400
directed x men,
he had parties like that.
Really?
Yeah.
I don't know man.

3091
02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:17.270
The vendors.
Which one?
It,
I don't know if these were the type of party,

3092
02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:20.630
but now what happens if guys go,
fuck this,

3093
02:48:20.930 --> 02:48:24.260
let's push an instructor out of here.
That would be interesting.

3094
02:48:24.261 --> 02:48:29.261
I've never seen happen there that we're going to end up killing each other.

3095
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:32.090
Let's break the circle open.
You know,
I don't know what,

3096
02:48:32.091 --> 02:48:35.540
I only had a student grab me one time because one of the tests we did is they

3097
02:48:35.541 --> 02:48:36.770
could be such a horrible idea,

3098
02:48:36.771 --> 02:48:40.370
but I'd love allow me to tell you what happened to this particular student.

3099
02:48:40.850 --> 02:48:42.140
So one of the tests we do,

3100
02:48:42.141 --> 02:48:45.650
you have twin 80 scuba tanks and you have to tread water with at least,
uh,

3101
02:48:45.710 --> 02:48:49.610
your wrist above the water for five minutes.
And it's really not that hard.

3102
02:48:49.611 --> 02:48:52.230
If you can just relax and just take a deep breath and put your head down,

3103
02:48:52.260 --> 02:48:54.770
you can,
there's a lot of buoyancy that you see,
you tread water,

3104
02:48:54.771 --> 02:48:56.900
but your hands have to stay [inaudible].

3105
02:48:56.990 --> 02:48:59.930
So you just use your legs and you have a full scuba tank system on your back,

3106
02:48:59.931 --> 02:49:02.720
which if you don't rig it properly,
it'll pull you back a little bit.

3107
02:49:02.930 --> 02:49:05.600
A lot of it is just kind of getting your lungs over your center of gravity,

3108
02:49:05.610 --> 02:49:09.520
like waters without your hands is fucking hard.
It's hard with hands too.
Yeah.

3109
02:49:09.580 --> 02:49:11.850
Yeah.
I mean the training is supposed to be hard.

3110
02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:16.080
So really from what I've been told,
I went through the correspondence course,

3111
02:49:16.081 --> 02:49:16.710
so I don't know.

3112
02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:19.800
<v 0>But
through the Gracie in action,</v>

3113
02:49:23.580 --> 02:49:25.100
<v 3>he always starts the same way,
right?
Like,</v>

3114
02:49:25.101 --> 02:49:26.780
they'll take a breath and then they're like,

3115
02:49:26.810 --> 02:49:29.480
they're keeping their hands above water and their head is,

3116
02:49:29.481 --> 02:49:31.670
keeps getting farther and farther and farther.
And they had to just like kick,

3117
02:49:31.671 --> 02:49:33.350
kick,
kick,
kick,
kick,
and then you know,

3118
02:49:33.351 --> 02:49:35.180
it's about to get really bad when they do the monkey Paul,

3119
02:49:35.181 --> 02:49:38.420
when their hands started doing this number,
they start like,
that's when you're,

3120
02:49:38.510 --> 02:49:43.160
the guy's about to either quit or go under.
And I had a foreign exchange student,

3121
02:49:43.161 --> 02:49:46.160
I think he was from Korea.
And they have a weight belt on too.

3122
02:49:46.190 --> 02:49:48.770
There's a 20 pound weight belt on her.
Well of course.
Why wouldn't there be?

3123
02:49:49.220 --> 02:49:51.650
So a lot of the times with the students will do is they'll drop their weight

3124
02:49:51.651 --> 02:49:52.880
belt when they think they're going to go under.

3125
02:49:52.881 --> 02:49:56.600
So I as a helpful instructor will get it for them and put it around the back of

3126
02:49:56.601 --> 02:50:00.860
their tanks so they can no longer take it off so they can finish the evolution.

3127
02:50:00.860 --> 02:50:02.000
Because just because you quit,

3128
02:50:02.060 --> 02:50:04.370
you're still gonna finish the fucking five minutes,
you know what I mean?

3129
02:50:04.371 --> 02:50:08.570
Like it has,
it has a purpose.
Right.
Uh,
and if you don't quit and you just fail,

3130
02:50:08.660 --> 02:50:11.030
will allow you to re retry it at another date,

3131
02:50:11.060 --> 02:50:13.490
but you're going to finish the five minutes with your best attempt.

3132
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:15.320
So I'll put the weight belt on the top of the tanks.

3133
02:50:15.890 --> 02:50:18.560
So this Korean kid dropped his weight belt and like,
yeah,
okay.
No problem.

3134
02:50:18.561 --> 02:50:22.520
Went down and got it,
put it back on.
Uh,

3135
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:24.680
he started going back under again.

3136
02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:28.730
It got to the point where he pulled his own life jacket and it inflates and

3137
02:50:28.731 --> 02:50:31.620
brings him back up.
So I helped them out.
I pulled the release valve,

3138
02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:34.640
let all of the oxygen,
or not the oxygen,
but the co two out of it.

3139
02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:40.240
So he starts going back down again and just comes up and gets one big like hand

3140
02:50:41.471 --> 02:50:45.470
out of the water and bear hugs me,
tried to take me under water with them.

3141
02:50:45.470 --> 02:50:48.050
It's the only time I've ever seen an instructor actually get grabbed.

3142
02:50:48.650 --> 02:50:52.610
So I just knew it was me,
so I just relaxed,

3143
02:50:53.010 --> 02:50:57.830
held my breath.
We went to the bottom until he passed out.
Whoa.

3144
02:50:58.500 --> 02:51:01.330
Who said,
all right bitch,
let's do it.
That's fine.
I come,
I'm like,
all right,

3145
02:51:01.720 --> 02:51:04.790
can you hold your breath?
I don't know.
I mean I'm nothing impressive.

3146
02:51:04.791 --> 02:51:07.370
Probably a couple of minutes longer than that guy could in a panic state.

3147
02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:11.090
That's all it mattered.
You know what I mean?
And you,
and you're in a panic state.

3148
02:51:11.270 --> 02:51:14.660
You got about 30 seconds and you're right.
I mean,
how much time do you have?

3149
02:51:14.690 --> 02:51:17.690
I probably wasn't going to be able to do a Max breath hold cause I was laughing

3150
02:51:17.691 --> 02:51:18.860
pretty hard at him.

3151
02:51:19.010 --> 02:51:22.310
<v 0>But so far that's the whole shit about,</v>

3152
02:51:22.311 --> 02:51:24.570
I get comfortable while they're fucked.

3153
02:51:25.020 --> 02:51:30.020
I live underwater bitch and he's just like looking at me like,
ah,
I'm

3154
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:30.601
<v 3>just goes out.</v>

3155
02:51:30.601 --> 02:51:34.620
And then you pull them up and it doctor with seven years of medical school and

3156
02:51:34.950 --> 02:51:39.950
residency under his belt goes wake up and then they wake up and hey,

3157
02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:43.050
you failed.
So he blacked out under the water.
That happens all the time.

3158
02:51:43.051 --> 02:51:45.960
We bring people up who,
let's just literally drowning.

3159
02:51:46.160 --> 02:51:47.720
It's just blacking out underwater.

3160
02:51:47.790 --> 02:51:51.110
But there's no evolution in seal training that requires you to black out.

3161
02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:54.390
Like one of the tests is a 50 meter underwater swim.
When you jump in,

3162
02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:57.750
you have to do a front somersault swim to the other side of the pool of touch at

3163
02:51:57.751 --> 02:52:01.570
front somersault and swim back.
That's another one that gets a lot of guys on.
Uh,

3164
02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:04.740
they'll pass out because they just don't want to give up.
And again,

3165
02:52:04.741 --> 02:52:07.570
all this stuff is about teaching you where the boundaries,

3166
02:52:07.571 --> 02:52:09.820
where you think they are and what other people tell you you can do.

3167
02:52:09.820 --> 02:52:13.490
And when you get alarm systems in your body,
it's,
it's a choice to,

3168
02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:15.400
to listen to those things.
A lot of the times,

3169
02:52:15.401 --> 02:52:20.401
a lot of navy seals or various a Spec ops guides go into like ultra marathons

3170
02:52:21.671 --> 02:52:25.030
and shit afterwards just to try to push themselves to the once you,

3171
02:52:25.031 --> 02:52:28.660
I mean honestly like Joe was addicted to it.
Yeah.
But I mean,
you know,

3172
02:52:28.661 --> 02:52:31.390
I would imagine that you probably,
I mean,

3173
02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:35.740
do you miss fighting and do things that challenge you physically and mentally to

3174
02:52:35.770 --> 02:52:38.710
continue pushing yourself and growing?
I mean,
once you get a taste for it,

3175
02:52:38.890 --> 02:52:40.810
I would imagine you still do those things too.
Don't you?

3176
02:52:41.110 --> 02:52:44.370
Well there's a certain amount of you're always going to want to push herself

3177
02:52:44.410 --> 02:52:47.380
cause cause cause you,
if you feel like you,
if you're not doing it,

3178
02:52:47.381 --> 02:52:50.290
if you're not testing your boundaries,
it Kinda feel like a pussy.

3179
02:52:50.530 --> 02:52:51.850
I feel like it's mastery too.

3180
02:52:51.851 --> 02:52:55.600
It's like yeah you get mastery over this thing and then what happens with people

3181
02:52:55.601 --> 02:52:58.210
that are uncommon and interesting,
they go on to the next thing,

3182
02:52:59.340 --> 02:53:02.410
this thing and then they want mastery over that thing irritates him that they

3183
02:53:02.411 --> 02:53:07.080
don't mass.
They're like oh man I suck at this.
This shit is good for that man.

3184
02:53:07.081 --> 02:53:10.460
And that's the one thing that's been the prime difference in my life is like go

3185
02:53:10.461 --> 02:53:13.810
into something and do something that kind of makes you nervous every day.
Go on,

3186
02:53:13.820 --> 02:53:18.800
go on,
go into fear based Shit and then live there and figure that out.
Hiding.

3187
02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:22.210
It's the only way to live.
Rewarding in addition to being exciting.

3188
02:53:22.930 --> 02:53:26.500
Reward is huge.
The exciting thing for me is like that's the initial moment,

3189
02:53:26.530 --> 02:53:29.060
but then the impact it has on your life.
I mean they,

3190
02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:30.580
there's two different full spectrums.

3191
02:53:30.580 --> 02:53:33.380
There's like in that moment and then how it changes you as a human being.
Right.

3192
02:53:33.670 --> 02:53:37.030
I got to bring you guys down.
Check out seal training.
You guys.
Let's make it,

3193
02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:41.200
let's make a video a day.
They may frown against that.
Oh,
okay.

3194
02:53:41.230 --> 02:53:43.740
But you can make a video when I jumped though with you.
Yes.

3195
02:53:43.930 --> 02:53:48.250
Cause well Joe will be in the plane as well.
Also,
I'll be wrapped to the wing

3196
02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:53.020
with a video camera looking at smaller getting look,

3197
02:53:53.970 --> 02:53:56.360
if you don't let me take you jump and we got to go hunting.
Okay.

3198
02:53:56.390 --> 02:54:00.000
What do you want to hunt a duck?
Oh,
well no.

3199
02:54:00.880 --> 02:54:03.340
All the out the woods hunting you guys hunting duck.

3200
02:54:04.130 --> 02:54:06.640
That's an additional oil I need to bring up.

3201
02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:10.780
That's going to get in the way of concentrating.
Here's the video.

3202
02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:14.590
Here's the video ended with this because we're basically out of time.

3203
02:54:14.590 --> 02:54:19.240
We just did three hours,
believe it or not did we really flies by every time.

3204
02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:23.350
Um,
so explain this will you as just the javelin missile,

3205
02:54:23.410 --> 02:54:28.150
but you cost 150,000 US dollar.
This is what we were talking about earlier.

3206
02:54:28.290 --> 02:54:32.170
For people listening.
Andy,
uh,
essentially has a,

3207
02:54:32.171 --> 02:54:36.310
this is a top attack.
It's like a sewer pipe attached to her shoulder.

3208
02:54:37.650 --> 02:54:41.350
This giant fucking,
yeah,
with a computer attached to it.

3209
02:54:41.500 --> 02:54:44.860
And it's about to launch.
So these guys that you're launching against,

3210
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:46.840
tell us the background on that.
It's just a truck,

3211
02:54:46.930 --> 02:54:50.650
a truck full of guys and they're shooting at,
you know,
that's done.
Okay.

3212
02:54:50.660 --> 02:54:54.700
They were shit.
And this is not their dancing.
Okay.
There's the,
there's the,

3213
02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:59.650
the round fires off climbs.
It's hard to see.
But then you'll see where it lands.

3214
02:55:00.970 --> 02:55:04.010
Oh my God.
So that is far.

3215
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:06.650
<v 2>How far away is that?
It's about two kilometers.
So it's,</v>

3216
02:55:06.690 --> 02:55:10.280
it's quite a bit slower than a bullet.
Oh,
very much so.
Yeah.

3217
02:55:10.290 --> 02:55:13.580
Cause it's so much weight to it and the,
the round,
the guy laughing,

3218
02:55:15.820 --> 02:55:19.250
that's so fucked up.
People just die.
Ha Ha.
Yeah.
But you know what?

3219
02:55:19.251 --> 02:55:22.160
Those people weren't me.
So it's celebrating they were bad guys.
Right.

3220
02:55:22.220 --> 02:55:25.850
Let's celebrate.
Boom.
That's crazy.
That,
that,
that,
that exists.

3221
02:55:25.970 --> 02:55:26.910
Reach out and touch somebody.

3222
02:55:26.911 --> 02:55:29.120
And what is that going to be like in five years from now?

3223
02:55:29.121 --> 02:55:31.490
It's going to be something even more insane.
They already have like,
you know,

3224
02:55:31.491 --> 02:55:35.870
like suicide drones now and all sorts of stuff.
Oh,
I'm sure.
Yeah.
I mean,

3225
02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:39.050
just drone warfare alone,
you know what I mean?

3226
02:55:39.051 --> 02:55:43.090
Then that's what they're going to be able to do with these Boston.
Um,

3227
02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:45.590
what are they called?
The Boston Dynamics,
those,
uh,

3228
02:55:45.591 --> 02:55:47.630
those crazy robots that they have.
I mean,

3229
02:55:47.631 --> 02:55:50.660
they've got those robots you can kick and they fucking go or sideways.

3230
02:55:50.810 --> 02:55:52.500
So it's not just going to be drones that fly.

3231
02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:55.100
It's going to be drones or like you're going to see an army of fucking

3232
02:55:55.101 --> 02:55:59.150
terminator robots learning into camps and they can go up hills,
man.
Hey,

3233
02:55:59.151 --> 02:56:02.180
you know what though?
Good on them.
I'd rather have that luck.
Yeah,
totally.

3234
02:56:02.181 --> 02:56:06.280
The Airforce Academy for the first time a few years ago,
graduated more,
uh,

3235
02:56:06.370 --> 02:56:09.770
non manned aircraft pilots and unmanned aircraft pilots in their history and did

3236
02:56:09.771 --> 02:56:13.280
they graduate and through Xbox live?
I thought that was a Prereq to recruit them.

3237
02:56:13.281 --> 02:56:17.210
Those motherfuckers probably,
it was a Prereq.
Yeah.
You know,
I'm sure.
Well,

3238
02:56:17.211 --> 02:56:19.550
listen to Andy.
Thank you very much,
man.
We gotta do this again.

3239
02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:22.430
Thanks for having me,
man.
Awesome dude.
Let's do it again.
Without a doubt.
Sure.

3240
02:56:22.730 --> 02:56:25.300
Tait Fletcher,
Tatum.
Maximus.
No longer,

3241
02:56:25.301 --> 02:56:28.710
and that was just straight up Tait Fletcher on Twitter.
Um,

3242
02:56:28.810 --> 02:56:33.800

And then Kyle milk I just put up today and uh,

3246
02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:46.460
apparently the UFC is mad about the,
the one with Donald.

3247
02:56:46.461 --> 02:56:50.360
I don't know why I don't understand it is a failed drug test allegations.

3248
02:56:50.610 --> 02:56:55.310
Well that he,
he knows he did.
He,
well,
anyway,
whatever fail.
He just wasn't there,

3249
02:56:55.610 --> 02:56:59.280
but they told them where he was.
He was in Vegas.
It's a long story.
Anyway,

3250
02:57:00.060 --> 02:57:03.980
pirate life to,
to find out the full details.
Caveman coffee,

3251
02:57:03.981 --> 02:57:06.590
see o.com each and every episode we drink.

3252
02:57:06.591 --> 02:57:09.050
Caveman coffee is the best fucking coffee on the planet earth.

3253
02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:13.700
And we've got an answer.
It's 240 milligrams caffeine,
so stronger than red bull.

3254
02:57:13.710 --> 02:57:17.510
Stronger than your mother's pussy.
And uh,
we'll be back.
See You tomorrow.
Bye Bye.
