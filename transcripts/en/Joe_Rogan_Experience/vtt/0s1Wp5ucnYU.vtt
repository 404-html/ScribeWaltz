1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.440
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:02.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:03.114
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

5
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>they're little helicopter.</v>

6
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did people do before they figured out tents?</v>

7
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>well the Eskimos,</v>

9
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I believe that they smeared fat on their skin that would,</v>

10
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of fat would keep the mosquitoes off them.</v>

11
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I think got all sorts of really clever adaptations.</v>

12
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.394
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:20.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:21.121
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

15
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>we sort of assume that we would be helpless,</v>

16
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>but that's because we didn't grow up there and our culture didn't,</v>

17
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

18
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

19
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

20
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.011
<v Speaker 1>you know who,</v>

21
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Wade Davis is a,</v>

22
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

23
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>he's an anthropologist.</v>

24
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>He's written a bunch of books.</v>

25
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting guy.</v>

26
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:34.831
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

27
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>like anthropologists in residents at the Smithsonian in Washington.</v>

29
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called the wayfarers I think was his last book about</v>

30
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.154
<v Speaker 1>traditional,</v>

31
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.581
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

32
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>about how these guys could navigate across the Pacific.</v>

33
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Just looking at the stars and the color of the water and smelling and whatever</v>

34
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:52.884
<v Speaker 1>they'd,</v>

35
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.461
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

36
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:53.821
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

37
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>one of the stories he tells us about this,</v>

39
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Eskimo guy,</v>

41
00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>old guy,</v>

42
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>and the family sort of took the keys to the car away from him.</v>

43
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.481
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

44
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>you can't go anymore.</v>

45
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>They were afraid he would go out and die the traditional way.</v>

46
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:10.430
<v Speaker 1>When Eskimo people got old,</v>

47
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>they would just like wander off into the ice and die.</v>

48
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>So as not to be a burden to the family.</v>

49
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

50
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>And he was a traditional guy and they were worried that he would take the,</v>

51
00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>the snow machine out and just die out there somewhere or hurt himself hunting or</v>

52
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:24.234
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

53
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>So they had this whole intervention.</v>

54
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And so that night he goes out,</v>

55
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>gets out of the house,</v>

56
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>takes a shit in his hand,</v>

57
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>forms the shit into a knife,</v>

58
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:42.381
<v Speaker 1>blade spits on it and the spit a is freezing along the edge and he hones that</v>

59
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:45.571
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

60
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>So he gets a nice sharp edge with his sped,</v>

61
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>takes his shit knife,</v>

62
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>kills a dog or a couple of dogs and takes their,</v>

63
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>ribs and makes us a sled out of it.</v>

65
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>And with the sinews and whatever other pieces of the dogs,</v>

66
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:01.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>he knew all this stuff from his childhood,</v>

68
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.600
<v Speaker 1>hooks up a couple of other dogs to the sled and he takes off into the,</v>

69
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>into the snow on his,</v>

70
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>sled with his shit knife.</v>

72
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.423
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

73
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

74
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 2>That might be the most of the same story I've ever heard.</v>

75
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.490
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know any better.</v>

76
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

77
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 2>we didn't know any better idiots.</v>

78
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 2>We were like 1920 that we,</v>

79
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.130
<v Speaker 2>we used to fucking go out and drink like a 12 pack of beer and eat McDonald's at</v>

80
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 2>one in the morning.</v>

81
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 2>And by like eight o'clock we were unloading trucks,</v>

82
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.903
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

83
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.160
<v Speaker 2>laughing and then we would work.</v>

84
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 2>We do all this shit and that during the lunch hour we would go out and play</v>

85
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.360
<v Speaker 2>basketball and like just regular sneakers and like five o one blues.</v>

86
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Remember that the black fly and you'd be out there.</v>

87
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 2>You come back and pouring sweat and then just keep,</v>

88
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.100
<v Speaker 2>it's in great shape.</v>

89
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 2>I was ever in it my life.</v>

90
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:54.950
<v Speaker 2>And then in the end of work I would then go lift and go ride a bike.</v>

91
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

92
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm at one time I want a bike ride hammered.</v>

93
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I was so into working out fucking bike ride.</v>

94
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm on like a 12 speed bike that I bought when I still have it by the way in my</v>

95
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 2>garage I refuse to throw shit out and a,</v>

96
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>I remember being hammered on the bike and I'm sweating so I'm becoming more</v>

97
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:09.934
<v Speaker 2>hammered.</v>

98
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 2>I was going to do this 11 mile loop and then it became oh seven and then I just</v>

99
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:19.711
<v Speaker 2>kinda came back and I was like on the bike laughing and I was like 2021 and was</v>

100
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 2>only beginning to understand the fragility of life and I knew that what I was</v>

101
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 2>doing was stupid,</v>

102
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.164
<v Speaker 2>but I couldn't get,</v>

103
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

104
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

105
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I just kept picturing my friends laughing at me and I was literally by myself</v>

106
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:31.001
<v Speaker 2>riding this bike,</v>

107
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 2>laughing drunk,</v>

108
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>driving up the street</v>

109
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 2>and you have a two and a half hours.</v>

110
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just taking snippets from fucking the eighties I got,</v>

111
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.803
<v Speaker 2>I got nothing left</v>

112
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 2>used to be able to bounce back so well when you're young,</v>

113
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

114
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 2>When you're 20 years old,</v>

115
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 2>you get hammered the next day.</v>

116
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 2>You barely feel anything.</v>

117
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.333
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

118
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Donald's in tear down that place.</v>

119
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I would get to quarter pounders with cheese,</v>

120
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 2>a large fry,</v>

121
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 2>a six piece mcnugget and I never liked him.</v>

122
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I never liked him.</v>

123
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I never thought an ace to try the different sauces.</v>

124
00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>I used to go with the mustard,</v>

125
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.583
<v Speaker 2>never tastes good.</v>

126
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted something to fill the void.</v>

127
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 2>And then I would get like a couple of cheeseburgers and uh,</v>

128
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it just a giant coke and just throw that down and wake up the next day</v>

129
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 2>with a flat stomach.</v>

130
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 2>And I had already drank like,</v>

131

<v Speaker 2>We've got to fight.</v>

135
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 2>We got into a fight one time right under the Golden Arches and the next town</v>

136
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:25.204
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

138
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 2>These guys came in drunk,</v>

139
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 2>classic Boston shift.</v>

140
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 2>They just come walking in and,</v>

141
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 2>and give everybody the finger.</v>

142
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Of course we respond to it and next thing you know,</v>

143
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 2>we're out underneath the golden arches.</v>

144
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 2>There's like five of us in two of them.</v>

145
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 2>And my buddy,</v>

146
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:41.531
<v Speaker 2>we always fought,</v>

147
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 2>he starts swinging on the big one and then the little one,</v>

148
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 2>he sort of jumped and it just became this big,</v>

149
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:47.111
<v Speaker 2>it looked like wrestling,</v>

150
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:47.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.310
<v Speaker 2>when like they all come running out of the dressing and to help each other.</v>

152
00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:50.051
<v Speaker 2>We're on snow,</v>

153
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 2>everybody's drunk just fallen down.</v>

154
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 2>We was so fucking drunk.</v>

155
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.370
<v Speaker 2>The cops were there sort of misting mace for like,</v>

156
00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know how long,</v>

157
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 2>like we didn't even see him pull up this just like being in the light.</v>

158
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden everybody's like eyes it like cheering up and shit.</v>

159
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.560
<v Speaker 2>And then what was hilarious was they just broke us up and they fuck it.</v>

160
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 2>And then like two seconds later we're back in our car and the same two guys we</v>

161
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:17.480
<v Speaker 2>were fighting were coming back up to the car and say,</v>

162
00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 2>what did the cops go?</v>

163
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:19.204
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was over.</v>

164
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.411
<v Speaker 2>And the guy's like,</v>

165
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:21.510
<v Speaker 2>that was a bullshit pudge.</v>

166
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm under the little one goes,</v>

167
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.811
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

168
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:22.911
<v Speaker 2>ma'am,</v>

169
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

170
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.030
<v Speaker 2>we laugh at you a shit.</v>

171
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking nuts.</v>

172
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:32.411
<v Speaker 2>I gotta give it up to him.</v>

173
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

174
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.891
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

175
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 2>fucking four on two whatever.</v>

177
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.420
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

178
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 2>they didn't give a shit.</v>

179
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.591
<v Speaker 2>They laughed.</v>

180
00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 2>They definitely laughed at our shit.</v>

181
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 2>They didn't care.</v>

182
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 2>They ate that Mason,</v>

183
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:41.471
<v Speaker 2>they came right back.</v>

184
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 2>They already right up to our face right up to our Ford escort.</v>

185
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 2>They did not give a fuck if you're still into the fight and he just got amazed.</v>

186
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what you need.</v>

187
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.690
<v Speaker 2>That thing happened because I don't,</v>

188
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 2>nobody got it full on.</v>

189
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Like it was just like you're,</v>

190
00:05:56.401 --> 00:05:56.581
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

191
00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I thought we thought it was the snow.</v>

192
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Like they had thrown rock salt cause we were on the ground and I don't know what</v>

193
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

194
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 2>but it was just like unbelievably fucking air.</v>

195
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.054
<v Speaker 2>But we were hammered.</v>

196
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a fucking police car pulled up and nobody noticed.</v>

197
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

198
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Whatever was going on.</v>

199
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 3>What do you believe are the components of,</v>

200
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.880
<v Speaker 3>of dream telepathy?</v>

201
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 3>Have you isolated it down to a certain,</v>

202
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 3>firing the synapses?</v>

203
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:21.381
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean,</v>

204
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.810
<v Speaker 3>do you have any idea of what,</v>

205
00:06:22.811 --> 00:06:23.644
<v Speaker 3>what causes it?</v>

206
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.620
<v Speaker 1>We have the equipment to do much more with the brain now than we could.</v>

207
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.430
<v Speaker 1>You have to remember the parasite ecologists don't have very much money and</v>

208
00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:34.380
<v Speaker 1>don't have the tools to,</v>

209
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.653
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

210
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

211
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.220
<v Speaker 1>to utilize a lot of this equipment.</v>

212
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.750
<v Speaker 1>But what we did on our studies was very,</v>

213
00:06:42.751 --> 00:06:43.531
<v Speaker 1>very simple.</v>

214
00:06:43.531 --> 00:06:48.531
<v Speaker 1>The nights that the dreams hill apathy seemed to be successful were the nights</v>

215
00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:52.380
<v Speaker 1>that the geo magnetic fields of the earth were very calm,</v>

216
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 1>very few sunspots,</v>

217
00:06:54.451 --> 00:06:56.520
<v Speaker 1>very few electrical storms.</v>

218
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>And so one could hypothesize that there is a field of some sort of global field</v>

219
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>were these barely detectable influences and very subtle means of communication</v>

220
00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:10.530
<v Speaker 1>that can sneak through.</v>

221
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.551
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

222
00:07:11.551 --> 00:07:12.301
<v Speaker 1>by and large,</v>

223
00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:17.301
<v Speaker 1>if there is an emotional connection between the people who are in contact with</v>

224
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:18.840
<v Speaker 1>each other over a distance,</v>

225
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.140
<v Speaker 1>it's more likely to happen than if they're complete strangers.</v>

226
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Didn't you have some sort of a crazy psychic vision of Kennedy being</v>

227
00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:29.994
<v Speaker 3>assassinated?</v>

228
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:31.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

229
00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:33.630
<v Speaker 1>actually I did the Alphas dre.</v>

230
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.640
<v Speaker 1>My very first silicide been experience that I had the courtesy of Timothy leary</v>

231
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.480
<v Speaker 1>who I went to Harvard to visit and who invited me to an experiment of silicide</v>

232
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:52.841
<v Speaker 1>mills was a beautiful and glorious experience yet was don during the days when</v>

233
00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:54.990
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin was legal,</v>

234
00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:55.441
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

235
00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:58.270
<v Speaker 1>as one of his last legal siliciden sessions.</v>

236
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.220
<v Speaker 1>And there was only one Downer during that experience.</v>

237
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:08.490
<v Speaker 1>And that was when I had the actual decision during psilocybin with my eyes</v>

238
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:12.400
<v Speaker 1>closed of President Lincoln being shot.</v>

239
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.730
<v Speaker 1>And I saw the gun at the base of his profile and somebody screamed out,</v>

240
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:20.260
<v Speaker 1>the president has been shot.</v>

241
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.980
<v Speaker 1>And then Lincoln space morphed into that of Kennedy.</v>

242
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.990
<v Speaker 1>And there was the rifle,</v>

243
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.890
<v Speaker 1>except now it was not a pistol as his rifle.</v>

244
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And somebody who's screaming,</v>

245
00:08:30.941 --> 00:08:32.350
<v Speaker 1>the president has been shot.</v>

246
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I recorded all of that.</v>

247
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I had such an incredible experience.</v>

248
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I made dozens of copies and Santa to my close friends.</v>

249
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.570
<v Speaker 1>And of course in several months the tragedy of Kennedy's death actually</v>

250
00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:47.141
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

251
00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And so my vision,</v>

252
00:08:48.941 --> 00:08:51.220
<v Speaker 1>whether it was coincidental or pre-cognitive,</v>

253
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.300
<v Speaker 1>was on record.</v>

254
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.180
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be considered myself a highly psychic person.</v>

255
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't consider yourself,</v>

256
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

257
00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>did that freak you out at all?</v>

258
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

259
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.381
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

260
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's preached me off in this field.</v>

261
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:06.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just a surprise at sometimes leaves me a,</v>

262
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:11.271
<v Speaker 1>a sense of wonder because there's more things going on in the world we don't</v>

263
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 1>take seriously,</v>

264
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 1>or they'll take us by surprise.</v>

265
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:19.210
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
