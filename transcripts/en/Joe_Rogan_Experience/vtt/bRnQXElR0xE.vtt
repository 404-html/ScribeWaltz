<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>when I got out of high school,</v>

4
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I went to art school for a year or two and then I dropped out and I was just</v>

6
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

7
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>how am I going to make a living doing this?</v>

8
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:11.621
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

9
00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>and I got all my best drawings and I went to,</v>

10
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it was cal arts,</v>

11
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:16.794
<v Speaker 1>it was like a,</v>

12
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like a open call,</v>

13
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:18.991
<v Speaker 1>like in,</v>

14
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like every single animation studio,</v>

15
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>every single advertising agency.</v>

16
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>And I got there and it's all these fucking kids with all their art and there's</v>

17
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>really long lines to talk to a guy that like has a pencil behind his ear and</v>

18
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:32.214
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>work on this work on this.</v>

20
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

22
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.781

23
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to wait in this line.</v>

24
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>So I went and I went to go take a piss and I saw one of the advertising guys get</v>

25
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>up and I followed him to the bathroom and I said,</v>

00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking dope man.</v>

47
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>You should come to my office in Beverly Hills.</v>

48
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>And I was like either 20 or 21.</v>

49
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:09.894
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

50
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.913
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

51
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's the,</v>

52
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the biggest advertising agencies in La.</v>

53
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I show up there like with a tie on and everything.</v>

54
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>And as I walked down the hallway,</v>

55
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like every movie poster.</v>

56
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.953
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

57
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.243
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

58
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.203
<v Speaker 1>I made it,</v>

59
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking like young and I'm going to make a living drawing.</v>

60
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Like this is fucking crazy.</v>

61
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think back then,</v>

62
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it is now.</v>

63
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>They would have all these artists draw in the style.</v>

64
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I forgotten drew Struzan,</v>

65
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>that's that star wars a painted all the star wars.</v>

66
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>These guys all draw that same style and you draw the movie poster and then they</v>

67
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 1>give that to the photographer.</v>

68
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>And the photographer,</v>

69
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

70
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>there's no art in movie posters now,</v>

71
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.031
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

72
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about fucking 20 years ago,</v>

73
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sure it's different now.</v>

74
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 1>And it was a avalanche movie with Chris.</v>

75
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

76
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>crystal.</v>

77
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.231
<v Speaker 1>Donald.</v>

78
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Crystal Donald.</v>

79
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I think that the movie was called avalanche.</v>

80
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>And so I sat in the room and I was like,</v>

82
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:09.481
<v Speaker 1>this is so cool.</v>

83
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I get to see a movie before it came out,</v>

84
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

85
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.181
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

86
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>this movie fucking sucks.</v>

87
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm sitting there watching it with like six old guys with like</v>

88
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:19.720
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes daily dangling out of their mouth.</v>

89
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

90
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>all right guys,</v>

91

93
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:24.930

94
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.980

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I walked into the guy's office less than a month in.</v>

150
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I said like,</v>

151
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>thank you for this honor.</v>

152
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it like this.</v>

153
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I learned so much I can't do it.</v>

154
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.223
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

155
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

156
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Like you see that line,</v>

157
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>you see how many people would die?</v>

158
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.161
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

159
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:48.431
<v Speaker 1>Dave.</v>

160
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>And he closes the door.</v>

161
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.331
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

162
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:50.164
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you something.</v>

163
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>You remind me of me.</v>

164
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:52.451

<v Speaker 1>You got like that fucking punk rock attitude.</v>

167
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 1>If you stay here and you do what I tell you,</v>

168
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you could be running this fucking place in like 20 years.</v>

169
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

170
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>oh well you only gave me a nice ego.</v>

171
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Boost the devil.</v>

172

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

174
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he said this to all those guys out there,</v>

175
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

176
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>And because I was the youngest guy there and I go,</v>

177
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't even believe I'm telling you.</v>

178
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

179
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

180
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>thank you for this opportunity.</v>

181
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this though.</v>

182
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.561
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

183
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:17.711
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

184
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel like art is my passion.</v>

185
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:20.021
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

186
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm dying here and you know,</v>

187
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>cause I thought,</v>

188
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.871
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

189
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I could draw crystal Donal all day.</v>

190
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>And then at night I could draw whatever I want,</v>

191
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>a or fifteens and buttholes,</v>

192
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 1>but muscle memory.</v>

193
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I had just spent the entire day training my hand to draw into drew Struzan style</v>

194
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>style of Chris O'donnell.</v>

195
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I get home and I want to do my shit.</v>

196
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

197
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck that butthole looks like crystal Donald's face,</v>

198
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.923
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

199
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>So I tell the guy,</v>

200
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:44.321
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

201
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.154
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

202
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this great opportunity you gave me,</v>

203
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to,</v>

204
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to re regretfully decline this thing.</v>

205
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:51.210
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

206
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Draw your funny books.</v>

209
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say it in that voice,</v>

210
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:56.224
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

211
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.741
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

212
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:57.574
<v Speaker 1>what's like mocking?</v>

213
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

214
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

215
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>not like hardcore,</v>

216
00:04:59.471 --> 00:04:59.831
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

217
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:00.664
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

218
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

219
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.463
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that.</v>

220
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.341
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

221
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:04.174
<v Speaker 1>you know what I,</v>

222
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I've made at that young at that,</v>

223
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

224
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

225
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.880
<v Speaker 1>it's for me the saddest thing when I see young people that have already like</v>

226
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.560
<v Speaker 1>given,</v>

227
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

228
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>that's the time you fight.</v>

229
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the time that you should try and fail and try again.</v>

230
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like when you get old,</v>

231
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

232
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>at least I tried.</v>

233
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work out,</v>

234
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

235
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

236
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.791
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

237
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go for it and if I end up fucking broke or poor,</v>

238
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.551
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

239
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>then fuck it,</v>

240
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.501
<v Speaker 1>at least I tried,</v>

242
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:30.320
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

243
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

244
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>and the next next job from that was drawing a midgets and,</v>

245
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.160
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

246
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>and bottles for Hustler.</v>

247
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

248
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

249
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I get to at least draw what I want to draw and buttholes for Hustler.</v>

250
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

251
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Worked for like Asian fever and the whole Larry Flynt trying to monetize a</v>

252
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>creative vision.</v>

253
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>It's always,</v>

254
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.190
<v Speaker 1>it's really important that you try to figure out what is unique in your head and</v>

255
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:54.390
<v Speaker 1>that what is in your head and if you,</v>

256
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>how do you get it out?</v>

257
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to bring up the Chappelle show or anything,</v>

258
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>it's like this whole like,</v>

259
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want to start my own network.</v>

260
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to start my own publishing company.</v>

261
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm just going to do whatever I want,</v>

262
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>knowing that it's not gonna make any money.</v>

263
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>And then what always happens is because it's so unique and whatever,</v>

264
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 1>it does make money.</v>

265
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

266
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>that's so easy for you now Dave,</v>

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>how do you think I got it?</v>

270
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 1>How do you think I fucking got it right?</v>

271
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.370

<v Speaker 1>they both like if you're poor,</v>
