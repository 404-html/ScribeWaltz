<v Speaker 1>minutes before 4:00.</v>

7
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Here's vow with the weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hottest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck back to you Jimmy.</v>

9
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:26.951
<v Speaker 1>Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how are we going to car fire in the </v>

10
00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:28.990
<v Speaker 1>breakdown lane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were getting emotional in the </v>

11
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>green room listening to Henry rollins </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about Putin.</v>

12
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>You're about to quote Chomsky like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

13
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>So he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just caught the end of it.</v>

14
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I sent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went in the green room and I like,</v>

15
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody loves Henry Rollins.</v>

16
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Sam Henry twice.</v>

17
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's constantly grinding.</v>

18
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was doing that thing about.</v>

19
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poot.</v>

20
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And you know there was a journalist who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a book about them,</v>

21
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>ended up dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin's a bad guy.</v>

22
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad guy as opposed to who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

24
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean he's definitely a bad guy,</v>

25
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>We all agree that course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean just because other people are</v>

27
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:07.271
<v Speaker 1>also bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't negate his point of Putin </v>

28
00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:07.370
<v Speaker 1>being a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he was saying is just that.</v>

29
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:12.371
<v Speaker 1>It's very bizarre that the Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that were at the forefront </v>

30
00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 1>of the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ones always,</v>

31
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember Khrushchev Banging on the desk </v>

32
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.970
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll bury you with,</v>

33
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>with Kennedy and these people are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the whitewashing Putin.</v>

34
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>They're essentially like trying to paint</v>
<v Speaker 1>out Putin to be a good guy because trump</v>

35
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.650
<v Speaker 1>is in this position where he's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be friends with this guy.</v>

36
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

37
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Well here's the quote I wanted to send </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

38
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that whole thing,</v>

39
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Nuremberg laws were applied,</v>

40
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:47.321
<v Speaker 1>then every post war American president </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been hanged since says Noam </v>

41
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Chomsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Putin kills journalists.</v>

42
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>We just torture hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me.</v>

43
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Chelsea manning is a whistleblower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We took Brock Obama torture.</v>

44
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 1>So we have our president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have presidents and vice presidents </v>

45
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>who are legit war criminals that walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>around today,</v>

46
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.220
<v Speaker 1>that a torture program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama got a peace prize and then </v>

49
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.731
<v Speaker 1>he had a kill list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How a peace prize winner with a kill </v>

50
00:02:15.731 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>list at drone kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you keep the kill list next to the</v>

51
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 1>peace prize?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you keep those two things?</v>

52
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:24.221
<v Speaker 1>Are they anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's some of the people that were </v>

53
00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:24.221
<v Speaker 1>killed were American citizens with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>due process,</v>

54
00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:27.610
<v Speaker 1>no due process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so nobody has a problem with trump.</v>

55
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:32.611
<v Speaker 1>Being buddy buddies with Benjamin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Netanyahu is a psychopathic maniac who </v>

56
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:33.890
<v Speaker 1>shoots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who shoots with precision,</v>

57
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medics who are trying to help people in </v>

58
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>nurses hand journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

59
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some is really true.</v>

60
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Israeli troops do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really depressing thing.</v>

61
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had abby Martin on and she sort of </v>

62
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.410
<v Speaker 1>illuminated that whole situation to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't know how bad it was,</v>

63
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.840
<v Speaker 1>nor did she until she went over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

64
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just experiencing what it's like the,</v>

65
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy that people that went through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

66
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust that realize the cost of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehumanizing an entire race of people </v>

67
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 2>now are capable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least some of them are capable of </v>

68
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 2>doing that to the Palestinians.</v>

69
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

70
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.810
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of mind blowing.</v>

71
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:15.600
<v Speaker 3>So I want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have friends who do that.</v>

72
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.660
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's doing this right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's getting caught up in this </v>

73
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.091
<v Speaker 3>hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why there's a word called </v>

74
00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:23.091
<v Speaker 3>hysteria because it happens and Lauryn </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

75
00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:27.320
<v Speaker 3>and you know what I like is what Noam </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chomsky said about this Russia hysteria </v>

76
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330
<v Speaker 3>that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

77
00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:30.780
<v Speaker 3>if you care about effects on our </v>
<v Speaker 3>pristine elections,</v>

78
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:33.210
<v Speaker 3>which he said very sarcastically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

79
00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:36.450
<v Speaker 3>if you care about what's affecting our </v>
<v Speaker 3>pristine elections to Russia,</v>

80
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.560
<v Speaker 3>gate is the last place I would look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the first place he would look.</v>

81
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:45.561
<v Speaker 3>If you're worried about four and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>control of or influence on our </v>

82
00:03:45.561 --> 00:03:46.320
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he would look to Israel.</v>

83
00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:49.470
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Benjamin Netanyahu came here and address</v>

84
00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:54.471
<v Speaker 3>the joint session of Congress without </v>
<v Speaker 3>the permission or invitation of the </v>

85
00:03:54.471 --> 00:03:54.471
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my bro,</v>

86
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.160
<v Speaker 3>when Obama was president and he did </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

87
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.190
<v Speaker 3>He did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a guy coming here to tell our </v>

88
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.220
<v Speaker 3>guys how to vote in direct defiance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our president and everyone embraced him.</v>

89
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine the food and did that </v>
<v Speaker 3>boot and came to America and addressed </v>

90
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.250
<v Speaker 3>the joint session of Congress against </v>
<v Speaker 3>the will of the president.</v>

91
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.670
<v Speaker 3>So this idea that somehow because Putin </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a bad guy,</v>

92
00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:13.410
<v Speaker 3>trump shouldn't have a good friendship </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

93
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Is Bs the guys who are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>influencing our government.</v>

94
00:04:16.951 --> 00:04:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Here are Benjamin Netanyahu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>

95
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:23.360
<v Speaker 3>but trump opened eight businesses in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia during the election.</v>

96
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.820
<v Speaker 3>No one gives a crap about any of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff because they're our friends.</v>

97
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

98
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:30.630
<v Speaker 3>just bombed us school today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A school bus,</v>

99
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 3>29 kids dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

100
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.130
<v Speaker 3>I just retweeted that from Sarah Abdula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

101
00:04:35.131 --> 00:04:36.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would they do that?</v>

102
00:04:36.391 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 3>Because they're in Yemen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

103
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.760
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're bombing.</v>

104
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 3>We were committing genocide in Yemen </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

105
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.420
<v Speaker 3>So we're helping Saudi Arabia committed </v>
<v Speaker 3>genocide in Yemen.</v>

106
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.990
<v Speaker 3>And the way we're doing it is they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a thing called siege warfare,</v>

107
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:51.170
<v Speaker 3>which is a war crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we just,</v>

108
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.200
<v Speaker 3>in fact they just prosecuted someone a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few months ago in a,</v>

109
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.920
<v Speaker 3>at the Hague for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

110
00:04:55.921 --> 00:05:00.921
<v Speaker 3>but since we're doing it and we're the </v>
<v Speaker 3>enforcers and Saudi Arabia is on the </v>

111
00:05:00.921 --> 00:05:02.760
<v Speaker 3>human rights council.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything's a joke now,</v>

112
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we were past it where it's a farce.</v>

113
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.010
<v Speaker 3>We're living in this forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when I see a guy that I love,</v>

114
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:10.680
<v Speaker 3>like Henry Rollins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying stuff like,</v>

115
00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:12.630
<v Speaker 3>oh Putin's this special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of bad.</v>

116
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.240
<v Speaker 3>I just called back Chomsky out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have nothing.</v>

117
00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:19.500
<v Speaker 3>We have legit war criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just one presidency away.</v>

118
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he's a step removed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that though?</v>

119
00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:24.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll assassinate journalists in his own</v>

120
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.930
<v Speaker 3>country right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now we're trying to assassinate </v>

<v Speaker 3>She really did say that after she just </v>

126
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.130
<v Speaker 3>got done killing Kadafi and then laughed</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

127
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.490
<v Speaker 3>that we've played that several times we </v>
<v Speaker 3>came,</v>

128
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:50.880
<v Speaker 3>we saw he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that fact</v>

129
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.450
<v Speaker 2>that any human being would ever do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

130
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he died,</v>

131
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.830
<v Speaker 2>that's some dark shit they watched and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they stabbed him in the ass hole.</v>

132
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.710
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of him stabbing him in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the asshole.</v>

133
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.740
<v Speaker 2>I standing there just confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not knowing what to do in this guys </v>

134
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 2>jamming a sword up his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the video?</v>

135
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I have not seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

136
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 2>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to see,</v>

137
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the video,</v>

138
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 2>them capturing him is fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a guy who has lived with an</v>

139
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.120
<v Speaker 2>iron fist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled these people.</v>

140
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Been a brutal dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been a horrible monster of a human </v>

141
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.601
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now all of a sudden these rebels have </v>

142
00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:28.601
<v Speaker 2>captured him and they can't believe they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

143
00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shooting and stabbing him.</v>

144
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:34.061
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually they have his body </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they prayed his body around after </v>

145
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:34.061
<v Speaker 2>they've killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

146
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:38.880
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's video of him should look at it </v>

147
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.141
<v Speaker 2>for just for a moment because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>stunning to see him captured and alive </v>

148
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 2>and can't believe that these rebels have</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

149
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 2>That it's not even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even like,</v>

150
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have seen video of him captured and </v>

151
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 3>that look on his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I know what you're talking about.</v>

152
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.340
<v Speaker 3>Just the guy's shoving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I did not.</v>

153
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.790
<v Speaker 3>I shoving a knife up his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I um,</v>

154
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.630
<v Speaker 3>I hit a dog with my car awhile ago and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just can't have no stomach for any of </v>

155
00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:07.410
<v Speaker 3>that stuff anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just a,</v>

156
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something went,</v>

157
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.450
<v Speaker 3>ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a real breakdown.</v>

158
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Like we took it to the vet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lived.</v>

159
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:14.500
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

160
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 3>So I hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hit a dog,</v>

161
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.010
<v Speaker 3>killed it a bout a year and a half ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might have already been dead already </v>

162
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.310
<v Speaker 3>been done because I think it was laying </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the street because I didn't see it.</v>

163
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.180
<v Speaker 3>So it had to be already laying there </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

164
00:07:30.181 --> 00:07:31.630
<v Speaker 3>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

165
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.640
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I saw I was driving to my pot </v>

166
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.021
<v Speaker 3>store and Eagle Rock and I saw this </v>
<v Speaker 3>little black puppy dog run across the </v>

167
00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 3>street in front of our car and there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>this big median,</v>

168
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.950
<v Speaker 3>like a grass median and it was good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

169
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:45.730
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

170
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.940
<v Speaker 3>And the cards hasn't started coming it </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other way and I stopped saying my </v>

171
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.631
<v Speaker 3>wife stops and I jumped out and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>running and I see the cars coming and </v>

172
00:07:54.631 --> 00:07:55.720
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see the dog anymore.</v>

173
00:07:55.721 --> 00:08:00.100
<v Speaker 3>And then I see the dog next to the curb </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's Kinda like,</v>

174
00:08:00.101 --> 00:08:04.270
<v Speaker 3>just going like that and it just crushed</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

175
00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even now to think of it switching.</v>

176
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.990
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got hit.</v>

177
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

178
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we pick it up and we,</v>

179
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.200
<v Speaker 3>we drove to a hospital as soon as we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could.</v>

180
00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:14.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

181
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 3>the Animal Hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which there was one not far away and it </v>

182
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:19.870
<v Speaker 3>lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dog lived,</v>

183
00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:22.480
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take it as a pet.</v>

184
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:23.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

185
00:08:23.561 --> 00:08:24.430
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

186
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

187
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.380
<v Speaker 3>they just might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife called back,</v>

188
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the thing and they said,</v>

189
00:08:30.941 --> 00:08:32.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to live in.</v>

190
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 3>We have someone who's going to take it </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

191
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.260
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God.</v>

192
00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:39.260
<v Speaker 3>But I was so surprised at how I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>broke down over that puppy.</v>

193
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:43.660
<v Speaker 3>The dog I ran over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like numb to but that dog for some</v>

194
00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:45.850
<v Speaker 3>reason that just everything opened and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just,</v>

195
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was such a basket case puppy's so </v>

196
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.060
<v Speaker 3>cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was such,</v>

197
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I was hit by a car at such a how can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just like,</v>

198
00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:59.791
<v Speaker 3>I see and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like I don't know if I have </v>

199
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I have ptsd over that,</v>

200
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:07.041
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I way over reacted to that </v>

201
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 3>situation so there was a lot more going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on there.</v>

202
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 3>And so when someone says something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Kadafi video.</v>

203
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can't even imagine guys who have to</v>

204
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 3>go to war and the stuff they have to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the things that they have to do.</v>

205
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:20.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they all don't come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

206
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 3>anybody who went over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

207
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>

208
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.100
<v Speaker 3>I've been to Afghanistan soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

209
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.340
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

210
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'd known that.</v>

211
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 3>Not Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they come to my show,</v>

212
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 3>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know those people.</v>

213
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a close friend who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually in combat like that.</v>

214
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

215
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I have a few close friends that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been in combat and when they start </v>

216
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.110
<v Speaker 2>drinking and that's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>inhibitions get loosened up and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories start flowing and you know,</v>

218
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 2>it's most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something people are </v>

219
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:52.330
<v Speaker 2>designed to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

220
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.290
<v Speaker 2>especially not when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one else is seeing it.</v>

221
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 2>The thing is if we all lived in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman times and everybody was getting </v>

222
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.740
<v Speaker 2>sorted up every day and people getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit with arrows all the time,</v>

223
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.040
<v Speaker 2>it's a normal part of life when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>start accepting the fact that there's </v>

224
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.520
<v Speaker 2>going to be lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about living today</v>

225
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.670
<v Speaker 2>where the majority of human beings live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this uber safe environment that's </v>

226
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.660
<v Speaker 2>probably a safe more safe than any </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who've ever lived ever.</v>

227
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.220
<v Speaker 2>And just overall in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the modern Western civilization.</v>

228
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.740
<v Speaker 2>But then you're going over to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and you're,</v>

229
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:22.300
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

230
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:27.340
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with bombings and schools</v>
<v Speaker 2>and buses and sniper attacks and you </v>

231
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:32.711
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your buddy just lost a leg from an ied </v>

232
00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:35.291
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that kind of shit just wears on a </v>

233
00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:35.291
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

234

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just any,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I can't believe we still do more like </v>

238
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.280
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

239
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very.</v>

240
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.241
<v Speaker 3>See I get it a lot of trouble because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've antiwar and all words are bullshit </v>

241
00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 3>and get in trouble because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>antiwar.</v>

242
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pro war,</v>

243
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire establishment is pro war.</v>

244
00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:54.840
<v Speaker 3>You know that every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every newscaster is pro war.</v>

245
00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:56.250
<v Speaker 3>If you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not pro war,</v>

246
00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:58.580
<v Speaker 3>you don't get on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're against the war,</v>

247
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 3>you get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Phil Donahue,</v>

248
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 3>like Ed Schultz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Jesse Ventura,</v>

249
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 3>like Ashley Banfield,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear.</v>

250
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 3>If you tell Chris Hedges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you tell the truth about the war,</v>

251
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 3>you will get fired from establishment </v>
<v Speaker 3>news</v>

252
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 2>establishment and use that will let you </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk openly other than Artie.</v>

253
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Artie seems to be pretty open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really ironic.</v>

254
00:11:17.201 --> 00:11:18.010
<v Speaker 2>It's ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

255
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

256
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.700
<v Speaker 2>when Abby Martin was working for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like Jesus Christ,</v>

257
00:11:21.701 --> 00:11:22.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

258
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.050
<v Speaker 2>how's that work?</v>

259
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the empire files and you're working </v>

260
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.840
<v Speaker 3>for Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

261
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.580
<v Speaker 3>It does seem crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy,</v>

262
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.210
<v Speaker 3>crazy juxtaposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is weird.</v>

263
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Ed Schultz was the one who said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

264
00:11:35.081 --> 00:11:36.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't.</v>

265
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.900
<v Speaker 3>He was told what to cover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what not to cover at MSNBC.</v>

266
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.620
<v Speaker 3>He was told not to cover Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to cover Bernie Sanders.</v>

267
00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:47.621
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that the Hillary Clinton </v>

268
00:11:47.621 --> 00:11:47.621
<v Speaker 3>campaign and the head of NBC News,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andy Lack.</v>

269
00:11:47.621 --> 00:11:50.240
<v Speaker 3>We're joined at the hip and he tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover Bernie Sanders.</v>

270
00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:53.300
<v Speaker 3>He was told not to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was yelled at by the head of MSNBC,</v>

271
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 3>how he described it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a month later he was fired.</v>

272
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 3>He was out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

273
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:01.690
<v Speaker 3>Jack had a similar situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack from the young Turks,</v>

274
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 3>just that he was told that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

275
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 3>our friends in Washington don't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>your tone.</v>

276
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they told him.</v>

277
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.800
<v Speaker 3>That is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was winning his time slot and </v>

278
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.720
<v Speaker 3>they told them that and they moved into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the weekend to give out sharp.</v>

279
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 3>This is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is true.</v>

280
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 3>So they moved them to the weekend and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they said they wanted him to work on his</v>

281
00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:22.780
<v Speaker 3>presentation skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys.</v>

282
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 3>Wedding is time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plot their segment.</v>

283
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 3>We want you to work on your presentation</v>
<v Speaker 3>skills.</v>

284
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 3>And meanwhile who they replaced them </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Al Sharpton.</v>

285
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 3>He's got great presentation skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

286
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:38.101
<v Speaker 3>Al Has sued on Al Sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see him try to read a </v>

287
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:40.950
<v Speaker 3>teleprompter is brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

288
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a great order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not a teleprompter reader and </v>

289
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.100
<v Speaker 3>it was like I have clips we used to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun of all the time on my show.</v>

290
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 3>If curious and then find out that that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason they gave was because he's a </v>

291
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.060
<v Speaker 3>better presenter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's better.</v>

292
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:59.250
<v Speaker 3>He's a great order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's different than being a news </v>

293
00:12:59.250 --> 00:12:59.630
<v Speaker 3>presenter and that is not in Al </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sharpton's wheelhouse.</v>

294
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just he's not the most trustworthy </v>

295
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:04.890
<v Speaker 3>person either.</v>

296
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's got a history of deception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you having that,</v>

297
00:13:06.381 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 3>the way he got that job?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

298
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 3>Well how about the way he became famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Tawana Brawley case.</v>

299
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean he became famous through </v>
<v Speaker 3>deception and so you're seeing this guy </v>

300
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.580
<v Speaker 3>who is basically a famous con man who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>now on television on a news program.</v>

301
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have.</v>

302
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.510
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at Brian Williams.</v>

303
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

304
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.140
<v Speaker 3>He has the 11th hour at an MSNBC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so since everybody forgotten,</v>

305
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.010

<v Speaker 3>I got.</v>

306
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.330
<v Speaker 3>His punishment was he had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to go spend six months a giggling</v>

307
00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:39.450
<v Speaker 3>with Rachel maddow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did he do?</v>

308
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Something show.</v>

309
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:47.731
<v Speaker 3>They have like these round tables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the end he has to laugh and pretend </v>

310
00:13:47.731 --> 00:13:48.370
<v Speaker 3>they all pretend they fucked up about </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

311
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.890
<v Speaker 3>All he had to do is tell the truth and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was scary enough.</v>

312
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.460
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And you're really.</v>

318

<v Speaker 3>Shots were fired.</v>

<v Speaker 3>straight up.</v>

321
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Lied about being in Bosnia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

327
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.520
<v Speaker 3>lying about being shot at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just,</v>

328
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.530
<v Speaker 3>it's always shocking to me when I find </v>
<v Speaker 3>out it had.</v>

329
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Politicians are lying.</v>

330
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.660
<v Speaker 3>They're all dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.130
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a.</v>

332
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 3>only the purest of people are drawn to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

333
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:44.101
<v Speaker 3>but freshman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's whenever I find out they're </v>

334
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:44.101
<v Speaker 3>narcissists.</v>

335
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:44.101
<v Speaker 3>Megaliters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>narcissistic megalomaniacs.</v>

336
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm always shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what it is,</v>

337
00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:50.401
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're weeding out the bad apples and </v>

338
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 3>then we're eventually gonna get to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>good ones.</v>

339
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to get rid of these bad ones </v>

340
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.281
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why it comes back to when he </v>

341
00:14:57.281 --> 00:14:57.281
<v Speaker 3>was talking about how Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want trump to be friends with Putin </v>

345
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.040
<v Speaker 3>because he's a nuclear power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want trump to be friends with anybody.</v>

346
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 3>We need detente.</v>
<v Speaker 3>NATO is the one wrapping up tensions,</v>

347
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 3>ramping up tensions with Russia and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have ever since the Cold War,</v>

348
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:13.940
<v Speaker 3>it supposedly ended and so it was just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>few anyways.</v>

349
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 3>So I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

350
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Putin has a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all bad guys.</v>

351
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's why I,</v>

352
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had John Kiriakou on my show.</v>

353
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:21.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he?</v>

354
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.520
<v Speaker 3>So he is a FCA guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went to prison because he exposed the</v>

355
00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:27.520
<v Speaker 3>torture program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

356
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 3>So Robert Mueller actually prosecuted </v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>

357
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.520
<v Speaker 3>So now he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a member of veterans intelligence </v>

358
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:36.520
<v Speaker 3>professionals for sanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vips.</v>

359
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 3>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

360
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:43.060
<v Speaker 3>they were invented or they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>originally organized to debunk the </v>

361
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.081
<v Speaker 3>weapons of mass destruction about Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were intelligence professionals </v>

362
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:51.011
<v Speaker 3>who knew what was happening that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>being sold a bill of goods because the </v>

363
00:15:51.011 --> 00:15:51.710
<v Speaker 3>military industrial complex wanted it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>

364
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they,</v>

365
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.460
<v Speaker 3>they were like all the top guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ray mcgovern,</v>

366
00:15:55.461 --> 00:15:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Bill Binney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

367
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 3>and they created this organization to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help debunk.</v>

368
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:05.111
<v Speaker 3>It will open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is the guy who was the first whistle </v>

369
00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:05.111
<v Speaker 3>blower for the NSF.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

370
00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:06.890
<v Speaker 3>And they tried to throw in the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to throw him in jail.</v>

371
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.140
<v Speaker 3>And of course he's the smartest guy at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the NSA of her head.</v>

372
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 3>So he outsmarted the FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well how did they do that?</v>

373
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.910
<v Speaker 3>So he had the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I forget the story,</v>

374
00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:17.630
<v Speaker 3>he told it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had them secretly recorded saying</v>

375
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:22.631
<v Speaker 3>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when they tried to show the </v>

376
00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 3>evidence against him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

377
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:24.680
<v Speaker 3>actually I got you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

378
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:26.460
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they could.</v>

379
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.480
<v Speaker 3>So he had him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he outsmarted them and he tells the </v>

380
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:31.480
<v Speaker 3>story on my show and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was about a year ago,</v>

381
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.801
<v Speaker 3>so I don't remember exactly how it went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he told me a lot of mindblowing </v>

382
00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:36.980
<v Speaker 3>stuff on my show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of stuff just to,</v>

383
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:38.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

384
00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:40.400
<v Speaker 3>like about how they spy on us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

385
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:45.401
<v Speaker 3>he was the one that first expose this </v>
<v Speaker 3>program that was essentially spying on </v>

386
00:16:45.401 --> 00:16:46.520
<v Speaker 3>every single email,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single voicemail,</v>

387
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.130
<v Speaker 3>every single conversation that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>is being recorded.</v>

388
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.740
<v Speaker 3>So William Binney invented a thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>called thin thread.</v>

389
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:57.070
<v Speaker 3>So thin thread was a data collection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what he did is he hooked up every </v>

390
00:16:57.141 --> 00:17:00.680
<v Speaker 3>cell phone to every cell phone in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the universe.</v>

391
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:05.710
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he did it and it was hard to do and </v>

392
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.710
<v Speaker 3>everybody said you couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did it.</v>

393
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:10.130
<v Speaker 3>And so he knew that medidata.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was more predictive than say,</v>

394
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:13.250
<v Speaker 3>if I tap your phone and listen to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual phone conversation,</v>

395
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.300
<v Speaker 3>that I actually learned more by looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a larger data set.</v>

396
00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:18.040
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

397
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 3>when context start happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means movements happening.</v>

398
00:17:21.171 --> 00:17:22.430
<v Speaker 3>That means that attack is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

399
00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:24.950
<v Speaker 3>That means more so if the metadata means</v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

400
00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:29.210
<v Speaker 3>And so he found a way to attract people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and keep your identity secret.</v>

401
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 3>So it was constitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he cared about,</v>

402
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:39.011
<v Speaker 3>the constitution and the right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>privacy and thin thread did that it was </v>

403
00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:42.941
<v Speaker 3>a better and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they got rid of thin thread and a </v>

404
00:17:42.941 --> 00:17:42.941
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11 happened.</v>

405
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.710
<v Speaker 3>So that's what built.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's who bill binney is.</v>

406
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:50.711
<v Speaker 3>And so he said they got rid of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's billions of dollars in </v>

407
00:17:50.711 --> 00:17:50.711
<v Speaker 3>the do pro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They brought in a,</v>

408
00:17:50.711 --> 00:17:51.710
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

409
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called trailblazer out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not as good as a tracker,</v>

410
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.740
<v Speaker 3>not as good as a metadata thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was five,</v>

411
00:17:58.741 --> 00:18:01.560
<v Speaker 3>$6,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Booz Allen or whoever invented it.</v>

412
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.800
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it's all about is it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all about money and you don't want to </v>

413
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.740
<v Speaker 3>disappoint people who want to have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of money paid their way.</v>

414
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what.</v>

415
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:14.031
<v Speaker 3>So he blew the whistle on that and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>come back at them and they tried to put </v>

416
00:18:14.031 --> 00:18:14.250
<v Speaker 3>him in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do to whistleblowers.</v>

417
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 3>That's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's funny to hear him say,</v>

418
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.200
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody wrote a bad book about Putin </v>

419
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:21.200
<v Speaker 3>and they ended up dead.</v>

420
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 3>What do you think we do in this country?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look what they did to Chelsea manning.</v>

421
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Look what we did to people who expose </v>
<v Speaker 3>war crimes inside of our country right </v>

422
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.470
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying.</v>

423
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:28.380
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to assassinate Juliana </v>
<v Speaker 3>sons.</v>

424
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.930
<v Speaker 3>They haven't been basically solitary </v>
<v Speaker 3>confinement.</v>

425
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.450
<v Speaker 3>We literally did torture Chelsea </v>
<v Speaker 3>Manning.</v>

426
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

427
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.450
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

428
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Barack Obama used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

429
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:43.090
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he prosecuted lots of whistleblowing </v>

430
00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:43.200
<v Speaker 3>journalists using the non.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blanking on the word it's called,</v>

431
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.330
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

432
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.710
<v Speaker 3>espionage act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this idea that,</v>

433
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure poor,</v>

434
00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 3>maybe Putin didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that woman who wrote that book </v>

435
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 3>about Putin has a lot of powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>enemies.</v>

436
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Usually you do when you are that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>been a journalist where you're exposing </v>

437
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 3>the powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She probably didn't just expose booton.</v>

438
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.540
<v Speaker 3>So she probably exposed a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point being is that,</v>

439
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

440
00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:05.400
<v Speaker 3>now who's being naive gay?</v>

441
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she probably did expose a lot of </v>

442
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.911
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also very likely that Putin </v>

443
00:19:13.911 --> 00:19:13.911
<v Speaker 3>enter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

444
00:19:13.911 --> 00:19:17.960
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not denying that Barack Obama had a </v>

445
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.600
<v Speaker 3>kill list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these guys are out,</v>

446
00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

447
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.510
<v Speaker 3>he took us from two hours to seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did Libya,</v>

448
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.240
<v Speaker 3>turned it into a failed state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now they have open slave trading.</v>

449
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're watching on youtube.</v>

450
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.220
<v Speaker 3>So dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they wanted to do it again.</v>

451
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:30.510
<v Speaker 3>They want to do it in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want.</v>

452
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.220
<v Speaker 3>So Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you a question.</v>

453
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 3>If we get rid of Assad in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know who takes over?</v>

454
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jesus?</v>

455
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

456
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Who starts running things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moses,</v>

457
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Elka,</v>
<v Speaker 3>al Qaeda,</v>

458
00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:45.670
<v Speaker 3>El Nuestra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

459
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that the power vacuum that always </v>

460
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:50.980
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

461
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:50.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

462
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.730
<v Speaker 3>the Wahhabi terrorist funded by Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arabia,</v>

463
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.760
<v Speaker 3>that's who takes over and I have video </v>
<v Speaker 3>tape after videotape of our top </v>

464
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.171
<v Speaker 3>officials admitting that Saudi Arabia </v>
<v Speaker 3>Funds Isis and that we also did so and </v>

465
00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:05.550
<v Speaker 3>that we created,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we created al Qaeda,</v>

466
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.790
<v Speaker 3>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we create an isis was created because of</v>

467
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:13.791
<v Speaker 3>our invasion of Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then we actually fund them and we </v>

468
00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:15.170
<v Speaker 3>ship them arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for what reason?</v>

469
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 3>To overthrow aside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can put a pipeline through Syria.</v>

470
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.440
<v Speaker 3>So we fund them so that they fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>Assad.</v>

471
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 3>But then Saudi Arabia funds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't the first time we did that.</v>

472
00:20:25.831 --> 00:20:28.440
<v Speaker 3>We funded to Al Ida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would fight the Russians.</v>

473
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the same.</v>

474
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.130
<v Speaker 3>And then we were left with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When was the mujahideen?</v>

475
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.180
<v Speaker 3>That's when they were the moon.</v>

476
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi Dean.</v>

477
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.040
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have videotapes of Hillary Clinton</v>

478
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.190
<v Speaker 3>screaming about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We created this problem.</v>

479
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.170
<v Speaker 3>She says this on video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have it.</v>

480
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.150
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

481
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.940
<v Speaker 3>that's why I get trouble because I tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth about the war.</v>

482
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.240
<v Speaker 3>And if you tell the truth about the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be called a conspiracy theorist </v>

483
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:54.550
<v Speaker 3>by the establishment news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what's happened.</v>

484
00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 3>That happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you conspiracy theorist?</v>

485
00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they say.</v>

486
00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 3>You know what the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I tell the truth about Syria,</v>

487
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

488
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.540
<v Speaker 3>the biggest conspiracy in my lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the Iraq war.</v>

489
00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:05.410
<v Speaker 3>That was a conspiracy.</v>

490
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's legit.</v>

491
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a legit conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

492
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's when you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>prove right.</v>

493
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean I used to have a whole bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

494
00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a whole bit about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

495
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.910
<v Speaker 1>the only way to find out if someone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like from 2005,</v>

496
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.000
<v Speaker 1>it was that the reason why they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>George Bush and power is the only way to</v>

497
00:21:21.001 --> 00:21:26.001
<v Speaker 1>find out if someone is really stupid is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put an actual stupid guy in his </v>

498
00:21:26.001 --> 00:21:30.411
<v Speaker 1>president and find out if everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaks out because the only way to </v>

499
00:21:30.411 --> 00:21:30.411
<v Speaker 1>really tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>

500
00:21:30.411 --> 00:21:32.190
<v Speaker 1>well we could put a smart guy in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have Mac.</v>

501
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

502
00:21:32.641 --> 00:21:32.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

503
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.890
<v Speaker 1>We'll never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll never know.</v>

504
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.240
<v Speaker 1>We'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get a dumb guy.</v>

505
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Let's just try it out and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

506
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.770
<v Speaker 1>And then it was all the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about us going to war in Iraq.</v>

507
00:21:40.771 --> 00:21:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Like why did we go to the war over there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why?</v>

508
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:46.800
<v Speaker 1>What did we tell them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they bought that Holy Shit.</v>

509
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.670
<v Speaker 1>And then he won again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won again.</v>

510
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I go and you know,</v>

511
00:21:52.441 --> 00:21:53.820
<v Speaker 1>there's someone in the back of the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

512
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I think we can go dumber.</v>

513
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And that became trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

514
00:22:02.941 --> 00:22:06.780
<v Speaker 1>that was from 2005 from my showtime </v>
<v Speaker 1>special from 13 years ago.</v>

515
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.110
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you something,</v>

516
00:22:09.111 --> 00:22:14.111
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be allowed to be president and </v>

517
00:22:14.111 --> 00:22:15.260
<v Speaker 3>was allowed to be president because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the bidding of the establishment.</v>

518
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.170
<v Speaker 3>They're on board with most of the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing there like that.</v>

519
00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:19.490
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>

520
00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.950
<v Speaker 3>he's not pulling back on any of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wars.</v>

521
00:22:21.951 --> 00:22:26.951
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've all ramped up the military </v>

522
00:22:26.951 --> 00:22:28.541
<v Speaker 3>budget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it funny Joe not protecting him </v>

523
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:28.541
<v Speaker 3>from you or they're not protecting him </v>
<v Speaker 3>from this,</v>

524
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:29.510
<v Speaker 3>this investigation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

525
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:30.680
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's happened.</v>

526
00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

527
00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:37.050
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they've gotten them on is all </v>

528
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:37.050
<v Speaker 3>regular corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

529
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:37.050
<v Speaker 3>trump is corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

530
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.320
<v Speaker 3>he's corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's corrupt with Saudi Arabia.</v>

531
00:22:39.321 --> 00:22:41.720
<v Speaker 3>He's corrupt with Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He grew up with Israel.</v>

532
00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.860
<v Speaker 3>He's get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all corrupt,</v>

533
00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:46.790
<v Speaker 3>but he thought the Clinton Foundation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're there all the chomsky quote,</v>

534
00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:49.780
<v Speaker 3>they'd all be hung if we applied the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nuremberg standards.</v>

535
00:22:49.781 --> 00:22:51.200
<v Speaker 3>So this is the world we're living in.</v>

536
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:56.030
<v Speaker 3>So this idea that somehow we need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus extra on trump and somehow poot.</v>

537
00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.860
<v Speaker 3>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists,</v>

538
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.200
<v Speaker 3>the Anti Putin journalists in Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>will tell you that we're a bunch of </v>

539
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.870
<v Speaker 3>numbskulls over here because we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflating Putin's power.</v>

540
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:11.110
<v Speaker 3>So we are blood like he's this all </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful guy who's got his finger in </v>

541
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.741
<v Speaker 3>every decision everywhere at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ellison mulattoes now blaming the Green </v>

542
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.350
<v Speaker 3>party being controlled by the Russians </v>
<v Speaker 3>for an Ohio election.</v>

543
00:23:18.351 --> 00:23:19.640
<v Speaker 3>A special election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>

544
00:23:19.641 --> 00:23:24.290
<v Speaker 3>I could show you some Milana and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Doesn't love Alyssa Milano,</v>

545
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's beautiful.</v>

546
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.170
<v Speaker 3>She's one of the prettiest of all time.</v>

547
00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I met her in a hotel once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you really wandering through the </v>

548
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:32.290
<v Speaker 1>hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got an elevator together.</v>

549
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:36.820
<v Speaker 1>So here is can't believe him in a hotel </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator with just not as I said hello.</v>

550
00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.930
<v Speaker 1>She said hello back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was it.</v>

551
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.840
<v Speaker 3>Did she know who you were?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

552
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.270
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a long time ago too.</v>

553
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.680
<v Speaker 3>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what sucks,</v>

554
00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:49.681
<v Speaker 3>because of our unwillingness to pass </v>
<v Speaker 3>policy that protects our election </v>

555
00:23:49.681 --> 00:23:53.231
<v Speaker 3>integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I immediately think the Green party </v>

556
00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:53.420
<v Speaker 3>votes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And tonight's our Russian meddling.</v>

557
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.660
<v Speaker 3>Why else would eddie would cast a </v>
<v Speaker 3>protest vote in Ohio when there's so </v>

558
00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 3>much at stake?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much at stake.</v>

559
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.540
<v Speaker 3>That's so delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

560
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Protest vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your vote worth?</v>

561
00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.100
<v Speaker 2>If everyone votes and they all vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>green,</v>

562
00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.580
<v Speaker 2>is that a protest vote?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it is possible that the Green party </v>

563
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:11.800
<v Speaker 2>can win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like do you have no faith?</v>

564
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.840
<v Speaker 2>So what they're doing is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>just bowing down to a rig system saying </v>

565
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.240
<v Speaker 2>the system is rigged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just vote for side b,</v>

566
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.360
<v Speaker 2>even though side a and b are funded by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same people I know,</v>

567
00:24:22.361 --> 00:24:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ideologically side B is our side.</v>

568
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what she's saying.</v>

569
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:31.570
<v Speaker 3>So what they've gone past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now the hashtag resistance have gone </v>

570
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.261
<v Speaker 3>beyond voters shaming and now what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're actually doing is democracy </v>

571
00:24:35.261 --> 00:24:38.861
<v Speaker 3>shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to participate in </v>

572
00:24:38.861 --> 00:24:38.861
<v Speaker 3>democracy and those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let me tell you something.</v>

573
00:24:38.861 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 3>When people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

574
00:24:39.441 --> 00:24:40.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Greens take away vote.</v>

575
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
<v Speaker 3>I would not have voted in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential election if I did not have </v>

576
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.300
<v Speaker 3>the opportunity to vote for the Green </v>
<v Speaker 3>Party.</v>

577
00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.570
<v Speaker 3>Just so those votes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't own those votes.</v>

578
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:54.710
<v Speaker 3>The way electoral politics works is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have enough votes to win,</v>

579
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:58.100
<v Speaker 3>you have to go get them and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>appeal to those votes,</v>

580
00:24:58.101 --> 00:25:01.430
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have an appeal to voters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Democratic Party,</v>

581
00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:06.431
<v Speaker 3>they have nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what they have left is fear and </v>

582
00:25:06.431 --> 00:25:08.540
<v Speaker 3>voter shaming and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're actually shaming democracy.</v>

583
00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would also think that by the time </v>

584
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:13.620
<v Speaker 2>after we've gotten through this past </v>
<v Speaker 2>election where no one,</v>

585
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.430
<v Speaker 2>literally no one in the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>

586
00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:17.680
<v Speaker 2>then maybe Fox News predicted that trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>was gonna win,</v>

587
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:22.950
<v Speaker 2>no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all were 100 percent sure hillary </v>

588
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.950
<v Speaker 2>was gonna win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were.</v>

589
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:26.230
<v Speaker 2>They were had in the 90 percent range of</v>
<v Speaker 2>probability of her winning and they were</v>

590
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.870
<v Speaker 2>displaying it on cnn so they know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>

591
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.670
<v Speaker 2>So why would someone think that a Green </v>
<v Speaker 2>party candidate has to be,</v>

592
00:25:33.671 --> 00:25:37.030
<v Speaker 2>or a libertarian candidate has to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest vote?</v>

593
00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Why can't it be a real vote at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point when you're talking about the kind</v>

594
00:25:40.631 --> 00:25:45.631
<v Speaker 2>of social media outreach that is capable</v>
<v Speaker 2>today that's possible today,</v>

595
00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.610
<v Speaker 2>what you a person who has some really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good points,</v>

596
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.860
<v Speaker 2>and as I look at this woman who wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York,</v>

597
00:25:50.861 --> 00:25:53.080
<v Speaker 2>the 28 year old girls a democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialist,</v>

598
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Alessandra ocozzio plant says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

599
00:25:55.661 --> 00:26:00.661
<v Speaker 2>if that doesn't tell you like this world</v>
<v Speaker 2>is changing in a radical way and </v>

600
00:26:00.661 --> 00:26:04.950
<v Speaker 2>upstarts and and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people who are huge underdogs have </v>

601
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.160
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a protest vote.</v>

602
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:11.310
<v Speaker 2>It's an actual vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if everybody who thinks this way </v>

603
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.830
<v Speaker 2>votes towards that protest vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

604
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.270
<v Speaker 2>They win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

605
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:13.960
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

606
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.890
<v Speaker 3>So I used to have a joke or I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

607
00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:20.460
<v Speaker 3>you can't vote for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can vote for a third party candidate</v>

608
00:26:20.461 --> 00:26:23.010
<v Speaker 3>until a lot of people already voting for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a third party candidate.</v>

609
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.500
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're saying.</v>

610
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.000
<v Speaker 3>You can't vote for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have no chance to win.</v>

611
00:26:27.001 --> 00:26:32.001
<v Speaker 3>So you have to wait until a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are already so that people don't </v>

612
00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:32.550
<v Speaker 3>understand that inherent contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

613
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 3>people maybe if you spent a 10th of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy trying to excite the half of the </v>

614
00:26:38.521 --> 00:26:43.521
<v Speaker 3>country that doesn't vote as you do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to voter shame progressive's or </v>

615
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:46.980
<v Speaker 3>Green Party or environmentalist for not </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving you their vote,</v>

616
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:51.981
<v Speaker 3>what you do not fucking own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would've spent a 10th of the energy </v>

617
00:26:51.981 --> 00:26:54.360
<v Speaker 3>trying to excite people who don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>participate to participate.</v>

618
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Instead of shaming the people who do </v>
<v Speaker 3>participate.</v>

619
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:57.930
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you'd get somewhere.</v>

620
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.300
<v Speaker 2>It's also this reluctance to admit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides are corrupt,</v>

621
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:06.330
<v Speaker 2>is this very strange thing that exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>on people who operate within those </v>

622
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:10.891
<v Speaker 2>narrow bandwidth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this narrow bandwidth is whatever </v>

623
00:27:10.891 --> 00:27:14.491
<v Speaker 2>side you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's you're on the right or the </v>

624
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:16.141
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the side that you want to win </v>

625
00:27:16.141 --> 00:27:16.600
<v Speaker 2>and it's the right side and they're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>good people and the other side,</v>

626
00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:17.200
<v Speaker 2>even though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

627
00:27:17.201 --> 00:27:20.920
<v Speaker 2>even though our side does wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this side does worse and they operate in</v>

628
00:27:20.921 --> 00:27:25.921
<v Speaker 2>this real narrow bandwidth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why she would think something </v>

629
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:29.440
<v Speaker 2>that's possibly negative for her side is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a protest vote.</v>

630
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Instead of being your actual feelings on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue,</v>

631
00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.220
<v Speaker 3>and if these people really cared about </v>
<v Speaker 3>voting integrity,</v>

632
00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:41.221
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't they want paper ballots?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they really cared about a voter </v>

633
00:27:41.221 --> 00:27:44.851
<v Speaker 3>integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't they want rank choice voting </v>

634
00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:44.851
<v Speaker 3>when they want that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you don't,</v>

635
00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:48.921
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to worry about this </v>

636
00:27:48.921 --> 00:27:48.921
<v Speaker 3>choice voting choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have it in Maine now,</v>

637
00:27:48.921 --> 00:27:48.921
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

638
00:27:48.921 --> 00:27:49.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's where,</v>

639
00:27:49.691 --> 00:27:49.930
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

640
00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.160
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to,</v>

641
00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.400
<v Speaker 3>this is my first choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my second choice.</v>

642
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.580
<v Speaker 3>This is my third choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't get to.</v>

643
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.010
<v Speaker 3>So it eliminates that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a spoiler,</v>

644
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>

645
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

646
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

647
00:28:03.341 --> 00:28:08.341
<v Speaker 3>and they voted in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Maine and the politicians of course </v>

648
00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:12.661
<v Speaker 3>don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they got rid of it and the court </v>

649
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:12.661
<v Speaker 3>reinstated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hadn't been.</v>

650
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:13.690
<v Speaker 3>I think it's happened twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

651
00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.380
<v Speaker 3>How does it work</v>

652
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.750
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like say if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote for a governor of Maine,</v>

653
00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.090
<v Speaker 2>you have a first choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A second choice.</v>

654
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>

655
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.540
<v Speaker 3>let's say there's three choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get to,</v>

656
00:28:22.541 --> 00:28:24.010
<v Speaker 3>you get to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

657
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:29.070
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say if your first choice was a </v>

658
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.070
<v Speaker 3>green party candidate and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

659
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.131
<v Speaker 3>that's my first choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my second choice would be the </v>

660
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:34.081
<v Speaker 3>Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in my third choice would be maybe </v>

661
00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:35.410
<v Speaker 3>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so does second choice have different</v>

662
00:28:35.411 --> 00:28:36.360
<v Speaker 3>points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you that,</v>

663
00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.920
<v Speaker 3>if your first choice doesn't get enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>votes to win,</v>

664
00:28:38.921 --> 00:28:40.870
<v Speaker 3>then your second choice goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

665
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.020
<v Speaker 3>So that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're never wasting your vote.</v>

666
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.690
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's ironic is that,</v>

667
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:47.920
<v Speaker 3>and I might have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

668
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.830
<v Speaker 3>there's people who can better explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>that simply.</v>

669
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.400
<v Speaker 3>I know people are going be jamie the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weighty,</v>

670
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.620
<v Speaker 3>better way to say that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's better ways,</v>

671
00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.860
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that kills me is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders,</v>

672
00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.670
<v Speaker 3>his whole career was about being an </v>
<v Speaker 3>independent.</v>

673
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.010
<v Speaker 3>And I have video tapes of him saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

674
00:29:03.011 --> 00:29:03.750
<v Speaker 3>what kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

675
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.040
<v Speaker 3>what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These talks that I talk to people,</v>

676
00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:07.600
<v Speaker 3>they come up to me after these debates </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they said,</v>

677
00:29:07.601 --> 00:29:09.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like what you said and uh,</v>

678
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.110
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make the most sense.</v>

679
00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.120
<v Speaker 3>But I can't vote for you because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>never going to win.</v>

680
00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.980
<v Speaker 3>I hate that they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to waste my vote.</v>

681
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:20.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's one thing I hate more than </v>

682
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:20.040
<v Speaker 3>that phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>waste your vote.</v>

683
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.230
<v Speaker 3>This was what he was saying his entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>career until now.</v>

684
00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.820
<v Speaker 3>And I want to know why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what the hell does Bernie</v>

685
00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Sanders in 2018 know that Bernie Sanders</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2006 didn't know.</v>

686
00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.530
<v Speaker 3>And Bernie Sanders in 1996 doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he tells everybody you got to run.</v>

687
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:36.360
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

688
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.350
<v Speaker 3>getting people to come into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party,</v>

689
00:29:38.351 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 3>which is actively cheating them yet he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>still seeing and him.</v>

690
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.680
<v Speaker 3>And he still runs as an independent in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Maine.</v>

691
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean in Vermont.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still runs it.</v>

692
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Everybody say you guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see he gets to run as an </v>

693
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:51.990
<v Speaker 3>independent.</v>

694
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.550
<v Speaker 1>He gets the running as an independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>while represented.</v>

695
00:29:52.551 --> 00:29:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

696
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.270
<v Speaker 1>So they have a special sweetheart deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

697
00:29:56.271 --> 00:29:59.900
<v Speaker 1>What is he saying when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's saying now that protest votes are a</v>

698
00:29:59.901 --> 00:30:01.280
<v Speaker 1>waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is he saying?</v>

699
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.390
<v Speaker 3>He told everybody vote for Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told.</v>

700
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:08.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not starting a third party and you </v>

701
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:08.410
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his whole life,</v>

702
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:11.991
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that we have to have the </v>

703
00:30:11.991 --> 00:30:13.470
<v Speaker 3>verbiage he used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One time I saw him was that,</v>

704
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

705
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:15.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesse Jackson's correct.</v>

706
00:30:15.811 --> 00:30:17.730
<v Speaker 3>We knew we needed a rainbow coalition of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

707
00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:23.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it has to happen outside of the </v>

708
00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that that was him.</v>

709
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.800
<v Speaker 3>So we have to have a progressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>coalition,</v>

710
00:30:25.801 --> 00:30:28.320
<v Speaker 3>but it has to happen outside and who </v>
<v Speaker 3>better to lead it.</v>

711
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.050
<v Speaker 3>But Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why it's hard to start a third</v>

712
00:30:31.051 --> 00:30:35.940
<v Speaker 3>party because you need people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>already famous and popular and,</v>

713
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in government.</v>

714
00:30:36.841 --> 00:30:41.841
<v Speaker 3>So if he left and he got saved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tulsi Gabbert and Nina Turner and </v>

715
00:30:41.841 --> 00:30:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Alexandra Cause your court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he got a bunch of people that are </v>

716
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.201
<v Speaker 3>super popular on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd have a third party and that would </v>

717
00:30:48.201 --> 00:30:48.330
<v Speaker 3>be pulling at 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 percent.</v>

718
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:53.330
<v Speaker 3>And now the Democrats would have to join</v>
<v Speaker 3>former coalition instead of what they're</v>

719
00:30:53.341 --> 00:30:55.710
<v Speaker 3>doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is ignoring progressives.</v>

720
00:30:56.070 --> 00:31:01.070
<v Speaker 3>After she cheated Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the Democrats cheated Bernie </v>

721
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Sanders in the primary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton didn't choose Bernie </v>

722
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Sanders as their vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an olive branch.</v>

723
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't choose a little bit with worn as</v>
<v Speaker 3>an olive branch.</v>

724
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:11.660
<v Speaker 3>She went to her right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got Tim Kaine was to the right of </v>

725
00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.180
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's anti union,</v>

726
00:31:12.181 --> 00:31:12.440
<v Speaker 3>whose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

727
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.940
<v Speaker 3>everything bad thing you want in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Corporate Democrat,</v>

728
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.380
<v Speaker 3>he's pro walled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole deal.</v>

729
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:21.710
<v Speaker 3>She went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just so if we had a third party that </v>

730
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:22.610
<v Speaker 3>actually pulled at 10 or 15 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have to.</v>

731
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:23.850
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd have to.</v>

732
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:28.320
<v Speaker 3>They'd have to do a thing called Joe </v>
<v Speaker 3>voter outreach instead of voters shaming</v>

733
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:31.350
<v Speaker 3>or it's what it's devolved to now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is democracy shaming.</v>

734
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.190
<v Speaker 3>They're literally shaming people for </v>
<v Speaker 3>participating in democracy.</v>

735
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:40.280
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to participate in </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy because you're a third party </v>

736
00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:40.920
<v Speaker 3>will fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's called democracy.</v>

737
00:31:40.921 --> 00:31:42.480
<v Speaker 3>And so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

738
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.630
<v Speaker 3>And I get to vote my conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be right back.</v>

739
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.130
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

740
00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.180
<v Speaker 1>That break right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solid going a radio show,</v>

741
00:31:51.181 --> 00:31:53.040
<v Speaker 1>that will be the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

742
00:31:53.041 --> 00:31:58.041
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why we came in today </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because we wanted to talk about the </v>

743
00:31:58.041 --> 00:31:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

744
00:31:58.351 --> 00:32:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I know you were a notch as a vocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>critic of Alex Jones.</v>

745
00:32:01.411 --> 00:32:03.960
<v Speaker 1>You spit in his face on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on live Internet show.</v>

746
00:32:03.961 --> 00:32:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I did not spit in his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was completely involuntary.</v>

747
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.070
<v Speaker 1>He coughed and liquid came out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

748
00:32:11.071 --> 00:32:13.230
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones is hilarious.</v>

749
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.910
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no denying that.</v>

750
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.030
<v Speaker 1>He's occasionally very hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

751
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I told you what happened.</v>

752
00:32:20.101 --> 00:32:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I was walking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's having this,</v>

753
00:32:21.331 --> 00:32:23.280
<v Speaker 1>they're just about to go fisticuffs the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>

754
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And as I walk up he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

755
00:32:25.831 --> 00:32:27.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to be nice and you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spit.</v>

756
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:31.050
<v Speaker 1>And I had a mouthful iced tea and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that's my story.</v>

757
00:32:31.051 --> 00:32:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm sticking to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good story.</v>

758
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:39.120
<v Speaker 1>You know who trump meant to say would I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would actually say would.</v>

759
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

760
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually,</v>

761
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.870
<v Speaker 2>what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any reason why they would,</v>

762
00:32:44.871 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 2>but he meant to say what it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

763
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the worst lies I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody's ever told on television in </v>

764
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.630
<v Speaker 2>front of millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a disturbing lie because in the</v>

765
00:32:53.631 --> 00:32:56.030
<v Speaker 2>context of the words and the way he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating,</v>

766
00:32:56.031 --> 00:32:58.730
<v Speaker 2>it's very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very clear.</v>

767
00:32:58.731 --> 00:32:59.650
<v Speaker 2>He meant to say what</v>

768
00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:03.030
<v Speaker 3>it meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was disconcerting to me for different</v>

769
00:33:03.031 --> 00:33:08.031
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was disconcerting to me because it </v>

770
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:08.031
<v Speaker 3>showed that he</v>

771
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:08.031
<v Speaker 2>mcadam to cave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

772
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Someone talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone pulled them aside and said,</v>

773
00:33:08.861 --> 00:33:10.870
<v Speaker 2>do you understand what the fuck is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on here?</v>

774
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.190
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they go,</v>

775
00:33:12.191 --> 00:33:12.710
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

776
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

777
00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:18.010
<v Speaker 3>trump contradicted our intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities in public in Helsinki,</v>

778
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.410
<v Speaker 3>and that's treason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No ass wipe.</v>

779
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.430
<v Speaker 3>That's not treason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The president sets our foreign policy.</v>

780
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.740
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to contradict the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking president.</v>

781
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the president says goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hate fucking saying this because </v>

782
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fan of Donald trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but God damn it,</v>

783
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:38.070
<v Speaker 3>we all lose our head and think that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unelected spies run our foreign policy.</v>

784
00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:42.670
<v Speaker 3>They do not spice spice or spice </v>
<v Speaker 3>unelected.</v>

785
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

786
00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:47.500
<v Speaker 3>and the ones who let us into Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not forget that the very.</v>

787
00:33:47.501 --> 00:33:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Do Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

788
00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:54.330
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever play that video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played almost weekly on my show of </v>

789
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.151
<v Speaker 3>Robert Molar lying about weapons of mass</v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction to Congress to get us into </v>

790
00:33:57.151 --> 00:33:57.151
<v Speaker 3>the Iraq war.</v>

791
00:33:57.151 --> 00:34:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was misinformed at the time.</v>

792
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't aware of all the information </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know him along with Colin Powell</v>

793
00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:08.070
<v Speaker 2>and many others where they're just good </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

794
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.280
<v Speaker 2>good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good people to do it in a bad.</v>

795
00:34:11.281 --> 00:34:16.281
<v Speaker 2>Those those no bid contracts at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Halliburton got for billions and </v>

796
00:34:16.281 --> 00:34:20.990
<v Speaker 2>billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just because they were the right </v>

797
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:20.990
<v Speaker 2>ones for the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

798
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:23.511
<v Speaker 2>why have bids when you've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>Halliburton and you've got a guy who's </v>

799
00:34:23.511 --> 00:34:25.140
<v Speaker 2>really close to Halliburton and Dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cheney,</v>

800
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.350
<v Speaker 2>who used to be the CEO of Halliburton as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vice president.</v>

801
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.400
<v Speaker 2>He got a sweet deal here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take advantage of it.</v>

802
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Halliburton gave Dick Cheney a </v>
<v Speaker 3>$30,000,000</v>

803
00:34:33.791 --> 00:34:37.570
<v Speaker 3>down payment when he became vice </v>
<v Speaker 3>president of this little bit of that.</v>

804
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Trying to help you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you like to go duck hunting,</v>

805
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.340
<v Speaker 2>give you a nice gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't shoot your friend in the face.</v>

806
00:34:44.341 --> 00:34:47.790
<v Speaker 2>That's how I used to do a bit about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

807
00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:50.190
<v Speaker 2>He shot his friend in the face and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend,</v>

808
00:34:50.191 --> 00:34:51.690
<v Speaker 2>apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize.</v>

809
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.030
<v Speaker 2>That's how gangster Dick Cheney is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

810
00:34:54.031 --> 00:34:59.031
<v Speaker 2>I should've been there or I looked like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bird thing was so fucking crazy,</v>

811
00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:01.910
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

812
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.460
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about Alex Jones being </v>
<v Speaker 2>the platform.</v>

813
00:35:05.461 --> 00:35:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

814
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.620
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're,</v>

815
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 2>it's almost waited for apple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like when apple pulled them </v>

816
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.450
<v Speaker 2>from itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

817
00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>

818
00:35:19.801 --> 00:35:20.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>danced with it,</v>

819
00:35:20.821 --> 00:35:22.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd given him some strikes.</v>

820
00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:27.830
<v Speaker 2>It was really recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like within the last couple of that </v>

821
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.310
<v Speaker 2>facebook had given him some strikes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube gave him some strikes and people</v>

822
00:35:30.311 --> 00:35:30.840
<v Speaker 2>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

823
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:31.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some,</v>

824
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.840
<v Speaker 2>I felt like almost like unfounded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

825
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 2>speculation</v>

826
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.230
<v Speaker 1>that they would remove him from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

827
00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 1>My 10 navigant or move him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

828
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:45.630
<v Speaker 1>That's too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>

829
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.240
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in one fell swoop.</v>

830
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spotify remove him.</v>

831
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 1>They were going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

832
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Itunes removed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a loophole though that some </v>

833
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:58.110
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw an article today where people want</v>

834
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.610
<v Speaker 1>nothing less than total destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

835
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that apple,</v>

836
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked Alex Jones and got rid of them,</v>

837
00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 1>but they offered him a safety net in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of the APP that he has on their APP</v>

838
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:11.730
<v Speaker 1>store that they're still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were trying to take that down to</v>

839
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:16.731
<v Speaker 1>like take down his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his show became instantly way more </v>

840
00:36:16.731 --> 00:36:16.731
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

841
00:36:16.731 --> 00:36:16.731
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it can.</v>

842
00:36:16.731 --> 00:36:20.480
<v Speaker 1>The unintended consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to tell people that,</v>

843
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

844
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defending Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm defending,</v>

845
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:26.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the principle of freedom of speech.</v>

846
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are convicted of killers or.</v>

847
00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:29.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on death row,</v>

848
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:35.630
<v Speaker 1>they still get their freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to print articles and </v>

849
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.630
<v Speaker 1>they're allowed to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

850
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.630
<v Speaker 1>They're still allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

851
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:36.780
<v Speaker 1>he's allowed to still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

852
00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:38.520
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hasn't been silenced.</v>

853
00:36:38.521 --> 00:36:43.521
<v Speaker 1>He has his website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could put his show out on his </v>

854
00:36:43.521 --> 00:36:43.521
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can,</v>

855
00:36:43.521 --> 00:36:45.120
<v Speaker 1>he can host it from his website and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could all be fine,</v>

856
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:50.330
<v Speaker 1>but these major media companies now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just decided we've had enough.</v>

857
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.160
<v Speaker 1>We don't want this on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's the thing,</v>

858
00:36:53.161 --> 00:36:58.161
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he said that they </v>

859
00:36:58.161 --> 00:37:02.140
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the straw that broke the </v>

860
00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.801
<v Speaker 1>camel's back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like it's not a recent </v>

861
00:37:03.801 --> 00:37:03.900
<v Speaker 1>statement that says go to the court </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcripts and we'll figure out.</v>

862
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't.</v>

863
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:06.390
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

864
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.790
<v Speaker 1>there is no hearing or nothing.</v>

865
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.230
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a judicial hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no.</v>

866
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they just want,</v>

867
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.390
<v Speaker 1>they let some Jag off billionaire in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night on a whim,</v>

868
00:37:15.391 --> 00:37:16.790
<v Speaker 1>fucking do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what happened?</v>

869
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was some billionaire or do you </v>

870
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.531
<v Speaker 1>think it's the middle managers and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>executives at all these giant tech </v>

871
00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:28.000
<v Speaker 1>companies have just decided?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

872
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

873
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.260
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

874
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.980
<v Speaker 1>the government tells facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

875
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.520
<v Speaker 1>what to do a lot of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

876
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:40.521
<v Speaker 1>And so they bow to the government all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time because they don't want to be </v>

877
00:37:40.521 --> 00:37:40.521
<v Speaker 1>regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

878
00:37:40.521 --> 00:37:41.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why they just,</v>

879
00:37:41.701 --> 00:37:44.520
<v Speaker 1>they just started having hearings with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they had those hearings.</v>

880
00:37:44.521 --> 00:37:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Should we regulate facebook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those hearings,</v>

881
00:37:47.371 --> 00:37:49.770
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking bizarre.</v>

882
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.400
<v Speaker 1>It was like a guy pretending to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>

883
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like some sort of a robot or an </v>

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.931
<v Speaker 1>alien the way you would sip water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would take like this and it was like </v>

885
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.080
<v Speaker 1>a guy spitting dip into a glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go to.</v>

886
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:10.390
<v Speaker 1>It was the weirdest little sips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone should make a compilation of </v>

887

<v Speaker 1>those Zuckerberg or pressure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

898
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.940

<v Speaker 3>Act Normal.</v>

899
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 3>Be Human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans drink water,</v>

900
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:50.190
<v Speaker 3>drink the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slowly he tilted that glass at him and </v>

901
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.190
<v Speaker 3>the guy behind him at the same colored </v>
<v Speaker 3>tie.</v>

902
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot in the head keeping eye contact </v>

903
00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.921
<v Speaker 3>while he was drinking the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of weird trying to at least be</v>

904
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 3>disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic.</v>

905
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.920
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole thing was so strange.</v>

906
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.490
<v Speaker 3>It was so what a better guy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

907
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.200
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to protect us from fake news and tell us</v>

908
00:39:11.201 --> 00:39:15.190
<v Speaker 3>what's real news and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who has integrity and what doesn't.</v>

909
00:39:15.191 --> 00:39:20.191
<v Speaker 3>Then a guy who made a couple of billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars off a stolen idea from his </v>

910
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:20.191
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

911
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the perfect guy to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

912
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.450
<v Speaker 3>The true story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what he actually did he,</v>

913
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.420
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what was in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

914
00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.830
<v Speaker 3>That was in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I know.</v>

915
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

916
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:29.130
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

917
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:34.260
<v Speaker 3>I know the story though was that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>ripped people off that it wasn't his </v>

918
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.050
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was the one who figured out a way</v>

919
00:39:35.051 --> 00:39:40.051
<v Speaker 3>to wrestle at a get rich as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is Matt Taibbi wrote an article</v>

<v Speaker 3>they shut down lots of other sites at </v>

927
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.940
<v Speaker 3>the behest of the government in Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

928
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.440
<v Speaker 3>and the Atlantic Council.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So pages like black elevation,</v>

929
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.830
<v Speaker 3>they got shut down a page called mindful</v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

930
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.980
<v Speaker 3>They got shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A facebook also wiped out,</v>

931
00:40:11.981 --> 00:40:15.850
<v Speaker 3>no unite the right to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a page appearing to advertise a</v>

932
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:20.851
<v Speaker 3>counter rally on the upcoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>anniversary of the violence in </v>

933
00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:20.851
<v Speaker 3>Charlottesville.</v>

934
00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.470
<v Speaker 3>So they shut that down to Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you beat it.</v>

935
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Let me just give you a quick quote from </v>
<v Speaker 3>his article.</v>

936
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.120
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook was helped in its efforts to </v>

937
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.881
<v Speaker 3>wipe out these dangerous memes by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Atlantic Council on whose board you'll </v>

938
00:40:32.881 --> 00:40:34.600
<v Speaker 3>find confidence inspiring names like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Henry Kissinger,</v>

939
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Cia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chief,</v>

940
00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Michael Hayden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>former acting cio,</v>

941
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.840
<v Speaker 3>had Michael Morel and former Bush era </v>
<v Speaker 3>homeland security chief Michael </v>

942
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Chertoff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people now have their hands on </v>

943
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:48.790
<v Speaker 3>what is essentially a direct lever over </v>
<v Speaker 3>nationwide news distribution.</v>

944
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.870
<v Speaker 3>It's hard though to state the potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>mischief that lurks behind this union of</v>

945
00:40:52.871 --> 00:40:57.871
<v Speaker 3>Internet platforms and would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>government censors at Kennedy's.</v>

946
00:40:57.881 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Read you one more paragraph because this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

947
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:01.300
<v Speaker 3>This is exactly what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

948
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:06.301
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is already a scandal that these </v>

949
00:41:06.301 --> 00:41:08.401
<v Speaker 3>defacto private media regulators have </v>
<v Speaker 3>secret algorithmic processes that pushed</v>

950
00:41:08.731 --> 00:41:11.500
<v Speaker 3>down some news organizations in favor of</v>
<v Speaker 3>others,</v>

951
00:41:11.501 --> 00:41:16.501
<v Speaker 3>which they do witness the complaints by </v>
<v Speaker 3>outlets like alternate truth dig and </v>

952
00:41:16.501 --> 00:41:20.881
<v Speaker 3>others that big platforms have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>deemphasizing alternative sites in the </v>

953
00:41:20.881 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 3>name of combating fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this week's revelation is worse when</v>

954
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:29.191
<v Speaker 3>facebook works with the government and </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to want to be star chamber </v>

955
00:41:29.191 --> 00:41:32.731
<v Speaker 3>organizations like the Atlantic Council </v>
<v Speaker 3>to delete sites on national security </v>

956
00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:36.841
<v Speaker 3>grounds using secret methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It opens the door to nightmare </v>

957
00:41:36.841 --> 00:41:38.720
<v Speaker 3>possibilities that you'd only find in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dystopian novels.</v>

958
00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.750
<v Speaker 3>So he goes out and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awesome what he says,</v>

959
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:42.760
<v Speaker 3>but I'm.</v>

960
00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.490
<v Speaker 2>We would have more comfort if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

961
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:50.550
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the things that they're </v>

962
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.550
<v Speaker 2>doing is they use that blanket term hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

963
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by the way,</v>

964
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:55.020
<v Speaker 3>so now they're trying to put a bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard about this in Congress to</v>

965
00:41:55.021 --> 00:42:00.021
<v Speaker 3>make police a protected class of people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you say shit about them now it's </v>

966
00:42:00.021 --> 00:42:00.870
<v Speaker 3>considered hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that?</v>

967
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to make peep.</v>

968
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.140
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fuck.</v>

969
00:42:04.141 --> 00:42:06.510
<v Speaker 3>The police would be considered hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>

970
00:42:06.511 --> 00:42:09.360
<v Speaker 3>So they would just retroactively arrest </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nwa.</v>

971
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:10.880
<v Speaker 3>They could not iced tea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

972
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Cop Killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right motherfucking cop killer.</v>

973
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.620
<v Speaker 3>And so now if you do have a rally that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the police,</v>

974
00:42:16.621 --> 00:42:21.621
<v Speaker 3>that's a hate rally and they can take </v>
<v Speaker 3>your youtube channel down if you said </v>

975
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:22.880
<v Speaker 3>hate stuff about the cops and such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

976
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.290
<v Speaker 3>So that that's where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hate speech.</v>

977
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.840
<v Speaker 3>The fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come I'm not allowed to hate shit by</v>

978
00:42:27.841 --> 00:42:29.340
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate Nazi's.</v>

979
00:42:29.341 --> 00:42:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Can I say I hate fucking Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate the KKK.</v>

980
00:42:32.311 --> 00:42:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Can I say I hate them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hate speech.</v>

981
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:36.780
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You strongly disliked the KKK.</v>

982
00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.440
<v Speaker 3>You can strongly disliked something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>

983
00:42:40.441 --> 00:42:45.441
<v Speaker 3>I hated the fucking dodgers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know speech because I was a cubs fan </v>

984
00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:47.430
<v Speaker 3>and the doctors always kicked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fish.</v>

985
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hate speech is a strange blanket term.</v>

986
00:42:49.531 --> 00:42:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Almost like drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

987
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:54.190
<v Speaker 2>drugs is caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also heroin.</v>

988
00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:55.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like drugs.</v>

989
00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:57.760
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what it is.</v>

990
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 3>There's hate out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>

991
00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:00.700
<v Speaker 3>So what's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by the way,</v>

992
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.940
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

993
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:04.670
<v Speaker 2>bad way of expressing things like hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech is,</v>

994
00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.360
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good descriptive because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree.</v>

995
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:09.630
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you stopped the,</v>

996
00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.330
<v Speaker 2>what does it entail?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

997
00:43:11.331 --> 00:43:16.331
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with a woman at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube about Sam Harris and I'm a </v>

998
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Douglas Murray and a podcast where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had had a conversation and someone put </v>

999
00:43:23.571 --> 00:43:26.360
<v Speaker 2>it on their youtube channel in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>playlist,</v>

1000
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.150
<v Speaker 2>just put it in their playlist and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a community guidelines.</v>

1001
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1002
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I asked why and the woman said very </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleanly it was hate speech.</v>

1003
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.010
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

1004
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you listen to it?</v>

1005
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:43.630
<v Speaker 2>It was a two intellectuals to public </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals discretion discussing </v>

1006
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:46.010
<v Speaker 2>immigration and some of the problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Europe is having right now.</v>

1007
00:43:46.011 --> 00:43:51.011
<v Speaker 2>And you decided that that's hate speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't even know what they said </v>

1008
00:43:51.011 --> 00:43:54.280
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that she's so confidently </v>

1009
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.561
<v Speaker 2>described it in that way sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of embodies what this problem </v>

1010
00:43:56.561 --> 00:43:58.610
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they have these blanket terms.</v>

1011
00:43:58.611 --> 00:44:03.611
<v Speaker 2>There were other throw on problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a million other fires to put </v>

1012
00:44:03.611 --> 00:44:07.061
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no more needed to put any </v>

1013
00:44:07.061 --> 00:44:07.061
<v Speaker 2>more consideration to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy is a problem.</v>

1014
00:44:07.061 --> 00:44:08.480
<v Speaker 2>This is problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is hate speech.</v>

1015
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Shut it down.</v>

1016
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:15.270
<v Speaker 3>People don't realize how bad it is for </v>
<v Speaker 3>all you do because you know this story.</v>

1017
00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.530
<v Speaker 3>But people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1018
00:44:16.531 --> 00:44:18.810
<v Speaker 3>good for Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He shouldn't be able to do that stuff.</v>

1019
00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:19.860
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing that good.</v>

1020
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you not understand that this is the </v>

1021
00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:26.550
<v Speaker 3>shot across the bow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if they can do this to Alex Jones,</v>

1022
00:44:26.551 --> 00:44:31.551
<v Speaker 3>that they're coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already been trashed by the </v>

1023
00:44:31.551 --> 00:44:31.551
<v Speaker 3>establishment media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the Washington Post,</v>

1024
00:44:31.551 --> 00:44:35.781
<v Speaker 3>by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already been equated to pedophiles </v>

1025
00:44:35.781 --> 00:44:38.541
<v Speaker 3>and those kinds of things and conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>theorists and I been in articles with </v>

1026
00:44:38.541 --> 00:44:38.541
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've done it to me.</v>

1027
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.830
<v Speaker 3>So because I tell the truth about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>

1028
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:42.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1029
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the antidote to bad speech,</v>

1030
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.210
<v Speaker 3>if you really hate what Alex Jones is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

1031
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.790
<v Speaker 3>the antidote to bad speech is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>censorship.</v>

1032
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 3>The antidote to bad speech is more </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>

1033
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.600
<v Speaker 3>If you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think what Alex Jones is doing </v>

1034
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.581
<v Speaker 3>needs to be debunked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>create a facebook page called debunking </v>

1035
00:45:01.581 --> 00:45:01.581
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones and debunk him.</v>

1036
00:45:01.581 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 3>The old Kyle Kalinsky does that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff all the time.</v>

1037
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:06.600
<v Speaker 3>People do that stuff all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you convert.</v>

1038
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:09.870
<v Speaker 3>If you're afraid of an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't shut down the idea,</v>

1039
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:15.080
<v Speaker 3>you expose the idea and you debunk it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you have a private platform and </v>

1040
00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.671
<v Speaker 3>you own this and you start a business </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your businesses putting up youtube </v>

1041
00:45:19.671 --> 00:45:23.901
<v Speaker 3>videos and you decide that someone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting up something that's hurtful and </v>

1042
00:45:23.901 --> 00:45:27.951
<v Speaker 3>damaging and racist and it could be used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to attack large groups of people and </v>

1043
00:45:27.951 --> 00:45:32.661
<v Speaker 3>then you see like all the craziness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been connected to the alt right </v>

1044
00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 3>movement and you associate that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this individual.</v>

1045
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.540
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to keep that on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>platform?</v>

1046
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no regulation right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1047
00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.790
<v Speaker 3>not like technic public utilities or it </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be though.</v>

1048
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:49.791
<v Speaker 3>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point is that 70 percent of the </v>

1049
00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:50.430
<v Speaker 3>people get their news from Google and </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook and they're a monopoly,</v>

1050
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:50.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1051
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:53.290
<v Speaker 3>So they had planned on ballistic powers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 present.</v>

1052
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1053
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:54.460
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1054
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:58.110
<v Speaker 3>that was a stat I read today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't.</v>

1055
00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1056
00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:00.600
<v Speaker 3>it's written that turn on and off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it.</v>

1057
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took.</v>

1058
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.680
<v Speaker 3>They took stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:04.170
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it's a stretch?</v>

1060
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.950
<v Speaker 3>It's says 45 percent of the people get </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight from facebook.</v>

1061
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.980
<v Speaker 3>That means $150.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Million people are on facebook every </v>

1062
00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:12.980
<v Speaker 3>single day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1063
00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.310
<v Speaker 3>I would think that's not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1064
00:46:14.311 --> 00:46:16.240
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when they get their news,</v>

1065
00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:17.820
<v Speaker 3>we don't have three people in this room </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't.</v>

1066
00:46:17.821 --> 00:46:19.650
<v Speaker 3>So that's three people right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're aren't.</v>

1067
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.330
<v Speaker 3>But I get my news from Google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1068
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.430
<v Speaker 3>I have that Google App on my phone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

1069
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:29.130
<v Speaker 3>every day I go to it in the morning when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking a shit and I go over like,</v>

1070
00:46:29.131 --> 00:46:30.960
<v Speaker 3>what's crazy today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's happening?</v>

1071
00:46:30.961 --> 00:46:32.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new porsche coming out.</v>

1072
00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.910
<v Speaker 3>One sentence like Sacha Baron Cohen do </v>
<v Speaker 3>one sentence.</v>

1073
00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just looked at it.</v>

1074
00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:39.300
<v Speaker 3>It's what it said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty five percent.</v>

1075
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.470
<v Speaker 3>I get it from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a facebook ad to.</v>

1076
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Is it a Gallup poll?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was according to their stats and I </v>

1077
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.510
<v Speaker 3>went back to read another rolling stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>article to find out.</v>

1078
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a bunch of like a facebook </v>

1079
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:52.890
<v Speaker 3>article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling advertisements,</v>

1080
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.440
<v Speaker 3>trying to find the data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even even,</v>

1081
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.610
<v Speaker 3>even if you clip it with those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't deny like Alex Jones cannot now</v>

1082
00:46:59.611 --> 00:46:59.970
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1083
00:46:59.971 --> 00:47:03.900
<v Speaker 3>just go to the other youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go to the other facebook.</v>

1084
00:47:03.901 --> 00:47:08.901
<v Speaker 3>There isn't another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have to recognize that the way we </v>

1085
00:47:08.901 --> 00:47:11.870
<v Speaker 3>are organized as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the town square is now owned by </v>

1086
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:12.600
<v Speaker 3>corporations who that need to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>regulated.</v>

1087
00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like before,</v>

1088
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:17.100
<v Speaker 3>if you know when 18 t was the phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>carrier for everybody,</v>

1089
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.500
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to give Alex Jones a phone</v>

1090
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:21.830
<v Speaker 3>service because I don't like the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's saying that.</v>

1091
00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.780
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1092
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.360
<v Speaker 3>you can't deny services,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

1093
00:47:24.361 --> 00:47:29.361
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not really a valid comparison </v>

1094
00:47:29.361 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 3>because the phone wasn't distributed</v>

1095
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 2>information to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The phone service is just a method of </v>

1096
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a utility.</v>

1097
00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:40.480
<v Speaker 2>What he's able to do through info wars </v>
<v Speaker 2>is if you've got them on your platform,</v>

1098
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:46.140
<v Speaker 2>he's going to say some things and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to use your platform to say some </v>

1099
00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:46.750
<v Speaker 2>things that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might not be true.</v>

1100
00:47:46.751 --> 00:47:51.751
<v Speaker 2>It might be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to decide like when does </v>

1101
00:47:51.751 --> 00:47:54.631
<v Speaker 2>it become a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think where they drew the line </v>

1102
00:47:54.631 --> 00:47:54.631
<v Speaker 2>with Sandy Hook.</v>

1103
00:47:54.631 --> 00:47:54.820
<v Speaker 3>So here's what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

1104
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:59.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to treat these as public </v>

1105
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920
<v Speaker 3>utilities because they are right </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook,</v>

1106
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:02.680
<v Speaker 3>there is no alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is an alternative to youtube.</v>

1107
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:03.990
<v Speaker 3>We need to deregulate them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1108
00:48:03.991 --> 00:48:07.480
<v Speaker 3>it's a long overdue by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they are monopolies.</v>

1109
00:48:07.481 --> 00:48:12.481
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's obvious to everyone that there </v>

1110
00:48:12.481 --> 00:48:12.481
<v Speaker 3>are monopolies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1111
00:48:12.481 --> 00:48:15.180
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you invent something called </v>

1112
00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:15.180
<v Speaker 3>whatsapp and then facebook buys it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>$20,</v>

1113
00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.180
<v Speaker 3>billion dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a monopoly,</v>

1114
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:17.930
<v Speaker 3>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to,</v>

1115
00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.620
<v Speaker 3>to compete with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are monopolies.</v>

1116
00:48:20.621 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 3>They need to be regulated and people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to be protected.</v>

1117
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:25.110
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1118
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:26.290
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how,</v>

1119
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.320
<v Speaker 3>that's where we need to go because right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we're leaving it up to the whims of </v>

1120
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:31.320
<v Speaker 3>a billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd say,</v>

1121
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Alex Jones really did some shit that </v>

1122
00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:37.531
<v Speaker 3>was wrong and he should be taken off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or his free speech should be a bridge </v>

1123
00:48:37.531 --> 00:48:37.531
<v Speaker 3>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

1124
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go go to a court or go to a thing or go.</v>

1125
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.470
<v Speaker 3>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1126
00:48:41.471 --> 00:48:44.500
<v Speaker 3>he docks his people and he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go is if doxing is illegal,</v>

1127
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:47.050
<v Speaker 3>he should be prosecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's what happened,</v>

1128
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.350
<v Speaker 3>but you shouldn't take away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he docs people?</v>

1129
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're saying he's died.</v>

1130
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.180
<v Speaker 3>He wanted he docs people from newtown or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever from the school shooting,</v>

1131
00:48:55.181 --> 00:49:00.181
<v Speaker 3>so that's what they're talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The individuals that he gave their </v>

1132
00:49:00.181 --> 00:49:00.520
<v Speaker 3>addresses and their names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they are saying,</v>

1133
00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:05.521
<v Speaker 3>that he decay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's find out if he actually did </v>

1134
00:49:05.521 --> 00:49:05.521
<v Speaker 3>that because that sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1135
00:49:05.521 --> 00:49:05.800
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1136
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:06.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he did,</v>

1137
00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.050
<v Speaker 2>but they're not saying what he actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1138
00:49:09.051 --> 00:49:13.850
<v Speaker 2>This is what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep hearing that he promoted the idea</v>

1139
00:49:13.851 --> 00:49:18.851
<v Speaker 2>that sandy hook was a false,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was false and that it was a false flag </v>

1140
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:24.620
<v Speaker 2>and that these were all actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he actually said that.</v>

1141
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I think what he actually said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that happened.</v>

1142
00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what he actually said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are saying,</v>

1143
00:49:31.851 --> 00:49:36.851
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's promoting the idea that it was a </v>

1144
00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:39.431
<v Speaker 2>hoax someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to know if that's what he </v>

1145
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:39.431
<v Speaker 2>really said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1146
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's even the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've heard it.</v>

1147
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it written that he promoted </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that sandy hook was a </v>

1148
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.300
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did not quoting.</v>

1149
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.180
<v Speaker 2>When they say that there's no quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no.</v>

1150
00:49:50.181 --> 00:49:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Sandy Hook was a hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those kids were actors.</v>

1151
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Those kids are not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that anywhere,</v>

1152
00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.910
<v Speaker 2>but they keep attributing that to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>without quotation.</v>

1153
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.090
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this.</v>

1154
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:04.840
<v Speaker 3>If there was some kind of process due </v>
<v Speaker 3>process where you could go back and look</v>

1155
00:50:04.841 --> 00:50:06.170
<v Speaker 3>at the transcript.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1156
00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:11.490
<v Speaker 2>not only that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If during this whole time where he's </v>

1157
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.440
<v Speaker 2>being tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was still labeled to be on youtube </v>

1158
00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.531
<v Speaker 2>and have his videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could show in his videos that he </v>

1159
00:50:16.531 --> 00:50:20.071
<v Speaker 2>didn't say that he could show what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually said and tell you what he </v>

1160
00:50:20.071 --> 00:50:22.420
<v Speaker 2>actually said and show clips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't do that anymore.</v>

1161
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:26.380
<v Speaker 2>So now the narrative is completely in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands of the mainstream media,</v>

1162
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.440
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Alex Jones narrative is being </v>

1163
00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.770
<v Speaker 2>taken 100 percent out of his hands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's in the mainstream media and now</v>

1164
00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.730
<v Speaker 2>there's sandy hook denier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theorists,</v>

1165
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.350
<v Speaker 2>right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lunatic,</v>

1166
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:40.730
<v Speaker 2>all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which mayor,</v>

1167
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:43.760
<v Speaker 2>if some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Alex my fucking nuts.</v>

1168
00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:48.210
<v Speaker 3>So my point is we've had nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would always tell that when I was</v>

1169
00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:48.780

<v Speaker 3>go ape shit about the national enquirer.</v>

00:56:20.711 --> 00:56:21.320
<v Speaker 2>it must be a hell of a house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is it?</v>

1270
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 2>And then there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The effects is a phenomenon.</v>

1271
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.110
<v Speaker 3>There's the house whereby an attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hide remover sensor,</v>

1272
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:33.120
<v Speaker 3>a piece of information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unintended consequences of publicizing </v>

1273
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.720
<v Speaker 3>the information more wildly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually facilitated by the Internet.</v>

1274
00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1275
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:39.410
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you,</v>

1276
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:47.560
<v Speaker 3>but on print,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1277
00:56:47.561 --> 00:56:49.450
<v Speaker 3>people may make the false equate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1278
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:50.860
<v Speaker 3>you're defending Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

1279
00:56:50.861 --> 00:56:55.861
<v Speaker 3>I'm not defending defending free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>defending free speech and I understand </v>

1280
00:56:55.861 --> 00:56:56.560
<v Speaker 3>the argument that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1281
00:56:56.561 --> 00:56:58.510
<v Speaker 3>it's a private corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

1282
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:03.570
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you took a look at the bigger </v>

1283
00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:03.570
<v Speaker 3>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the should beat.</v>

1284
00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:05.410
<v Speaker 3>Everyone thinks the internet should be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>public utility.</v>

1285
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:10.411
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people do and that's what they're </v>

1286
00:57:10.411 --> 00:57:10.411
<v Speaker 3>upset that they're not treating it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a public utility.</v>

1287
00:57:10.411 --> 00:57:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Obama administration did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They decided to at the last minute.</v>

1288
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:15.200
<v Speaker 3>And so if you think the Internet should </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a public utility,</v>

1289
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:20.430
<v Speaker 3>I think youtube and facebook should be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>public utility also and but there's the,</v>

1290
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:25.510
<v Speaker 3>there's an opening for other people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make their own youtube,</v>

1291
00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 3>like make a version of it if you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>them an efficient capital,</v>

1292
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.420
<v Speaker 3>but you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's some.</v>

1293
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.410
<v Speaker 3>And if you do start it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll just buy you out.</v>

1294
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:36.190
<v Speaker 3>Like I just showed you the example of </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsapp with nightwood,</v>

1295
00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:38.040
<v Speaker 3>$19,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>on whatever they paid for.</v>

1296
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.640
<v Speaker 3>It was some crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a,</v>

1297
00:57:39.641 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 3>just eat up their competition right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to Teddy Roosevelt to come along</v>

1298
00:57:42.791 --> 00:57:45.160
<v Speaker 3>and break up all these monopolies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never gonna happen.</v>

1299
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of the empire is coming.</v>

1300
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.570
<v Speaker 3>So here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1301
00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:54.160
<v Speaker 3>is there a valid parallel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a valid comparison?</v>

1302
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Like are there people that have things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are more hateful that are on </v>

1303
00:57:59.200 --> 00:57:59.890
<v Speaker 3>youtube that haven't been deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>platforms?</v>

1304
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Is it the influence that he has that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's terrifying?</v>

1305
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Is it the fact that he's a figurehead </v>
<v Speaker 3>for this kind of stuff?</v>

1306
00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is that he's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This whole info wars movement is in some</v>

1307
00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:18.730
<v Speaker 3>people's mind a figurehead for this pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump thing.</v>

1308
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.640
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to stop and silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it?</v>

1309
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:22.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1310
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.670
<v Speaker 3>It's very curious that it all happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time.</v>

1311
00:58:24.671 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because there's a,</v>

1312
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:27.800
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1313
00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:32.970
<v Speaker 3>in 1996 there was a law passed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually insulates the platforms for </v>

1314
00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:36.250
<v Speaker 3>being sued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that?</v>

1315
00:58:36.251 --> 00:58:39.300
<v Speaker 3>So like for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if someone puts up something like say</v>

1316
00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:41.410
<v Speaker 3>he puts something up that leads to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone getting killed,</v>

1317
00:58:41.411 --> 00:58:42.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>On facebook,</v>

1318
00:58:42.251 --> 00:58:44.160
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't sue youtube,</v>

1319
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:47.380
<v Speaker 3>you can't sue facebook for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's in that 1996 law.</v>

1320
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's that.</v>

1321
00:58:49.481 --> 00:58:51.520
<v Speaker 3>So I get that they're a private company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

1322
00:58:51.521 --> 00:58:53.770
<v Speaker 3>they have to have the protection of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>

1323
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:56.540
<v Speaker 3>They have congress protecting them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have a certain.</v>

1324
00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:59.940
<v Speaker 3>That's a certain type of regulation </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're regulated from.</v>

1325
00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 3>You can't sue them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1326
00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:05.890
<v Speaker 3>So I'm looking for this tweet bike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glenn Greenwald that really,</v>

1327
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:09.530
<v Speaker 3>because if we're going to take down </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1328
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I'll find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll find it.</v>

1329
00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says there's been a tactic of sensors</v>

1330
00:59:18.011 --> 00:59:23.011
<v Speaker 3>for centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start with someone who was so </v>

1331
00:59:23.011 --> 00:59:25.411
<v Speaker 3>utterly hated and marginalized that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone is blinded by their hatred for </v>

1332
00:59:25.411 --> 00:59:29.591
<v Speaker 3>the first central ship target that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheer and forget that they're endorsing </v>

1333
00:59:29.591 --> 00:59:32.390
<v Speaker 3>a principle and power that will then </v>
<v Speaker 3>expand.</v>

1334
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:35.830
<v Speaker 3>And so right now they came for the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1335
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Right now we're allowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1336
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.360
<v Speaker 3>the whim of billionaires in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the night to decide who gets to be on</v>

1337
00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:43.490
<v Speaker 3>these monopolistic platforms and who </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't.</v>

1338
00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 3>If there was 10 youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one would care,</v>

1339
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:48.200
<v Speaker 3>but there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one youtube,</v>

1340
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:53.230
<v Speaker 3>there's one facebook and they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>monopolies and that's the world we live </v>

1341
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:54.260
<v Speaker 3>in right now and that's why they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing whatever the government wants them</v>

1342
00:59:54.261 --> 00:59:56.480
<v Speaker 3>to because they don't want the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government to regulate them.</v>

1343
00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:01.720
<v Speaker 3>That's why he went there and was sipping</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water like that and trying to make </v>

1344
01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.960
<v Speaker 3>guide tat contact and be nice because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want them to regulate them.</v>

1345
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:08.080
<v Speaker 3>He'll do it for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do Julian assange and 2010 gave a </v>

1346
01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:08.870
<v Speaker 3>speech which I saw recently on a plane </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he predicted this.</v>

1347
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.270
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the corporations are an extension of the</v>

1348
01:00:11.271 --> 01:00:13.610
<v Speaker 3>government and they will do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>censorship in the future.</v>

1349
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:15.530
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

1350
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.050
<v Speaker 3>So do you think is the government that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensory Alex Jones,</v>

1351
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:23.080
<v Speaker 3>because I would think that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government that's in power currently </v>

1352
01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.301
<v Speaker 3>would want to keep Alex Jones and </v>
<v Speaker 3>position because he's a supporter of </v>

1353
01:00:25.301 --> 01:00:25.580
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a supporter of,</v>

1354
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:26.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does,</v>

1355
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:31.990
<v Speaker 3>so why does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is trump going after Julian assange </v>

1356
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:31.990
<v Speaker 3>just because he's afraid he'll expose </v>
<v Speaker 3>him someday.</v>

1357
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:34.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is he allowing the CIA to do that,</v>

1358
01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:39.550
<v Speaker 3>to go after Julian assange and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just shows you how shitty the </v>

1359
01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:42.431
<v Speaker 3>journalists are in America because not </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them are standing up for Julian </v>

1360
01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:45.691
<v Speaker 3>to signs and they're all pretending that</v>
<v Speaker 3>when trump says mean things about Jim </v>

1361
01:00:45.691 --> 01:00:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Acosta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that somehow that's this unbelievable </v>

1362
01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 3>violation of our freedom and our press </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's got you son of a bitch.</v>

1363
01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.010
<v Speaker 3>You don't care if you cared about </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of the press.</v>

1364
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.010
<v Speaker 3>You would say something about Julian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Assan and no one is saying,</v>

1365
01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:00.200
<v Speaker 3>what lie has Julian assange is ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>printed.</v>

1366
01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>

1367
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:03.050
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never.</v>

1368
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:08.260
<v Speaker 3>What did Julian assange's do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He revealed that our election was being </v>

1369
01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.160
<v Speaker 3>rigged by the Democratic Party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Russia,</v>

1370
01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.920
<v Speaker 3>but by the Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is a sin you can commit.</v>

1371
01:01:12.921 --> 01:01:14.720
<v Speaker 3>You can not tell the truth about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>

1372
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:16.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1373
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1374
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:22.690
<v Speaker 3>he revealed the CIA in has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although spying techniques that they can</v>

1375
01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:25.730
<v Speaker 3>get your tv to listen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your phone,</v>

1376
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:31.030
<v Speaker 3>a vault seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff he revealed that's why </v>

1377
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:31.030
<v Speaker 3>they want to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I trump,</v>

1378
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:32.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that trump is just,</v>

1379
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:35.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not really clued in,</v>

1380
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:37.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1381
01:01:37.131 --> 01:01:39.800
<v Speaker 3>lets other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's glad to let the generals do the job</v>

1382
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:41.820
<v Speaker 3>and his underlings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't really want.</v>

1383
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:45.080
<v Speaker 3>He wants to paint broad strokes and lets</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone you want to kill Julian.</v>

1384
01:01:45.081 --> 01:01:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>

1385
01:01:45.801 --> 01:01:48.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a f that's I think how he </v>
<v Speaker 3>feels.</v>

1386
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's his plan to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody else underneath it wants </v>

1387
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:53.140
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And certainly the intelligence community</v>

1388
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.090
<v Speaker 3>and everyone forgets this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chuck Schumer went on Rachel Maddow show</v>

1389
01:01:57.091 --> 01:02:02.091
<v Speaker 3>like two years ago and right out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>public said that trump is making a </v>

1390
01:02:02.091 --> 01:02:06.191
<v Speaker 3>mistake by crossing the intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>community because when you mess with </v>

1391
01:02:06.191 --> 01:02:09.251
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have six ways to Sunday to mess </v>

1392
01:02:09.251 --> 01:02:09.251
<v Speaker 3>with you back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1393
01:02:09.251 --> 01:02:13.571
<v Speaker 3>And nobody cared that he said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what he's saying is the president </v>

1394
01:02:13.571 --> 01:02:15.080
<v Speaker 3>should be afraid of unelected spooks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unelected bureaucrats,</v>

1395
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.100
<v Speaker 3>these don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should be,</v>

1396
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.810
<v Speaker 3>he should be afraid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>

1397
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:18.830
<v Speaker 3>And no one went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1398
01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.660
<v Speaker 3>what the apps could you imagine saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that about Barack Obama?</v>

1399
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barack Obama better be nice to the CA.</v>

1400
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:28.730
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna to eft with him as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>elected official to official saying that</v>

1401
01:02:29.191 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 3>almost almost sanctioning it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1402
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:36.230
<v Speaker 3>And then we have Eugene Robinson and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington Post or writing an articles </v>

1403
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:38.280
<v Speaker 3>begging the deep state to undermine </v>
<v Speaker 3>about trump's foreign policy.</v>

1404
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.270
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that article?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1405
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pulitzer Prize winner.</v>

1406
01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:45.210
<v Speaker 3>First they spend all their life denying </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a deep state.</v>

1407
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:50.270
<v Speaker 3>And that new gene Robinson writes an </v>
<v Speaker 3>article begging the deep state to defy </v>

1408
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:50.270
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1409
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:54.860
<v Speaker 3>president trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So blinded by ideology that they don't </v>

1410
01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:56.700
<v Speaker 3>see the consequences of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's unintended consequences.</v>

1411
01:02:56.701 --> 01:03:00.150
<v Speaker 3>And here they are and they're coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've already come for me.</v>

1412
01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:01.820
<v Speaker 3>They're already coming for the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>third.</v>

1413
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.750
<v Speaker 3>This is how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how this works.</v>

1414
01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:09.140
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I worn all my friends about </v>

1415
01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:09.660
<v Speaker 3>the Russia gate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nonsense Chomsky said,</v>

1416
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:12.750
<v Speaker 3>if you care about the people meddling in</v>
<v Speaker 3>our election,</v>

1417
01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Russia would be the last place I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>look.</v>

1418
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:17.310
<v Speaker 3>The first place to look is concentrated </v>
<v Speaker 3>capital.</v>

1419
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.400
<v Speaker 3>That's what dictates who are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>our government.</v>

1420
01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:25.550
<v Speaker 3>That's why we don't have the things the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of the world has because we have a </v>

1421
01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:26.610
<v Speaker 3>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Capital has captured our government,</v>

1422
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:28.710
<v Speaker 3>which is why we don't have medicare for </v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

1423
01:03:28.711 --> 01:03:33.711
<v Speaker 3>which is why we don't have free college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why we don't have an </v>

1424
01:03:33.711 --> 01:03:33.780
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why we're in a wars.</v>

1425
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have to countries poor or low </v>

1426
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:38.990
<v Speaker 3>income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty three percent of the country can't</v>

1427
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:43.251
<v Speaker 3>afford a thousand dollar emergency and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter of all kids are in poverty in </v>

1428
01:03:43.251 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 3>the richest country in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

1429
01:03:43.711 --> 01:03:48.711
<v Speaker 3>what do you call a system that takes the</v>
<v Speaker 3>richest country in the world that </v>

1430
01:03:48.711 --> 01:03:49.230
<v Speaker 3>renders half of its population poor or </v>
<v Speaker 3>low income?</v>

1431
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:54.350
<v Speaker 3>That's a failed fucking system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're living in right now </v>

1432
01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:54.420
<v Speaker 3>and it's failing worldwide.</v>

1433
01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were someone like Google though,</v>

1434
01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:03.090
<v Speaker 2>or who owns youtube or if you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>itunes or any of these platforms that </v>

1435
01:04:04.061 --> 01:04:09.061
<v Speaker 2>have spotify when you get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming volume of complaints about </v>

1436
01:04:09.701 --> 01:04:14.701
<v Speaker 2>someone who's in the news right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the fact that Alex Jones is </v>

1437
01:04:14.701 --> 01:04:18.961
<v Speaker 2>being sued by the Sandy Hook parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what started this all off </v>

1438
01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:23.340
<v Speaker 2>because to people this is so egregious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these poor parents lost their children </v>

1439
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:28.950
<v Speaker 2>and here's this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible saying that it's fake and </v>

1440
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:29.510
<v Speaker 2>that they don't want that on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>

1441
01:04:29.511 --> 01:04:33.700
<v Speaker 2>So would you think that they should just</v>
<v Speaker 2>delete the episode that has that?</v>

1442
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:37.840
<v Speaker 2>It says that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should they do that or should they allow</v>

1443
01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:38.710
<v Speaker 2>that episode?</v>

1444
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:40.020
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1445
01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:41.040
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1446
01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.990
<v Speaker 3>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the solution.</v>

1447
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.670
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's,</v>

1448
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 3>if he did do something in a video that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is illegal,</v>

1449
01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:50.700
<v Speaker 3>take that video down until it gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjudicated.</v>

1450
01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:55.260
<v Speaker 3>You don't see platform of 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't give him the death penalty.</v>

1451
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1452
01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.940
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about like stormfront,</v>

1453
01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:00.080
<v Speaker 2>what have you got?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some white supremacist group.</v>

1454
01:05:00.081 --> 01:05:01.990
<v Speaker 2>It's calling for violence against </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1455
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:03.760
<v Speaker 2>You Do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take them down.</v>

1456
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:05.300
<v Speaker 3>I think you would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1457
01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:10.301
<v Speaker 3>you would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see in some kind of </v>

1458
01:05:10.301 --> 01:05:10.301
<v Speaker 3>adjudication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1459
01:05:10.301 --> 01:05:10.301
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1460
01:05:10.301 --> 01:05:12.740
<v Speaker 3>the blanket policies and things saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like hate speech.</v>

1461
01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.590
<v Speaker 3>It's all interpretation in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a week ago,</v>

1462
01:05:15.591 --> 01:05:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Mark Zuckerberg was defending it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was defending that,</v>

1463
01:05:18.361 --> 01:05:20.320
<v Speaker 3>that we have holocaust deniers on our </v>
<v Speaker 3>platform,</v>

1464
01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 3>holocaust deniers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

1465
01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.470
<v Speaker 3>and that's not fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not going.</v>

1466
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:25.300
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to take that down like </v>
<v Speaker 3>I just told you.</v>

1467
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:27.340
<v Speaker 3>They have guys deprecating out of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>

1468
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:30.190
<v Speaker 3>They have this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have the,</v>

1469
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:30.940
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1470
01:05:30.941 --> 01:05:31.330
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1471
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:33.160
<v Speaker 3>the national enquirer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still cool.</v>

1472
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:35.320
<v Speaker 3>So this is a very squiggly line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

1473
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:35.860
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1474
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:38.140
<v Speaker 3>there's no board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no adjudication.</v>

1475
01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:39.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not transparent</v>

1476
01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:41.280
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not rational either.</v>

1477
01:05:41.281 --> 01:05:43.170
<v Speaker 2>This is not a rational debate.</v>

1478
01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:44.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just,</v>

1479
01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:49.810
<v Speaker 3>the sheer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just give you one more thing </v>

1480
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:50.390
<v Speaker 3>about what he says when this is Matt </v>
<v Speaker 3>Taibbi.</v>

1481
01:05:50.391 --> 01:05:55.391
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sheer market power of these </v>

1482
01:05:55.391 --> 01:05:55.391
<v Speaker 3>companies over information flow has </v>
<v Speaker 3>always been the real threat.</v>

1483
01:05:55.580 --> 01:06:00.580
<v Speaker 3>This is why breaking them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd have long ago become a national </v>

1484
01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.010
<v Speaker 3>priority instead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as was obvious during the Senate hearing</v>

1485
01:06:02.011 --> 01:06:06.710
<v Speaker 3>with Mark Zuckerberg earlier this year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians are more interested in using</v>

1486
01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.620
<v Speaker 3>then curtailing the power of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies.</v>

1487
01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:13.580
<v Speaker 3>The platform for their part will cave </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than be regulated.</v>

1488
01:06:13.790 --> 01:06:18.790
<v Speaker 3>The end game here couldn't be clearer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how authoritarians marriages </v>

1489
01:06:18.861 --> 01:06:21.710
<v Speaker 3>begin and people should be very worried.</v>

1490
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.790
<v Speaker 2>They should be worried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be worried,</v>

1491
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:29.850
<v Speaker 2>especially if this does escalate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that people who believed </v>

1492
01:06:31.231 --> 01:06:33.820
<v Speaker 2>that he's a sandy hook deniers and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>read those words,</v>

1493
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.240
<v Speaker 2>they don't want him to have a platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want them to be able to </v>

1494
01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.541
<v Speaker 2>spread that hate and they understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that they would feel like </v>

1495
01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:44.350
<v Speaker 2>imagine being one of those parents and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you lost your kid and you're,</v>

1496
01:06:44.351 --> 01:06:49.351
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing this guy on tv or on </v>

1497
01:06:49.351 --> 01:06:49.351
<v Speaker 2>youtube saying it's all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1498
01:06:49.351 --> 01:06:51.260
<v Speaker 2>it's outrageous and it's repulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1499
01:06:51.261 --> 01:06:55.540
<v Speaker 2>It's offensive and I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's,</v>

1500
01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:59.020
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very dangerous.</v>

1501
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:04.830
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous to silence people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that may or may not have any other </v>

1502
01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:11.941
<v Speaker 2>recourse in terms of like he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the ability to defend himself,</v>

1503
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:18.240
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have the ability to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>video about it unless he puts it on his </v>

1504
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.130
<v Speaker 2>own website and then who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch it like this,</v>

1505
01:07:19.131 --> 01:07:21.130
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that they're doing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>

1506
01:07:21.131 --> 01:07:24.130
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a slippery slope,</v>

1507
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially when they use these terms</v>

1508
01:07:26.921 --> 01:07:31.921
<v Speaker 2>like hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not like when you say like what </v>

1509
01:07:31.921 --> 01:07:31.921
<v Speaker 2>do they say?</v>

1510
01:07:31.921 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 2>And they say that he violated their </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms,</v>

1511
01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.970
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1512
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:39.150
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are those terms that he violated </v>

1513
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:41.281
<v Speaker 2>and what is the specific violation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are the words that he said </v>

1514
01:07:41.281 --> 01:07:41.920
<v Speaker 2>where you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough is enough.</v>

1515
01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.560
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you let him get away with saying</v>

1516
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.620
<v Speaker 2>all this other shit for years and years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>

1517
01:07:46.621 --> 01:07:48.250
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when do you draw this line?</v>

1518
01:07:48.251 --> 01:07:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Like just that video that we played,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1519
01:07:50.531 --> 01:07:52.060
<v Speaker 2>they smell like sulfur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat it,</v>

1520
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:54.560
<v Speaker 2>they want to eat babies screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Satan.</v>

1521
01:07:54.561 --> 01:07:56.890
<v Speaker 2>And the one of the babies like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1522
01:07:57.090 --> 01:07:59.590
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does the line get drawn?</v>

1523
01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1524
01:08:00.651 --> 01:08:05.651
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that should be up to </v>

1525
01:08:05.651 --> 01:08:08.110
<v Speaker 2>subjectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that should be a very,</v>

1526
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.730
<v Speaker 2>very hard question that's answered with </v>
<v Speaker 2>very clear facts.</v>

1527
01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:13.020
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

1528
01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 3>should have an adversarial judicial with</v>

1529
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:21.190
<v Speaker 1>an impartial judge or jury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how would you even get someone </v>

1530
01:08:21.190 --> 01:08:22.540
<v Speaker 1>impartial instead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have inhouse decide decisions.</v>

1531
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard that.</v>

1532
01:08:23.791 --> 01:08:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean you heard Matt Taibbi does </v>
<v Speaker 1>delineate the people who are involved in</v>

1533
01:08:26.661 --> 01:08:31.661
<v Speaker 1>this stuff and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook's taken down pages of people </v>

1534
01:08:31.661 --> 01:08:33.210
<v Speaker 1>who are Palestinians because the Israeli</v>
<v Speaker 1>government tells them to do it.</v>

1535
01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1536
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I had heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1537
01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:39.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's them doing the bidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government says take a down,</v>

1538
01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>take it you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get to free speech.</v>

1539
01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:46.691
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't want the government to </v>

1540
01:08:46.691 --> 01:08:46.691
<v Speaker 1>get mad at me because we're making so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much goddamn money right now.</v>

1541
01:08:46.691 --> 01:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't want the government to get mad </v>
<v Speaker 1>at us.</v>

1542
01:08:47.721 --> 01:08:49.250
<v Speaker 1>That's what facebook and youtube is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1543
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>See if I would like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone,</v>

1544
01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that no one should be </v>

1545
01:08:58.290 --> 01:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>taken down.</v>

1546
01:08:58.290 --> 01:08:59.030
<v Speaker 1>If someone's calling for the death of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all black people and like maybe it's not</v>

1547
01:08:59.031 --> 01:09:04.031
<v Speaker 1>a good place to give them a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like the problem that I'm </v>

1548
01:09:04.221 --> 01:09:07.430
<v Speaker 1>having with this is these things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>air quotes,</v>

1549
01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.880
<v Speaker 1>hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I told you that they said that </v>

1550
01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.030
<v Speaker 1>about Sam Harrison Douglas Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that is fucking crazy.</v>

1551
01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.940
<v Speaker 1>So when is it stopping hate speech?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when?</v>

1552
01:09:16.941 --> 01:09:20.300
<v Speaker 1>When do you draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it's mildly offensive,</v>

1553
01:09:20.301 --> 01:09:22.220
<v Speaker 1>is that hate speech?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where's it go?</v>

1554
01:09:22.221 --> 01:09:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Where does it go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where we're not allowed to hate people.</v>

1555
01:09:24.921 --> 01:09:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why I don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being a dick.</v>

1556
01:09:28.690 --> 01:09:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you allowed to hate things?</v>

1557
01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1558
01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I understand that calling for action I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is the call for action might be.</v>

1559
01:09:37.701 --> 01:09:42.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's a legal term that this is </v>

1560
01:09:42.701 --> 01:09:42.701
<v Speaker 1>not a legal term though.</v>

1561
01:09:42.701 --> 01:09:44.360
<v Speaker 1>The when they blanket things with hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

1562
01:09:44.361 --> 01:09:46.760
<v Speaker 1>like we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was calling something a drug,</v>

1563
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:48.390
<v Speaker 1>this is an illegal drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1564
01:09:48.391 --> 01:09:50.960
<v Speaker 1>what if caffeine becomes an illegal drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>

1565
01:09:50.961 --> 01:09:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Is that the same as meth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's clearly not.</v>

1566
01:09:53.871 --> 01:09:57.020
<v Speaker 1>There's different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say hate speech and you also</v>

1567
01:09:57.021 --> 01:10:02.021
<v Speaker 1>lumped Douglas Murray having an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual conversation with Sam </v>

1568
01:10:02.021 --> 01:10:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Harris about immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lump that in.</v>

1569
01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:08.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's the kind of soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so did you know that right before </v>

1570
01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.010
<v Speaker 1>fourth of July there was a newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Texas.</v>

1571
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:12.530
<v Speaker 1>And so they wanted to for the fourth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>July,</v>

1572
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.050
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to post the declaration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

1573
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:17.900
<v Speaker 1>So they posted the first half of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know about this?</v>

1574
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Facebook gave him a strike for hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

1575
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:25.990
<v Speaker 1>hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave him a strike and so now </v>

1576
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:25.990
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1577
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:25.990
<v Speaker 1>that was an algorithm though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1578
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:30.670
<v Speaker 1>They picked up some of the phrase or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrasing in there about slavery and </v>

1579
01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:31.670
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then being animals or something like</v>

1580
01:10:31.671 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1581
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:33.800
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what it was.</v>

1582
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:36.110
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the newspaper said,</v>

1583
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:41.170
<v Speaker 1>now we're afraid to post the second half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the declaration because we'll get a </v>

1584
01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 1>second strike and they might pull our </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole page.</v>

1585
01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

1586
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:46.910
<v Speaker 1>when they released that strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1587
01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:48.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

1588
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.600
<v Speaker 1>So what is this book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pill?</v>

1589
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:53.660
<v Speaker 1>What is this idea that I need a nanny </v>
<v Speaker 1>state to protect me from the ideas?</v>

1590
01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I think they're worried about the power </v>
<v Speaker 1>of propaganda and it's just they don't </v>

1591
01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:02.561
<v Speaker 1>know exactly what the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressing that power of propaganda </v>

1592
01:11:02.561 --> 01:11:03.590
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really the primary issue.</v>

1593
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:07.040
<v Speaker 1>They're worried that a guy like Alex </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones already has this massive following</v>

1594
01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.450
<v Speaker 1>his what he's done by calling sandy hook</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake may,</v>

1595
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>may be awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe is,</v>

1596
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1597
01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.060
<v Speaker 2>is it enough to completely diy platform </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and how?</v>

1598
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:19.250
<v Speaker 2>How are they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are they?</v>

1599
01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:21.180
<v Speaker 3>Even if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say it was,</v>

1600
01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:24.130
<v Speaker 3>let's just say you and I agree that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is okay.</v>

1601
01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't there still be some kind of a </v>

1602
01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 3>process?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There should be.</v>

1603
01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:31.740
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be.</v>

1604
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Even if we agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

1605
01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.520
<v Speaker 3>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate it as much as you hate it,</v>

1606
01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:37.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you and that people are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1607
01:11:37.051 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 3>I know Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last time I was on your show,</v>

1608
01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said people are going to take what I'm</v>

1609
01:11:40.981 --> 01:11:44.040
<v Speaker 3>saying right now and twisted and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what they did to me last night.</v>

1610
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.590
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sure people did who took it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>twisted it.</v>

1611
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:49.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to name names,</v>

1612
01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:52.080
<v Speaker 3>but what did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say they twisted what we were.</v>

1613
01:11:52.081 --> 01:11:54.510
<v Speaker 3>So when we're talking about seth rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they twisted and I said,</v>

1614
01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:55.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did,</v>

1615
01:11:55.021 --> 01:11:57.090
<v Speaker 3>was covered on my show until this day.</v>

1616
01:11:57.090 --> 01:11:59.280
<v Speaker 3>People still say I was pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a new show.</v>

1617
01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:04.281
<v Speaker 3>I covered it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even discussing it and even you </v>

1618
01:12:04.281 --> 01:12:04.281
<v Speaker 3>can't even discuss like I couldn't cover</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1619
01:12:04.281 --> 01:12:06.390
<v Speaker 3>couldn't discuss it and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's exactly what happened.</v>

1620
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:09.480
<v Speaker 3>Somebody cut me saying that and cut some</v>
<v Speaker 3>other stuff and put it together.</v>

1621
01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.980
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son of a bitch.</v>

1622
01:12:10.981 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what are you going to do?</v>

1623
01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:12.810
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are you gonna do?</v>

1624
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.550
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1625
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:17.100
<v Speaker 3>so I just want people to know this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1626
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:22.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm just as offended as everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying we need to have these things </v>

1627
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:23.250
<v Speaker 3>be public utilities for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>

1628
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:24.710
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1629
01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:29.900
<v Speaker 3>you know exactly what Matt Tie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be said what the end game here is </v>

1630
01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:30.720
<v Speaker 3>very clear and they want to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>censor people.</v>

1631
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:33.870
<v Speaker 3>They want to be able to censor and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first people are going to come after his</v>

1632
01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:34.950
<v Speaker 3>left wing organizations.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They're could come after black lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

1634
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:38.000
<v Speaker 3>They're connected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>already come after left.</v>

1635
01:12:38.001 --> 01:12:39.740
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did they think they're going to come</v>

1636
01:12:39.741 --> 01:12:42.100
<v Speaker 3>after to black lives matter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean there?</v>

1637
01:12:42.101 --> 01:12:44.180
<v Speaker 3>I their hate speech against the police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kidding me.</v>

1638
01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:46.290
<v Speaker 3>They already said they're controlled by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Russians.</v>

1639
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Who is they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is they saying that and who's they </v>

1640
01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:51.380
<v Speaker 3>gonna come after them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by that?</v>

1641
01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1642
01:12:51.841 --> 01:12:53.510
<v Speaker 3>the FBI will infiltrate them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

1643
01:12:53.511 --> 01:12:54.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they already have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1644
01:12:54.601 --> 01:12:56.500
<v Speaker 3>how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1645
01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:58.590
<v Speaker 3>how all that stuff works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how that stuff works.</v>

1646
01:12:58.591 --> 01:13:03.591
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then just credit them and then they </v>

1647
01:13:03.591 --> 01:13:03.591
<v Speaker 3>will commit violence in their name and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1648
01:13:03.591 --> 01:13:04.740
<v Speaker 3>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black lives matters are violent.</v>

1649
01:13:04.741 --> 01:13:05.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a cop doing it,</v>

1650
01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:06.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't help that.</v>

1651
01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:08.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened up in Dapple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1652
01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:09.690
<v Speaker 3>that's the kind of stuff they do up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1653
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:12.390
<v Speaker 3>And then provocateur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1654
01:13:12.391 --> 01:13:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by the way,</v>

1655
01:13:13.381 --> 01:13:17.490
<v Speaker 3>I learned about that from Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the problem with Alex Jones.</v>

1656
01:13:17.491 --> 01:13:19.080
<v Speaker 3>He's right about stuff sometimes.</v>

1657
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was way more right about stuff in the</v>

1658
01:13:21.401 --> 01:13:26.401
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex himself and I've talked to him </v>

1659
01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:27.460
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>says he drinks too much and he's getting</v>

1660
01:13:27.461 --> 01:13:32.461
<v Speaker 2>too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs to go on a diet and exercise </v>

1661
01:13:32.461 --> 01:13:33.930
<v Speaker 2>and start getting his life in order and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he takes things too far sometimes and he</v>

1662
01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:37.210
<v Speaker 2>should take those off the rails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes off the rails like he.</v>

1663
01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:42.240
<v Speaker 2>He and I had a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he got mad at me for saying that I </v>

1664
01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.110
<v Speaker 2>didn't think George Soros was a Nazi and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he had this whole thing.</v>

1665
01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:49.120
<v Speaker 2>We ranted ray and then we talked back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth and he apologized and he said,</v>

1666
01:13:49.361 --> 01:13:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes have to far what I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1667
01:13:53.051 --> 01:13:58.051
<v Speaker 2>Aliens will say that unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he recognizes that sometimes</v>

1668
01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:02.320
<v Speaker 2>he's just caught up in that cycle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>outrage,</v>

1669
01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:04.510
<v Speaker 2>that cycle of outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

1670
01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.200
<v Speaker 2>there's no room for error.</v>

1671
01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:12.560
<v Speaker 2>There's no room to step back and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reset is.</v>

1672
01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.330
<v Speaker 2>It's this constant outrage constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>under attack.</v>

1673
01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:21.480
<v Speaker 2>And then there's these words that get </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown around that sort of lose their </v>

1674
01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.060
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like globalists and shills and,</v>

1675
01:14:24.061 --> 01:14:25.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1676
01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:28.630
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of attitude that there's this,</v>

1677
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:34.110
<v Speaker 2>there's this cabal of evil that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to take,</v>

1678
01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:38.380
<v Speaker 2>take over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at one point Alex had this idea that</v>

1679
01:14:38.381 --> 01:14:42.820
<v Speaker 2>they were going to try to kill off most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and you remember that.</v>

1680
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:48.270
<v Speaker 2>I heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this idea that they wanted to a </v>

1681
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:49.510
<v Speaker 2>youth and I orj was genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to,</v>

1682
01:14:49.810 --> 01:14:54.810
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to break it down to what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the word where they talk about doing </v>

1683
01:14:54.810 --> 01:14:55.900
<v Speaker 2>that to talk about reducing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

1684
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:58.570
<v Speaker 2>There's like some sort of a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theorist,</v>

1685
01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.600
<v Speaker 2>term of reduction of population to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable number of super evil </v>

1686
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.420
<v Speaker 2>geniuses that could live forever.</v>

1687
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.490
<v Speaker 2>And they wanted to get it down to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1688
01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:11.670
<v Speaker 2>500 million people worldwide that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>live for a million years or some crazy </v>

1689
01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:15.610
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that that's that whole cycle</v>

1690
01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:20.880
<v Speaker 2>of like constant outrage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's a conspiracy and you get </v>

1691
01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.550
<v Speaker 2>whacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whacked out and caught up in it.</v>

1692
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:29.700
<v Speaker 2>If you go back to Alex's earlier videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met Alex in 98 I believe,</v>

1693
01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:36.300
<v Speaker 2>and back then Alex was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was going after George w dot Bush </v>

1694
01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:40.650
<v Speaker 2>when George W dot Bush was running for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president and he was saying that this </v>

1695
01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:41.590
<v Speaker 2>guy is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

1696
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.400
<v Speaker 2>he's a puppet and that he's a puppet of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the CIA and you know,</v>

1697
01:15:45.401 --> 01:15:46.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

1698
01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:51.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he supports genocide and he was showing </v>

1699
01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:51.550
<v Speaker 2>up at campaign rallies and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>arresting him.</v>

1700
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:54.700
<v Speaker 2>He was anti right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was,</v>

1701
01:15:54.701 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 2>he was anti what he thought was this </v>
<v Speaker 2>globalist agenda.</v>

1702
01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:03.150
<v Speaker 2>He also infiltrated Bohemian Grove when </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody thought the Bohemian Grove is </v>

1703
01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:03.700
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing really going on.</v>

1704
01:16:03.701 --> 01:16:04.270
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1705
01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:08.140
<v Speaker 2>these really rich people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>together with heads of state and foreign</v>

1706
01:16:08.141 --> 01:16:11.230
<v Speaker 2>dignitaries and they're dressing up like</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking druids.</v>

1707
01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:15.430
<v Speaker 2>And they have an effigy that they burned</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of the owl God Molek and people</v>

1708
01:16:15.431 --> 01:16:16.210

<v Speaker 2>he's crazy.</v>

1709
01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Then he releases the video and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1710
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:22.480

1713
01:16:29.831 --> 01:16:34.831
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He releases this video that shows that </v>

1714
01:16:34.831 --> 01:16:37.830
<v Speaker 2>the World Trade Organization protests </v>
<v Speaker 2>were infiltrated by these agent </v>

1715
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:40.990
<v Speaker 2>provocateurs who are most likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>government agents with government agent.</v>

1716
01:16:40.991 --> 01:16:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Boots on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1717
01:16:42.011 --> 01:16:44.890

<v Speaker 2>They smash windows.</v>

1718
01:16:44.891 --> 01:16:47.170
<v Speaker 2>They're all wearing masks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had light things on fire.</v>

1719
01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Then they're all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all hold up in one house.</v>

1720
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:53.260

<v Speaker 2>eventually released.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is all done under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he proved all this.</v>

1722
01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:59.140
<v Speaker 2>He showed all how this is going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at these peaceful protesters.</v>

1723
01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Then the consequences of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they established a no protest line at </v>

1724
01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:09.181
<v Speaker 2>the WTO where you couldn't go by with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pin on have you tried to get through </v>

1725
01:17:09.181 --> 01:17:12.170
<v Speaker 2>with a that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w t o with a red line through it.</v>

1726
01:17:12.171 --> 01:17:14.540
<v Speaker 2>They told you you could not wear that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pin.</v>

1727
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:17.750
<v Speaker 2>You can't come through here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a node protest zone,</v>

1728
01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.270
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the consequences of this kind of</v>

1729
01:17:20.271 --> 01:17:22.970
<v Speaker 2>censorship and this is how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>establish the censorship.</v>

1730
01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:28.180
<v Speaker 2>They make it seem like your organization</v>
<v Speaker 2>is violent and dangerous by introducing </v>

1731
01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:29.200
<v Speaker 2>violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous elements in the,</v>

1732
01:17:29.201 --> 01:17:33.320
<v Speaker 2>in the form of an undercover police </v>
<v Speaker 2>officers or military.</v>

1733
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:38.440
<v Speaker 2>They smash windows tip over newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 2>stands and it was fucking create chaos </v>

1734
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:42.410
<v Speaker 2>so that the government has to come in </v>
<v Speaker 2>because now we have a violent situation,</v>

1735
01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:47.560
<v Speaker 2>so then the military comes in and arrest</v>
<v Speaker 2>protestors and silences the protests so </v>

1736
01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:52.361
<v Speaker 2>they don't look embarrassing in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people from foreign countries </v>

1737
01:17:52.361 --> 01:17:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that are coming here to the World Trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>Organization.</v>

1738
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:55.880
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know he showed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dude,</v>

1739
01:17:55.881 --> 01:17:58.370
<v Speaker 2>he look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not wrong always,</v>

1740
01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:02.090
<v Speaker 2>and he was more right back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was also more sane back then.</v>

1741
01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:04.880
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was more measured and more calm.</v>

1742
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:10.030
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have the big moon face back </v>

1743
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.030
<v Speaker 2>then either and he wasn't drinking as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

1744
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think in the screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>spitting and and you know,</v>

1745
01:18:12.471 --> 01:18:13.430
<v Speaker 2>you ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll say,</v>

1746
01:18:13.431 --> 01:18:15.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just overwhelmed by the sheer volume</v>

1747
01:18:15.981 --> 01:18:18.690
<v Speaker 2>of corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the shit that he sees every day.</v>

1748
01:18:19.930 --> 01:18:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember he was crying when trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>bombed Syria?</v>

1749
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:27.020
<v Speaker 2>He was crying because he was crying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump fucked us.</v>

1750
01:18:27.210 --> 01:18:28.670
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1751
01:18:28.671 --> 01:18:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I really genuinely believe most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time that he means.</v>

1752
01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1753
01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1754
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:37.940
<v Speaker 2>the thing is we look for conspiracies </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>

1755
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000
<v Speaker 2>like everything that's experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're off track and I don't think </v>

1756
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:43.460
<v Speaker 2>there's anyone there that can sit down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

1757
01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:44.810
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

1758
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Let's examine this in a factual way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's stop.</v>

1759
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Cut The hyperbole out and let's look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the facts are and where are we </v>

1760
01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:54.710
<v Speaker 2>getting these facts and why do we think </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is happening?</v>

1761
01:18:54.711 --> 01:18:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think this is fake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that sounds fucking crazy to me.</v>

1762
01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:00.740
<v Speaker 2>No one's there to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone was there to do that,</v>

1763
01:19:00.741 --> 01:19:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I think he probably would be stopped and</v>
<v Speaker 2>would examine things.</v>

1764
01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.640
<v Speaker 2>It would balance out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1765
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:11.650
<v Speaker 2>like one of the reasons why I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have him on my podcast when I did was </v>

1766
01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:12.290
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted people to see the Alex </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I know because people like,</v>

1767
01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:13.820
<v Speaker 2>how could you know that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1768
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.110
<v Speaker 2>look at how he is when I get them high </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we get drunk and he's laughing about</v>

1769
01:19:18.111 --> 01:19:21.500
<v Speaker 2>stuff and talking about interdimensional</v>
<v Speaker 2>child molesters and all that.</v>

1770
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.260
<v Speaker 2>This is what I wanted everybody to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is Alex Jones.</v>

1771
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:27.050
<v Speaker 2>He's a fun guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that,</v>

1772
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:32.290
<v Speaker 2>that is not a good position to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're constantly looking for </v>

1773
01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:35.240
<v Speaker 2>conspiracies everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might nail a few,</v>

1774
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.940
<v Speaker 2>but then you might call out a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that are fake,</v>

1775
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:42.970
<v Speaker 2>which not just negates the ones that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>nailed but negates everything you say as</v>

1776
01:19:43.401 --> 01:19:48.401
<v Speaker 2>soon as you're one of those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's a conspiracy and then dead </v>

1777
01:19:48.401 --> 01:19:49.610
<v Speaker 2>kids aren't really dead and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>an actor.</v>

1778
01:19:49.611 --> 01:19:51.710
<v Speaker 2>And like everything that you say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good,</v>

1779
01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:52.670
<v Speaker 2>they're going to stop.</v>

1780
01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:58.710
<v Speaker 3>My uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is that I focus on the ones that </v>

1781
01:19:59.771 --> 01:20:00.880
<v Speaker 3>are important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1782
01:20:00.881 --> 01:20:01.960
<v Speaker 3>That I think is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1783
01:20:01.961 --> 01:20:06.961
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I care about wars and the lies that are </v>

1784
01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:12.530
<v Speaker 3>told about wars from the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which the media pushes every war in my </v>

1785
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:14.120
<v Speaker 3>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the ones I care about.</v>

1786
01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:15.840
<v Speaker 3>I hear everything you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1787
01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:16.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1788
01:20:16.810 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to say God,</v>

1789
01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.430
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really know much about Alex </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones until the,</v>

1790
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1791
01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:25.860
<v Speaker 3>very famously at that incident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really,</v>

1792
01:20:25.861 --> 01:20:27.720
<v Speaker 3>I never really watched them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went home that night.</v>

1793
01:20:27.721 --> 01:20:32.721
<v Speaker 3>I watched some of his videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is when I found out some of them </v>

1794
01:20:32.721 --> 01:20:32.721
<v Speaker 3>are really funny and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1795
01:20:32.721 --> 01:20:37.430
<v Speaker 3>honest to God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really know much about him and </v>

1796
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.430
<v Speaker 3>so I don't even know this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1797
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:41.890
<v Speaker 2>if you could find that Jamie CV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they pull all that stuff from </v>

1798
01:20:41.890 --> 01:20:44.711
<v Speaker 2>youtube?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything but doesn't so else have it </v>

1799
01:20:44.711 --> 01:20:44.720
<v Speaker 2>probably on their channel.</v>

1800
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:49.790
<v Speaker 3>And I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never did videos about him or </v>

1801
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.790
<v Speaker 3>debunked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>

1802
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

1803
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:54.720
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't in my sight line of sight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was busy making fun of MSNBC and CNN.</v>

1804
01:20:55.081 --> 01:20:55.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what I like to do.</v>

1805
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1806
01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:02.200
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all very confusing to me and all.</v>

1807
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he should say those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1808
01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:08.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he should say lies about </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids not being dead.</v>

1809
01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:09.880
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1810
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.810
<v Speaker 2>the horrors of being a parent and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid was shot.</v>

1811
01:21:12.811 --> 01:21:16.650
<v Speaker 2>And school shooting and then some guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that there are 100 percent actors</v>

1812
01:21:16.651 --> 01:21:18.950
<v Speaker 2>and fake and lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's horrible stuff.</v>

1813
01:21:18.951 --> 01:21:23.951
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy who was one of the parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a conspiracy theorist until </v>

1814
01:21:23.951 --> 01:21:23.951
<v Speaker 2>this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1815
01:21:23.951 --> 01:21:25.920
<v Speaker 2>he was a conspiracy theorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believed all that stuff.</v>

1816
01:21:25.921 --> 01:21:30.921
<v Speaker 2>And then his son was killed and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they started calling him a fraud and </v>

1817
01:21:30.921 --> 01:21:34.101
<v Speaker 2>saying he was an actor and saying it </v>
<v Speaker 2>never happened and that he's a paid </v>

1818
01:21:34.101 --> 01:21:35.920
<v Speaker 2>shill and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a big article about this,</v>

1819
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:41.030
<v Speaker 2>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you see this guy talk and it's </v>

1820
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.030
<v Speaker 2>heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1821
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:42.510
<v Speaker 2>you read his words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's heartbreaking.</v>

1822
01:21:42.511 --> 01:21:46.950
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine your son was murdered in</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest school maskers ever,</v>

1823
01:21:46.951 --> 01:21:48.060
<v Speaker 2>if not the biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1824
01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:53.540
<v Speaker 2>And here's people running around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emailing you and sending you tweets and </v>

1825
01:21:54.091 --> 01:21:56.970
<v Speaker 2>facebook messages that you're a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>

1826
01:21:56.971 --> 01:22:01.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you work for the globalists and this is </v>

1827
01:22:01.971 --> 01:22:02.280
<v Speaker 2>all just a plot to take our guns away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like holy.</v>

1828
01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:08.090
<v Speaker 3>These things are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the people who think the old </v>

1829
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:10.290
<v Speaker 3>school shootings that they're all set up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to so they can take our guns away.</v>

1830
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:15.390
<v Speaker 2>They think that about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought that about the country </v>

1831
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:16.270
<v Speaker 2>music festival shooting in Vegas because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they felt like,</v>

1832
01:22:16.271 --> 01:22:21.271
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a way to get those people on our </v>

1833
01:22:21.271 --> 01:22:21.271
<v Speaker 2>side because those are all the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment people,</v>

1834
01:22:21.271 --> 01:22:26.040
<v Speaker 2>the country music people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What better people to get to turn </v>

1835
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.180
<v Speaker 2>against the second amendment that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people that are.</v>

1836
01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:32.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guarantee you if you had like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>red light that went off every time,</v>

1837
01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.580
<v Speaker 2>like on the top of someone's head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there were a national rifles agency,</v>

1838
01:22:36.581 --> 01:22:39.340
<v Speaker 2>if they were an NRA member in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

1839
01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.370
<v Speaker 2>I bet there'll be a lot of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>lights a,</v>

1840
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.300
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of those people are nra </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1841
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Lot of people who are gun owners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I better just gun owners.</v>

1842
01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.040
<v Speaker 2>How many people are gun owners?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bit fucking half.</v>

1843
01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:53.100
<v Speaker 2>At least half the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably one of the strongest </v>

1844
01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:53.100
<v Speaker 2>demographics.</v>

1845
01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:53.410
<v Speaker 2>You could find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Country Music,</v>

1846
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:54.940
<v Speaker 2>gun owners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>

1847
01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:57.550
<v Speaker 2>that's a giant connection and so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought was,</v>

1848
01:22:57.551 --> 01:22:58.480
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this guy,</v>

1849
01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:03.700
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make this Manchurian candidate and </v>

1850
01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:04.150
<v Speaker 2>make them gun down all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people think you didn't even do it.</v>

1851
01:23:04.151 --> 01:23:09.151
<v Speaker 2>They think they shot in the room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the agents did it and they killed </v>

1852
01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:10.270
<v Speaker 2>all these people and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullets coming out.</v>

1853
01:23:10.271 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 2>All these different windows and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different areas and like,</v>

1854
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:14.240
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

1855
01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exhausting.</v>

1856
01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.450
<v Speaker 2>It's exhausting and it's also horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1857
01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole thing's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that they think that the </v>

1858
01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.991
<v Speaker 2>government would create a false flag </v>
<v Speaker 2>that by the way didn't do anything </v>

1859
01:23:27.991 --> 01:23:31.381
<v Speaker 2>second amendment still in place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that they would create a false flag </v>

1860
01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:35.340
<v Speaker 2>and they would be willing to gun down </v>
<v Speaker 2>what did that he killed like 50 plus </v>

1861
01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:38.850
<v Speaker 2>people and shot like 500 something </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking insane like that,</v>

1862
01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:40.060
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the,</v>

1863
01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:42.040
<v Speaker 2>that that's they would get together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1864
01:23:42.041 --> 01:23:47.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gotta do we gotta get this guy and </v>

1865
01:23:47.041 --> 01:23:50.280
<v Speaker 2>get them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them to shoot all these people and </v>

1866
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:50.280
<v Speaker 2>that's how we're going to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns is totally ineffective.</v>

1867
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:50.950
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't done anything.</v>

1868
01:23:51.170 --> 01:23:52.520
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lead here.</v>

1869
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not the first person to make </v>

1870
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.550
<v Speaker 3>this point about guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is people who are big,</v>

1871
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:59.360
<v Speaker 3>strong second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say that.</v>

1872
01:23:59.370 --> 01:24:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because whenever I advocate for gun </v>

1873
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:04.370
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

1874
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:04.370
<v Speaker 3>oh good that only the governor will have</v>
<v Speaker 3>guns,</v>

1875
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:05.900
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a bad argument,</v>

1876
01:24:05.901 --> 01:24:06.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1877
01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:07.730
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that argument.</v>

1878
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:10.850
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the whole point of view keeping your</v>

1879
01:24:10.851 --> 01:24:15.851
<v Speaker 3>guns to protect yourself from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government is that the government's </v>

1880
01:24:15.851 --> 01:24:17.540
<v Speaker 3>going to take your rights away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you need to have your guns to protect</v>

1881
01:24:17.541 --> 01:24:18.740
<v Speaker 3>your rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1882
01:24:18.741 --> 01:24:20.120
<v Speaker 3>the government already took your rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1883
01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:22.130
<v Speaker 3>They're already reading every email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're already reading,</v>

1884
01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.920
<v Speaker 3>listening on every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You already lost your right to privacy.</v>

1885
01:24:24.921 --> 01:24:27.410
<v Speaker 3>They let you keep your guns while they </v>
<v Speaker 3>took the rest of your rights away.</v>

1886
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:32.530
<v Speaker 3>So now you still have your guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now why don't you go get your rights </v>

1887
01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:34.991
<v Speaker 3>back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have your gun that they're never </v>

1888
01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:34.991
<v Speaker 3>going to do it,</v>

1889
01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:38.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So already report was an interesting </v>

1890
01:24:38.010 --> 01:24:38.010
<v Speaker 2>take on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1891
01:24:38.010 --> 01:24:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one day technology to reach a point,</v>

1892
01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:43.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them it was like through those </v>

1893
01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:44.530
<v Speaker 2>little psychic dudes that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be able to predict future</v>

1894
01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:45.280
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1895
01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.470
<v Speaker 2>And then he arrested you for a future </v>
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>

1896
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:24:48.570 --> 01:24:49.930
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:24:49.931 --> 01:24:50.530
<v Speaker 3>That's kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1899
01:24:50.531 --> 01:24:51.280
<v Speaker 3>they already cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1900
01:24:51.281 --> 01:24:53.680
<v Speaker 3>They kind of do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they can arrest you for a conspiracy</v>

1901
01:24:53.681 --> 01:24:54.020
<v Speaker 3>to commit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1902
01:24:54.021 --> 01:24:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Crime.</v>

1903
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.230
<v Speaker 2>But you don't even have to have a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1904
01:24:56.231 --> 01:24:58.300
<v Speaker 2>You just have some emails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk and shit.</v>

1905
01:24:58.710 --> 01:25:03.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to have a role playing thing </v>

1906
01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:03.710
<v Speaker 2>that you do with your wife.</v>

1908
01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:08.070
<v Speaker 2>we're Bonnie and Clyde and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take down the government and they </v>

1909
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.110
<v Speaker 2>just fucking kick down your door in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the night.</v>

1910
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

1911
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Who's that comic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who had the ice agents breakdown?</v>

1912
01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:16.690
<v Speaker 2>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started following him after that.</v>

1913
01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:18.520
<v Speaker 2>He made a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1914
01:25:18.521 --> 01:25:19.530
<v Speaker 2>What was the joke?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1915
01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:21.080
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was fun.</v>

1916
01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.480
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty funny by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1917
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:24.890
<v Speaker 2>That guy's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know my phone.</v>

1918
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:29.520
<v Speaker 2>I forgot that story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tells us hilarious about those ice or</v>

1919
01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:32.800
<v Speaker 2>the ice cops coming into his place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is his name?</v>

1920
01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Jake Jake parttime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup comic podcast hosts and </v>

1921
01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:42.871
<v Speaker 2>self-described pizza delivery guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who in a strange twist of fate recently </v>

1922
01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:45.220
<v Speaker 2>found himself debating immigration </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy with for homeland security agents</v>

1923
01:25:45.221 --> 01:25:50.221
<v Speaker 2>in his home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The agent's paint him in early morning </v>

1924
01:25:50.221 --> 01:25:51.400
<v Speaker 2>visit last Sunday because of some jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tweeted about Cinco de Mayo.</v>

1925
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1926
01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what he said.</v>

1927
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:59.400
<v Speaker 2>Here's how Cinco de Mayo works in 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 2>white people allowed to culturally </v>

1928
01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.570
<v Speaker 2>appropriate on the condition that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>helped destroy ice.</v>

1929
01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>You kill one ice agent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to wear</v>

1930
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.770
<v Speaker 1>some barrel to kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get to wear a Poncho.</v>

1931
01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:15.260
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is that you can't joke </v>
<v Speaker 1>around about killing an agent because </v>

1932
01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:15.260
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1933
01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 1>So if he had a Sirius xm radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be fired right now.</v>

1934
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they fired Nick Depaulo for that,</v>

1935
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:22.460
<v Speaker 1>for saying something very similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1936
01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.870
<v Speaker 1>And so I say about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1937
01:26:23.871 --> 01:26:27.230
<v Speaker 1>so nick can't make a joke about someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>going into a university,</v>

1938
01:26:27.231 --> 01:26:27.590
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1939
01:26:27.630 --> 01:26:29.270
<v Speaker 1>next school shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his joke.</v>

1940
01:26:29.271 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the professor,</v>

1941
01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:33.410
<v Speaker 1>please go to the Berkeley and go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher's lounge or something like that.</v>

1942
01:26:33.411 --> 01:26:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which everyone knows.</v>

1943
01:26:34.341 --> 01:26:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a goddamn comedian.</v>

1944
01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a right wing community.</v>

1945
01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Can we see everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1946
01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:42.920
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can go on those same radio shows</v>

1947
01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:47.921
<v Speaker 1>and they'll same radio stations and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can advocate for killing hundreds of </v>

1948
01:26:47.921 --> 01:26:48.920
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people in another country </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know and nobody says shit</v>

1949
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:50.180
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1950
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:51.740
<v Speaker 1>People do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People lie about.</v>

1951
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:53.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the weird thing,</v>

1952
01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can have a torture program in </v>

1953
01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:58.280
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody goes,</v>

1954
01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:58.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird that the.</v>

1955
01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.410
<v Speaker 1>And then the media goes along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even call it torture.</v>

1956
01:27:00.411 --> 01:27:03.290
<v Speaker 1>They call it enhanced interrogation </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques because we're doing it.</v>

1957
01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.270
<v Speaker 1>But Nick said that that's all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden.</v>

1958
01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:10.080
<v Speaker 1>So it's just such a weird squiggly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit line of morality and,</v>

1959
01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and so and now Nicole would be better </v>
<v Speaker 1>off for it anyway.</v>

1960
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick will be better off for it and he </v>

1961
01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:20.201
<v Speaker 1>has a podcast now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think unfortunately he's doing a </v>

1962
01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:21.470
<v Speaker 1>subscription service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I tried to talk all these guys out</v>

1963
01:27:21.471 --> 01:27:23.420
<v Speaker 1>of because you can't hear it at all for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

1964
01:27:23.421 --> 01:27:27.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to pay and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it limits a bad idea.</v>

1965
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it limits your growth.</v>

1966
01:27:29.271 --> 01:27:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a famous comedian,</v>

1967
01:27:30.501 --> 01:27:35.501
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sure he'll get some money and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know he's probably doing really well </v>

1968
01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:35.690
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just.</v>

1969
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:38.750
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a subscription service?</v>

1970
01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's shaking his head on Patriot for </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 bucks or more.</v>

1971
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:51.310
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give you more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So start at 10 and then keep adding </v>

1972
01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:54.191
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now all we do is we need to give all </v>

1973
01:27:54.191 --> 01:27:54.510
<v Speaker 1>the way all our stuff for free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except we do a couple of weeks.</v>

1974
01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:57.740
<v Speaker 1>We'd maybe do a couple extra hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week for our patrons.</v>

1975
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:59.970
<v Speaker 1>That's like bonus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1976
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:01.310
<v Speaker 1>So you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to.</v>

1977
01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:05.870
<v Speaker 1>That's not the worst thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that people have different.</v>

1978
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:07.400
<v Speaker 1>You do bonus stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1979
01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:08.480
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's free.</v>

1980
01:28:08.481 --> 01:28:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Everything's free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really lucky.</v>

1981
01:28:10.501 --> 01:28:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Your super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super popular.</v>

1982
01:28:12.081 --> 01:28:17.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I wasn't super popular it was </v>

1983
01:28:17.081 --> 01:28:17.081
<v Speaker 1>all free too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1984
01:28:17.081 --> 01:28:17.810
<v Speaker 1>I had it free in the beginning when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting a thousand downloads.</v>

1985
01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.710
<v Speaker 1>It's always been free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

1986
01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I just want to just start to kick it.</v>

1987
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Kick in for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you started to take off this </v>

1988
01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:26.230
<v Speaker 1>show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two years ago.</v>

1989
01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1990
01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Really say about two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three years ago.</v>

1991
01:28:27.921 --> 01:28:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Was it an issue or what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a special guest that.</v>

1992
01:28:30.861 --> 01:28:33.080
<v Speaker 1>What was it you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1993
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:35.620
<v Speaker 1>It's momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just over time.</v>

1994
01:28:35.890 --> 01:28:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just always.</v>

1995
01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Just constantly doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grinding,</v>

1996
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.070
<v Speaker 1>being in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivering on three or four days a week.</v>

1997
01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1998
01:28:43.931 --> 01:28:46.190
<v Speaker 1>you do your best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do your best.</v>

1999
01:28:46.191 --> 01:28:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Get better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make mistakes,</v>

2000
01:28:47.871 --> 01:28:49.850
<v Speaker 1>apologize for your mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>

2001
01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Because when I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I did your show last time,</v>

2002
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:57.221
<v Speaker 1>I just in my head ever since like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always like you are doing what I want to</v>

2003
01:28:59.451 --> 01:29:00.260
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't.</v>

2004
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 1>I loved what I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Doe because</v>

2005
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.480
<v Speaker 2>people always try and discredit men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2006
01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:07.290
<v Speaker 2>know how I got into a position where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to worry about being discredited.</v>

2007
01:29:07.291 --> 01:29:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking nightclub Jaguar comedian </v>
<v Speaker 2>and afterward,</v>

2008
01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:13.020
<v Speaker 2>that's why you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to cage fighting.</v>

2009
01:29:13.021 --> 01:29:14.970
<v Speaker 2>I spoke the pod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a reputable person.</v>

2010
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.210
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be.</v>

2011
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:21.210
<v Speaker 2>You want to be who I want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at a reputable person,</v>

2012
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.710
<v Speaker 2>go fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2013
01:29:22.711 --> 01:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I do my best to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2014
01:29:25.171 --> 01:29:28.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I approach issues and in an honest way,</v>

2015
01:29:28.351 --> 01:29:30.600
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not your source of reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I mean?</v>

2016
01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that guy.</v>

2017
01:29:32.491 --> 01:29:37.491
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a provocateur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be the guy in the outside </v>

2018
01:29:37.491 --> 01:29:37.491
<v Speaker 2>throwing spitballs that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's who I want to be doing.</v>

2019
01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I am doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow I got caught up in this thing </v>

2020
01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:43.530
<v Speaker 2>where people are going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>discredit you.</v>

2021
01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>

2022
01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm confused by this,</v>

2023
01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:55.251
<v Speaker 2>this Alex Jones thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because although I don't support a lot </v>

2024
01:29:55.251 --> 01:29:58.290
<v Speaker 2>of the things that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why more people don't think</v>

2025
01:29:58.291 --> 01:30:03.291
<v Speaker 2>that this could be a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they could just throw that hate </v>

2026
01:30:03.291 --> 01:30:06.411
<v Speaker 2>speech blanket on things and if I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that experience of talking to that </v>

2027
01:30:06.411 --> 01:30:08.220
<v Speaker 2>woman was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was describing the Douglas Murray,</v>

2028
01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:12.870
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris' podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't have a single slur.</v>

2029
01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:16.650
<v Speaker 2>It is no hateful rhetoric mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hate speech.</v>

2030
01:30:16.651 --> 01:30:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I listened to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a description.</v>

2031
01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a discussion rather.</v>

2032
01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:23.610
<v Speaker 2>So you have that insight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2033
01:30:23.611 --> 01:30:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I know how calmly and confidently she </v>
<v Speaker 2>said it's hate speech.</v>

2034
01:30:28.050 --> 01:30:29.100
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it was like,</v>

2035
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:32.430
<v Speaker 2>do you remember those old commercials </v>
<v Speaker 2>where um,</v>

2036
01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:37.520
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy and he was eating with </v>
<v Speaker 2>another guy and he was saying that if </v>

2037
01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:37.920
<v Speaker 2>you buy drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you support terrorism.</v>

2038
01:30:38.050 --> 01:30:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you mean?</v>

2039
01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.110
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fact.</v>

2040
01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.320
<v Speaker 2>It's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If act fact and he's eating a salad,</v>

2041
01:30:43.321 --> 01:30:45.780
<v Speaker 2>he's a no nonsense guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fact honey,</v>

2042
01:30:45.810 --> 01:30:47.630
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean its effect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Its effect.</v>

2043
01:30:47.690 --> 01:30:50.220
<v Speaker 2>If Act fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you buy pot,</v>

2044
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:52.500
<v Speaker 2>you're supporting terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's basically what you said.</v>

2045
01:30:52.501 --> 01:30:57.501
<v Speaker 2>It's hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the same sort of self </v>

2046
01:30:57.501 --> 01:30:57.501
<v Speaker 2>righteous indignation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2047
01:30:57.690 --> 01:30:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where she didn't,</v>

2048
01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:03.240
<v Speaker 2>but when I was pressing her on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was almost like she was my boss and I</v>

2049
01:31:03.241 --> 01:31:04.350
<v Speaker 2>couldn't talk to her about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2050
01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand that this kind of,</v>

2051
01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 2>this method of communication that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>accustomed to,</v>

2052
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:13.440
<v Speaker 2>this does not apply here you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

2053
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:18.500
<v Speaker 2>You have to discuss these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know the merit of your </v>

2054
01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:18.500
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2055
01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to see where you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where your thought process laws that you</v>

2056
01:31:20.791 --> 01:31:24.060
<v Speaker 2>could just throw this hate speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>blanket on things and it turns out there</v>

2057
01:31:24.061 --> 01:31:26.130
<v Speaker 2>was no thought and there was no </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration.</v>

2058
01:31:26.130 --> 01:31:31.130
<v Speaker 2>There was no examination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't know the content of the </v>

2059
01:31:31.130 --> 01:31:33.711
<v Speaker 2>conversation and her confidence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that it was hate speech was </v>

2060
01:31:33.711 --> 01:31:37.910
<v Speaker 2>merely towing the company line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same company line that got James </v>

2061
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Damore fired for the Google memo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2062
01:31:39.811 --> 01:31:44.811
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked to actual evolutionary </v>

2063
01:31:44.811 --> 01:31:47.151
<v Speaker 2>biologists and people understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and people who are clinical </v>

2064
01:31:47.641 --> 01:31:51.300
<v Speaker 2>psychologists will talk to you about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>real differences between men and women.</v>

2065
01:31:51.301 --> 01:31:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Would he actually said in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>documents where he's.</v>

2066
01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:58.940
<v Speaker 2>He didn't make some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantitative like like a ruling that </v>

2067
01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:05.730
<v Speaker 2>women are less valuable or that women </v>
<v Speaker 2>are worth less money or that women are </v>

2068
01:32:06.431 --> 01:32:09.460
<v Speaker 2>in somehow in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form inferior.</v>

2069
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:14.790
<v Speaker 2>He simply wrote about clinical studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have shown tendencies to gravitate </v>

2070
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:20.550
<v Speaker 2>towards different professions and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a page and a half in that about how </v>

2071
01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:24.220
<v Speaker 2>there's ways that we could encourage </v>
<v Speaker 2>more women to get into tech,</v>

2072
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:24.780
<v Speaker 2>so it was.</v>

2073
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.490
<v Speaker 2>It was not negative in any way towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

2074
01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:32.520
<v Speaker 2>but I saw all these people describing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>as hateful rhetoric and then that it was</v>

2075
01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:37.620
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what with actual studies,</v>

2076
01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.220
<v Speaker 2>actual studies of science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are real.</v>

2077
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:46.350
<v Speaker 2>These are harmful gender stereotypes </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't add up to your vision</v>

2078
01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:51.570
<v Speaker 2>of Narnia diversity that you did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>only exists in Wakanda and some cloud </v>

2079
01:32:52.361 --> 01:32:53.610
<v Speaker 2>somewhere that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've.</v>

2080
01:32:53.690 --> 01:32:56.170
<v Speaker 2>You've put up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are not real numbers.</v>

2081
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:59.950
<v Speaker 2>There's reasons why people gravitate </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards certain professions.</v>

2082
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are biological.</v>

2083
01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:08.250
<v Speaker 2>They're fascinating to study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean that a person who </v>

2084
01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:12.781
<v Speaker 2>becomes a nurse is any better than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who becomes a carpenter or vice </v>

2085
01:33:12.781 --> 01:33:17.221
<v Speaker 2>or a guy who becomes a surgeon is any </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than someone who becomes a </v>

2086
01:33:17.221 --> 01:33:17.830
<v Speaker 2>computer coder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not what anyone's saying.</v>

2087
01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:23.190
<v Speaker 2>What they're saying is there's reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>why people find different things </v>

2088
01:33:23.190 --> 01:33:27.541
<v Speaker 2>interesting and some of them might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of testosterone they have in </v>

2089
01:33:27.541 --> 01:33:27.910
<v Speaker 2>their system and the fact they have x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>y chromosomes,</v>

2090
01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:33.120
<v Speaker 2>their their genetic history that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of their family and the culture </v>

2091
01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.011
<v Speaker 2>that they grew up and there's all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>variables and these variables are </v>

2092
01:33:38.011 --> 01:33:39.310
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you say that,</v>

2093
01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:42.430
<v Speaker 2>these variables must even out at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>

2094
01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.850
<v Speaker 2>we must have an equality of outcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on gender,</v>

2095
01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:47.020
<v Speaker 2>based on race.</v>

2096
01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even talking about people </v>

2097
01:33:52.170 --> 01:33:53.941
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're just talking about something </v>

2098
01:33:53.941 --> 01:33:56.281
<v Speaker 2>that you need to say in order for you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep your job because you want to keep </v>

2099
01:33:56.281 --> 01:34:00.931
<v Speaker 2>collecting ones and Zeros and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that there's this confusion </v>

2100
01:34:00.931 --> 01:34:01.900
<v Speaker 2>as to why there's not more women that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are leaders.</v>

2101
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Why there's not more women that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>tech.</v>

2102
01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Why there's not more this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More that.</v>

2103
01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you really want to concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>on diversity.</v>

2104
01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:10.060
<v Speaker 2>You really want to concentrate on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairness concentrated why they're trying</v>

2105
01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:12.280
<v Speaker 2>to keep agents out of Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

2106
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Because that's some real fucking racism </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going on right now.</v>

2107
01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:18.760
<v Speaker 2>No one's saying a word about it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about people that are kicking ass.</v>

2108
01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:21.130
<v Speaker 2>They're kicking ass too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're trying to.</v>

2109
01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.640
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to make it more </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

2110
01:34:22.641 --> 01:34:27.641
<v Speaker 2>There's a giant class action lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians are suing Harvard because it's </v>

2111
01:34:27.641 --> 01:34:28.810
<v Speaker 2>more difficult for them to get in than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else.</v>

2112
01:34:30.210 --> 01:34:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid,</v>

2113
01:34:31.171 --> 01:34:33.660
<v Speaker 3>I was told that they pee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pee in your coke,</v>

2114
01:34:33.690 --> 01:34:37.860
<v Speaker 3>and that's the Chinese show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I grew up.</v>

2115
01:34:37.861 --> 01:34:40.050
<v Speaker 3>I know that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just a thing that they would tell</v>

2116
01:34:40.051 --> 01:34:40.890
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little Kids,</v>

2117
01:34:41.190 --> 01:34:43.170
<v Speaker 3>little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just say that that's all it is,</v>

2118
01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:49.060
<v Speaker 3>but it's like Joe St Joe to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Charles Murray chat with the.</v>

2119
01:34:50.630 --> 01:34:53.280
<v Speaker 3>The antidote to that isn't to censor </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2120
01:34:53.281 --> 01:34:57.480
<v Speaker 3>The antidote to that is good speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More speech wasn't even if you wanted to</v>

2121
01:34:57.481 --> 01:35:00.230
<v Speaker 3>be whatever is person to put it on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>playlist,</v>

2122
01:35:00.231 --> 01:35:05.231
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody got a community guideline </v>

2123
01:35:05.231 --> 01:35:05.231
<v Speaker 3>strike for putting it on their playlist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2124
01:35:05.231 --> 01:35:09.080
<v Speaker 3>that's why I say we need to have it be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the youtube,</v>

2125
01:35:09.081 --> 01:35:11.030
<v Speaker 3>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are public utilities.</v>

2126
01:35:11.031 --> 01:35:14.390
<v Speaker 3>They need to be regulated and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2127
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:15.830
<v Speaker 3>There's no getting around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2128
01:35:15.831 --> 01:35:19.220
<v Speaker 3>They have super control in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have massive impact.</v>

2129
01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.810
<v Speaker 3>But so to CBS.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2130
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:23.450
<v Speaker 3>So if you say something and CBS fires </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2131
01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:28.900
<v Speaker 3>is that illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it funny that Les Moonves is </v>

2132
01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:31.130
<v Speaker 3>getting in trouble for some he did to an</v>
<v Speaker 3>actress instead of in the eighties?</v>

2133
01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:36.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And instead of him being a long time </v>

2134
01:35:36.190 --> 01:35:36.190
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it the eighties?</v>

2135
01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it was at least 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 1996 with the one.</v>

2136
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:40.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it?</v>

2137
01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:41.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2138
01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:42.640
<v Speaker 3>So that's still a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2139
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:45.090
<v Speaker 3>So the eighties was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2140
01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was confusing that with your,</v>

2141
01:35:47.710 --> 01:35:50.300
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking of Sylvester stallone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2142
01:35:50.301 --> 01:35:52.850
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking as George.</v>

2143
01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Psychiatry,</v>

2144
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:58.250
<v Speaker 3>some guy popped out from the 85,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said he grabbed his deck,</v>

2145
01:35:58.251 --> 01:35:58.640
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2146
01:35:58.641 --> 01:36:01.430
<v Speaker 3>let it go buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

2147
01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

2148
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:05.450
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the,</v>

2149
01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:07.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a molester at my church.</v>

2150
01:36:07.521 --> 01:36:09.850
<v Speaker 3>We had a priest that was a molester </v>
<v Speaker 3>named father hollow.</v>

2151
01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Shocker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

2152
01:36:12.171 --> 01:36:14.000
<v Speaker 3>Is it a Catholic Church?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shocker.</v>

2153
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:17.030
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't trust anybody.</v>

2154
01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:20.930
<v Speaker 3>And the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used to call them happy hands Holahan</v>

2155
01:36:20.931 --> 01:36:23.240
<v Speaker 3>because he would always cry because </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you come up,</v>

2156
01:36:23.241 --> 01:36:25.460
<v Speaker 3>he'd always like to wrestle you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was the last kind of guy.</v>

2157
01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:26.740
<v Speaker 3>He was a nerd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

2158
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:29.090
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not a wrestling type guy,</v>

2159
01:36:29.110 --> 01:36:32.090
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't a rapist trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd always come up like,</v>

2160
01:36:32.091 --> 01:36:32.610
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I?</v>

2161
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you doing?</v>

2162
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.320
<v Speaker 3>You're just trying to grab me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we would call them happy hands,</v>

2163
01:36:36.321 --> 01:36:38.660
<v Speaker 3>Holihan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we would get in trouble if,</v>

2164
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:43.750
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if our parents heard us that don't get </v>

2165
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.750
<v Speaker 3>disrespectful to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2166
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.750
<v Speaker 3>he's grabbing our dicks.</v>

2167
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:48.770
<v Speaker 3>So they finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they finally caught him and I don't know</v>

2168
01:36:48.771 --> 01:36:51.260
<v Speaker 3>why I started talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2169
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:53.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did I start talking about this?</v>

2170
01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.270
<v Speaker 3>And I know because we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>

2171
01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.880
<v Speaker 3>we always had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we always thought it was like it was up </v>

2172
01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:05.891
<v Speaker 3>to you to not get molested by him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you got costs and we would </v>

2173
01:37:05.891 --> 01:37:07.410
<v Speaker 3>laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would laugh at kids who got caught at</v>

2174
01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:08.280
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got less kids.</v>

2175
01:37:09.170 --> 01:37:11.120
<v Speaker 3>So we got to run faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucker.</v>

2176
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:14.300
<v Speaker 3>He would take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would take us.</v>

2177
01:37:14.301 --> 01:37:19.301
<v Speaker 3>He had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a summerhouse right with a boat and up </v>

2178
01:37:19.301 --> 01:37:19.301
<v Speaker 3>in Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2179
01:37:19.301 --> 01:37:21.260
<v Speaker 3>So he would take us and it was like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour and a half away.</v>

2180
01:37:21.261 --> 01:37:26.261
<v Speaker 3>We get in his station wagon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he take like six boys up to there and </v>

2181
01:37:26.261 --> 01:37:26.660
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go water skiing or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2182
01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2183
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:31.640
<v Speaker 3>so he had the day setup where he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you got there,</v>

2184
01:37:31.641 --> 01:37:36.641
<v Speaker 3>you had to first do cleaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you had to change into your cleaning </v>

2185
01:37:36.641 --> 01:37:36.641
<v Speaker 3>clothes and.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh Jeez.</v>

2187
01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.200
<v Speaker 3>And so every time we had to go into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>room and change,</v>

2188
01:37:39.201 --> 01:37:41.450
<v Speaker 3>he would find a reason to come into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>room and wrestle one of us.</v>

2189
01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

2190
01:37:43.371 --> 01:37:44.120
<v Speaker 3>But we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2191
01:37:44.121 --> 01:37:45.800
<v Speaker 3>we got to put up with it because we want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go onto the boat,</v>

2192

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no one could say like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>was laughing about child molestation.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He would take us.</v>

2208
01:38:17.731 --> 01:38:19.750
<v Speaker 3>This priest would try to teach you how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to ski.</v>

2209
01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Know How do you teach someone how to </v>

<v Speaker 3>they sit there on the dock and you pull </v>
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>

2216
01:38:42.201 --> 01:38:42.201
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2217
01:38:42.201 --> 01:38:45.360

<v Speaker 3>So he would take us in shallow water and</v>

2218
01:38:45.361 --> 01:38:50.361
<v Speaker 3>then he would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would put the skis on you so you </v>

2219
01:38:50.361 --> 01:38:51.570

<v Speaker 3>And then he would like put his hands.</v>

2220

<v Speaker 3>He would put his hands underneath your </v>
<v Speaker 3>crotch like this from to pick you up.</v>

2221
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:56.960

<v Speaker 3>I couldn't agree.</v>

2266
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 3>And it's a terrifying</v>

2267
01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:57.250
<v Speaker 1>number when you look at the numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have just accused them of,</v>

2268
01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:00.370
<v Speaker 1>of sexual assault and molestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>

2269
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrifying.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2272
01:41:06.931 --> 01:41:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I feel very fortunate that I ducked </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2273
01:41:08.850 --> 01:41:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

2274
01:41:10.151 --> 01:41:12.880
<v Speaker 1>A Catholic school you went to Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>school for one year.</v>

2275
01:41:12.881 --> 01:41:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Only first grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was gone after first grade and uh,</v>

2276
01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had friends that stayed in,</v>

2277
01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I know new people that got touched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2278
01:41:21.041 --> 01:41:22.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2279
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:25.390
<v Speaker 1>it's for people who outside the Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>

2280
01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:30.420
<v Speaker 1>people who are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that happened and it </v>

2281
01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:34.051
<v Speaker 1>probably happened when they told them </v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't get married anymore </v>

2282
01:41:34.051 --> 01:41:34.190
<v Speaker 1>because it used to be the pope could get</v>
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>

2283
01:41:34.191 --> 01:41:39.191
<v Speaker 1>The pope was allowed to have children </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that priests were allowed to be </v>

2284
01:41:39.191 --> 01:41:39.191
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>

2285
01:41:39.191 --> 01:41:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Priests were allowed to have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were rock stars.</v>

2286
01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:43.930
<v Speaker 1>You have to realize like back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lutheran days,</v>

2287
01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:47.470
<v Speaker 1>the days of Martin Luther and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys were fucking everybody.</v>

2288
01:41:47.890 --> 01:41:52.250
<v Speaker 1>They would get you in that confession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the confession with him,</v>

2289
01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:54.580
<v Speaker 1>what you did to Delores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delores,</v>

2290
01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:59.670
<v Speaker 1>they're just sucking dicks all day has </v>
<v Speaker 1>shown me I sucked at Dolores when they </v>

2291
01:41:59.670 --> 01:42:03.390
<v Speaker 1>were banging everybody and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with some sort of a reason why </v>

2292
01:42:03.521 --> 01:42:06.160
<v Speaker 1>they should have to be celibate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from then on,</v>

2293
01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:07.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what happened.</v>

2294
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I heard was what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that.</v>

2295
01:42:09.611 --> 01:42:12.910
<v Speaker 1>So there was two ways to become nobility</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Bonnyville Times.</v>

2296
01:42:12.911 --> 01:42:17.911
<v Speaker 1>You could be born noble or you could buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>your way into the church and so you </v>

2297
01:42:17.951 --> 01:42:22.951
<v Speaker 1>could become nobility and so what would </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen is these rich motherfuckers who </v>

2298
01:42:22.951 --> 01:42:23.650
<v Speaker 1>would buy the witness of the Church </v>
<v Speaker 1>would die and then all their money would</v>

2299
01:42:23.651 --> 01:42:24.370
<v Speaker 1>go to their kid.</v>

2300
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Their first born in the church is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to get some.</v>

2301
01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:29.980
<v Speaker 1>We got to get our hands on that money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they passed the law.</v>

2302
01:42:29.981 --> 01:42:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can get married legally.</v>

2303
01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.840
<v Speaker 1>They all did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still had kids and shit and they </v>

2304
01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:36.840
<v Speaker 1>still had mistresses and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they died,</v>

2305
01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.560
<v Speaker 1>all their money and property went to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>

2306
01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:40.810
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so of course it's all about.</v>

2307
01:42:40.811 --> 01:42:41.920
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the story I heard.</v>

2308
01:42:41.921 --> 01:42:43.410
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anybody heard different levels,</v>

2309
01:42:43.411 --> 01:42:44.950
<v Speaker 1>it's both a bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bed.</v>

2310
01:42:44.951 --> 01:42:49.951
<v Speaker 1>It had something to do with sex as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and preventing those guys from fucking </v>

2311
01:42:49.951 --> 01:42:50.470
<v Speaker 1>everybody you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were rock stars.</v>

2312
01:42:50.471 --> 01:42:55.471
<v Speaker 1>There was no rock stars back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the guys that were the spokespersons </v>

2313
01:42:55.471 --> 01:42:59.100
<v Speaker 1>for God would most likely be the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>who had the most influence in the </v>

2314
01:42:59.100 --> 01:42:59.100
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2315
01:42:59.130 --> 01:43:04.130
<v Speaker 1>he's a kid that we went to school with </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a clearly gay and a nice guy and</v>

2316
01:43:05.171 --> 01:43:08.140
<v Speaker 1>he was going to become a priest when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were all in high school together.</v>

2317
01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:11.230
<v Speaker 1>So as we were like riding the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to high school,</v>

2318
01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:16.320
<v Speaker 1>he was a couple of years ahead of me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a leaving school and he was </v>

2319
01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:21.121
<v Speaker 1>already on his way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it divinity school or </v>

2320
01:43:21.121 --> 01:43:21.121
<v Speaker 1>seminary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seminary,</v>

2321
01:43:21.121 --> 01:43:21.121
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:43:21.121 --> 01:43:25.240
<v Speaker 1>He was on his way and we were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all calling him father already and</v>

2323
01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:30.241
<v Speaker 1>it was just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all accepting the fact this guy </v>

2324
01:43:30.241 --> 01:43:30.241
<v Speaker 1>was going to be a priest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2325
01:43:30.241 --> 01:43:34.300
<v Speaker 1>for him it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so obviously gay that,</v>

2326
01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:35.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2327
01:43:35.561 --> 01:43:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't give a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I knew you could tell these gay.</v>

2328
01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:42.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a gay guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never had any interest in girls.</v>

2329
01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Never was around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a,</v>

2330
01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:50.130
<v Speaker 1>just an oddly feminine man and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to take up the priesthood and we</v>

2331
01:43:50.741 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>all treated him</v>

2332
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.760
<v Speaker 2>like he was different because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to become</v>

2333
01:43:53.890 --> 01:43:56.340
<v Speaker 3>priest is very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2334
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:59.850
<v Speaker 3>The know priests are still treated like </v>
<v Speaker 3>rock stars in the Catholic Church today.</v>

2335
01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was.</v>

2336
01:44:00.721 --> 01:44:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile I was just another 16 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid just like us,</v>

2337
01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:09.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he was 17 at the time and I think </v>

2338
01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I was 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just,</v>

2339
01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:13.281
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't a different than us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were calling him father and </v>

2340
01:44:13.281 --> 01:44:13.281
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2341
01:44:13.281 --> 01:44:15.880
<v Speaker 3>It was just so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had two uncles that went to seminary.</v>

2342
01:44:16.570 --> 01:44:19.570
<v Speaker 3>One of them became a priest and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other one,</v>

2343
01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:24.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the summer I had a friend who got </v>

2344
01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:25.870
<v Speaker 3>pregnant and he had to stop being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get dropped out of the seminary.</v>

2345
01:44:25.930 --> 01:44:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you went to my grandmother's </v>

2346
01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:31.450
<v Speaker 3>house as you walked up the steps into </v>
<v Speaker 3>their living room,</v>

2347
01:44:31.451 --> 01:44:36.451
<v Speaker 3>the two pictures she would have greeting</v>
<v Speaker 3>you was a picture of both her sons in </v>

2348
01:44:36.451 --> 01:44:38.530
<v Speaker 3>their priest outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one was actually a priest and one had</v>

2349
01:44:38.531 --> 01:44:41.200
<v Speaker 3>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the picture she kept up.</v>

2350
01:44:41.250 --> 01:44:43.210
<v Speaker 3>Right guys bring it over his four kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>to her house.</v>

2351
01:44:43.211 --> 01:44:45.770
<v Speaker 3>There's the picture of Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you in the priest outfit?</v>

2352
01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:49.220
<v Speaker 3>One point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2353
01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:50.410
<v Speaker 3>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2354
01:44:50.411 --> 01:44:51.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you,</v>

2355
01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:52.960
<v Speaker 3>are you still religious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still go to church?</v>

2356
01:44:52.961 --> 01:44:53.840
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2357
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:54.920
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2358
01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:56.920
<v Speaker 3>I go because my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to church,</v>

2359
01:44:56.921 --> 01:45:00.760
<v Speaker 3>a Baptist Church in Pasadena because my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother in law goes and she wanted,</v>

2360
01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:01.800
<v Speaker 3>she asked me to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2361
01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:03.310
<v Speaker 3>that's probably fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2362
01:45:03.311 --> 01:45:03.910
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go.</v>

2363

<v Speaker 3>I'm being protested by the Westboro </v>
<v Speaker 3>Baptist Church tomorrow are.</v>

2364
01:45:07.241 --> 01:45:09.850
<v Speaker 3>You were in Kansas City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2365
01:45:09.851 --> 01:45:10.660
<v Speaker 3>very excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2366
01:45:10.661 --> 01:45:11.290
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

2367
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:13.600
<v Speaker 3>I've always wanted to be protesting is </v>
<v Speaker 3>good for you</v>

2368
01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:16.920
<v Speaker 2>press release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they even responded to my,</v>

2369
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:17.610
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2370
01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:22.611
<v Speaker 2>I put out a post and they had a tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who has no idea what God wants </v>

2371
01:45:22.611 --> 01:45:24.840
<v Speaker 2>to speak and forgot that I said that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2372
01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a god.</v>

2373
01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:27.540
<v Speaker 2>They said I was an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>

2374
01:45:27.810 --> 01:45:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm really not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2375
01:45:29.431 --> 01:45:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't consider myself anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't consider myself religious.</v>

2376
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:36.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a person who doesn't know.</v>

2377
01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:40.650
<v Speaker 2>And I don't call it gnostic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm more agnostic than anything,</v>

2378
01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:42.270
<v Speaker 2>but I don't even want to put a label on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2379
01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Why should I have to be someone's camp?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2380
01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:51.160
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my opinions are allowed to evolve and </v>

2381
01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm allowed to and I've done a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

2382
01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some shit that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain,</v>

2383
01:45:52.951 --> 01:45:54.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and psychedelics,</v>

2384
01:45:54.061 --> 01:45:56.850
<v Speaker 2>man will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll get whatever confidence you have</v>

2385
01:45:56.851 --> 01:45:57.750
<v Speaker 2>that there's no god.</v>

2386
01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.020
<v Speaker 2>You go through a dmt trip and you come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and the other and you're like,</v>

2387
01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:06.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I don't know what the fuck I'm </v>

2388
01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.761
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I don't know anything and that's </v>

2389
01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:07.761
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the maybe I don't know anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>

2390
01:46:08.190 --> 01:46:10.430
<v Speaker 2>So I said that if where there was a god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's a god,</v>

2391
01:46:10.431 --> 01:46:15.431
<v Speaker 2>but if there was a god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he or she would probably very </v>

2392
01:46:15.431 --> 01:46:18.771
<v Speaker 2>disappointed these hateful twats pretend</v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak for him putting up signs and </v>

2393
01:46:18.771 --> 01:46:18.990
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God hates fags.</v>

2394
01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Like you really think this is what God </v>
<v Speaker 2>would want.</v>

2395
01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:26.480
<v Speaker 2>That's outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what they're excited </v>

2396
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:26.480
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you said that,</v>

2397
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:26.480
<v Speaker 2>that I speak for God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2398
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:29.000
<v Speaker 2>but they could speak for good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see God hates fags taking.</v>

2399
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:34.030
<v Speaker 2>See that written anywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look to the Bible never says God hates </v>

2400
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:36.861
<v Speaker 2>fags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's their website is God hates </v>

2401
01:46:36.861 --> 01:46:37.290

01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I think they should take their facebook </v>
<v Speaker 2>page away.</v>

2403
01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:40.680
<v Speaker 2>Do they have a youtube channel?</v>

2404
01:46:41.110 --> 01:46:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Westboro Baptist Church.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but don't.</v>

2406
01:46:45.891 --> 01:46:50.891
<v Speaker 3>Don't use speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think we're living in a weird </v>

2407
01:46:50.891 --> 01:46:54.501
<v Speaker 3>era of like people wanting to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>discredit people just like get rid of </v>

2408
01:46:57.001 --> 01:46:57.480
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2409
01:46:57.481 --> 01:46:58.320
<v Speaker 3>oh you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2410
01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:03.800
<v Speaker 3>you don't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing that the establishment says </v>

2411
01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:06.411
<v Speaker 3>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only one narrative on this </v>

2412
01:47:06.411 --> 01:47:06.411
<v Speaker 3>Syrian war and if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go away from it,</v>

2413
01:47:06.411 --> 01:47:08.670
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a bad person and you're alive and</v>

2414
01:47:08.671 --> 01:47:10.710
<v Speaker 3>you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're an apologist for Assad and you're</v>

2415
01:47:10.711 --> 01:47:12.150
<v Speaker 3>a Putin puppet at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2416
01:47:12.151 --> 01:47:12.900
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2417
01:47:12.901 --> 01:47:17.730
<v Speaker 3>I just have a different view on the war </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's based on facts and evidence and</v>

2418
01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:22.731
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those people you're trusting now </v>

2419
01:47:22.731 --> 01:47:22.731
<v Speaker 3>were the ones who continuously lied to </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

2420
01:47:22.731 --> 01:47:24.120
<v Speaker 3>So I've never lied to you about a war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

2421
01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.590
<v Speaker 3>you're upset because I'm skeptical of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who constantly lie about war.</v>

2422
01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:33.880
<v Speaker 3>It's just the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's just a weird thing and </v>

2423
01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.871
<v Speaker 3>it's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I guess it's probably always been </v>

2424
01:47:35.871 --> 01:47:35.871
<v Speaker 3>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

2425
01:47:35.871 --> 01:47:35.871
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2426
01:47:35.871 --> 01:47:39.080
<v Speaker 3>now that I'm experienced it because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the public talking about this stuff </v>

2427
01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:42.650
<v Speaker 3>and it's just weird how people are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>quick to go along with the </v>

2428
01:47:42.650 --> 01:47:45.681
<v Speaker 3>establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at how the lefties are defending </v>

2429
01:47:45.681 --> 01:47:48.081
<v Speaker 3>the intelligence community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wishing Robert Muller of fucking happy </v>

2430
01:47:48.081 --> 01:47:48.081
<v Speaker 3>birthday on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bunch of idiots.</v>

2431
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 3>So ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2432
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:54.060
<v Speaker 3>do you guys have any sense of history?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any sense of recent history?</v>

2433
01:47:54.330 --> 01:47:55.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2434
01:47:55.950 --> 01:48:00.950
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shows you how the hatred of someone </v>

2435
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:03.321
<v Speaker 3>could make people's lizard brains </v>
<v Speaker 3>excited and then rational thinking goes </v>

2436
01:48:03.321 --> 01:48:03.321
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

2437
01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:06.390
<v Speaker 3>So I love amplicon on my show says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2438
01:48:06.391 --> 01:48:08.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate trump as much as anybody,</v>

2439
01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:10.890
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to let them steal my </v>
<v Speaker 3>critical thinking skills.</v>

2440
01:48:10.891 --> 01:48:15.891
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the thing that I like about what </v>

2441
01:48:15.891 --> 01:48:15.960
<v Speaker 3>our show does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're very consistent.</v>

2442
01:48:16.170 --> 01:48:21.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't have one set of rules first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People I like and another set of rules </v>

2443
01:48:21.170 --> 01:48:21.170
<v Speaker 3>for people I have opposed.</v>

2444
01:48:21.170 --> 01:48:23.280
<v Speaker 2>And I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really appreciate that about you.</v>

2445
01:48:23.281 --> 01:48:28.281
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that I said</v>
<v Speaker 2>about you the first time we came on and </v>

2446
01:48:28.281 --> 01:48:28.530
<v Speaker 2>say you shoot straight no matter whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right or left,</v>

2447
01:48:28.531 --> 01:48:29.760
<v Speaker 2>whatever you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call it,</v>

2448
01:48:29.761 --> 01:48:31.860
<v Speaker 2>like you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no partisan politics.</v>

2449
01:48:31.861 --> 01:48:36.861
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's so rare it doesn't exist </v>

2450
01:48:36.861 --> 01:48:36.861
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2451
01:48:36.861 --> 01:48:41.271
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching or listening rather than </v>

2452
01:48:41.271 --> 01:48:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris is one of his podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

2453
01:48:41.730 --> 01:48:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Whereas guests made a really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>point saying that we're in this strange </v>

2454
01:48:46.730 --> 01:48:50.181
<v Speaker 2>time in history where the news is </v>
<v Speaker 2>different depending on what channel you </v>

2455
01:48:50.671 --> 01:48:55.671
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be you at different people </v>

2456
01:48:55.671 --> 01:48:58.550
<v Speaker 2>telling you the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you have different news if you </v>

2457
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.740
<v Speaker 2>totally different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally different news.</v>

2458
01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's completely partisan.</v>

2459
01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:06.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 100 percent left or 100 percent </v>

2460
01:49:06.230 --> 01:49:06.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2461
01:49:06.230 --> 01:49:07.650
<v Speaker 2>And you're either all in with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like what we're talking about</v>

2462
01:49:07.651 --> 01:49:10.680
<v Speaker 2>here and what you're describing is idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports like this,</v>

2463
01:49:10.681 --> 01:49:13.140
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this needing to shut people down.</v>

2464
01:49:13.141 --> 01:49:15.000
<v Speaker 2>They want to get a result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to win the game.</v>

2465
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:20.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now they just slam dunked on Alex </v>

2466
01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Jones and they're high fiving all around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coffee shop.</v>

2467
01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:22.590
<v Speaker 2>All the Baristas are fucking psyched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2468
01:49:22.591 --> 01:49:27.591
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really excited to make an </v>

2469
01:49:27.591 --> 01:49:27.591
<v Speaker 2>espresso.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2470
01:49:27.591 --> 01:49:29.511
<v Speaker 2>we shut them down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fucking shut them down and we're </v>

2471
01:49:29.511 --> 01:49:30.600
<v Speaker 2>gonna put our masks and our bike locks </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to whack.</v>

2472
01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Trump supporters are in the head </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight.</v>

2473
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Like this is is a strange time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

2474
01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.680
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even,</v>

2475
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:42.950
<v Speaker 2>you can't even objectively assess the </v>
<v Speaker 2>merits of an idea because the ideas have</v>

2476
01:49:44.191 --> 01:49:47.950
<v Speaker 2>already been clearly delineated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very clearly</v>

2477
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:53.040
<v Speaker 3>acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptable parameters of this </v>

2478
01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:53.710
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the acceptable ideas.</v>

2479
01:49:53.711 --> 01:49:56.650
<v Speaker 3>And if you go over them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are persona non grata.</v>

2480
01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2481
01:49:58.790 --> 01:50:00.700
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meanwhile you turn on NBC,</v>

2482
01:50:00.701 --> 01:50:02.160
<v Speaker 3>it's just littered with liars.</v>

2483
01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so is Fox and of course you know </v>

2484
01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.330
<v Speaker 2>what I'd love Shepard Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shep Smith.</v>

2485
01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:13.380
<v Speaker 2>He is a fascinating character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he is doing over there is going </v>

2486
01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:16.640
<v Speaker 2>against everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes to get like the.</v>

2487
01:50:16.641 --> 01:50:20.930
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen the what Sean Hannity says</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus Shepard Smith?</v>

2488
01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen those videos.</v>

2489
01:50:22.281 --> 01:50:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty funny.</v>

2490
01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:27.040
<v Speaker 2>And he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's not right.</v>

2491
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:28.580
<v Speaker 2>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Constitutionally,</v>

2492
01:50:28.581 --> 01:50:33.581
<v Speaker 2>like what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's describing what Sean Hannity </v>

2493
01:50:33.581 --> 01:50:34.520
<v Speaker 2>said versus the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's right.</v>

2494
01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:39.210
<v Speaker 2>He's right in terms of what is a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's right in terms of what you know,</v>

2495
01:50:39.230 --> 01:50:42.410
<v Speaker 2>whether or not something is legal or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's unethical.</v>

2496
01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2497
01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:45.670
<v Speaker 3>you know that that's the thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shep Smith,</v>

2498
01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:47.220
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2499
01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:52.230
<v Speaker 3>when he gets something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's just genuinely getting it </v>

2500
01:50:52.230 --> 01:50:55.321
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's because he's trying </v>

2501
01:50:55.321 --> 01:50:55.321
<v Speaker 3>to push it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2502
01:50:55.321 --> 01:50:55.420
<v Speaker 3>he might be unconsciously been </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupted,</v>

2503
01:50:55.421 --> 01:50:57.550
<v Speaker 3>but not consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did he get over there?</v>

2504
01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Was the over there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2505
01:50:59.231 --> 01:51:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tell me.</v>

2506
01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when Hannity was on with</v>
<v Speaker 3>combs?</v>

2507
01:51:02.531 --> 01:51:07.531
<v Speaker 3>It was Hannity and colmes took the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weasel earliest weakest looking liberal.</v>

2508
01:51:08.051 --> 01:51:12.580
<v Speaker 3>They could find a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looks like he just sweats canola oil and</v>

2509
01:51:12.581 --> 01:51:16.180
<v Speaker 3>they put him on TV opposite like this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>his parties and he would just cower in </v>

<v Speaker 3>the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm kidding.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty nerdy and him split up.</v>

2518
01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:40.180
<v Speaker 3>The band broke up long before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2519
01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:41.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's very nice guy.</v>

2523
01:51:47.070 --> 01:51:52.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he was a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was almost like he didn't get </v>

2524
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.070
<v Speaker 3>riled up on</v>

2525
01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:57.160
<v Speaker 2>to keep his job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got riled up enough to make liberals </v>

2526
01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.961
<v Speaker 2>look like pushovers and so the people at</v>
<v Speaker 2>home and Kansas and be like stupid </v>

2527
01:51:59.961 --> 01:52:00.270
<v Speaker 2>liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2528
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Sean Hannity's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my man.</v>

2529
01:52:02.010 --> 01:52:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Sean Hannity's got American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2530
01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:07.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Sean Hannity with his big fat white</v>

2531
01:52:07.141 --> 01:52:12.141
<v Speaker 2>bread eaten face and that he was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the one who is telling the truth about </v>

2532
01:52:12.141 --> 01:52:15.860
<v Speaker 2>the real problem and the dems in it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fascinating to see that video </v>

2533
01:52:15.991 --> 01:52:20.170
<v Speaker 2>was Shepard Smith just clearly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2534
01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:20.750
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2535
01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:24.900
<v Speaker 2>and very cleanly dissecting everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Hannity says.</v>

2536
01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2537
01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:27.310
<v Speaker 3>the ironic part is right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2538
01:52:27.311 --> 01:52:28.660
<v Speaker 3>that's the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six minutes of it,</v>

2539
01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:30.360
<v Speaker 3>and we can't play this though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2540
01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:38.350
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence to prove any of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>was true after the 18 months.</v>

2541
01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:41.890
<v Speaker 3>The Russian investigation is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite of a hoax.</v>

2542
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:47.790
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>indictments against Russian </v>

2543
01:52:47.790 --> 01:52:47.790
<v Speaker 3>organizations and persons have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>handed up.</v>

2544
01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:50.060
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2545
01:52:50.061 --> 01:52:52.400
<v Speaker 3>It goes on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a Fox News.</v>

2546
01:52:52.401 --> 01:52:56.780
<v Speaker 3>Shep Smith shuts down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sean Hannity's lies and propaganda.</v>

2547
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:59.960
<v Speaker 3>How is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is Shep Smith still at Fox News?</v>

2548
01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:01.340
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you telling me?</v>

2549
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:02.990
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2550
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2551
01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:06.710

<v Speaker 3>eyes look like he's a drugged up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're cheesing anchor,</v>

<v Speaker 3>so on some pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isley,</v>

2554
01:53:09.111 --> 01:53:13.100
<v Speaker 3>he looks like something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's the chief anchor of their breaking</v>

2555
01:53:13.101 --> 01:53:18.101
<v Speaker 3>news division,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let me tell you about what Sean </v>

2556
01:53:18.101 --> 01:53:18.680
<v Speaker 3>Hannity has been doing is that woman on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alexandria,</v>

2557
01:53:18.681 --> 01:53:23.681
<v Speaker 3>Kazuyo Cortez from New York who beat Joe</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crowley and she's the big democratic </v>

2558
01:53:23.681 --> 01:53:26.180
<v Speaker 3>socialists and everybody's got their </v>
<v Speaker 3>bushing and not over it because,</v>

2559
01:53:26.181 --> 01:53:31.181
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's the Corporate Democrats hater the </v>

01:53:31.181 --> 01:53:31.181
<v Speaker 3>right wind.</v>

2561
01:53:31.181 --> 01:53:31.181
<v Speaker 3>She freaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2562
01:53:31.181 --> 01:53:35.591
<v Speaker 3>Because he's actually going to help </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and Sean Hannity has been like </v>

2563
01:53:35.591 --> 01:53:35.591
<v Speaker 3>reading out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look what she likes.</v>

2564
01:53:35.591 --> 01:53:40.070
<v Speaker 3>She wants to have medicare for all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wants to have free college.</v>

2565
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:43.670
<v Speaker 3>She wants to living wage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wants to end the war and people.</v>

2566
01:53:43.671 --> 01:53:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure almost half his audience are </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2567
01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:47.630
<v Speaker 3>that sounds looking pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's A.</v>

2568
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:52.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know Sean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things are tough out here in the </v>

2569
01:53:52.810 --> 01:53:52.810
<v Speaker 3>heartland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that possible to do all those things?</v>

2570
01:53:52.810 --> 01:53:56.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry about medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>bills for my fucking kids anymore and I </v>

2571
01:53:56.850 --> 01:53:59.590
<v Speaker 3>tried for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry about sending my </v>

2572
01:53:59.590 --> 01:53:59.590
<v Speaker 3>kids to college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome because you have more.</v>

2573
01:53:59.590 --> 01:54:01.250
<v Speaker 3>You have endless money for these wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you have some money for us,</v>

2574
01:54:01.251 --> 01:54:03.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean college subsidized,</v>

2575
01:54:03.021 --> 01:54:06.640
<v Speaker 3>like why is it so expensive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it actually backfiring.</v>

2576
01:54:06.650 --> 01:54:11.650
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I there was a poll that Fox and friends </v>

2577
01:54:11.650 --> 01:54:13.961
<v Speaker 3>and friends and friends put out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>said Fox and refresh it.</v>

2578
01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:19.620
<v Speaker 3>It said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think the 32 point </v>

2579
01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:19.620
<v Speaker 3>$6,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Bernie Sanders Medicare for all plan</v>

2580
01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:24.341
<v Speaker 3>is worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they left out the other part </v>

2581
01:54:24.341 --> 01:54:24.341
<v Speaker 3>which turns out it saves two point </v>
<v Speaker 3>something trillion dollars,</v>

2582
01:54:24.341 --> 01:54:29.171
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the part they leave out to their </v>

2583
01:54:29.171 --> 01:54:30.881
<v Speaker 3>gaslighting and their own viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like all news organizations have </v>

2584
01:54:30.881 --> 01:54:30.881
<v Speaker 3>their own viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

2585
01:54:30.881 --> 01:54:35.700
<v Speaker 3>that pole pole went up and 73 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Fox and friends and friends and </v>

2586
01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:39.701
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Viewers said they want Bernie Sanders </v>

2587
01:54:39.701 --> 01:54:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Medicare for all 73 percent and 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people voted in that bowl.</v>

2588
01:54:41.081 --> 01:54:42.990
<v Speaker 3>So that's not just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2589
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.310
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It doesn't scare people anymore because </v>

2592
01:54:51.130 --> 01:54:54.940

2629
01:56:15.930 --> 01:56:20.930
<v Speaker 3>we don't call it free healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We call it included because it's </v>

2630
01:56:20.930 --> 01:56:24.741
<v Speaker 3>included in your taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like just like your public </v>

2631
01:56:24.741 --> 01:56:24.960
<v Speaker 3>education here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like your streets and roads here,</v>

2632
01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:26.910
<v Speaker 3>just like your department,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire department,</v>

2633
01:56:26.911 --> 01:56:27.930
<v Speaker 3>your Chi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's included.</v>

2634
01:56:28.130 --> 01:56:29.610
<v Speaker 3>We don't go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get free police,</v>

2635
01:56:29.670 --> 01:56:31.050
<v Speaker 3>you get free fire department.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2636
01:56:31.051 --> 01:56:36.051
<v Speaker 3>it's included in your Texas road road </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintenance and so that's the funny </v>

2637
01:56:36.051 --> 01:56:37.200
<v Speaker 3>thing that Sean Hannity and the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>wing,</v>

2638
01:56:37.201 --> 01:56:38.910
<v Speaker 3>they think they can scare people by </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2639
01:56:38.911 --> 01:56:39.540
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff,</v>

2640
01:56:39.541 --> 01:56:39.840
<v Speaker 3>they're off.</v>

2641
01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.810
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the Democrats would have been off,</v>

2642
01:56:41.850 --> 01:56:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton would have been offering</v>
<v Speaker 3>people something,</v>

2643
01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:46.860
<v Speaker 3>maybe half the country who didn't vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it came out and voted for her.</v>

2644
01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:52.220
<v Speaker 3>So that's the thing you use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Democrats have nothing to offer </v>

2645
01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:55.341
<v Speaker 3>people in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why there are a shit show at a </v>

2646
01:56:55.341 --> 01:56:56.190
<v Speaker 3>failed party and they've lost their </v>
<v Speaker 3>wiped out at every level of government.</v>

2647
01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:59.220
<v Speaker 3>And so if they take over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like if the congress,</v>

2648
01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:00.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a big chance to chance they </v>
<v Speaker 3>might.</v>

2649
01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:02.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2650
01:57:02.161 --> 01:57:02.540
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2651
01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:07.580
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the ones doing the bidding for </v>

2652
01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:09.321
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just handed him more money for </v>

2653
01:57:09.321 --> 01:57:09.321
<v Speaker 3>defense than he even asked for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if trump had,</v>

2654
01:57:09.321 --> 01:57:10.110
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the funny thing,</v>

2655
01:57:10.111 --> 01:57:12.420
<v Speaker 3>if trump is a maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll to say he's unhinged.</v>

2656
01:57:12.421 --> 01:57:17.421
<v Speaker 3>He's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Haiti shouldn't have his finger on the </v>

2657
01:57:17.421 --> 01:57:17.421
<v Speaker 3>button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's give them $80,</v>

2658
01:57:17.421 --> 01:57:17.580
<v Speaker 3>million more dollars for bombs.</v>

2659
01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:21.300
<v Speaker 3>Those two things are incongruent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those don't go together.</v>

2660
01:57:21.330 --> 01:57:23.670
<v Speaker 3>So you're bullshitting me on one end or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

2661
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he's going to get through </v>
<v Speaker 3>this without going to jail?</v>

2662
01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:28.440
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2663
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:33.710
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think your son's going to go to </v>

2664
01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:33.710
<v Speaker 3>jail?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2665
01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:33.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at predicting things,</v>

2666
01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:37.701
<v Speaker 3>but they should all go to jail because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably all corrupt doing </v>

2667
01:57:37.701 --> 01:57:40.670
<v Speaker 3>corrupt shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you put a special prosecutor on </v>

2668
01:57:40.670 --> 01:57:42.750
<v Speaker 3>anybody I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll find crimes on anybody you know,</v>

2669
01:57:42.751 --> 01:57:44.580
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're prosecuting manafort for.</v>

2670
01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:47.490
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have anything to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>election or trump's campaign.</v>

2671
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:49.410
<v Speaker 3>It's all shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before the trump's campaign,</v>

2672
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:53.010
<v Speaker 3>when he was in collusion with Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the from the Podesta group,</v>

2673
01:57:53.011 --> 01:57:58.011
<v Speaker 3>he was funneling money from fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ukraine and they were giving it through </v>

2674
01:57:58.011 --> 01:58:00.970
<v Speaker 3>the Podesta found day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is what he's getting charged.</v>

2675
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:06.000
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's getting charged for shit that </v>

2676
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:06.000
<v Speaker 3>happened before he ever even worked for </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

2677
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.320
<v Speaker 3>So that's the part they don't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go metaphor charge,</v>

2678
01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:09.240
<v Speaker 3>but then 80th paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

2679
01:58:09.241 --> 01:58:10.680
<v Speaker 3>this has nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>election.</v>

2680
01:58:10.890 --> 01:58:15.890
<v Speaker 3>Every articles like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just a matter of them deciding </v>

2681
01:58:15.890 --> 01:58:17.860
<v Speaker 3>to put a microscope up your ass and find</v>
<v Speaker 3>things you did wrong.</v>

2682
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:22.160
<v Speaker 3>They put a microscope but Bill Clinton's</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass about some land deal in Arkansas and</v>

2683
01:58:22.170 --> 01:58:26.370
<v Speaker 3>ended up going to a blowjob in the oval </v>
<v Speaker 3>office and he got impeached for it.</v>

2684
01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:31.640
<v Speaker 3>So they got rid of the special </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecutor after that because they </v>

2685
01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:33.080
<v Speaker 3>realize that you'll find crimes on </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody if you put a special prosecutor.</v>

2686
01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they.</v>

2687
01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:35.760
<v Speaker 3>And now they bring it back for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

2688
01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:38.610
<v Speaker 3>they're not prosecuting literal fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>war criminals.</v>

2689
01:58:39.090 --> 01:58:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Joe Literal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know their war criminals.</v>

2690
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:43.390
<v Speaker 3>There was a thing called the torture </v>
<v Speaker 3>program.</v>

2691
01:58:43.450 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 3>We know that it was a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one goes to jail.</v>

2692
01:58:46.590 --> 01:58:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's prosecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but God dammit,</v>

2693
01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:51.670
<v Speaker 3>they got a special prosecutor for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that they shouldn't,</v>

2694
01:58:51.850 --> 01:58:54.680
<v Speaker 3>but we all know if you put a special </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecutor on anybody,</v>

2695
01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna find a lot of fucking </v>

2696
01:58:59.720 --> 01:58:59.720
<v Speaker 3>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2697
01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:02.131
<v Speaker 3>they know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all the same game of this thing </v>

2698
01:59:02.131 --> 01:59:02.800
<v Speaker 3>about not registering as four at age and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they all played the same game.</v>

2699
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:07.950
<v Speaker 3>They don't register as foreign agents </v>
<v Speaker 3>until they get caught and then the </v>

2700
01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:08.020
<v Speaker 3>government allows them to go backtrack </v>
<v Speaker 3>and reregister,</v>

2701
01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:11.130
<v Speaker 3>but they're not doing that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to let but metaphor it.</v>

2702
01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:12.220
<v Speaker 3>They eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made a mistake.</v>

2703
01:59:12.670 --> 01:59:17.670
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's ways to oppose trump and the </v>

2704
01:59:17.670 --> 01:59:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Russia thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

2705
01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:20.470
<v Speaker 3>The way to oppose trump is you offer </v>
<v Speaker 3>people something else.</v>

2706
01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:23.470
<v Speaker 3>He ran to the left of Hillary Clinton on</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy.</v>

2707
01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:28.530
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to end our foreign wars is </v>
<v Speaker 3>according to his rhetoric and his </v>

2708
01:59:28.530 --> 01:59:31.261
<v Speaker 3>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to give everybody healthcare </v>

2709
01:59:31.261 --> 01:59:33.150
<v Speaker 3>member.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's going to get healthcare and </v>

2710
01:59:33.150 --> 01:59:33.150
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was his.</v>

2711
01:59:33.150 --> 01:59:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Of course he stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing the exact opposite.</v>

2712
01:59:33.590 --> 01:59:38.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so who does the thing they say they're </v>

2713
01:59:38.590 --> 01:59:39.350
<v Speaker 3>gonna do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoever does the thing.</v>

2714
01:59:39.490 --> 01:59:41.650
<v Speaker 3>Who's ever done it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

2715
01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:42.800
<v Speaker 3>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he got.</v>

2716
01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:45.100
<v Speaker 3>That's why democracy is not based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust.</v>

2717
01:59:45.101 --> 01:59:48.100
<v Speaker 3>It's based on mistrust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's based on transparency.</v>

2718
01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:49.320
<v Speaker 2>You remember that bit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That bill,</v>

2719
01:59:49.890 --> 01:59:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Bill Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to do about a.</v>

2720
01:59:52.081 --> 01:59:55.860
<v Speaker 2>That is something along the lines of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that when you get elected,</v>

2721
01:59:55.861 --> 02:00:00.861
<v Speaker 2>they bring into a smoky room filled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>globalists and they show you an angle of</v>

2722
02:00:00.991 --> 02:00:03.690
<v Speaker 2>the Kennedy assassination that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>never seen before.</v>

2723
02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.410
<v Speaker 2>They roll it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any questions?</v>

2724
02:00:07.230 --> 02:00:12.230
<v Speaker 2>What's my agenda?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it almost seems like that's what </v>

2725
02:00:12.230 --> 02:00:12.480
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>

2726
02:00:12.630 --> 02:00:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Obama changed his tune,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remembering the hope and change website </v>

2727
02:00:17.630 --> 02:00:19.500
<v Speaker 2>that had all that shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whistleblowers afforded protection.</v>

2728
02:00:19.530 --> 02:00:21.240
<v Speaker 2>That was all gone the day he got </v>
<v Speaker 2>elected.</v>

2729
02:00:21.241 --> 02:00:26.241
<v Speaker 2>That was a while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took a while for him being an office </v>

2730
02:00:26.241 --> 02:00:28.170
<v Speaker 2>where they realized that it was still in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there on deleted it all.</v>

2731
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:30.980
<v Speaker 3>He disbanded his own followers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2732
02:00:30.981 --> 02:00:32.750
<v Speaker 3>So when he got elected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barack Obama,</v>

2733
02:00:32.751 --> 02:00:35.720
<v Speaker 3>he had all these young people who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>activated and they signed up.</v>

2734
02:00:35.721 --> 02:00:38.650
<v Speaker 3>He had a mailing list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat at all and we want to go do shit for</v>

2735
02:00:38.651 --> 02:00:40.400
<v Speaker 3>you want to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

2736
02:00:40.401 --> 02:00:41.540
<v Speaker 3>get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did.</v>

2737
02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:43.670
<v Speaker 3>He got rid of them because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>control them.</v>

2738
02:00:43.671 --> 02:00:44.570
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2739
02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.170
<v Speaker 3>they fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2740
02:00:46.450 --> 02:00:47.700
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2741
02:00:47.810 --> 02:00:49.670
<v Speaker 3>then Bernie Sanders has his campaign and</v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

2742
02:00:49.671 --> 02:00:54.671
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to fight this fucking evil </v>

2743
02:00:54.671 --> 02:00:54.671
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then on a dime he goes,</v>

2744
02:00:54.671 --> 02:00:54.671
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2745
02:00:54.671 --> 02:00:56.690
<v Speaker 3>let's join this evil machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little thing happens.</v>

2746
02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2747
02:00:58.131 --> 02:00:59.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't know.</v>

2748
02:00:59.530 --> 02:01:01.820
<v Speaker 3>I bought it good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what people have said.</v>

2749
02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:06.821
<v Speaker 3>Chris Hedges said that Bernie Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to end up like Ralph Nader </v>

2750
02:01:06.821 --> 02:01:07.580
<v Speaker 3>who was unfairly held accountable again </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the Democrats.</v>

2751
02:01:07.610 --> 02:01:10.940
<v Speaker 3>The Democrats lost to heal to fucking a </v>
<v Speaker 3>game show host.</v>

2752
02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:16.600
<v Speaker 3>And that's what this is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't come to terms with this and </v>

2753
02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:20.291
<v Speaker 3>they don't want us to examine the system</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gave us trump and they don't want </v>

2754
02:01:20.291 --> 02:01:23.381
<v Speaker 3>to examine how they could have the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>qualified person to book couldn't even </v>

2755
02:01:23.381 --> 02:01:24.110
<v Speaker 3>beat fucking Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how qualified you are.</v>

2756
02:01:24.111 --> 02:01:24.230
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

2757
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted trump to win because they </v>

2758
02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:30.030
<v Speaker 2>thought he'd be the easiest guy to beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the election.</v>

2759
02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:34.480
<v Speaker 3>That was the song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it funny that nobody gets mad at </v>

2760
02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:34.640
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's upset at Chris Hayes for having</v>

2761
02:01:34.670 --> 02:01:37.040
<v Speaker 3>empty podiums of trump for an whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

2762
02:01:37.041 --> 02:01:39.770
<v Speaker 3>which I saw and then he wags his finger </v>
<v Speaker 3>at Surandon.</v>

2763
02:01:39.890 --> 02:01:44.890
<v Speaker 3>You're the son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You prop trump up and you didn't cover </v>

2764
02:01:44.890 --> 02:01:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders because you were fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>told not to,</v>

2765
02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:50.680
<v Speaker 3>and we know that for a fact because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ed Schultz and now you're going to </v>

2766
02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:53.471
<v Speaker 3>pretend like you're a sanctimonious </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking brick and you're going to wag </v>

2767
02:01:53.471 --> 02:01:53.690
<v Speaker 3>your finger at people with no money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>no power.</v>

2768
02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the biggest microphone of </v>

2769
02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:00.581
<v Speaker 3>anybody and you fucking prop Donald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump up and you don't take </v>

2770
02:02:00.581 --> 02:02:03.761
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he's a piece of shit and </v>

2771
02:02:03.761 --> 02:02:03.761
<v Speaker 3>couldn't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very excited,</v>

2772
02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:08.920
<v Speaker 3>very excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he's doing their bidding </v>

2773
02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:08.920
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those people are doing their bidding</v>

2774
02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:10.250
<v Speaker 3>because Ed Schultz revealed and fill </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and you,</v>

2775
02:02:10.251 --> 02:02:13.160
<v Speaker 3>if you tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will fucking fire your ass.</v>

2776
02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:16.850
<v Speaker 3>They've got guys like Lee Veggie and and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rachel maddow pretending they don't know</v>

2777
02:02:16.851 --> 02:02:20.420
<v Speaker 3>how net neutrality works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

2778
02:02:20.421 --> 02:02:22.310
<v Speaker 3>A good as it gets a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's important,</v>

2779
02:02:22.311 --> 02:02:24.230
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know which way we'll see how</v>
<v Speaker 3>it rolls out.</v>

2780
02:02:24.231 --> 02:02:24.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the middle.</v>

2781
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:30.170
<v Speaker 3>That's what tools or hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I wouldn't do it too.</v>

2782
02:02:30.171 --> 02:02:32.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not being offered 30 grand a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day to sell my soul.</v>

2783
02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:37.780
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems confusing to me that they're </v>

2784
02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:41.291
<v Speaker 3>thinking about using hillary again </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it seems to me that she's </v>

2785
02:02:41.291 --> 02:02:43.970
<v Speaker 3>starting to make her way back into new </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycles and given speeches.</v>

2786
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:49.000
<v Speaker 3>She has a pack that's supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporting women who are running for </v>

2787
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.740
<v Speaker 3>office except not Cynthia Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2788
02:02:50.810 --> 02:02:55.810
<v Speaker 3>she's going to prop up the most corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucker in New York has had for a long </v>

2789
02:02:55.810 --> 02:02:58.631
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was supposed to be about just women </v>

2790
02:02:58.631 --> 02:02:59.030
<v Speaker 3>whose gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She says that's what the gender based.</v>

2791
02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:01.790
<v Speaker 3>She said she was starting a pack to help</v>
<v Speaker 3>encourage women to run.</v>

2792
02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:03.680
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read that in an interview with her and</v>

2793
02:03:03.681 --> 02:03:04.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

2794
02:03:04.281 --> 02:03:06.320
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't that pack?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then supporting Cynthia Nixon.</v>

2795
02:03:06.321 --> 02:03:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Why are you supporting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2796
02:03:08.001 --> 02:03:11.020
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck she was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she independent.</v>

2797
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:14.690
<v Speaker 3>She running a Democrat and she's running</v>
<v Speaker 3>against Cuomo.</v>

2798
02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:18.470
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so of course I'm was running for mayor.</v>

2799
02:03:18.590 --> 02:03:21.200
<v Speaker 3>No governor was running for governor in </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>

2800
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:23.900
<v Speaker 3>I knew she was running for something I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know was that big.</v>

2801
02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:25.930
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuomo is one of the most corrupt.</v>

2802
02:03:26.110 --> 02:03:27.600
<v Speaker 3>He said he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just a,</v>

2803
02:03:27.601 --> 02:03:29.120
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have one party rule,</v>

2804
02:03:29.121 --> 02:03:34.121
<v Speaker 3>we have corporate rule and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are in bed with the corporations </v>

2805
02:03:34.121 --> 02:03:37.271
<v Speaker 3>because their body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's the way our elections </v>

2806
02:03:37.271 --> 02:03:38.330
<v Speaker 3>work and that's the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why Hillary Clinton has a private</v>

2807
02:03:38.331 --> 02:03:41.450
<v Speaker 3>position and a public position and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>not saying she's the only one,</v>

2808
02:03:41.451 --> 02:03:46.451
<v Speaker 3>but she's the one that we know actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally said that because of </v>

2809
02:03:46.451 --> 02:03:46.451
<v Speaker 3>wikileaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God.</v>

2810
02:03:46.451 --> 02:03:47.250
<v Speaker 3>And that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go back to Julian signs.</v>

2811
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:52.270
<v Speaker 3>The fact that none of the reporters in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States are sticking up for </v>

2812
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:55.451
<v Speaker 3>Julian Assan shows you that what they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>is fucking wrestling and they don't do </v>

2813
02:03:55.451 --> 02:03:56.090
<v Speaker 3>real journalism wrestling.</v>

2814
02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:59.060
<v Speaker 3>And what's really interesting about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Julia naissance things,</v>

2815
02:03:59.061 --> 02:04:04.010
<v Speaker 3>if you ask people what he did that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the reductionist thinking,</v>

2816
02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:09.130
<v Speaker 3>because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've allowed this narrative to play </v>

2817
02:04:09.130 --> 02:04:11.531
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll say he's accused of sexual </v>

2818
02:04:11.531 --> 02:04:12.260
<v Speaker 3>assault and when you find out the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>facts of it,</v>

2819
02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:17.380
<v Speaker 3>his woman consensual sex and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of the night he stuck it in </v>

2820
02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:18.850
<v Speaker 3>without a condom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were calling.</v>

2821
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:21.680
<v Speaker 3>They were calling it surprised sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2822
02:04:21.810 --> 02:04:23.660
<v Speaker 3>But there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it didn't make any sense.</v>

2823
02:04:23.661 --> 02:04:27.740
<v Speaker 3>And why the pressure him to the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States for surprise sex that he had in.</v>

2824
02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Where was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Norway or somewhat the first.</v>

2825
02:04:29.811 --> 02:04:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Of course they want to kind of come at </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2826
02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they want to get the CIA wants to get</v>

2827
02:04:34.191 --> 02:04:35.610
<v Speaker 3>you the first thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh he's probably by betsy.</v>

2828
02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:37.080
<v Speaker 3>He's a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get some going.</v>

2829
02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:41.820
<v Speaker 3>And that whole prosecutor who tries to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecutor was discredited for doing so.</v>

2830
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.460
<v Speaker 3>They were apologized to Julian asides </v>
<v Speaker 3>the UN stuck up for his.</v>

2831
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Stood up for Julian to size and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>

2832
02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:51.180
<v Speaker 3>So this is why they're still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still have them.</v>

2833
02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Hold up in the Ecuadorian embassy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is he going to do?</v>

2834
02:04:54.361 --> 02:04:55.500
<v Speaker 3>They want to kick him out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2835
02:04:55.530 --> 02:04:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ACL was,</v>

2836
02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:58.440
<v Speaker 3>I think supporting him in the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

2837
02:04:58.441 --> 02:04:59.550
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2838
02:04:59.551 --> 02:05:04.551
<v Speaker 3>certain people of character or are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are supporting him or not him,</v>

2839
02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:08.910
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of journalistic integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech,</v>

2840
02:05:08.911 --> 02:05:10.620
<v Speaker 3>the right to publish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you watch that movie,</v>

2841
02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:15.830
<v Speaker 3>the post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was all about Daniel Ellsberg and </v>

2842
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.830
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Vietnam,</v>

2843
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:19.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Pentagon papers which expose that </v>

2844
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:20.670
<v Speaker 3>for administrations were lying to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the Vietnam War.</v>

2845
02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:22.110
<v Speaker 3>Not a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a democrat.</v>

2846
02:05:22.111 --> 02:05:27.111
<v Speaker 3>They're all again the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking two wings of the same party to </v>

2847
02:05:27.111 --> 02:05:27.111
<v Speaker 3>right wings.</v>

2848
02:05:27.111 --> 02:05:30.800
<v Speaker 3>It's the military industrial party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the hero of that movie is the woman </v>

2849
02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:32.280
<v Speaker 3>who was the head of the Washington Post.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Daniel Ellsberg.</v>

2850
02:05:32.281 --> 02:05:37.281
<v Speaker 3>He was a real fucking hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how can you make that movie in this </v>

2851
02:05:37.281 --> 02:05:39.960
<v Speaker 3>day and age and not mentioned Chelsea </v>
<v Speaker 3>manning not mentioned Edward Snowden and</v>

2852
02:05:39.961 --> 02:05:40.710
<v Speaker 3>not go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2853
02:05:41.090 --> 02:05:46.090
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Ellsberg's up today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We imprison them and that's what we're </v>

2854
02:05:46.090 --> 02:05:46.090
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We in prison,</v>

2855
02:05:46.090 --> 02:05:50.421
<v Speaker 3>the Daniel Ellsberg's up today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody who watched panels of the </v>

2856
02:05:50.421 --> 02:05:51.640
<v Speaker 3>actors from that movie and the director </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sit around and talk,</v>

2857
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:56.750
<v Speaker 3>nobody ever brings the shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unfucking believable to me that </v>

2858
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:57.220
<v Speaker 3>they don't understand that they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing pr.</v>

2859
02:05:57.230 --> 02:06:02.230
<v Speaker 3>That's propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look how good our Washington Post </v>

2860
02:06:02.230 --> 02:06:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Washington Post went on to lead us into </v>
<v Speaker 3>every fucking war after that movie was </v>

2861
02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:05.790
<v Speaker 3>supposedly made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2862
02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:10.791
<v Speaker 3>So after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after they did that and they printed </v>

2863
02:06:10.791 --> 02:06:10.791
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they backed every goddamn more sense.</v>

2864
02:06:10.791 --> 02:06:13.920
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones who told us that Saddam</v>
<v Speaker 3>had weapons of mass destruction.</v>

2865
02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:17.940
<v Speaker 3>And it was irrefutable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the headline on their editorial</v>

2866
02:06:17.941 --> 02:06:19.170
<v Speaker 3>page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't [inaudible].</v>

2867
02:06:19.290 --> 02:06:23.070
<v Speaker 3>It was their editorial board said air </v>
<v Speaker 3>refutable doubt always at that fake news</v>

2868
02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:28.160
<v Speaker 3>should they have their facebook page </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken down that actually led to the </v>

2869
02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:28.920
<v Speaker 3>fucking death of millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2913
02:08:06.221 --> 02:08:08.420
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was,</v>

2914
02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:10.960
<v Speaker 3>I was just back in Chicago and I played </v>
<v Speaker 3>a place called Thalia Hall,</v>

2915
02:08:10.961 --> 02:08:13.190
<v Speaker 3>which is fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where Brian Callen just did his,</v>

<v Speaker 3>channel.</v>

2918
02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:20.830
<v Speaker 3>It was so I used to live in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started to be a comedian,</v>

2919
02:08:20.831 --> 02:08:22.840
<v Speaker 3>I moved to that neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was back then.</v>

2920
02:08:22.841 --> 02:08:24.220
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a nice neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2921
02:08:24.221 --> 02:08:27.040
<v Speaker 3>It was like a tougher neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got to live closer to the city and</v>

2922
02:08:27.041 --> 02:08:32.041
<v Speaker 3>all my comedian friends live there </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was affordable and now it's </v>

2923
02:08:32.041 --> 02:08:32.530
<v Speaker 3>being gentrified and shit and they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got this new theater and it's.</v>

2924
02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:35.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's old and they refurbished it and</v>

2925
02:08:35.231 --> 02:08:37.510
<v Speaker 3>it's 600 people and I came out and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just like,</v>

02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:40.270
<v Speaker 3>it was just like heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2927
02:08:40.271 --> 02:08:45.271
<v Speaker 3>and I get my whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to figure out how to get people </v>

2928
02:08:45.271 --> 02:08:48.031
<v Speaker 3>to stand up at the end of my set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do I get what I don't want to </v>

2929
02:08:48.031 --> 02:08:48.031
<v Speaker 3>do it in a shitty way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to manipulate them,</v>

2930
02:08:48.031 --> 02:08:51.010
<v Speaker 3>but I want to have come from my heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>and inspire people and make them want to</v>

2931
02:08:51.011 --> 02:08:51.760
<v Speaker 3>stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2932
02:08:51.761 --> 02:08:52.840
<v Speaker 3>to get a standing ovation.</v>

2933
02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now they stand up when I come out.</v>

2934
02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:56.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry about it.</v>

2935
02:08:57.310 --> 02:09:02.310

02:09:56.860 --> 02:10:01.860

<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now he's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2972
02:10:09.041 --> 02:10:11.500
<v Speaker 3>it's just like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I W I aspire to be Bill Maher.</v>

2973
02:10:11.501 --> 02:10:14.460
<v Speaker 3>I aspire to be a millionaire for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and a little bit out of touch.</v>

2974
02:10:14.910 --> 02:10:16.180
<v Speaker 3>That's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did it.</v>

2975
02:10:17.890 --> 02:10:19.730
<v Speaker 3>You did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

2976
02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:21.070
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's good.</v>

2977
02:10:21.071 --> 02:10:21.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2978
02:10:21.770 --> 02:10:26.770
<v Speaker 3>I get upset because I want him to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>better or be more like I want them to </v>

2979
02:10:26.770 --> 02:10:27.040
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it actually helps me.</v>

2980
02:10:27.070 --> 02:10:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the more he's he shifts to the right,</v>

2981
02:10:30.070 --> 02:10:32.110
<v Speaker 3>the more his audience comes to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2982
02:10:32.111 --> 02:10:37.111
<v Speaker 3>And the more I get on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have to do as much as an ame on </v>

2983
02:10:37.111 --> 02:10:37.111
<v Speaker 3>stage at a live show and people fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

2984
02:10:37.111 --> 02:10:37.111
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2985
02:10:37.111 --> 02:10:38.930
<v Speaker 3>It's progressives don't like him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's.</v>

2986
02:10:39.110 --> 02:10:44.110
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did that happen for Bernie Sanders </v>

2987
02:10:44.110 --> 02:10:44.110
<v Speaker 3>campaign?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real.</v>

2988
02:10:44.110 --> 02:10:48.610
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference that there's a </v>

2989
02:10:48.610 --> 02:10:48.610
<v Speaker 3>difference between the Hillary and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders.</v>

2990
02:10:48.610 --> 02:10:50.510
<v Speaker 3>How could he not get it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tell me.</v>

2991
02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:51.570
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's had we,</v>

2992
02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:51.980
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2993
02:10:51.981 --> 02:10:53.730
<v Speaker 3>I played videos of him saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2994
02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:55.190
<v Speaker 3>Now they were basically the same.</v>

2995
02:10:55.190 --> 02:10:56.060
<v Speaker 3>What's the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then?</v>

2996
02:10:56.140 --> 02:10:57.920
<v Speaker 3>These progressives are just being </v>
<v Speaker 3>babies.</v>

2997
02:10:57.921 --> 02:11:02.921
<v Speaker 3>And isn't it funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Progressives are being babies when they </v>

2998
02:11:02.921 --> 02:11:05.771
<v Speaker 3>won't support warmongering corporatists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but centrus corporatist start being </v>

2999
02:11:05.771 --> 02:11:06.830
<v Speaker 3>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they fuck over progressive's,</v>

3000
02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:08.600
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't ever accommodate them.</v>

3001
02:11:08.601 --> 02:11:11.210
<v Speaker 3>They don't ever drop their values and </v>
<v Speaker 3>come over and be progressive.</v>

3002
02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:13.760
<v Speaker 3>We're always supposed to go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never go the other way.</v>

3003
02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:15.080
<v Speaker 3>That unity means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3004
02:11:15.081 --> 02:11:18.830
<v Speaker 3>you guys shut the fuck up and fall in </v>
<v Speaker 3>line and become a corporatist.</v>

3005
02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:21.590
<v Speaker 3>That's what they mean when they say </v>
<v Speaker 3>unity and it ain't happening,</v>

3006
02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:26.710
<v Speaker 3>and I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders is making a big mistake </v>

3007
02:11:26.710 --> 02:11:26.710
<v Speaker 3>by not starting a third party right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you influence.</v>

3008
02:11:26.710 --> 02:11:29.720
<v Speaker 3>If he does not win the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>nomination in 20 slash 20,</v>

3009
02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:32.330
<v Speaker 3>what is he built over these four years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking nothing.</v>

3010
02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he's going to run?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Run in 20 slash 20?</v>

3011
02:11:35.770 --> 02:11:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what this is all about.</v>

3012
02:11:38.210 --> 02:11:40.550
<v Speaker 3>That's what this is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thought he had said he was done.</v>

3013
02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:43.190
<v Speaker 3>I thought he said he wasn't gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try again.</v>

3014
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:44.750
<v Speaker 3>He's running again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks if there's.</v>

3015
02:11:45.010 --> 02:11:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll make that prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3016
02:11:46.730 --> 02:11:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll make that prediction that you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar.</v>

3017
02:11:48.590 --> 02:11:52.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll bet you $2 doubled down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five bucks.</v>

3018
02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3043

<v Speaker 1>I did the Chicago theater in how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>seats is that?</v>

3044
02:12:49.410 --> 02:12:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Thirty 700.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pretty popular.</v>

3046
02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know what happened,</v>

3047
02:12:56.041 --> 02:13:01.041
<v Speaker 1>but I did the Chicago theater many years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago and I remember saying something </v>

3048
02:13:01.041 --> 02:13:03.960
<v Speaker 1>about the podcast and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many you guys listen to the podcast?</v>

3049
02:13:04.170 --> 02:13:07.710
<v Speaker 1>And it was a roar through the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>

3050
02:13:07.770 --> 02:13:10.860
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was when I realized I was like,</v>

3051
02:13:10.861 --> 02:13:12.050
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3052
02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3053
02:13:13.170 --> 02:13:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't think I thought I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be like 10 percent of the </v>

3054
02:13:18.170 --> 02:13:18.170
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

3055
02:13:18.170 --> 02:13:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't pay attention to anything,</v>

3056
02:13:19.051 --> 02:13:24.051
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the secrets from me </v>

3057
02:13:24.051 --> 02:13:24.900
<v Speaker 1>staying me and people and people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>accused me of changing.</v>

3058
02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:27.420
<v Speaker 1>It's called I evolve as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3059
02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I learn more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied myself.</v>

3060
02:13:30.930 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm ruthlessly</v>

3061
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:34.680
<v Speaker 2>critical of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very analytical,</v>

3062
02:13:34.681 --> 02:13:39.681
<v Speaker 2>self analytical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't like a lot of the stuff I </v>

3063
02:13:39.681 --> 02:13:43.100
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just so I get better at it </v>

3064
02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:43.100
<v Speaker 2>hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3065
02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:46.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't know that anybody was </v>

3066
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.870
<v Speaker 2>paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

3067
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.870
<v Speaker 2>wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't looking.</v>

3068
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I occasionally look and I go to,</v>

3069
02:13:50.431 --> 02:13:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't want any think about that and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think about it.</v>

3070
02:13:52.421 --> 02:13:57.421
<v Speaker 2>I just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that moment where I was in front of </v>

3071
02:13:57.421 --> 02:14:00.501
<v Speaker 2>3,700</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and know how many guys listened </v>

3072
02:14:00.501 --> 02:14:00.501
<v Speaker 2>to the podcast and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3073
02:14:00.501 --> 02:14:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3074
02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:07.460
<v Speaker 2>This is not what I expected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to be a bunch of </v>

3075
02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:07.460
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>

3076
02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:10.380
<v Speaker 2>no ma'am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no fear booked or UFC whatever.</v>

3077
02:14:10.890 --> 02:14:15.890
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I realized something was </v>

3078
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:15.890
<v Speaker 2>going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird feeling,</v>

3079
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:19.341
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you realize all these people are </v>

3080
02:14:19.341 --> 02:14:19.341
<v Speaker 2>coming to see you because of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>you did yourself.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was the yes,</v>

3082
02:14:19.341 --> 02:14:19.960
<v Speaker 3>because it's something you did and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

3083
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:22.330
<v Speaker 3>it was when I stopped trying almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one</v>

3086
02:14:27.921 --> 02:14:30.470
<v Speaker 3>Like when I stop censoring myself or </v>
<v Speaker 3>overthinking,</v>

3087
02:14:30.471 --> 02:14:33.170
<v Speaker 3>like I would go on stage and I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have my jokes down to a science.</v>

3088
02:14:33.171 --> 02:14:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3089
02:14:36.111 --> 02:14:39.350
<v Speaker 3>way and I just let it rip and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that connected with people.</v>

3090
02:14:39.351 --> 02:14:40.280
<v Speaker 3>It's so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>

02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:45.310
<v Speaker 3>and the Burbank Burbank Comedy Festival </v>

3097
02:14:57.080 --> 02:14:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Places almost full.</v>

3098
02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:01.430
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what the fuck's going on?</v>

3100
02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:05.020

<v Speaker 3>I am not,</v>

3102
02:15:06.801 --> 02:15:11.801

<v Speaker 3>that they came from Compton when they </v>

3103
02:15:11.801 --> 02:15:11.801
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

3106
02:15:12.921 --> 02:15:13.910
<v Speaker 3>we worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to see.</v>

3107
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:15.620
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3108
02:15:15.621 --> 02:15:17.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm really connecting with people right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

3109
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:22.830
<v Speaker 3>that don't look like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they share the same ideology and it </v>

3110
02:15:22.830 --> 02:15:27.131
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when I would go see George </v>

3111
02:15:27.131 --> 02:15:27.131
<v Speaker 3>Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever went and saw him live,</v>

3112
02:15:27.131 --> 02:15:30.970
<v Speaker 3>there were 80 year old hippies and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were a teenager kids and there was </v>

3113
02:15:30.970 --> 02:15:31.430
<v Speaker 3>everybody in between and that's what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like at my shows.</v>

3114
02:15:31.431 --> 02:15:35.120
<v Speaker 3>And it makes me so fucking happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so that's when it,</v>

3115
02:15:35.150 --> 02:15:35.950
<v Speaker 3>that's when it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3116
02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:37.160
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3117
02:15:37.161 --> 02:15:38.960
<v Speaker 3>thanks flappers for making me do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

3118
02:15:38.961 --> 02:15:39.680
<v Speaker 3>because now I realize,</v>

3119
02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 2>and Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy for you too,</v>

3120
02:15:41.701 --> 02:15:46.701
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that you're one of the </v>

3121
02:15:46.701 --> 02:15:48.990
<v Speaker 2>only people out there that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't toe a line one way or the other.</v>

3122
02:15:48.991 --> 02:15:52.050
<v Speaker 2>You really do speak the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said that about you the first time</v>

3123
02:15:52.230 --> 02:15:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I said about you before I ever had you </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

3124
02:15:53.881 --> 02:15:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy just says what he thinks.</v>

3125
02:15:55.951 --> 02:15:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Whether you agree with them or disagree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them,</v>

3126
02:15:57.481 --> 02:15:59.460
<v Speaker 2>you can't point to him and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3127
02:15:59.461 --> 02:16:03.300
<v Speaker 2>this guy is just a left wing hack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or this guy is a right wing apologist,</v>

3128
02:16:03.301 --> 02:16:08.301
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just say what you think and that is </v>

3129
02:16:08.301 --> 02:16:11.040
<v Speaker 2>so refreshing and it's so valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just not enough of that today.</v>

3130
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:16.430
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these people that are super </v>

3131
02:16:16.430 --> 02:16:18.781
<v Speaker 2>intelligent that think that if you vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>one way it's a protest vote and he </v>

3132
02:16:18.931 --> 02:16:23.931
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have a protest vote because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're throwing away your vote and you </v>

3133
02:16:23.931 --> 02:16:25.530
<v Speaker 2>gonna let the right wing people when </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're missing everything.</v>

3134
02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:29.950
<v Speaker 2>You're missing this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This whole thing is super complicated,</v>

3135
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:34.980
<v Speaker 1>it's very complicated and the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see through the haze is to be honest </v>

3136
02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:36.430
<v Speaker 1>and you're one of the only people that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

3137
02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate you saying that and </v>

3138
02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a lot of common </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

3139
02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:45.151
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations fingers out of our </v>

3140
02:16:45.151 --> 02:16:48.271
<v Speaker 1>government and ending wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people agree on that </v>

3141
02:16:48.271 --> 02:16:48.271
<v Speaker 1>and that actually scares the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment.</v>

3142
02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it does.</v>
