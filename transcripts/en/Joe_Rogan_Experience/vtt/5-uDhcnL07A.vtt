00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.670
<v Speaker 1>While the results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.200
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.360
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're live ladies and gentlemen to</v>

5

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Brian counts on the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's his birthday and uh,</v>

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>he's old as fuck and sometimes you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>

8
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.200
<v Speaker 1>you lose your keys and you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what time it is.</v>

9
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Chip [inaudible] mother fucking Bra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>and Brendan job is up in this bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut up and we're watching beltre hope</v>

11
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>no one at the UFC gets mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a big fight.</v>

12
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>This is an important one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we are,</v>

13
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now this is the heavyweight finals</v>

14
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>is going to be fade or versus Ryan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bader.</v>

15
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am excited about that.</v>

16
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I like Ryan Bader at heavyweight.</v>

17
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>He looks fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's bigger than me right now.</v>

18
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>How many of these guys just should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>done that a long time ago when to stop</v>

19
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>cutting weight?</v>

20
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Went to heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could just crucifying their body.</v>

21
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Chris Weidman I think is kind of one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main ones.</v>

22
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to excel at light</v>

23
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a disc replaced in his neck.</v>

24
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>He's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll figure it out.</v>

25
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>The worst nightmare though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a fighter in wrestling or MMA is</v>

26
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>just being overpowered by somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

27
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're killing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to,</v>

28
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>they would rather go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>depleted then get thrown around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so old school.</v>

30
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>It's such an old school way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it makes sense though,</v>

31
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to be that one in wrestling it's,</v>

32
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.220
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at Tj dillashaw,</v>

33
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Tj dillashaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

34
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:28.520
<v Speaker 1>but that's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>

35
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about that fight because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched that fight several times.</v>

36
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I am of the opinion that was a quick</v>
<v Speaker 1>stoppage.</v>

37
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Early startups for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my,</v>

38
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>here's my other point with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When there are 125 pounds,</v>

39
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you can let it go on a little longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>than if they were heavyweights.</v>

40
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd heard more on the side of let it go</v>
<v Speaker 1>long to 125 days.</v>

41
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>It could be a thousand pounds each and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight got stopped quick.</v>

42
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Let that's fucking fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when talking about a legacy</v>

43
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>that was spending 69 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about Tj?</v>

44
00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nike.</v>

45
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>See fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy drained his body to get down to</v>

46
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>125 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

47
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry.</v>

48
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>To who knows a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably have beat him anyway.</v>

49
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>But for people that are paying for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the event,</v>

50
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.540
<v Speaker 1>we want to see some highlight shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definite knock out.</v>

51
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought I thought the ref,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever he was,</v>

53
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>he was just in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell he wanted to stop it.</v>

54
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Or like there's guides that they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just want to get in there and like</v>

55
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>saved her life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really good of anybody's life.</v>

56
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

57
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard job.</v>

58
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I am so glad I'm not a referee because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they make a mistake,</v>

59
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>they can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

60
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it again.</v>

61
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>You remember they used to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when big John McCarthy</v>

62
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>stopped the fight between Marilla</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bustamante and uh,</v>

63
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Matt Lindland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Lindland.</v>

65
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Matt Lindland tapped and said he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>tap and Big John McCarthy let the fight</v>

66
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.700
<v Speaker 1>continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt and he got him in an arm bar.</v>

67
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We missed an arm bar.</v>

68
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 2>That was some serious Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

69
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see it in the highlights.</v>

70
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Where was Jesus Christ talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

71
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>let's get those nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Bella towards got some fucking high</v>

72
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>level fights now man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are like,</v>

73
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.681
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

74
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 2>on the way up there as close to the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get right.</v>

75
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 2>They have the biggest prospect in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport and Pico.</v>

76
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's by far.</v>

77
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Take it back a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about Conan Sylvia era versus</v>

78
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 2>soccer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking rob.</v>

79
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I remember that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

80
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Same Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He redid the fight.</v>

81
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 2>The whole fight got re did old school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got stopped during John too and</v>

82
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.390
<v Speaker 2>then they decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

83
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Speaker 2>let them fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big John.</v>

84
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.100
<v Speaker 2>He got he eight or Conan hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

85
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Sakharova soccer but dropped and went</v>
<v Speaker 2>down for a single and they stopped the</v>

86
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 2>fight and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you doing?</v>

87
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 2>But it was in Japan.</v>

88
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 2>They pulled him aside in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like wild west,</v>

89
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

90
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.013
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

91
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they don't let big</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's score the rounds.</v>

92
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 2>That's tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they don't let them</v>

93
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 2>chime in on officially with a scorecard</v>
<v Speaker 2>until everyone else gets going.</v>

94
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.240
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that doesn't want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

95
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is who does what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I did it,</v>

96
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:07.711
<v Speaker 2>the problem was when they announced the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unofficial scorecard and if I was right</v>

97
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 2>and you know the general consensus was</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my side and they flash it.</v>

98
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>

99
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:18.660
<v Speaker 2>if the other fighter wins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do those judges get trash</v>

100
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.960
<v Speaker 2>responsible show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is this.</v>

101
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what it was though.</v>

102
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning the UFC was,</v>

103
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bending over backwards for the</v>

104
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 2>commission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

105
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

106
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I had to,</v>

107
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 2>well they still want the cat too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but boxing's boxing doesn't have to do</v>

108
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

109
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Boxing doesn't have to bend over</v>
<v Speaker 2>backwards for the commission.</v>

110
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.020
<v Speaker 2>Boxing was around before the commission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so boxes,</v>

111
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 2>because I have to kiss ass to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>commission.</v>

112
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>The UFC had to because they were a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport and the commission could have</v>

113
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 2>easily just shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a different dynamic.</v>

114
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 2>But the difference is you were doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an independent,</v>

115
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 2>meaning you weren't doing commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were doing commentary and you were</v>

116
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 2>coming in in between rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very educational.</v>

117
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 2>If big John was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem would be that he's actually</v>

118
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 2>doing commentary while he's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very hard to do.</v>

119
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of doing that because when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing commentary,</v>

120
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really what I'm trying to do is be</v>

121
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 2>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to give some life to it.</v>

122
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to like put some emotion to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

123
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not really scoring.</v>

124
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>

125
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying have like say you score</v>

126
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:28.070
<v Speaker 2>it and then also do the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying maybe have him outside of it</v>

127
00:05:28.071 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 2>because they have 17 commentators will</v>
<v Speaker 2>jump in there.</v>

128
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Big Guy though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's Goldie and big John.</v>

129
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.771
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

130
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 2>frank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mary of Chill Sonin you got to college,</v>

131
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 2>but while the fights are happening with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the voice you're hearing on television</v>

132
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 2>is big John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way he can do that.</v>

133
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 2>In my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like that would be a big</v>

134
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you can't do it.</v>

135
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Smith used to do scoring in</v>
<v Speaker 2>between and it was good.</v>

136
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy is very good at what's it going to</v>

137
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:55.950
<v Speaker 2>do now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

138
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

139
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>I I'm not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

140
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not happy that the UFC got rid of</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

141
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I think he's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

142
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a lot of other pieces on bad</v>

143
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 3>terms are the terms I do not know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they were cutting the money.</v>

144
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 3>It was a financial thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You left.</v>

145
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.610
<v Speaker 3>He's still on good terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

146
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 3>but they offer them less money because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these other dudes,</v>

147
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.821
<v Speaker 3>so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

148
00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm a doc is off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see their dream job.</v>

149
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 3>But they signed a one year contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ask anybody why they let him go?</v>

150
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 3>They want to use fighters so it wasn't a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fit.</v>

151
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.780
<v Speaker 3>They decided to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See fighters,</v>

152
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 3>UFC fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

153
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:31.860
<v Speaker 3>That's how the NFL is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

154

155
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.150
<v Speaker 3>tater is always a former chief Tony</v>
<v Speaker 3>Romo.</v>

156
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Tony Romo was the commentators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got back.</v>

157
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 3>I already best he calls exactly what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna happen before it even happens.</v>

158
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:46.581
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

159
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people kind of dislike it.</v>

160
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

161

<v Speaker 3>this can be a run to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get ready and then that sure enough,</v>

162
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He reads it before it all happens.</v>

163
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Then they even check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

164
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 3>he's going to throw up a slant in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>top left higher.</v>

177
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 3>he's going for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why this is happening?</v>

178
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's called this guy's name out too,</v>

179
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 3>because we didn't give this guy's name</v>
<v Speaker 3>or what he was,</v>

180
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to counter the take down.</v>

181
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 3>He goes for Kamora and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he rides that Kamora all the way to an</v>

182
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:39.590
<v Speaker 3>armbar and then he kind of swims with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

183
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 3>with the Camorra is still intact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The arm pops and bill fucking beautiful.</v>

184
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's tight ass submission.</v>

185
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 3>He looks strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Powerful.</v>

186
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Kamora it's kind of amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>

187
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bearded Camorra's aren't just for</v>

188
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Camorra's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Camorra's are for back takes and for</v>

189
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 3>straight armbar setups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

190
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:00.900
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

191
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 3>the traditional Komora is probably the</v>
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>

192
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:06.981
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

193
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 3>you take the army and you crank it</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind his back,</v>

194
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 3>that's probably the hardest of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

195
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably easier just to use the</v>

196
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:16.900
<v Speaker 3>Camorra grip to take the back or to turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>it into a spiderweb.</v>

00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:51.970
<v Speaker 3>shave his head because he could sing so</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

305
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.670
<v Speaker 3>We just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

306
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.060

<v Speaker 3>metal.</v>

311
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.590
<v Speaker 3>So I wore all that shit and I always</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought in the back of my head,</v>

312
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.050
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was weird that gay people</v>
<v Speaker 3>were the same shit dudes too.</v>

313
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.850

<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just a rock star.</v>

<v Speaker 3>His band,</v>

320
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 3>his name was queen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one thought he was gay who just,</v>

321
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.010
<v Speaker 3>no one thought he was getting some</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

322
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.470
<v Speaker 3>but not the match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Took a while.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you watch the movie,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Liberace.</v>

332
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.980
<v Speaker 3>I think Freddie Mercury is a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a little crazier than no</v>

333
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.490
<v Speaker 3>liberace problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Name of his band was queen.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true,</v>

335
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:15.400
<v Speaker 3>but he's a Rockstar rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Liberace played a piano and came out and</v>

341
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.790

611
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.110
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying is Freddie Roach said this</v>

612
00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:54.650
<v Speaker 1>about Aaron Peko said he could be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>world champion right now in boxing.</v>

613
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.150
<v Speaker 1>If he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want him to do boxing.</v>

616
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.460
<v Speaker 1>And he goes for Miguel cotto camp when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a kid,</v>

617
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.440
<v Speaker 1>even younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like four or five years ago,</v>

618
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.690
<v Speaker 1>he would beat Miguel cotto and rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

619
00:26:05.691 --> 00:26:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Miguel's not give him shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd beat him in round sparring.</v>

620
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.830
<v Speaker 1>He's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just kid man.</v>

621
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.840
<v Speaker 1>He's very ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the number one high school wrestling</v>

<v Speaker 1>he could compete in boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was compete.</v>

627
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.520
<v Speaker 1>He'd be world champion right now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But why doesn't he do that?</v>

630
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Because it isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way more money in boxing.</v>

631
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.280

701
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Speaker 4>didn't mean to go down this road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Mike Baker Dude,</v>

702
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.530
<v Speaker 4>did you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was humble.</v>

703
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.390
<v Speaker 4>I watched my bakers and then I went down</v>
<v Speaker 4>a rabbit hole on youtube on mlk.</v>

704
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.930
<v Speaker 4>Conspiracy from the CIA's convinced that</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone helped James Earl Ray to</v>

705
00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.330
<v Speaker 4>convince guys legit as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when he,</v>

706
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.820
<v Speaker 4>when he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

707
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 4>let me look into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing,</v>

708
00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:03.230
<v Speaker 4>although I like Mike Baker's gray guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When when I brought up JFK,</v>

709
00:30:03.231 --> 00:30:07.640
<v Speaker 4>he did the CIA killed jfk is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know with Mlk,</v>

710
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Martin Luther King junior thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about no,</v>

711
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.690
<v Speaker 4>but he calls him the bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

712
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.950
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

713
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:16.300
<v Speaker 4>You see no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's hit things.</v>

714
00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 4>Lost credibility with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

715
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do believe he was able to pull that</v>

716
00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:22.270
<v Speaker 4>off and if you get up there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can actually pull that out.</v>

717
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.680
<v Speaker 4>Any hundred could do that were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

718
00:30:24.681 --> 00:30:24.851
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

719
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:26.770
<v Speaker 4>That's not exactly true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do it.</v>

720
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 4>It's not that far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's less than a hundred yards.</v>

00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:29.140
<v Speaker 4>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you haven't.</v>

722
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 4>It's a little shaky and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the bullet,</v>

723
00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:33.660
<v Speaker 4>the way the bullet came in telling you</v>
<v Speaker 4>the PR,</v>

724
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.230
<v Speaker 4>the only problem is the magic bullet</v>
<v Speaker 4>theory.</v>

725
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:35.920
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the risk.</v>

<v Speaker 4>propecia and argo.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You don't think he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

858
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.420
<v Speaker 4>you don't think that he already kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a touch of the dog?</v>

859
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.440
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't.</v>

860
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 4>You think it was all you just shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolate.</v>

861
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:17.610
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the side effects.</v>

862
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.640
<v Speaker 4>One of the side effects of severe</v>
<v Speaker 4>depression from have peace.</v>

863
00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:24.780
<v Speaker 4>You have really two d Brian's propecia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is It d h t inhibitor.</v>

864
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.130
<v Speaker 4>The reason why it works to keep your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body from losing his hair is because</v>

865
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:32.100
<v Speaker 4>dihydrotestosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a derivative testosterone is</v>

866
00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:33.390
<v Speaker 4>suppressed by propecia.</v>

867
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:37.200
<v Speaker 4>Propecia was originally proskauer and</v>
<v Speaker 4>proskauer was something they use for</v>

868
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:40.860
<v Speaker 4>people with a prostate enlargement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you get on that stuff.</v>

869
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:44.640
<v Speaker 4>It inhibits dht so your hair stops</v>
<v Speaker 4>falling out and grows back a little bit,</v>

870
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.370
<v Speaker 4>but it also fucks with your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your energy levels.</v>

871
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:49.110
<v Speaker 4>Dude for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what,</v>

872
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.371
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>

873
00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:52.320
<v Speaker 4>For me it wasn't very good for my</v>
<v Speaker 4>boners.</v>

874
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.110
<v Speaker 4>I still got them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is what,</v>

875
00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:56.790
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stopped taking it because I ran out of</v>

876
00:36:56.791 --> 00:36:58.050
<v Speaker 4>it and I forgot to get a new</v>
<v Speaker 4>prescription.</v>

877
00:36:58.051 --> 00:36:59.920
<v Speaker 4>How that goes in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Dick was hard.</v>

878
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.400
<v Speaker 4>It was just like this hen hunt and I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

879
00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:04.890
<v Speaker 4>what is happening with my Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I realized,</v>

880
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not on the appropriate [inaudible]</v>

881
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.150
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I realized propecia was fucking up</v>

882
00:37:09.151 --> 00:37:11.590
<v Speaker 4>my boners a cat could not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would blend.</v>

883
00:37:11.591 --> 00:37:12.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

885
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.790
<v Speaker 4>So then I got off of it and the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing I noticed is how much more energy</v>

886
00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:19.030
<v Speaker 4>I had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like lifting.</v>

888
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:25.090
<v Speaker 4>I could lift more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had more energy to roll forever and</v>

889
00:37:25.091 --> 00:37:28.480
<v Speaker 4>then obviously counts and my brother to</v>

<v Speaker 4>not terrible really back then I was like</v>

1456
01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:43.820
<v Speaker 4>roll the dice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you had a little less crack a</v>

1457
01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.460
<v Speaker 4>year before the crack epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

1458
01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:48.500
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I first started training the girls</v>

1459
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:50.040
<v Speaker 4>I would date because I was training all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

1460
01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.550
<v Speaker 4>Whenever we get all you did hit me in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the face,</v>

1461
01:01:52.551 --> 01:01:56.330
<v Speaker 4>they'd always punched me or pushed me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause you're so big,</v>

1462
01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:58.520
<v Speaker 4>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can get away with it.</v>

1463
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.290
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's like hitting a punching</v>

1464
01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:01.124
<v Speaker 4>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Cool.</v>

1465
01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.250
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to come their way.</v>

1466
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:05.090
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I remember I was living in this</v>

1467
01:02:05.091 --> 01:02:08.720
<v Speaker 4>basement with all these roommates and me</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my girl at the time were fighting</v>

1468
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.650
<v Speaker 4>and I was like lifting a lot of spite to</v>
<v Speaker 4>65 at the time.</v>

1469
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.770
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she did something that horrible.</v>

1470
01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:18.740
<v Speaker 4>I forget what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it pissed me off and there's a couch</v>

1471
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 4>and I wanted to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember I was like,</v>

1472
01:02:20.311 --> 01:02:24.270
<v Speaker 4>just fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lifted up the couch and to me,</v>

1473
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:27.150
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a heavy couch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like one of those Ikea</v>

1474
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:30.990
<v Speaker 4>couches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This thing went and fucking hit the</v>

1475
01:02:30.991 --> 01:02:32.550
<v Speaker 4>ceiling land on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>

1476

<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like oh shit,</v>

<v Speaker 4>she got hot.</v>

1478
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.830
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she wanted to call the cops.</v>

1479
01:02:37.831 --> 01:02:42.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm like for throwing us so far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't mean to launch this Shitty Sofa</v>

1480
01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.400
<v Speaker 4>over throwing us sofa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can.</v>

1481
01:02:44.401 --> 01:02:46.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the cops came and you'd be like,</v>

1482
01:02:46.201 --> 01:02:48.680
<v Speaker 4>I didn't throw it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have to arrest someone or if it's</v>

1483
01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:50.580
<v Speaker 4>a domestic violence call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even if it's not true,</v>

1484
01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:51.780
<v Speaker 4>they got to take me away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1485
01:02:51.781 --> 01:02:54.290
<v Speaker 4>But if it's not violence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the cops come hashtag no,</v>

1486
01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.970
<v Speaker 4>Greg Hardy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if the cops come and you say,</v>

1487
01:02:56.971 --> 01:02:59.610
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do anything violent to her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got mad.</v>

1488
01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:01.320
<v Speaker 4>I threw the sofa over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1489
01:03:01.321 --> 01:03:02.820
<v Speaker 4>But then crazy bitches go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1495
01:03:20.821 --> 01:03:24.540

<v Speaker 4>But I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told you this story.</v>

1502
01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:39.350

<v Speaker 4>I told her foot stumps.</v>

1503
01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:43.260
<v Speaker 4>You remember that story I told you that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was breaking up with the girl.</v>

1504
01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:45.990
<v Speaker 4>She was moving out of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She started opening my windows going</v>

01:03:45.991 --> 01:03:47.460
<v Speaker 4>stop heading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And I was like closed in the winter.</v>

1507
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:52.820
<v Speaker 4>You don't hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this fight they're setting.</v>

1508
01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:56.460
<v Speaker 4>Do you look at the genes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looks like the guy from Orange County</v>

1509
01:03:56.461 --> 01:03:58.260
<v Speaker 4>choppers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to find those genes just so</v>

1510
01:03:58.261 --> 01:04:00.570
<v Speaker 4>he can get dressed quick on the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1511
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm paste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is a cell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the fight.</v>

1513
01:04:02.821 --> 01:04:03.654
<v Speaker 4>Ready,</v>
<v Speaker 4>takedown,</v>

1514
01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:06.060
<v Speaker 4>grounded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pound stoppage in a minute.</v>

1515
01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:06.894
<v Speaker 4>Quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1516
01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a setup.</v>

1517
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>

1518
01:04:10.831 --> 01:04:11.720
<v Speaker 4>His debut?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1519
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.120
<v Speaker 4>he's never fought before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so having fight in a smaller</v>

1520
01:04:15.121 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 4>organization and not just feed them to</v>
<v Speaker 4>these fucking,</v>

1521
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:20.970
<v Speaker 4>he shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he shouldn't be in jeans.</v>

1522
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.780
<v Speaker 4>It's not disrespectful to him and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not disrespectful to the sport,</v>

1523
01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:29.640
<v Speaker 4>but it's disrespectful to a large scale</v>
<v Speaker 4>organization to have a guy who's a guy</v>

1524
01:04:29.641 --> 01:04:32.910
<v Speaker 4>who's coming in from pro wrestling's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got a big fan base,</v>

1525
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:36.370
<v Speaker 4>do it the right way and then eventually</v>
<v Speaker 4>make your way into a big organization.</v>

1526
01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.440
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about?</v>

1527
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.510
<v Speaker 4>He's like homemade event on espn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1528
01:04:39.511 --> 01:04:40.860
<v Speaker 4>how'd that go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How'd that work?</v>

1529
01:04:40.861 --> 01:04:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We watch it together.</v>

1530
01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.570
<v Speaker 4>It was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why knew that guy was,</v>

1531
01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:46.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was fading quick.</v>

1532
01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.510
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about it and your green</v>
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>

1533
01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:49.680
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fading.</v>

1534
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:51.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the way he's stepping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looks exhausted.</v>

1535
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:53.970
<v Speaker 4>He tired out quick and then he hit that</v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

1536
01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:55.950
<v Speaker 4>With the illegal knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he's still going to be in</v>

1537
01:04:55.951 --> 01:04:59.110
<v Speaker 4>the UFC after that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>100% they've invested too much in I'm</v>

1538
01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:00.510
<v Speaker 4>Dana said he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you have another fight.</v>

1539
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.840
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting interest.</v>

1540
01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.440
<v Speaker 4>It's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's the life we live.</v>

1541
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.520
<v Speaker 4>And what do you do with them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I do with them,</v>

1542
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:10.740
<v Speaker 4>I did give him Derek Lewis and give him</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck out and I go,</v>

1543
01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.930
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he liked to hit women Lewis who came</v>

1544
01:05:12.931 --> 01:05:14.410
<v Speaker 4>from a domestic violence home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1545
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:15.180
<v Speaker 4>he's pretty good.</v>

1546
01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:16.800
<v Speaker 4>Enjoy this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be a fighter.</v>

1547
01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 4>Here's Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Derek,</v>

1548
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.670
<v Speaker 4>Derek,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but too,</v>

1549
01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.060
<v Speaker 4>now I know he asked mad how many fights</v>
<v Speaker 4>is greg hardy had was as,</v>

1550
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.550
<v Speaker 4>that'd be his fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had three on the whatever and white</v>

1551
01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:30.220
<v Speaker 4>guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a pro bowler.</v>

1552
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:33.310
<v Speaker 4>Really Athletic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't his learning curve be very,</v>

1553
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:34.370
<v Speaker 4>very steep?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

1554
01:05:34.371 --> 01:05:35.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't he?</v>

1555
01:05:35.271 --> 01:05:37.340
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He he just too much.</v>

1556
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:39.520
<v Speaker 4>There's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's too much to download.</v>

1557
01:05:39.521 --> 01:05:42.460
<v Speaker 4>Especially at his age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's 30 so you got to download a lot of</v>

1558
01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:44.740
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe he's working a lot on striking,</v>

1559
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:47.770
<v Speaker 4>but you can't cover Jiu Jitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing,</v>

1560
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.340
<v Speaker 4>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom at all.</v>

1561
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:53.320
<v Speaker 4>No matter who you are now it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter you to take Herschel Walker.</v>

1562
01:05:53.321 --> 01:05:54.940
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter if they're that great</v>
<v Speaker 4>of an athlete.</v>

1563
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:56.600
<v Speaker 4>It takes a fucking wild to learn the</v>
<v Speaker 4>skill.</v>

1564
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:59.530
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Herschel Walker was a world class</v>

1565
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:02.770
<v Speaker 4>athlete and a lifelong martial artists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different animals,</v>

1566
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.720
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying even if you take an</v>

1567
01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:07.060
<v Speaker 4>athletic like Lebron James would</v>
<v Speaker 4>struggle,</v>

1568
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:08.320
<v Speaker 4>did you throw it to the UFC?</v>

1569
01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.680
<v Speaker 4>Firmly believed that Hershel Walker</v>
<v Speaker 4>would have given a lot of dudes a hard</v>

1570
01:06:11.681 --> 01:06:15.100
<v Speaker 4>fucking time at his age or if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>started early in his forties even his</v>

1571
01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.730
<v Speaker 4>forties I think he was such a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>freak stud of an athlete.</v>

1572
01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:22.770
<v Speaker 4>He's such an outlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to give it a lot of speed.</v>

1573
01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:25.840
<v Speaker 4>Heading to 35 he was running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was running Olympic speed.</v>

1574
01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.840
<v Speaker 4>He's in the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was such a freak.</v>

1575
01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:32.350
<v Speaker 4>It's just unbelievable and a real</v>
<v Speaker 4>martial artist,</v>

1576
01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.240
<v Speaker 4>but you really had skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when,</v>

1577
01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:36.040
<v Speaker 4>when I first saw him fight in the UFC I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

1578
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.450
<v Speaker 4>or it strikeforce rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1579
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.640
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he can actually fight.</v>

1580
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Like dudes are scared of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was.</v>

1581
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:45.040
<v Speaker 4>He was moving in the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't doing anything wrong.</v>

1582
01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.170
<v Speaker 4>Who's taking guys down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smashing them.</v>

1583
01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.110
<v Speaker 4>And the physical power that he had was</v>
<v Speaker 4>just scares body.</v>

1584
01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:51.610
<v Speaker 4>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous.</v>

1585
01:06:51.611 --> 01:06:54.090
<v Speaker 4>And also the team he trained with AK,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was ready,</v>

1586
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.800
<v Speaker 4>he did it the right place and they gave</v>
<v Speaker 4>him the right fights.</v>

1587
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:57.730
<v Speaker 4>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1588
01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:00.170
<v Speaker 4>But if you started younger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you dove real prominent hands,</v>

1589
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:04.150
<v Speaker 4>real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you wanted to be an actual,</v>

1590
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:08.740
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting because you know when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get like elite athletes,</v>

1591
01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:13.360
<v Speaker 4>how many of them actually want to fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's the most elite athlete in the UFC?</v>

1592

1931
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:34.471
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Mike Baker,</v>

1932
01:21:34.471 --> 01:21:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I liked Mike Baker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear anything about that.</v>

1933
01:21:36.871 --> 01:21:38.550
<v Speaker 1>That's later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's towards the end.</v>

1934
01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.950
<v Speaker 1>And I was one of the last things I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to ask him in the last half hour</v>

1935
01:21:40.951 --> 01:21:42.930
<v Speaker 1>of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of youtube videos on that</v>

1936
01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.430
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ellen Mlk,</v>

1937
01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.410
<v Speaker 1>I went down that ramp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

1938
01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.330
<v Speaker 1>That being a um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1939
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.180
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1940
01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:54.090
<v Speaker 1>that's just one of the conspiracy theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most like there's the John</v>

1941
01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Lennon one too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just mlk for sure.</v>

1942
01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.730
<v Speaker 1>He was disrupting this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1943
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:04.070
<v Speaker 1>he was bringing people together in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could disrupt power masses,</v>

1944
01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:07.500
<v Speaker 1>different body types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a before and after</v>

1945
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:14.430
<v Speaker 1>went to was just a shill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one of those where they,</v>

1946
01:22:14.511 --> 01:22:18.080
<v Speaker 1>there's pictures of him and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rothschilds and the rockerfeller's were</v>

1947
01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:20.290
<v Speaker 1>hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he used to have parties and fuck</v>

1948
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:22.650
<v Speaker 1>just white girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would too if I was him.</v>

1949
01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:25.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it is when it really</v>
<v Speaker 1>counts.</v>

1950
01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:29.680
<v Speaker 1>But that conspiracy theory for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably met those people cause they</v>

1951
01:22:29.681 --> 01:22:31.140
<v Speaker 1>for sure they probably wanted to meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1952
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're either in or you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with a group like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's no one in their threaten la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's tough.</v>

1959
01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got like two dudes in the audience</v>

1961
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:57.570
<v Speaker 1>We need oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drove through.</v>

1962
01:22:57.571 --> 01:23:02.571
<v Speaker 1>Once I drove through one</v>
<v Speaker 1>big John McCarthy</v>

<v Speaker 5>huge strike.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What were you thinking when you were on</v>

1965
01:23:11.311 --> 01:23:14.220
<v Speaker 5>the ground with them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to slow everything down in</v>

1966
01:23:14.221 --> 01:23:15.630
<v Speaker 5>my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keeping me</v>

1968
01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Trying to slow everything down his mind.</v>

1969
01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:21.230
<v Speaker 5>I know going to get that big elbow in</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1970
01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:22.433
<v Speaker 5>It's just a matter of,</v>

1971
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 1>you know what a guy like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you almost wishing he got in a 10 years</v>

<v Speaker 1>heavyweight though.</v>

1974
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:35.740
<v Speaker 1>He probably when the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he can figure out a way to not get</v>

1975
01:23:35.741 --> 01:23:37.750
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1976
01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:40.990
<v Speaker 1>he's huge dry and viking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he weigh?</v>

1977
01:23:43.290 --> 01:23:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm high as fuck.</v>

1978
01:23:47.150 --> 01:23:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at two 45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should I listen to 45 I think they</v>

1979
01:23:51.621 --> 01:23:53.170
<v Speaker 1>said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to 40 something.</v>

1980
01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:54.850
<v Speaker 1>He's a big fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah Dude.</v>

1981
01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's a point of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where you're too big,</v>

1982
01:23:58.250 --> 01:24:01.130
<v Speaker 1>do you think like for some people think</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 65 is like too big,</v>

1983
01:24:01.131 --> 01:24:02.540
<v Speaker 1>too big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really to 40.</v>

1984
01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:07.541
<v Speaker 1>Look at lead all the champions bay to 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to 40 jds two 40 to 45 pens on how</v>

1985
01:24:08.391 --> 01:24:09.520
<v Speaker 1>you fade or two 30</v>

1986
01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.320
<v Speaker 3>you could be 300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you say guys,</v>

1987
01:24:14.321 --> 01:24:16.210
<v Speaker 3>you can't talk over each other to mom</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro,</v>

1988
01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:21.840
<v Speaker 3>you have to be 300 pounds and athletic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tr.</v>

1989
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.030
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

1990
01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:29.740
<v Speaker 3>as far as a Jujitsu goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bigger the guy,</v>

1991
01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:35.200
<v Speaker 3>the less training partners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the has to really get real roles and so</v>

1992
01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 3>they end up like not really training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1993
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:42.400
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why generally speaking,</v>

1994
01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:45.880
<v Speaker 3>the bigger the guy in Jiu Jitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last technique he has,</v>

1995
01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:50.260
<v Speaker 3>because he's used to roll in day after</v>
<v Speaker 3>day just using his weight and his power.</v>

1996
01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1997
01:24:52.301 --> 01:24:57.301
<v Speaker 3>But if you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you got to do this 285 pounds and</v>

1998
01:24:57.341 --> 01:25:01.720
<v Speaker 3>somehow he had like a billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>billionaire backer and he just got all</v>

1999
01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:05.920
<v Speaker 3>these big guys like every day he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>1520 big eyes.</v>

2000
01:25:05.921 --> 01:25:10.921
<v Speaker 3>The role with the old thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an example of Bouchet is a big</v>

2001
01:25:11.441 --> 01:25:16.441
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker and he super technical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super technical moves like a cat.</v>

2002
01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.420
<v Speaker 3>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

2003
01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:21.490
<v Speaker 3>it's just the bigger the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2004
01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:23.170
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Shittier the training.</v>

2005
01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.380
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to roll with the big dudes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put together a super camp.</v>

2006
01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big guys come through and they quit</v>

2007
01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu often because no one will roll</v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

2008
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:37.860
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a big reason why DC's as</v>
<v Speaker 3>good as he is in cains,</v>

2009
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:41.920
<v Speaker 3>as good as he is hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two fucking superhero smashing</v>

2010
01:25:41.921 --> 01:25:45.060
<v Speaker 3>into each other every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yes you are correct sir.</v>

2011
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told me that,</v>

2012
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:48.970
<v Speaker 3>that when Kane was healthy without</v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

2013
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.210
<v Speaker 3>baddest guy on the planet and gave all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them,</v>

2014
01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:55.380
<v Speaker 3>all of them there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a nightmare for all to dc.</v>

2015
01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Said CDC says healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2016
01:25:57.491 --> 01:25:59.860
<v Speaker 3>brother beats off of them and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>off my everything.</v>

2017
01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:00.221
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2018
01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've never seen anything like healthy</v>

2019
01:26:02.171 --> 01:26:03.850
<v Speaker 3>cane would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't fuck with them.</v>

2020
01:26:03.851 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 3>No</v>

2021
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.030
<v Speaker 2>one DC DC said to me that he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that guy was healthy,</v>

2022
01:26:08.031 --> 01:26:10.670
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really watched Kane and I trained with</v>

2023
01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Cain and I can't beat that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2024
01:26:12.921 --> 01:26:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I can't beat that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and DC was saying it just with a hundred</v>

2025
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:18.890
<v Speaker 2>percent humility and just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2026
01:26:18.891 --> 01:26:23.210
<v Speaker 2>the guy was the best meat death wish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish there was a way to find out who</v>

2027
01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:26.930
<v Speaker 2>really was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most accomplished is steep bay and</v>

2028
01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:28.840
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't get into the picture a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphin.</v>

2029
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:29.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2030
01:26:29.901 --> 01:26:33.860
<v Speaker 2>air pecos fight next fuck ass because</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Steve Pay,</v>

2031
01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Steve Pay Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did what he had to do.</v>

2032
01:26:36.261 --> 01:26:38.990
<v Speaker 2>He won the title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the guys that he fought in that time</v>

2033
01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:42.590
<v Speaker 2>period would not the best of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like he fought cain when cain</v>

2034
01:26:42.591 --> 01:26:47.591
<v Speaker 2>fought jds to like fucking fight and was</v>
<v Speaker 2>prime.</v>

2035
01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Jade jds was a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

2036
01:26:49.731 --> 01:26:52.850
<v Speaker 2>but also the argument to that to favor</v>
<v Speaker 2>and went undefeated for what,</v>

2037
01:26:52.851 --> 01:26:53.960
<v Speaker 2>seven years?</v>

2038
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:56.300
<v Speaker 2>That is a good argument Mr Pico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2039
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:58.190
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they did all the Pico,</v>

2040
01:26:58.191 --> 01:27:00.620
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything be everything and he went on</v>

2041
01:27:00.621 --> 01:27:02.420
<v Speaker 2>to feed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what fade door did,</v>

2042
01:27:02.421 --> 01:27:04.790
<v Speaker 2>but we know that they definitely let</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do things.</v>

2043
01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:06.740
<v Speaker 2>So whether or not he did anything or</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do anything,</v>

2044
01:27:06.741 --> 01:27:09.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just purely speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I leave that up to you.</v>

2045
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean I bet my life on it but not a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

2046
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.380
<v Speaker 2>But some people over there were</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely doing stuff and they were</v>

2047
01:27:15.381 --> 01:27:18.020
<v Speaker 2>encouraging all this stuff and we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that went over there where they</v>

2048
01:27:18.021 --> 01:27:22.130
<v Speaker 2>encourage these people to take stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whether he did or was undefeated for</v>

2049
01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:27.140
<v Speaker 2>stats was that take everything aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave all that co would fade or has that</v>

2050
01:27:27.651 --> 01:27:31.550
<v Speaker 2>none of them have is that motherfucker</v>
<v Speaker 2>will catch armbars off his back like a</v>

2051
01:27:31.551 --> 01:27:32.180
<v Speaker 2>lightweight.</v>

2052
01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one thing that separates him</v>

2053
01:27:33.981 --> 01:27:34.970
<v Speaker 2>from everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2054
01:27:34.971 --> 01:27:38.630
<v Speaker 2>people would throw him through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would hit the ground and five seconds</v>

2055
01:27:38.631 --> 01:27:40.530
<v Speaker 2>later he'd have you in something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also his,</v>

2056
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:43.820
<v Speaker 2>his technique was so unconventional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

2057
01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.120
<v Speaker 2>you can't train that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with his hands down at his hips and</v>

2058
01:27:47.121 --> 01:27:50.000
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's time winging punches at you.</v>

2059
01:27:50.001 --> 01:27:52.970
<v Speaker 2>He could take a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Fujita fight memory went on</v>

<v Speaker 2>rubbery legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got fucking rock.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2186
01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I want to come down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2187
01:33:43.811 --> 01:33:44.201
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2188
01:33:44.201 --> 01:33:45.034
<v Speaker 3>Come down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2189
01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:47.920
<v Speaker 3>then I just kind of like flaked on some</v>
<v Speaker 3>texts or something.</v>

2190
01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:51.910
<v Speaker 3>And then he finally just showed up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he showed up and then I looked him up</v>

2191
01:33:51.911 --> 01:33:52.960
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

2192
01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:53.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2193
01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:59.160
<v Speaker 3>So I had no idea that he's been working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2194
01:33:59.670 --> 01:34:03.910
<v Speaker 3>to on being the ultimate like version</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2195
01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:07.810
<v Speaker 3>he's our little brown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like strategically as a fighter.</v>

2196
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 3>Got Chocolate Dell like chuck the bell</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his prime.</v>

2197
01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:15.010
<v Speaker 3>He wrestled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's very hard to take them down in</v>

2198
01:34:15.011 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 3>there and if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hard to keep them down and that's</v>

2199
01:34:17.381 --> 01:34:19.930
<v Speaker 3>what he uses wrestling for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But chocolate Dell was going to come out</v>

2200
01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 3>and take heads off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea.</v>

2201
01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:27.100
<v Speaker 3>That's what Aaron Picos strategy was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I heard about them,</v>

2202
01:34:27.101 --> 01:34:29.980
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pulled him to the side and I told him,</v>

2203
01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:30.963
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2204
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.350
<v Speaker 3>don't listen to anybody trying to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>you that you can be like the best</v>

2205
01:34:35.351 --> 01:34:37.270
<v Speaker 3>striker in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not people out.</v>

2206
01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:41.260
<v Speaker 3>This is what I was telling him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea that he was trying to be</v>

2207
01:34:41.261 --> 01:34:43.600
<v Speaker 3>chucked without.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I knew was that he was a stud</v>

2208
01:34:43.601 --> 01:34:44.880
<v Speaker 3>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like on,</v>

2209
01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:48.670
<v Speaker 3>this is the best advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was on my deathbed,</v>

2210
01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:53.080
<v Speaker 3>this is what I would tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say fucking wrestle.</v>

2211
01:34:53.530 --> 01:34:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Take dudes down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pass the guard,</v>

2212
01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:58.460
<v Speaker 3>mount them them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>choke them.</v>

2213
01:34:58.790 --> 01:35:03.530
<v Speaker 3>That should be your number one strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're such an amazing wrestler.</v>

2214
01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.320
<v Speaker 3>Don't let anybody cause be sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to me.</v>

2215
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is he talking about?</v>

2216
01:35:09.201 --> 01:35:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm going to do the opposite of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying.</v>

2217
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:13.850
<v Speaker 3>But he didn't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't say anything.</v>

2218
01:35:13.851 --> 01:35:17.990
<v Speaker 3>So I kept reminding him this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time he gets high,</v>

2219
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:22.370
<v Speaker 3>he was just wanting to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu was a nice case he ever got</v>

2220
01:35:22.371 --> 01:35:24.020
<v Speaker 3>taken down and it ended up on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

2221
01:35:24.230 --> 01:35:29.060
<v Speaker 3>He had no intentions of using his</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling to take people down and win</v>

2222
01:35:29.061 --> 01:35:31.670
<v Speaker 3>the fight on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know what to but every time</v>

2223
01:35:31.671 --> 01:35:35.120
<v Speaker 3>and remind him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying the same shit over and over.</v>

2224
01:35:35.150 --> 01:35:37.100
<v Speaker 3>You know the guys he trains with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say them,</v>

2225
01:35:37.101 --> 01:35:39.170
<v Speaker 3>I fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the guys who trained with the</v>

2226
01:35:39.171 --> 01:35:42.080
<v Speaker 3>best of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does not lose the last town.</v>

2227
01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.210
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you know,</v>

2228
01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:48.230
<v Speaker 3>then he fought his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his first fight he got caught with an</v>

2229
01:35:48.231 --> 01:35:51.340
<v Speaker 3>upper cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got staggered and then he got</v>

2230
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:53.820
<v Speaker 3>guillotine correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He bought a bigger guy first.</v>

2231
01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:58.700
<v Speaker 3>You can toot youtube wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 3>international guys like from Turkey,</v>

2232
01:35:58.701 --> 01:36:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever when he was 16 but my church,</v>

2233
01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.890
<v Speaker 3>check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll tell you the story.</v>

2234
01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:06.230
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just finish this story.</v>

2235
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:12.070
<v Speaker 3>So even up to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right after that loss,</v>

2236
01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:18.110
<v Speaker 3>I still didn't know that was his</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate strategy.</v>

2237
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:21.650
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So after that fight,</v>

2238
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:23.750
<v Speaker 3>what I said was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2239
01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.850
<v Speaker 3>it was almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told him,</v>

2240
01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:31.370
<v Speaker 3>let's turn your ass into that Khabib,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that GSP,</v>

2241
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:36.260
<v Speaker 3>that unstoppable take down machine where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you smashed when the fuckers on the</v>

2242
01:36:36.261 --> 01:36:39.020
<v Speaker 3>ground and you fucking choke them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do this shit.</v>

2243
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:42.620
<v Speaker 3>This was after that first loss and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hear from him after that.</v>

2244
01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:44.300
<v Speaker 3>I was over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was done.</v>

2245
01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:47.600
<v Speaker 3>So I guess this cat first kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when he got clipped and he got</v>

2246
01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:50.780
<v Speaker 3>hurt and he got submitted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have you for me,</v>

2247
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I was like say we should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should have,</v>

2248
01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.610
<v Speaker 3>you should have just washed all his</v>
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>

2249
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:55.723
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2250
01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:58.520
<v Speaker 3>Smile issue with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause because he trains with a</v>

2251
01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:01.220
<v Speaker 3>worldclass guys and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't ever lose rounds.</v>

2252
01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:02.510
<v Speaker 3>He's so company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2253
01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:04.910
<v Speaker 3>dude this isn't Tj dillashaw this isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>

2254
01:37:04.911 --> 01:37:06.260
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna smoke this guy.</v>

2255
01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:10.550
<v Speaker 3>So his respect isn't there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he just comes in cause he's knocked</v>

2256
01:37:10.551 --> 01:37:13.610
<v Speaker 3>down Miguel cotto so he comes in and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>got clipped him.</v>

2257
01:37:13.611 --> 01:37:15.790
<v Speaker 3>He just doesn't give us funding sources</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2258
01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Before I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just finish this.</v>

2259
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:22.760
<v Speaker 3>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I realized that I was giving him</v>

2260
01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:26.270
<v Speaker 3>advice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the complete opposite of this</v>

2261
01:37:26.271 --> 01:37:28.430
<v Speaker 3>whole training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all his coaches,</v>

2262
01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.780
<v Speaker 3>all his coaches were wanting to use the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling to keep the fight standing so</v>

2263
01:37:32.781 --> 01:37:34.250
<v Speaker 3>he could use his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a striking,</v>

2264
01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.870
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2265
01:37:36.330 --> 01:37:38.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I then I finally realized that then he</v>

2266
01:37:38.901 --> 01:37:42.590
<v Speaker 3>went his own way and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took me a couple,</v>

2267
01:37:42.650 --> 01:37:46.190
<v Speaker 3>two or three fights to realize the dam</v>
<v Speaker 3>never write shit.</v>

2268
01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.640
<v Speaker 3>This motherfucker can let me get too</v>
<v Speaker 3>excited.</v>

2269
01:37:50.630 --> 01:37:54.350
<v Speaker 3>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this mucky son that he's finding</v>

2270
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:55.651
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2271
01:37:55.651 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 3>this is</v>

2272
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.420
<v Speaker 2>the top featherweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2273
01:37:57.421 --> 01:37:58.000
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

2274
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.450
<v Speaker 2>When this want to get a title shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys understand what I'm saying?</v>

2275
01:38:00.451 --> 01:38:03.210
<v Speaker 2>I understand now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First some guys,</v>

2276
01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:03.720
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

2277
01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.330
<v Speaker 2>now at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to make this clear now at</v>

2278
01:38:06.331 --> 01:38:09.360
<v Speaker 2>this point I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn Holy Shit,</v>

2279
01:38:09.361 --> 01:38:12.120
<v Speaker 2>they did have the right strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is an amazing striker.</v>

2280
01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I just went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just going by,</v>

2281
01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:16.650
<v Speaker 2>that's your thing like no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2282
01:38:16.651 --> 01:38:18.390
<v Speaker 2>just like the odds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the odds?</v>

2283
01:38:18.391 --> 01:38:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2284
01:38:18.930 --> 01:38:21.600
<v Speaker 2>we already know you're one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers in the game.</v>

2285
01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:24.030
<v Speaker 2>We already know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stick to that,</v>

2286
01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:25.470
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

2287
01:38:25.471 --> 01:38:28.620
<v Speaker 2>That is striking is extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tough fight for him.</v>

2288
01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:32.700
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you say headed cross is a very</v>

2289
01:38:32.701 --> 01:38:34.320
<v Speaker 2>good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is tough site by far,</v>

2290
01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.330
<v Speaker 2>but like I was talking to the belt</v>
<v Speaker 2>toward guys today,</v>

2291
01:38:36.331 --> 01:38:39.480
<v Speaker 2>the insiders that like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't expect them to smoke them the</v>

2292
01:38:39.481 --> 01:38:40.650
<v Speaker 2>first round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I always think,</v>

2293
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I think he finished them under four</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes but like,</v>

2294
01:38:42.690 --> 01:38:42.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2295
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:43.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2296
01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:46.380
<v Speaker 2>This is a tough one I find that I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>is critical for a young fighter that's</v>

2297
01:38:46.381 --> 01:38:48.840
<v Speaker 2>coming up is to not rely on any one</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2298
01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about a guy who</v>

2299
01:38:51.241 --> 01:38:54.210
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have to rely on any one thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about Aaron Peko,</v>

2300
01:38:54.211 --> 01:38:57.030
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a legit worldclass</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler,</v>

2301
01:38:57.270 --> 01:39:02.270
<v Speaker 2>but if people know that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand and they know that you,</v>

2302
01:39:02.410 --> 01:39:03.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you're one of the best</v>

2303
01:39:03.721 --> 01:39:05.610
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to threaten them with</v>

2304
01:39:05.611 --> 01:39:08.160
<v Speaker 2>the take down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That becomes an issue because there's</v>

2305
01:39:08.161 --> 01:39:11.400
<v Speaker 2>certain guys like gas on Bolanos or</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain,</v>

2306
01:39:11.401 --> 01:39:14.790
<v Speaker 2>there's certain boxers are strikers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got some nasty shit for your ass</v>

2307
01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:15.690
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2308
01:39:15.690 --> 01:39:17.940
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they know for a fact you're not going</v>

2309
01:39:17.941 --> 01:39:20.430
<v Speaker 2>to take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're standing up with Paul Daley,</v>

2310
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.310
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he knows for a fact you're not going</v>

2311
01:39:23.311 --> 01:39:23.880
<v Speaker 2>to take him down.</v>

2312
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.950
<v Speaker 2>He's going to launch a left hook from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon.</v>

2313
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:27.550
<v Speaker 2>He's going to hit you on your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

2314
01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:34.650
<v Speaker 2>but let me probably their plan B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plan b would be gone would be,</v>

2315
01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.500
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to be good on the</v>

2316
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:37.570
<v Speaker 2>fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please let me finish.</v>

2317
01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:42.630
<v Speaker 2>The most important thing if you can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things is that the other guy</v>

2318
01:39:42.631 --> 01:39:45.840
<v Speaker 2>has to not know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was George Saint Pierre as greatest</v>

2319
01:39:45.841 --> 01:39:46.591
<v Speaker 2>trends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2320
01:39:46.591 --> 01:39:49.890
<v Speaker 2>He never knew when he was punching you</v>
<v Speaker 2>or he's taking you down and you were</v>

2321
01:39:49.891 --> 01:39:52.530
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were always behind Koscheck fundings</v>

2322
01:39:52.590 --> 01:39:53.790
<v Speaker 2>jab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>double it.</v>

2323
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:57.270
<v Speaker 2>So fucking good at that here and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's not the best wrestler and he's</v>

2324
01:39:57.271 --> 01:40:00.600
<v Speaker 2>not the best striker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was the best at figuring out how</v>

2325
01:40:00.601 --> 01:40:02.730
<v Speaker 2>to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know what was coming next.</v>

2326
01:40:02.731 --> 01:40:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Where are you rolling loaded for Rasa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hobby and him or a phenomenal</v>

2327
01:40:06.421 --> 01:40:10.260
<v Speaker 2>combination cause for Ross is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually so smart and he's</v>

2328
01:40:10.261 --> 01:40:11.310
<v Speaker 2>thinking rationally.</v>

2329
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:12.600
<v Speaker 2>He's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go in there and you're</v>

2330
01:40:12.601 --> 01:40:14.110
<v Speaker 2>gonna fuck him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that.</v>

2331
01:40:14.130 --> 01:40:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Some of the problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about overloading his mind.</v>

2332
01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:20.040
<v Speaker 2>It was all very rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very technique based,</v>

2333
01:40:20.041 --> 01:40:23.280
<v Speaker 2>very psychology based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reason that meant what made that</v>

2334
01:40:23.281 --> 01:40:25.860
<v Speaker 2>GSP so good also is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2335
01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:26.790
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2336
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:29.310
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know what he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was facing that high level</v>

2337
01:40:29.311 --> 01:40:31.140
<v Speaker 2>competition construct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hughes,</v>

2338
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Pico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these guys,</v>

2339
01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:34.321
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2340
01:40:34.321 --> 01:40:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to use my rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and knock them out of the bottom.</v>

2341
01:40:36.051 --> 01:40:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Shot this guy with him and crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to see the best version of</v>

2342
01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:42.060
<v Speaker 2>in Pico cause he can't just sit there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fucking box with them.</v>

2343
01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:44.490
<v Speaker 2>You can see his wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you're gonna see some different,</v>

2344
01:40:44.491 --> 01:40:45.200
<v Speaker 2>mix it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have,</v>

2345
01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.070
<v Speaker 2>because he's never been pushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's dominate to you.</v>

2346
01:40:47.071 --> 01:40:52.071
<v Speaker 2>Remember what John Danner told us the</v>
<v Speaker 2>secret to GSPS do you remember was that</v>

2347
01:40:52.590 --> 01:40:54.940
<v Speaker 2>when we're eating at that restaurant in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head hair,</v>

2348
01:40:54.970 --> 01:40:55.320
<v Speaker 2>John did.</v>

2349
01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.710
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2350
01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:01.180
<v Speaker 2>the secret to his success is it's super</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple.</v>

2351
01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:06.660
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna either faint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's either going to faint jab or he's</v>

2352
01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:11.890
<v Speaker 2>going to actually really jab you or</v>
<v Speaker 2>faint takedown or actually take take you</v>

2353
01:41:11.891 --> 01:41:13.600
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was always a faint before</v>

2354
01:41:13.601 --> 01:41:14.860
<v Speaker 2>everything he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>

2355
01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:18.460
<v Speaker 2>he's always so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never know when that shot's coming.</v>

2356
01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:22.650
<v Speaker 2>Sharma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Pico GSP was the whole thing for asa</v>

2357
01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:24.510
<v Speaker 2>hobbies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so they're,</v>

2358
01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:28.510
<v Speaker 2>the two of them together worked so well</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they both have a great check of</v>

2359
01:41:28.511 --> 01:41:31.630
<v Speaker 2>their ego and an understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences and you rarely do right</v>

2360
01:41:31.631 --> 01:41:35.680
<v Speaker 2>hand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both really,</v>

2361
01:41:35.681 --> 01:41:37.790
<v Speaker 2>really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Told me cause he's trying with them all</v>

2362
01:41:37.791 --> 01:41:39.640
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said that he's an amazing chess player.</v>

2363
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George.</v>

2364
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:45.250
<v Speaker 2>So George is an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's really strategic and I feel like</v>

2365
01:41:45.251 --> 01:41:49.150
<v Speaker 2>he could always find</v>
<v Speaker 2>empty where,</v>

2366
01:41:49.151 --> 01:41:49.720
<v Speaker 2>where are you?</v>

2367
01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Where are you had a weakness near them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where he was.</v>

2368
01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Well he was super open minded to men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they need like learn back kicked</v>

2369
01:41:57.971 --> 01:42:00.670
<v Speaker 2>from you are like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he just fed Eddie's place.</v>

2370
01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I felt so embarrassed that I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2371
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like it was ridiculous that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show him anything.</v>

2372
01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's video on youtube of Joe Rogan,</v>

2373
01:42:12.630 --> 01:42:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Gsp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what,</v>

2374
01:42:15.450 --> 01:42:20.450
<v Speaker 2>fucking kicking lesson your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I wouldn't ever have tried to</v>

2375
01:42:21.701 --> 01:42:23.860
<v Speaker 2>sell it to him if I didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2376
01:42:23.861 --> 01:42:26.590
<v Speaker 2>But when that came out of that same</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting with dawn her when we were in</v>

2377
01:42:26.591 --> 01:42:29.050
<v Speaker 2>the restaurant donaher set it up cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

2378
01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he told me afterwards that he set me</v>

2379
01:42:31.271 --> 01:42:32.830
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kinda had heard.</v>

2380
01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:35.380
<v Speaker 2>So He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for someone to teach gsp how</v>

2381
01:42:35.381 --> 01:42:36.830
<v Speaker 2>to throw a tuning sidekick.</v>

2382
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:39.700
<v Speaker 2>His technique is off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're going to fucking James</v>

2383
01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Bond movie or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny with his accent.</v>

2384
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:46.570
<v Speaker 2>So Carlos is 10 years older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's no Parkinson.</v>

2385
01:42:46.610 --> 01:42:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough fight for Pico,</v>

2386
01:42:49.170 --> 01:42:54.100
<v Speaker 2>but we still thinks pico gets it done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's all about where's Pico at right</v>

2387
01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:55.810
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about where's he at right now</v>

2388
01:42:55.811 --> 01:42:57.490
<v Speaker 2>because one day he's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbeatable,</v>

2389
01:42:57.850 --> 01:42:58.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>up this intensity and he keep up this</v>

2392
01:43:06.401 --> 01:43:08.740
<v Speaker 2>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be a world champion.</v>

2393
01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:11.470
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that they could stop them</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a grave injury,</v>

2394
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:16.950
<v Speaker 2>a grave injury or some sort of a mistake</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his thinking where he starts taking</v>

2395
01:43:17.231 --> 01:43:20.780
<v Speaker 2>things for granted or find some won't.</v>

01:46:26.931 --> 01:46:28.340
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>your deathbed confessional.</v>

2466
01:46:37.401 --> 01:46:39.980
<v Speaker 4>You're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could have taken him down.</v>

2467
01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.770
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to stop Aaron Peko from</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking the cup.</v>

2468
01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:44.990
<v Speaker 4>He could beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing,</v>

2469
01:46:44.991 --> 01:46:47.120
<v Speaker 4>why not to do too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing.</v>

2470
01:46:47.150 --> 01:46:49.590
<v Speaker 4>You can do all things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do all things,</v>

2471
01:46:49.591 --> 01:46:50.280
<v Speaker 4>but if you're standing</v>

2472
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.220
<v Speaker 2>in front of a guy all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get that guy hurt the way he got</v>

2473
01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:54.180
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart deck,</v>

2474
01:46:54.181 --> 01:46:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your objective,</v>

2475
01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:56.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to be Monday,</v>

2476
01:46:56.971 --> 01:46:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Monday morning quarterback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2477
01:46:58.590 --> 01:47:02.070
<v Speaker 2>But objective looking at right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say take him down,</v>

2478
01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:04.420
<v Speaker 2>take him down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smash them up,</v>

2479
01:47:05.110 --> 01:47:07.740
<v Speaker 2>and then you take no damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no chances.</v>

2480
01:47:07.890 --> 01:47:11.400
<v Speaker 2>It's all variables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about mitigating variables.</v>

2481
01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 2>You close all the variables down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you take God down a mountain and</v>

2482
01:47:14.611 --> 01:47:17.250
<v Speaker 2>start dropping elbows on his head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you close all the variables.</v>

2483
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:20.580
<v Speaker 2>If you can maintain the mount position</v>
<v Speaker 2>and keep trenching and you already know</v>

2484
01:47:20.581 --> 01:47:23.070
<v Speaker 2>he's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all it's about of whether he's</v>

2485
01:47:23.071 --> 01:47:25.080
<v Speaker 2>going to tap the strikes or you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get a choke.</v>

2486
01:47:25.110 --> 01:47:27.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't like seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a bummer.</v>

2487
01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:29.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bummer,</v>

2488
01:47:29.191 --> 01:47:30.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's also not a bumper for Corolla.</v>

2489
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:35.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like this game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's heartbreak and everybody needs to</v>

2490
01:47:35.971 --> 01:47:38.070
<v Speaker 2>see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young guys coming up need to see that as</v>

2491
01:47:38.071 --> 01:47:40.140
<v Speaker 2>good as you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to understand the mind.</v>

2492
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:45.000
<v Speaker 2>You can't let yourself get sucked into</v>
<v Speaker 2>this path for glory where you're wild</v>

2493
01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:48.960
<v Speaker 2>and reckless and you're not keeping your</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands up and you're not respecting the</v>

2494
01:47:48.961 --> 01:47:51.330
<v Speaker 2>power of the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you have the technique</v>

2495
01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:54.420
<v Speaker 2>though there's no reason to play that</v>
<v Speaker 2>game state that he may think he's a</v>

2496
01:47:54.421 --> 01:47:57.210
<v Speaker 2>fucking killer man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had the guy heard him and then just</v>

2497
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:58.920
<v Speaker 2>all blood and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

2498
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:03.980
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just came in and he's 22 and he</v>

2499
01:48:04.051 --> 01:48:06.390
<v Speaker 2>thought he could just smash that guy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hurts you.</v>

2500
01:48:06.391 --> 01:48:09.050
<v Speaker 2>It looked like he was going to think he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going and he probably would have if</v>

2501
01:48:09.051 --> 01:48:10.670
<v Speaker 2>he fought technical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

2502
01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:15.760
<v Speaker 2>he abandoned ship experience is he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>caught on a clench and this kid had him</v>

2503
01:48:16.051 --> 01:48:18.970
<v Speaker 2>here and he was hitting him with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom to the body twice and cross and</v>

2504
01:48:18.971 --> 01:48:21.060
<v Speaker 2>he clipped him on the chin with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect punch.</v>

2505
01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Perfect right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean his neck snapped,</v>

2506
01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:26.580
<v Speaker 2>his fucking head spun around and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

2507
01:48:26.581 --> 01:48:29.670
<v Speaker 2>He was out cold before he went down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way down he clipped him two more</v>

2508
01:48:29.671 --> 01:48:30.960
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One more time.</v>

2509
01:48:30.961 --> 01:48:32.750
<v Speaker 2>When he was down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta buy a duplex.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not going to go more</v>

2515
01:48:49.531 --> 01:48:50.490
<v Speaker 2>than one round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He has a filling in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>things due to enter peaker.</v>

2522
01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:08.340

<v Speaker 2>even what happened because he still</v>

2523
01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:10.590
<v Speaker 2>thinks he's going to be world champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still think you'll figure it out.</v>

2524
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:15.120
<v Speaker 2>He certainly could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything can happen.</v>

2525
01:49:15.150 --> 01:49:19.170
<v Speaker 2>He has all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just needs to fucking fight you.</v>

2526
01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Gotta fight technically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always.</v>

2527
01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:23.310
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's moments where you have to open</v>

2528
01:49:23.311 --> 01:49:25.770
<v Speaker 2>yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the guys who do it correctly,</v>

2529
01:49:26.130 --> 01:49:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna give you a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>style bender,</v>

2530
01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:31.120
<v Speaker 2>that motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he gets you heard he,</v>

2531
01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:34.050
<v Speaker 2>he goes after you correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does that run a Shin,</v>

2532
01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:39.290
<v Speaker 2>keeps control him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Defense a fucking push them down.</v>

2533
01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was good.</v>

2534
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:45.180
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to pass since there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>way you're going to get knocked out from</v>

2535
01:49:45.181 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 2>the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can knock a guy out from the mouth,</v>

2536
01:49:48.011 --> 01:49:52.090
<v Speaker 2>but he cannot even talk about great all</v>
<v Speaker 2>time mma strikers.</v>

2537
01:49:52.090 --> 01:49:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva,</v>

2538
01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.440
<v Speaker 2>when he would hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would take his time.</v>

2539
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.080
<v Speaker 2>He would take his time and he would stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>focused.</v>

2540
01:49:59.081 --> 01:50:01.840
<v Speaker 2>And if he knew you were fucked up and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew he could just walk in and smash</v>

2541
01:50:01.841 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he would take advantage of that.</v>

2542
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Let's see this and watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2543
01:50:04.511 --> 01:50:08.080
<v Speaker 2>so now he opera ca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect upper cut.</v>

2544
01:50:08.290 --> 01:50:11.330
<v Speaker 2>He gets the guy hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>falls back and,</v>

2545
01:50:11.331 --> 01:50:14.670
<v Speaker 2>but look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moves towards him like,</v>

2546
01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:17.860
<v Speaker 2>like he can't hit him like he's can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt them and look at him.</v>

2547
01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:21.490
<v Speaker 2>He just stays in that clinch and Pecos</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there when the right hand hits,</v>

2548
01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:23.830
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see cause he stood right in front of</v>

2549
01:50:23.831 --> 01:50:26.050
<v Speaker 2>the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He even when he was getting hit with</v>

2550
01:50:26.051 --> 01:50:27.310
<v Speaker 2>shots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never adjusted.</v>

2551
01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:31.000
<v Speaker 2>He just was bullying his way forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See He's bullying is way forward.</v>

2552
01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got clipped and the guy who launched</v>

2553
01:50:33.521 --> 01:50:37.390
<v Speaker 2>a perfect right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my thing is pico really shouldn't be</v>

2554
01:50:37.391 --> 01:50:40.000
<v Speaker 2>standing in front of them right here</v>
<v Speaker 2>flipping a coin.</v>

2555
01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because maybe it's heads,</v>

2556
01:50:41.651 --> 01:50:46.020
<v Speaker 2>maybe its tail straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>upstairs to to the body and what</v>

2557
01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:48.970
<v Speaker 2>upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my thing is if you're Aaron Peko one</v>

2558
01:50:48.971 --> 01:50:52.300
<v Speaker 2>of the best wrestlers to ever do mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you shoot right there?</v>

2559
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:55.420
<v Speaker 2>You've got that guy in a position where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's thrown wild shots that he wants to</v>

2560
01:50:55.421 --> 01:50:57.730
<v Speaker 2>knock out that gsps looking for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>dunk under,</v>

2561
01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:58.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:00.860
<v Speaker 2>GSP is going to duck under shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take you down and then you fuck.</v>

2563
01:51:00.861 --> 01:51:02.260
<v Speaker 2>He's going to beat you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you stand back up,</v>

2564
01:51:02.261 --> 01:51:03.790
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be bewildered and</v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausted.</v>

2565
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:06.430
<v Speaker 2>He's going to hit you again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a young guy,</v>

2566
01:51:06.431 --> 01:51:08.740
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a young guy with flying phenomenal</v>

2567
01:51:08.741 --> 01:51:11.020
<v Speaker 2>talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is a lesson.</v>

2568
01:51:11.650 --> 01:51:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Take Ego and take your personality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>take your personal identity out of this</v>

2569
01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:20.590
<v Speaker 2>and look at this as this is these little</v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces that are moving around a on a</v>

2570
01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:24.280
<v Speaker 2>board and these pieces have properties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have values and they have,</v>

2571
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:26.170
<v Speaker 2>they have powers and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses.</v>

2572
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:29.530
<v Speaker 2>And if you watch these pieces play out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're looking at a mathematical</v>

2573
01:51:29.531 --> 01:51:31.540
<v Speaker 2>algorithm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize when there's flaw,</v>

2574
01:51:31.630 --> 01:51:34.300
<v Speaker 2>when can it go wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's when it could go wrong.</v>

2575
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:36.160
<v Speaker 2>We stand in front of each other and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

2576
01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:37.550
<v Speaker 2>It can go wrong for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2577
01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that's ever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go con.</v>

2578
01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Saki got knocked out by a Kaleel</v>
<v Speaker 2>roundtree with a perfect left hand,</v>

2579
01:51:42.761 --> 01:51:43.361
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go Con.</v>

2580
01:51:43.361 --> 01:51:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Slack is one of the greatest kickboxers</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all time.</v>

2581
01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:46.720
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean Cleo was not a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

2582
01:51:46.721 --> 01:51:49.090
<v Speaker 2>He's been very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high level fighter.</v>

2583
01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.640
<v Speaker 2>It's just anybody can get caught if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're standing in front of city hall</v>

2584
01:51:51.641 --> 01:51:54.250
<v Speaker 2>can only take so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with those little gloves.</v>

2585
01:51:55.060 --> 01:52:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Think about all the fighters in MMA</v>
<v Speaker 2>history that have been known to have</v>

2586
01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:05.950
<v Speaker 2>rock solid Chin's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them have one thing in common for</v>

2587
01:52:05.951 --> 01:52:07.540
<v Speaker 2>a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I never got hurt.</v>

2588
01:52:07.630 --> 01:52:09.310
<v Speaker 2>They never got rocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2589
01:52:09.311 --> 01:52:10.330
<v Speaker 2>For Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Dan,</v>

2590
01:52:10.331 --> 01:52:12.610
<v Speaker 2>he's got a great chin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

2591
01:52:12.611 --> 01:52:14.440
<v Speaker 2>He's never been rocked and he's been hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>solid.</v>

2592
01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know that guy has a solid shin.</v>

2593
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:23.360
<v Speaker 2>It's probably going to fall apart later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only get so many of those know</v>

2594
01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.090
<v Speaker 2>already with Pico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got rocked in his first fight and</v>

2595
01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.420
<v Speaker 2>this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got rocked.</v>

2596
01:52:28.421 --> 01:52:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys fight.</v>

2597
01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.610
<v Speaker 2>He got flour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know now,</v>

2598
01:52:30.611 --> 01:52:33.520
<v Speaker 2>so we know now that damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know he's not,</v>

2599
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:37.090
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to be known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's more to have the ultimate Chin for</v>

2600
01:52:37.091 --> 01:52:39.040
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was hurt already.</v>

2601
01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:41.830
<v Speaker 2>I think it was hurt and even though he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving in for the kill,</v>

2602
01:52:41.831 --> 01:52:46.831
<v Speaker 2>I think he'd been tagged a few times in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mix there and Pico.</v>

2603
01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:47.841
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2604
01:52:47.841 --> 01:52:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was punches that landed and maybe</v>

2605
01:52:50.391 --> 01:52:53.360
<v Speaker 2>they didn't take him out and maybe they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even make them buckle.</v>

2606
01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.160
<v Speaker 2>But all those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get clipped,</v>

2607
01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:58.190
<v Speaker 2>have you ever walked into a door and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't know you walked in the door</v>

2608
01:52:58.191 --> 01:52:59.900
<v Speaker 2>and you can just keep walking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your head's like,</v>

2609
01:52:59.901 --> 01:53:02.210
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine if you're in the middle of a</v>

2610
01:53:02.211 --> 01:53:04.380
<v Speaker 2>fight with the earphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just bumped in your head.</v>

2611
01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:07.910
<v Speaker 2>The things shoved right into my ear lobe</v>
<v Speaker 2>or my,</v>

2612
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2613
01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:11.090
<v Speaker 2>like a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2614
01:53:11.210 --> 01:53:14.930
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get that many Kaos that early in</v>

2615
01:53:14.931 --> 01:53:16.580
<v Speaker 2>your career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good sign.</v>

2616
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2617
01:53:17.931 --> 01:53:20.780
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe so as hard as fuck too.</v>

2618
01:53:20.781 --> 01:53:22.560
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't help either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boxing,</v>

2619
01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:25.100
<v Speaker 2>sparring gets Codo at his age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>

2620
01:53:25.130 --> 01:53:25.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2621
01:53:25.701 --> 01:53:27.410
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things are luck.</v>

2622
01:53:27.411 --> 01:53:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Cumulus for Pico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such an amazing wrestler that he</v>

2623
01:53:32.151 --> 01:53:34.280
<v Speaker 2>can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has the choice to go,</v>

2624
01:53:34.281 --> 01:53:38.580
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could go to go to my next fight and</v>

2625
01:53:38.581 --> 01:53:40.760
<v Speaker 2>the next fight after that and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2626
01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:42.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade fucking blows.</v>

2627
01:53:42.710 --> 01:53:45.350
<v Speaker 2>And it's like Russian roulette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do that.</v>

2628
01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:47.990
<v Speaker 2>You can keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could just play it safe and go,</v>

2629
01:53:47.991 --> 01:53:50.330
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to use my wrestling to take</v>

2630
01:53:50.331 --> 01:53:53.150
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain his ass and could be these</v>

2631
01:53:53.151 --> 01:53:55.410
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this rule or by Brian.</v>

2632
01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:57.080
<v Speaker 2>One round dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One route.</v>

2633
01:53:57.081 --> 01:53:58.210
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your birthday.</v>

2634
01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:01.520
<v Speaker 2>One and maybe 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'd be safe for 10 more minutes.</v>

2635
01:54:01.521 --> 01:54:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you tell them you're the life of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>party when you get there anyway,</v>

2636
01:54:05.961 --> 01:54:07.880
<v Speaker 2>this part is going to go on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

2637
01:54:07.881 --> 01:54:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Most of the cool there yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2638
01:54:10.011 --> 01:54:12.740
<v Speaker 2>The main stars on fade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2639
01:54:12.741 --> 01:54:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his last fight?</v>

2640
01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:15.740
<v Speaker 2>The last fight ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fighting.</v>

2641
01:54:15.790 --> 01:54:16.521
<v Speaker 2>Writing better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2642
01:54:16.521 --> 01:54:17.740
<v Speaker 2>you gotta stay dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

2643
01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.700
<v Speaker 2>We love you man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happy Birthday.</v>

2644
01:54:19.710 --> 01:54:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Happy Birthday Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happy Birthday.</v>

2645
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:25.510
<v Speaker 2>52 hong kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the Haiti.</v>

2646
01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Two more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

2647
01:54:26.451 --> 01:54:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I think what you just said is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

2648
01:54:28.630 --> 01:54:31.820
<v Speaker 2>We said it's very important and this was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really interesting thing that has two</v>

2649
01:54:31.821 --> 01:54:33.860
<v Speaker 2>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep doing what you're doing or go</v>

2650
01:54:33.861 --> 01:54:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Khabib style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is really interesting.</v>

2651
01:54:35.571 --> 01:54:36.740
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What just happened?</v>

2652
01:54:36.741 --> 01:54:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's three choices.</v>

2653
01:54:37.641 --> 01:54:40.100
<v Speaker 2>One is mixed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them up like GSP.</v>

2654
01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:43.070
<v Speaker 2>The thing about GSP that's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting is it wasn't just Khabib</v>

2655
01:54:43.071 --> 01:54:44.870
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was who knows what's going to happen,</v>

2656
01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:46.250
<v Speaker 2>who knows if he's jabbing.</v>

2657
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:51.680
<v Speaker 2>The reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only reason he was striking is cause</v>

2658
01:54:51.681 --> 01:54:54.440
<v Speaker 2>you just can't go in there at the bell</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take a guy down.</v>

2659
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:58.520
<v Speaker 2>You got to set it all up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always just setting it all up.</v>

2660
01:54:58.521 --> 01:55:00.500
<v Speaker 2>He was throwing jabs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>setting shit up.</v>

2661
01:55:00.501 --> 01:55:05.501
<v Speaker 2>But the number one mission in his mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>was to take his opponent down and play</v>

2662
01:55:05.691 --> 01:55:10.691
<v Speaker 2>it safe and mount him and pound them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you find the guy that you could take</v>

2663
01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:14.480
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't the blueprint with Josh</v>
<v Speaker 2>Koscheck.</v>

2664
01:55:14.481 --> 01:55:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was a blueprint with Johny</v>

2665
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Hendricks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2666
01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Josh Koscheck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he jabbed the shit out of them.</v>

2667
01:55:19.330 --> 01:55:24.230
<v Speaker 2>I take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody tries to take every fucking</v>

2668
01:55:24.231 --> 01:55:25.610
<v Speaker 2>body down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>GSP,</v>

2669
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:29.240
<v Speaker 2>he didn't take his exam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because he didn't try.</v>

2670
01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:32.810
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to take down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tried a few times,</v>

2671
01:55:32.811 --> 01:55:35.870
<v Speaker 2>but he wasn't success to Josh Koscheck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The game plan was literally to get them</v>

2672
01:55:35.871 --> 01:55:37.130
<v Speaker 2>to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your number logo.</v>

2673
01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:42.400
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he was holding on to 99%</v>
<v Speaker 2>GSPS fights are designed to take the</v>

2674
01:55:43.441 --> 01:55:44.274
<v Speaker 2>fight to the ground.</v>

2675
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:46.080
<v Speaker 1>They got real boring to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest,</v>

2676
01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:49.820
<v Speaker 1>fellows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intelligent way.</v>

2677
01:55:51.150 --> 01:55:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's not intelligent as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as entertainment.</v>

2678
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:59.340
<v Speaker 1>When he's saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was fun.</v>

2679
01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:04.400
<v Speaker 1>He'll blow up a paper view for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you look great.</v>

2680
01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hands in La Right now.</v>

2681
01:56:06.901 --> 01:56:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Training with Freddy isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said he's real thin to looking at a</v>

2682
01:56:09.931 --> 01:56:11.520
<v Speaker 1>55 fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2683
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:16.290
<v Speaker 1>And even though even though it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does stand a lot and and play on his</v>

2684
01:56:16.291 --> 01:56:17.670
<v Speaker 1>feet a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

2685
01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:20.210
<v Speaker 1>his main objective is to take them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top and down.</v>

2686
01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:22.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's number one.</v>

2687
01:56:23.050 --> 01:56:25.650
<v Speaker 1>But don't fuck around and throw some</v>
<v Speaker 1>strikes.</v>

2688
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Why are they still talking about a floyd</v>
<v Speaker 1>mayweather fight?</v>

2689
01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:30.930
<v Speaker 1>It's embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck they're doing</v>

2690
01:56:30.931 --> 01:56:32.550
<v Speaker 1>is just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he goes,</v>

2691
01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I like three fights left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's up to me,</v>

2692
01:56:34.890 --> 01:56:39.510
<v Speaker 1>it's Tony Gsp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>GSP and floyd mayweather.</v>

2693
01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.960
<v Speaker 1>When I hear that I want to throw up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think?</v>

2694
01:56:42.961 --> 01:56:45.510
<v Speaker 1>He just wants money and get the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2695
01:56:45.511 --> 01:56:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he thinks he can beat him</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's such a savage.</v>

2696
01:56:47.581 --> 01:56:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't beat him.</v>

2697
01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't think floyd can knock</v>
<v Speaker 1>him out there in for a rude awakening.</v>

2698
01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Well he certainly bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>

2699
01:56:55.560 --> 01:57:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe he lasts all 12 but they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get battered to fuck up will be awful.</v>

2700
01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:03.900
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's going to be paid if</v>

2701
01:57:03.901 --> 01:57:05.470
<v Speaker 1>that's what you wanna do you get paid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I?</v>

2702
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I'd much rather see him fighting GSP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2703
01:57:08.341 --> 01:57:09.960
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think,</v>

2704
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a terrible move for him to</v>

2705
01:57:12.961 --> 01:57:15.300
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Floyd would just look,</v>

2706
01:57:15.301 --> 01:57:20.040
<v Speaker 1>floyd is the best box or maybe of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>era maybe of all time.</v>

2707
01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:21.570
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's undefeated.</v>

2708
01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The UFC let connor do that once.</v>

2709
01:57:24.970 --> 01:57:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Now he's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can barely get him to fight is worth</v>

2710
01:57:26.881 --> 01:57:28.860
<v Speaker 1>$100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

2711
01:57:28.861 --> 01:57:29.660
<v Speaker 1>do please fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2712
01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make so much money,</v>

2713
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:33.180
<v Speaker 1>whiskey and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight when I'm ready.</v>

2714
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:35.340
<v Speaker 1>They're not gonna let that ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're never gonna see that again.</v>

2715
01:57:35.970 --> 01:57:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that crazy.</v>

2716
01:57:37.471 --> 01:57:39.800
<v Speaker 1>They may</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree,</v>

2717
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:44.910
<v Speaker 1>which is it can't happen now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that the fertittas don't own the UFC</v>

2718
01:57:45.421 --> 01:57:47.880
<v Speaker 1>and now like this corporation owns it</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2719
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is not one day days is up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hill.</v>

2720
01:57:50.610 --> 01:57:51.140
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2721
01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:54.540
<v Speaker 1>what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that connor has so much</v>

2722
01:57:54.541 --> 01:57:59.541
<v Speaker 1>leverage now where it's not a good thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make someone a giant star who could</v>

2723
01:57:59.791 --> 01:58:02.520
<v Speaker 1>be a giant star because they're worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person's going to have leverage.</v>

2724
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:04.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll make them a giant star in the</v>

2725
01:58:04.141 --> 01:58:04.530
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>

2726
01:58:04.530 --> 01:58:07.590
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to let him jump over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do a code promotion with floyd</v>

2727
01:58:07.591 --> 01:58:10.530
<v Speaker 1>mayweather again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe put that and listen to keep doing</v>

2728
01:58:10.531 --> 01:58:12.330
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else would they do it with theirs?</v>

2729
01:58:12.331 --> 01:58:14.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the better question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

2730
01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:16.800
<v Speaker 1>If they had another connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it the same way.</v>

2731
01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:19.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a way to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a smart way to make money.</v>

2732
01:58:19.111 --> 01:58:20.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a fun fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We watched it.</v>

2733
01:58:20.581 --> 01:58:22.020
<v Speaker 1>We got to seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sit education.</v>

2734
01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.080
<v Speaker 1>It's an education for people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate martial arts because you</v>

2735
01:58:25.081 --> 01:58:28.740
<v Speaker 1>really got to understand what a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>class top of the food chain,</v>

2736
01:58:28.741 --> 01:58:32.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe the best of all time box or does</v>
<v Speaker 1>to an MMA fighter and you think we're</v>

2737
01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:34.140
<v Speaker 1>going to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The general audience,</v>

2738
01:58:34.141 --> 01:58:35.850
<v Speaker 1>he keeps saying for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not what I'm saying.</v>

2739
01:58:35.851 --> 01:58:37.890
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is is it was getting us</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2740
01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:40.440
<v Speaker 1>It was good for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was good for the sport and if someone</v>

2741
01:58:40.441 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 1>comes along different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone</v>

2742
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:44.410
<v Speaker 2>comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not floyd did someone else and the</v>

2743
01:58:44.411 --> 01:58:47.720
<v Speaker 2>same situation arises again and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>another opportunity to make a shitload</v>

2744
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:48.760
<v Speaker 2>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to do it again.</v>

2745
01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:52.150
<v Speaker 2>How many titles do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Floyd Floyd is 40 years old.</v>

2746
01:58:52.151 --> 01:58:54.070
<v Speaker 2>He probably doesn't want to do it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>many more times.</v>

2747
01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:57.850
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that would fuck floyd up</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that his extravagant spending isn't a</v>

2748
01:58:57.851 --> 01:59:01.750
<v Speaker 2>bad look for MMA too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say Floyd's 27 at this point</v>

2749
01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:04.660
<v Speaker 2>and he's one of the greatest and we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's connor smokes him.</v>

2750
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Here's can be smoked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's style.</v>

2751
01:59:07.001 --> 01:59:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Bench smokes him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At what point is you have to be like,</v>

2752
01:59:09.851 --> 01:59:12.890
<v Speaker 2>this is a bad look man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like guys can fucking torched with.</v>

2753
01:59:12.891 --> 01:59:17.891
<v Speaker 2>Depends on whether or not it's obvious</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had no chance.</v>

2754
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Like with Connor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2755
01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:23.230
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing is like he landed</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of shots,</v>

2756
01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:24.490
<v Speaker 2>get up and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2757
01:59:24.491 --> 01:59:28.060
<v Speaker 2>if this guy could take this guy down or</v>
<v Speaker 2>even just kick his legs,</v>

2758
01:59:28.330 --> 01:59:30.430
<v Speaker 2>if Kinda could just kick his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a wash.</v>

2759
01:59:30.850 --> 01:59:35.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting to watch someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>even fail against someone who's way</v>

2760
01:59:35.471 --> 01:59:37.870
<v Speaker 2>better at their sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real question is,</v>

2761
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:40.620
<v Speaker 2>you're ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you ever going to see a worldclass</v>

2762
01:59:40.630 --> 01:59:42.640
<v Speaker 2>boxer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>By time we saw James Tony,</v>

2763
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:47.200
<v Speaker 2>he had been like really late in the game</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Vince Phillips Fought Masato and k</v>

2764
01:59:47.201 --> 01:59:49.180
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was way late in the game.</v>

2765
01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:50.800
<v Speaker 2>They were on their way out looking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

2766
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:54.580
<v Speaker 2>right after thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterthoughts for the most part,</v>

2767
01:59:54.581 --> 01:59:57.460
<v Speaker 2>for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever think you're gonna see like</v>

2768
01:59:57.461 --> 01:59:58.294
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2769
01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:04.160
<v Speaker 2>a Crawford step into MMA aloma Chanko</v>
<v Speaker 2>step into MMA in their prime?</v>

2770
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you do make so much money?</v>

2771
02:00:07.450 --> 02:00:09.700
<v Speaker 2>I know they need to make it so because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're at that level,</v>

2772
02:00:09.701 --> 02:00:14.380
<v Speaker 2>they're making so much money and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you risk going to the UFC in</v>

2773
02:00:14.381 --> 02:00:16.980
<v Speaker 2>50 years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How awesome that put a poster is going</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's not as fun I don't think talking</v>

2783

2789
02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying the masses.</v>

2790
02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:00.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God don't worry about the mat.</v>

2791
02:01:00.851 --> 02:01:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're right.</v>

2792
02:01:02.290 --> 02:01:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the UFC where think many</v>

2793
02:01:04.361 --> 02:01:06.610
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it could be stepped in and tried to</v>

2794
02:01:06.611 --> 02:01:08.410
<v Speaker 2>fight floyd right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now,</v>

2795
02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:12.760
<v Speaker 2>if they set it up in two months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you it would sell at least a</v>

2796
02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:12.840
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

2797
02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:16.480
<v Speaker 2>It does better than conor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would want to say you think it does?</v>

2798
02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:18.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think those clubs at a million.</v>

2799
02:01:18.581 --> 02:01:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I said it does a million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be boy Jamie for him.</v>

2800
02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you would do a million pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>per views or more or more something</v>

2801
02:01:25.721 --> 02:01:26.041
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2802
02:01:26.041 --> 02:01:27.460
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do a million.</v>

2803
02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:28.780
<v Speaker 2>It's floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't miss.</v>

2804
02:01:28.810 --> 02:01:30.940
<v Speaker 2>When uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was um,</v>

2805
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:35.950
<v Speaker 2>who was a floyd's last fall was it</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pacquiao and then Tim Bradley,</v>

2806
02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:38.270
<v Speaker 2>if I pack out then Tim Bradley never</v>
<v Speaker 2>tired.</v>

2807
02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the pack,</v>

2808
02:01:39.221 --> 02:01:41.840
<v Speaker 2>you've got the giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most paper view numbers ever.</v>

2809
02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:44.030
<v Speaker 2>But then Tim Bradley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm correct,</v>

2810
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:48.440
<v Speaker 2>only got a few hundred thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 300,000 isn't that right?</v>

2811
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:49.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2812
02:01:49.061 --> 02:01:52.250
<v Speaker 2>So then he fights connor and he gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 2 million,</v>

2813
02:01:52.251 --> 02:01:54.020

<v Speaker 2>Tim Bradley.</v>

2818
02:02:00.590 --> 02:02:04.280
<v Speaker 2>So then he fights Andre Berto that only</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets 350,000 or something like that.</v>

2819
02:02:04.281 --> 02:02:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Pay per view buys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he flights.</v>

2820
02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Conor fights connor and it's millions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper views.</v>

2821
02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:11.450
<v Speaker 2>If he fucked could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would still be better than fighting</v>

2822
02:02:11.451 --> 02:02:12.620
<v Speaker 2>any of those other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agree.</v>

2823
02:02:12.621 --> 02:02:15.480

<v Speaker 2>I fucked that one up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a math teacher.</v>

2836
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:46.010
<v Speaker 2>He is a math teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see when Crawford fought him,</v>

2837
02:02:46.170 --> 02:02:48.080
<v Speaker 2>whoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when we realized how good</v>

2838
02:02:48.081 --> 02:02:49.760
<v Speaker 2>terrence can you realize he was the math</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher?</v>

2839
02:02:50.290 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crawford is if he's not the best in the</v>

2840
02:02:53.211 --> 02:02:55.550
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's top two or three already said that.</v>

2841
02:02:55.551 --> 02:02:56.031
<v Speaker 2>I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2843
02:02:56.571 --> 02:02:58.370

<v Speaker 2>it'd be tough to go against Crawford</v>

2844
02:02:58.371 --> 02:03:00.350
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Notice nobody calls Crawford.</v>

2845
02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:04.330
<v Speaker 2>So to up to everyone challenged them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>such a,</v>

2847
02:03:07.690 --> 02:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>I think these fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a good win.</v>

2848
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:12.110

<v Speaker 2>When he moved over to bell tore two,</v>

2862
02:03:38.271 --> 02:03:41.120
<v Speaker 2>something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it was almost like you</v>

2863
02:03:41.121 --> 02:03:42.200
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

2864
02:03:42.201 --> 02:03:45.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even in the UFC anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to really make something here.</v>

2865
02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:47.600
<v Speaker 2>When he built beat Phil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2866
02:03:47.601 --> 02:03:49.430
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's beaten some really good guys.</v>

2867
02:03:49.431 --> 02:03:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really good guys.</v>

2868
02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:53.100
<v Speaker 2>When you look at them like everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>about him,</v>

2869
02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:56.120
<v Speaker 2>like technically the way he's moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he fights,</v>

2870
02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:58.310
<v Speaker 2>and he's a good example of what we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier.</v>

2871
02:03:58.311 --> 02:04:00.170
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what he's gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna take you down.</v>

2872
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:03.680
<v Speaker 2>He's going to strike with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing everything and he's mixing</v>

2873
02:04:03.681 --> 02:04:05.360
<v Speaker 2>everything up and his mentality.</v>

2874
02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking end.</v>

2875
02:04:06.450 --> 02:04:08.900
<v Speaker 2>His mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing he was telling me is,</v>

2876
02:04:08.901 --> 02:04:12.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was trying to negotiate with Bell</v>

2877
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Torres contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is his last fight,</v>

2878
02:04:14.150 --> 02:04:15.440
<v Speaker 2>his contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hold up,</v>

2879
02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:18.020
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be a free agent and be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>double champ champ,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2892
02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:48.810
<v Speaker 2>If they don't see you there they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's he been?</v>

2893
02:04:48.811 --> 02:04:51.270

<v Speaker 2>acknowledge Palatar they never have.</v>

2895
02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:58.620
<v Speaker 2>They never acknowledged fade or they</v>
<v Speaker 2>never acknowledged when he was fighting</v>

2896
02:04:58.621 --> 02:05:00.270
<v Speaker 2>in pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they never thought.</v>

2897
02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.850
<v Speaker 2>They literally didn't even want me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say pride.</v>

2898
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:05.070
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to acknowledge other</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations,</v>

2899
02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:07.740
<v Speaker 2>especially back then because pride</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked them over.</v>

2900
02:05:07.890 --> 02:05:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Remember they had that whole sneaky deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they gave him chocolate dao and</v>

2901
02:05:11.791 --> 02:05:14.190
<v Speaker 2>vandelay is supposed to come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they reneged.</v>

2902
02:05:14.191 --> 02:05:16.380
<v Speaker 2>It was a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shady shit and I was still,</v>

2903
02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:19.380
<v Speaker 2>as a person who's a martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 2>commentator,</v>

2904
02:05:19.381 --> 02:05:21.750
<v Speaker 2>you have to bring up fade or you had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring up [inaudible].</v>

2905
02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:24.000
<v Speaker 2>You had to bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the people that were making big</v>

2906
02:05:24.001 --> 02:05:26.730
<v Speaker 2>noise over in Japan and he was one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2907
02:05:29.450 --> 02:05:32.430
<v Speaker 2>He didn't cool if they had opened it up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to so we could see who's the absolute</v>

2908
02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:35.190
<v Speaker 2>best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beta is really good.</v>

2909
02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:37.050
<v Speaker 2>He's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really would,</v>

2910
02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I would be very curious to see how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>better he's gotten because sometimes</v>

2911
02:05:39.991 --> 02:05:42.860
<v Speaker 2>guys turned a corner and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden they just become the best.</v>

2912
02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:46.650
<v Speaker 2>We tough to tell again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is his opposition right now because</v>

2913
02:05:46.670 --> 02:05:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Michio and right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in him and he was never a world</v>

2914
02:05:49.051 --> 02:05:51.420
<v Speaker 2>beater in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was at a top five guy.</v>

2915
02:05:51.570 --> 02:05:53.590
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's never contender really good.</v>

2916
02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then still Phil Davis,</v>

2917
02:05:55.971 --> 02:05:57.990
<v Speaker 2>no field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dale says guys beat a lot of fucking</v>

2918
02:05:57.991 --> 02:06:01.500
<v Speaker 2>good people and fills another one who</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked better once he got to bell tour,</v>

2919
02:06:01.710 --> 02:06:03.090
<v Speaker 2>he looked better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he like hit,</v>

2920
02:06:03.091 --> 02:06:04.170
<v Speaker 2>he turned a corner as well.</v>

2921
02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:07.290
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a new chapter in your life like that,</v>

2922
02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:11.050
<v Speaker 2>you've got to rise to the occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Chemo Chemo off see older and</v>

2923
02:06:11.060 --> 02:06:14.070
<v Speaker 2>his career and it fade or oldest shit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his career.</v>

2924
02:06:14.071 --> 02:06:15.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what Beta is that.</v>

2925
02:06:16.030 --> 02:06:17.430
<v Speaker 2>There are great wins though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2926
02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:19.980
<v Speaker 2>And at light heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would kill right now in the UFC,</v>

2927
02:06:19.981 --> 02:06:22.220
<v Speaker 2>there's no button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2928
02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:27.420
<v Speaker 2>once Bella Tor stars started signing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the UFC,</v>

2929
02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:30.780
<v Speaker 2>like with Chandler and Alvarez and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>champs Alvarez,</v>

2930
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:34.780
<v Speaker 2>Albert's</v>
<v Speaker 2>channel in that way and now ben ass</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2934
02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:40.740
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2935
02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:43.140
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Bella tour fighters are being</v>

2936
02:06:43.141 --> 02:06:45.330
<v Speaker 2>signed to the UFC based on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>stardom.</v>

2937
02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Bella Tours legit as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2938
02:06:47.941 --> 02:06:52.500
<v Speaker 2>super legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especi a certain weight classes for</v>

2939
02:06:52.501 --> 02:06:54.120
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the best on the planet.</v>

2940
02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:55.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would lit.</v>

2941
02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd be Woodley.</v>

2942
02:06:56.910 --> 02:07:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean [inaudible] Musashi is absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best in the planet.</v>

2943
02:07:00.241 --> 02:07:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Hand Chandler has beaten Alvarez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alvarez,</v>

2944
02:07:02.971 --> 02:07:05.850
<v Speaker 2>one of the best on planet challenge ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>live or go to the UFC.</v>

2945
02:07:06.450 --> 02:07:10.260
<v Speaker 2>He just see style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes being over there.</v>

2946
02:07:10.410 --> 02:07:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Here's the argument to Ben Henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC worldclass comes the Bella tour.</v>

2947
02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:17.680
<v Speaker 2>It's been a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been struggles,</v>

2948
02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:19.500
<v Speaker 2>cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought course club,</v>

2949
02:07:19.501 --> 02:07:23.190
<v Speaker 2>which I don't think was the right move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that terrible idea to whereby this is</v>

2950
02:07:23.191 --> 02:07:25.290
<v Speaker 2>not his weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just say five pounder.</v>

2951
02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:28.560
<v Speaker 2>And I love Ben Friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he hasn't looked like the same ben</v>

2952
02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:30.720
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compete against Frankie Edgar.</v>

2953
02:07:30.721 --> 02:07:33.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to remember that he's been</v>

2954
02:07:33.481 --> 02:07:36.910
<v Speaker 2>fighting world class competition for</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2955
02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:39.040
<v Speaker 2>So as the Debbie and bees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2956
02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Rice rest true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you cannot stop it.</v>

2957
02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Eddie Alvarez was later,</v>

2958
02:07:44.410 --> 02:07:46.870
<v Speaker 2>he came along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his career was hard and rough,</v>

2959
02:07:46.871 --> 02:07:49.270
<v Speaker 2>but it was later in in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the time period.</v>

2960
02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Then ben underground kitten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2961
02:07:51.190 --> 02:07:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henderson was like WC,</v>

2962
02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:55.060
<v Speaker 2>right to showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Showtime.</v>

2963
02:07:55.330 --> 02:07:58.420
<v Speaker 2>You got to remember he was the champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pet is,</v>

2964
02:07:58.421 --> 02:08:02.290
<v Speaker 2>takes his title with that crazy kick to</v>
<v Speaker 2>close out WEC.</v>

2965
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:03.590
<v Speaker 2>They go over to the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2966
02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:05.470
<v Speaker 2>he beats every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fights.</v>

2967
02:08:05.471 --> 02:08:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought so many fucking tough guys.</v>

2968
02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:09.430
<v Speaker 2>So many guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2969
02:08:09.431 --> 02:08:13.330
<v Speaker 2>And then didn't he fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got stopped by dos Anjos when dos</v>

2970
02:08:13.331 --> 02:08:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Anjos was one is up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

2971
02:08:15.131 --> 02:08:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Dos Anjos is on the way to the title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the big fight was him and</v>

2972
02:08:18.401 --> 02:08:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Henderson needs Cko dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2973
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:24.220
<v Speaker 2>He was a motherfucker back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dos Anjos for that time period.</v>

2974
02:08:24.221 --> 02:08:27.220
<v Speaker 2>There was a time period of like two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years where I think dosantos was just a</v>

2975
02:08:27.221 --> 02:08:30.730
<v Speaker 2>fucking berzerker like one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>lightweights of all time and then,</v>

2976
02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:31.900
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2977
02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:32.890
<v Speaker 2>It could be a coincidence.</v>

2978
02:08:32.910 --> 02:08:35.280
<v Speaker 2>The new side of came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went on to lose weight.</v>

2979
02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:36.373
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2980
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:40.780
<v Speaker 2>That will never go into 70 he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking monster has 70 he's not as good</v>

2981
02:08:40.781 --> 02:08:45.781
<v Speaker 2>at 70 as it is is 55 fucking good at 70</v>
<v Speaker 2>now the guys like Camaros Uzman it's</v>

2982
02:08:46.070 --> 02:08:48.030
<v Speaker 2>going to be a problem for the guys like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colby Covington,</v>

2983
02:08:48.031 --> 02:08:50.890
<v Speaker 2>undersize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big strong wrestlers.</v>

2984
02:08:50.891 --> 02:08:54.000
<v Speaker 2>It could become a hard time to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>

2985
02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Go from Bella Tor to the UFC or you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen a bell tour no matter what in that</v>

2986
02:08:58.661 --> 02:08:59.460
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one,</v>

2987
02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:03.730
<v Speaker 2>the cream of the crop or change is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>level of prestige and the belt,</v>

2988
02:09:03.850 --> 02:09:06.190
<v Speaker 2>the UFC belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC.</v>

2989
02:09:06.191 --> 02:09:07.024
<v Speaker 2>It's king.</v>

2990
02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:12.010
<v Speaker 2>No matter what it will be because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to go through a tougher road to get</v>

2991
02:09:12.011 --> 02:09:13.270
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>

2992
02:09:13.271 --> 02:09:17.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not even like saying a and B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like saying a and f.</v>

2993
02:09:18.070 --> 02:09:20.260
<v Speaker 2>There's so many separations between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bella,</v>

2994
02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:22.330
<v Speaker 2>our belt in the UFC talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>prestige,</v>

2995
02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:25.360
<v Speaker 2>prestige,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're talking about town,</v>

2996
02:09:25.630 --> 02:09:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Douglas Lema in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the best welterweights on</v>

2997
02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:32.710
<v Speaker 2>planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rory Macdonald who beat him in a very</v>

2998
02:09:32.711 --> 02:09:34.690
<v Speaker 2>close decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best welterweights on earth.</v>

2999
02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:37.150

3000
02:09:37.151 --> 02:09:38.890
<v Speaker 2>the fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>

3001
02:09:38.891 --> 02:09:41.620

3013
02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:14.050
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to get signed to the UFC and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting the prelims.</v>

3014
02:10:14.170 --> 02:10:17.470

3015
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:21.010

3028
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:54.130
<v Speaker 2>You've got to do a read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I read.</v>

3029
02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:56.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just leave Cyborg on the</v>

3030
02:10:56.391 --> 02:10:58.610
<v Speaker 2>sidelines and not hide her enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She gets pissed.</v>

3031
02:10:58.611 --> 02:11:03.611
<v Speaker 2>Think you need to have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a technical foul and accidental foul and</v>

3032
02:11:04.731 --> 02:11:06.210
<v Speaker 2>that's the end of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if it's,</v>

3033
02:11:06.330 --> 02:11:07.520
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a foul.</v>

3034
02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:09.530
<v Speaker 2>If you poke someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck is it?</v>

3035
02:11:09.531 --> 02:11:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Not if a foul if your toes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he seemed to fix that.</v>

3036
02:11:15.230 --> 02:11:16.790
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just throw a punch,</v>

3037
02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:19.550
<v Speaker 2>if you throw a punch and as you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing your ride hook,</v>

3038
02:11:19.610 --> 02:11:22.130
<v Speaker 2>your thumb goes in someone's eye and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stopped the fight.</v>

3039
02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:24.080
<v Speaker 2>They look at the replay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say it's an eye poked.</v>

3040
02:11:24.081 --> 02:11:26.420
<v Speaker 2>The referee says it's an I poke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get disqualified.</v>

3041
02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:29.870
<v Speaker 2>How is that any different than you</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing a round kick and the the,</v>

3042
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:31.880
<v Speaker 2>the toe inadvertently goes in your arm.</v>

3043
02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:34.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just snap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not meagan's fault.</v>

3044
02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she did what she was supposed to do.</v>

3045
02:11:35.691 --> 02:11:39.050
<v Speaker 2>She's tracking her down using a range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lands a nice kick butt.</v>

3046
02:11:39.051 --> 02:11:40.970
<v Speaker 2>She caught her at the toe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toe in the eyeball,</v>

3047
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.520
<v Speaker 2>but also cat turned her back and wave</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's over.</v>

3048
02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:47.360
<v Speaker 2>But she has to say it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sheriff fucking eyeballs popped.</v>

3049
02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cut right here.</v>

3050
02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:56.630

<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

3055
02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:11.870
<v Speaker 2>There should be a shortage of 150 115</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3087
02:13:41.701 --> 02:13:43.050
<v Speaker 2>he's epic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3088
02:13:43.051 --> 02:13:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Like look at his sneakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just found those somewhere.</v>

3089
02:13:50.130 --> 02:13:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Somebody's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says put these on and can't go</v>

3090
02:13:53.311 --> 02:13:54.780
<v Speaker 2>barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not Reebok's.</v>

3091
02:13:54.781 --> 02:13:56.340
<v Speaker 2>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think they are?</v>

3092
02:13:56.370 --> 02:13:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Sauconys new balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Balance.</v>

3093
02:14:00.670 --> 02:14:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Tsa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3094
02:14:02.071 --> 02:14:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Probably not even the TSA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Balances we can always get that</v>

3095
02:14:04.891 --> 02:14:08.880
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't cross man kisses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes through the whole deal.</v>

3096
02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:10.270
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's someone in the media asks him if</v>

3097
02:14:10.271 --> 02:14:12.930
<v Speaker 2>he Christ and he said once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

3098
02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I did chopping onions.</v>

3099
02:14:15.090 --> 02:14:17.910
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

3100
02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:21.450
<v Speaker 2>What do you think he loses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably last time for him.</v>

3101
02:14:21.451 --> 02:14:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3102
02:14:22.530 --> 02:14:23.820
<v Speaker 2>you never know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3103
02:14:23.821 --> 02:14:27.240
<v Speaker 2>he might just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be really bored with everything else in</v>

3104
02:14:27.241 --> 02:14:29.970
<v Speaker 2>his life and willing to take the</v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment.</v>

3105
02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:31.670
<v Speaker 2>This is the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

3106
02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:35.820
<v Speaker 2>when a guy's his greatest fade or it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a career that fader has had and</v>

3107
02:14:35.821 --> 02:14:38.040
<v Speaker 2>still wins every now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like knocked out frank,</v>

3108
02:14:39.150 --> 02:14:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Frank Mir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he soda and chill son and he still can</v>

3109
02:14:42.541 --> 02:14:42.960
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>

3110
02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still can beat good guys.</v>

3111
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:46.380
<v Speaker 2>And B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3112
02:14:46.381 --> 02:14:51.090
<v Speaker 2>real quality UFC fighters that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>transitioned over both those guys,</v>

3113
02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:53.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chill son and was a quality fighter.</v>

3114
02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Frank Mir is quality fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heavyweight champion.</v>

3115
02:14:56.070 --> 02:14:58.350
<v Speaker 2>It was to tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't keep doing this.</v>

3116
02:14:58.351 --> 02:15:00.840
<v Speaker 2>This is probably the most funny ever has</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever all day.</v>

3117
02:15:00.841 --> 02:15:02.130
<v Speaker 2>What does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't say anything.</v>

3118
02:15:02.131 --> 02:15:03.690
<v Speaker 2>And he eats ice cream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He draws pictures,</v>

3119
02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:08.520
<v Speaker 2>give him a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets into that cage and he,</v>

3120
02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:12.690
<v Speaker 2>so he reignites the fuel inside of him</v>
<v Speaker 2>that led him to be,</v>

3121
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:15.780
<v Speaker 2>if not the greatest of all time in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>

3122
02:15:15.810 --> 02:15:17.100
<v Speaker 2>top three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>top three.</v>

3123
02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:20.130
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is all about time period.</v>

3124
02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:23.580
<v Speaker 2>It is about time period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also about what happened when</v>

3125
02:15:23.581 --> 02:15:25.860
<v Speaker 2>they fought for a preschool for dooms</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotta be in the argument</v>

3126
02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:29.350
<v Speaker 2>but then Solos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to steep it,</v>

3127
02:15:29.351 --> 02:15:32.150
<v Speaker 2>you gotta do for you had to do cane can.</v>

3128
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3129
02:15:34.650 --> 02:15:36.360
<v Speaker 2>I think those are the guys in particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

3130
02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:39.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't need just the format that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mount Rushmore of heavyweights.</v>

3131
02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:41.090
<v Speaker 2>The argument for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for ratio,</v>

3132
02:15:41.091 --> 02:15:44.880
<v Speaker 2>for doom is very strong because he beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>him off to a great aussie pay out him in</v>

3133
02:15:44.881 --> 02:15:46.650
<v Speaker 2>the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got reckless,</v>

3134
02:15:46.670 --> 02:15:48.720
<v Speaker 2>the street bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cayo de and then uh,</v>

3135
02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:50.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Volkov k owed him to,</v>

3136
02:15:50.811 --> 02:15:52.220
<v Speaker 2>to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your point with fader and you're</v>

3137
02:15:52.221 --> 02:15:52.441
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

3138
02:15:52.441 --> 02:15:53.251
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets up there.</v>

3139
02:15:53.251 --> 02:15:54.030
<v Speaker 2>He gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

3140
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:56.460
<v Speaker 2>You're cool with Liddell and Tito.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep doing it.</v>

3141
02:15:56.630 --> 02:15:58.920
<v Speaker 2>But this is a difference between them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

3142
02:15:58.921 --> 02:16:01.500
<v Speaker 2>because fate or stayed active.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was cool with Tito.</v>

3143
02:16:01.501 --> 02:16:04.800
<v Speaker 2>What I was when it was not cool with was</v>
<v Speaker 2>chuck didn't look right.</v>

3144
02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:06.970
<v Speaker 2>He didn't look like he was prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though,</v>

3145
02:16:07.370 --> 02:16:09.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't look like he was prepared on</v>

3146
02:16:09.391 --> 02:16:11.010
<v Speaker 2>the meds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where he's at.</v>

3147
02:16:11.011 --> 02:16:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where he's at physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what damage he sustained.</v>

3148
02:16:13.950 --> 02:16:17.800
<v Speaker 2>When I see fade or fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wins or he loses like Montreal and</v>

3149
02:16:17.801 --> 02:16:19.470
<v Speaker 2>chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that shaft fight though,</v>

3150
02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:21.620
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that shot that Michio on</v>

3151
02:16:21.621 --> 02:16:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Keto road with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does chaos.</v>

3152
02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:26.500
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people touches anywhere on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chin.</v>

3153
02:16:26.501 --> 02:16:30.100
<v Speaker 2>You're going to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucking sofar athlete freak</v>

3154
02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:33.950
<v Speaker 1>in the NFL for six years and he's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>light on his feet and he's fast as like</v>

3155
02:16:33.951 --> 02:16:34.784
<v Speaker 1>a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3156
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:39.670
<v Speaker 1>So did he knocked out Derrick Lewis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 15 seconds to still took it to</v>

3157
02:16:39.671 --> 02:16:40.300
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3158
02:16:40.300 --> 02:16:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's indicative of fate or</v>
<v Speaker 1>being done.</v>

3159
02:16:44.930 --> 02:16:47.150
<v Speaker 1>You see the model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

3160
02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:50.920
<v Speaker 1>it's as resilient as it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maldon owls and underrated boxer.</v>

3161
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Maldonado touched him up and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Zombie,</v>

3162
02:16:55.091 --> 02:16:55.600
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3163
02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:59.230
<v Speaker 1>he's really should be fighting at one 70</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't eat all the assets in the</v>

3164
02:16:59.231 --> 02:17:03.410
<v Speaker 1>world and he gave fucking feed or it</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything it had done,</v>

3165
02:17:03.420 --> 02:17:07.680
<v Speaker 1>both won that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to fucking reverse it in</v>

3166
02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:08.381
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3167
02:17:08.381 --> 02:17:10.270
<v Speaker 1>what are you at your fucking mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Russia.</v>

3168
02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:14.590
<v Speaker 1>He would get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to like get them to do a,</v>

3169
02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:19.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Russia or best friends with hooten</v>

3170
02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:20.410
<v Speaker 1>for fuck sakes.</v>

3171
02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't shit reverse there.</v>

3172
02:17:22.390 --> 02:17:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are these marines coming in?</v>

3173
02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:27.290
<v Speaker 1>They come in for [inaudible] was in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

3174
02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:28.720
<v Speaker 1>They're doing a national anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

3175
02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a Russian national anthem.</v>

3176
02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just scare and fate or with guns.</v>

3177
02:17:32.890 --> 02:17:34.400
<v Speaker 1>They brought a gun in the oxygen for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fate.</v>

3178
02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:36.680
<v Speaker 1>You're a fuck about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to eat that.</v>

3179
02:17:36.730 --> 02:17:39.670
<v Speaker 1>They bring guns into the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is odd,</v>

3180
02:17:39.671 --> 02:17:40.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a ritual.</v>

3181
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ritual,</v>

3182
02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:43.570
<v Speaker 1>not a ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got shoes on too.</v>

3183
02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got shoes on both those things.</v>

3184
02:17:45.941 --> 02:17:47.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of shoes in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about that.</v>

3185
02:17:47.431 --> 02:17:50.340
<v Speaker 1>When I say what is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they going to shoot those guys with</v>

3186
02:17:50.430 --> 02:17:53.020
<v Speaker 1>a medicine for the troops shot holes</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the ceiling?</v>

3187
02:17:53.290 --> 02:17:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I would celebrate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do a whole thing where like</v>

3188
02:17:59.441 --> 02:18:01.690
<v Speaker 1>giving back to troops and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're doing here?</v>

3189

02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:27.110
<v Speaker 1>John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the big moments,</v>

3251
02:20:27.111 --> 02:20:31.970
<v Speaker 1>he gets caught up sometimes Johnson shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad shot and fucking he bounces head</v>

3253
02:20:33.951 --> 02:20:38.450

3254
02:20:38.451 --> 02:20:41.000
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight champ champ champ.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is that what he said?</v>

3261
02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3262
02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible champ shit.</v>

3263
02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:56.293
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3264
02:20:57.050 --> 02:20:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Hey Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] started it and now fucking</v>

3265
02:21:00.220 --> 02:21:01.520
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3266
02:21:01.521 --> 02:21:03.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a few guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

3267
02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ties up the division so it gets a</v>

3268
02:21:06.381 --> 02:21:07.250
<v Speaker 1>little messy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

3269
02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>

3270
02:21:09.891 --> 02:21:14.891
<v Speaker 1>but 70 and would at least go to 85 is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the belt and 45 there are 35 pound belt.</v>

3271
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:19.250
<v Speaker 1>He goes going to go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

3272
02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I really believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if some,</v>

3273
02:21:21.380 --> 02:21:24.680
<v Speaker 1>this is an egregious error and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight that stopped prematurely.</v>

3274
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I think you should almost put it up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vote of the Internet.</v>

3275
02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I really do it all at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At your God damn mind</v>

3276
02:21:33.230 --> 02:21:34.110
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3277
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Popular vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you say most people like 70% of</v>

3278
02:21:38.151 --> 02:21:40.120
<v Speaker 1>the punctuation of dummies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3279
02:21:40.650 --> 02:21:45.650
<v Speaker 1>it's like 80 it's about the popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote,</v>

3280
02:21:45.651 --> 02:21:46.460
<v Speaker 1>amy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3281
02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:48.950
<v Speaker 1>but let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about we have and say,</v>

3282
02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:53.510
<v Speaker 1>how about we have an organization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>esteemed ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3283
02:21:54.310 --> 02:21:58.610
<v Speaker 1>an organization of maybe 200 excepted</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial artists,</v>

3284
02:21:58.850 --> 02:22:02.600
<v Speaker 1>worldclass martial artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that a committee of a hundred</v>

3285
02:22:03.470 --> 02:22:06.350
<v Speaker 1>people is what the fuck they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get the decision,</v>

3286
02:22:06.351 --> 02:22:08.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great idea.</v>

3287
02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:11.630
<v Speaker 1>If you have it so much better than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet trolls voting John Hackleman</v>

3288
02:22:11.631 --> 02:22:15.500
<v Speaker 1>ends and John Donna,</v>

3294
02:22:29.370 --> 02:22:34.370
<v Speaker 4>If you have those Tom's girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you had all those people in like a</v>

<v Speaker 2>when that credit card bill is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come and you got all these charges and</v>

3370
02:26:01.901 --> 02:26:03.810

3372
02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:09.550
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around it and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight a smart calculated fight,</v>

3373
02:26:09.551 --> 02:26:12.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who the fuck gets hit the least in</v>

<v Speaker 2>He saw a lot of time.</v>

3378
02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I think aspirin is probably the number</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

3379
02:26:23.261 --> 02:26:26.590
<v Speaker 2>but he's never fought anybody at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>caliber of the UFC.</v>

3380
02:26:26.591 --> 02:26:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Like in their prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but just avoid it.</v>

3382
02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it.</v>

3383
02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Jones really doesn't take damage</v>

<v Speaker 2>The for the young fighters too.</v>

3386
02:26:39.521 --> 02:26:41.630

<v Speaker 2>is you train,</v>

3387
02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:44.080

<v Speaker 2>all that work,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're coaches,</v>

3391
02:26:51.341 --> 02:26:53.710
<v Speaker 2>you're disrespecting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause now it's level playing field.</v>

3392
02:26:53.711 --> 02:26:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Whoever lands first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking [inaudible] Nunez.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

3399
02:27:10.451 --> 02:27:15.451
<v Speaker 2>this is one person fighting on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative and fighting on emotions and</v>

3400
02:27:15.941 --> 02:27:19.780
<v Speaker 2>trying to just overwhelm someone in Pico</v>

<v Speaker 1>and here's the thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They don't give you another belt.</v>

3438
02:28:53.301 --> 02:28:58.280
<v Speaker 1>They just added another stone to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Budget cuts was a real eye.</v>

3439
02:28:58.300 --> 02:28:59.450
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the word.</v>

3440
02:28:59.451 --> 02:29:00.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the rumor that you don't get new</v>
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>

3470
02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:08.900

3502
02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:23.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a four man tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Josh Barnett,</v>

3503
02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:25.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rustam Chizzy IV.</v>

3504
02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:26.400
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who,</v>

3505
02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:29.670
<v Speaker 3>who fought Gordon Ryan in the finals of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bi six.</v>

3506
02:31:29.671 --> 02:31:31.380
<v Speaker 3>That's where Eba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where Rob Gordon,</v>

3507
02:31:31.381 --> 02:31:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Ryan was born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he won the absolute of Ebi Ebi,</v>

3508
02:31:35.251 --> 02:31:38.670
<v Speaker 3>six hours his first tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is combat [inaudible] badge meant</v>

3509
02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:41.300
<v Speaker 3>to slab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's barn and not do companies just</v>

3510
02:31:41.310 --> 02:31:46.310
<v Speaker 3>don't get to Gordon Fabrice format</v>
<v Speaker 3>attorneys combat Barnett be sick.</v>

3511
02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:49.590
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing tournament.</v>

3512
02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:51.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be crazy dude.</v>

3513
02:31:51.270 --> 02:31:53.740
<v Speaker 3>Cause Josh Barnett just got beat by</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gordon Ryan too.</v>

3514
02:31:54.180 --> 02:31:59.180
<v Speaker 3>He got to know it could be a rematch</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and Rustam thou he was in the</v>

3515
02:31:59.401 --> 02:32:02.700
<v Speaker 3>finals and Gordon beat him in the finals</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the absolute Ebi six.</v>

3516
02:32:02.940 --> 02:32:05.820
<v Speaker 3>So there's two re potential rematches</v>
<v Speaker 3>alone.</v>

3517
02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:09.600
<v Speaker 3>But then on top of that you got fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>buddies over doom versus Gordon Ryan in</v>

3518
02:32:09.601 --> 02:32:10.470
<v Speaker 3>round one I think.</v>

3519
02:32:10.470 --> 02:32:11.820
<v Speaker 3>I think dawn Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ryan,</v>

3520
02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:14.970
<v Speaker 3>I think Gordon Ryan is obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the best thing in Jujitsu,</v>

3521
02:32:15.060 --> 02:32:17.550
<v Speaker 3>but he wants to mma too with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>

3522
02:32:17.551 --> 02:32:19.760
<v Speaker 3>his skillset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's gonna take over him and may</v>

3523
02:32:19.761 --> 02:32:21.350
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a motherfuck.</v>

3524
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Well he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like Donna,</v>

3525
02:32:23.361 --> 02:32:26.100
<v Speaker 3>hers is a personality to right way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donna.</v>

3526
02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Her is telling him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to learn how to strike</v>

3527
02:32:28.231 --> 02:32:29.700
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to go in there without</v>

3528
02:32:29.701 --> 02:32:34.701
<v Speaker 3>any skills and joy attack his Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is going to be,</v>

3529
02:32:35.491 --> 02:32:36.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be good for him.</v>

3530
02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:37.861
<v Speaker 3>It's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

3531
02:32:37.861 --> 02:32:40.710
<v Speaker 3>He'll do fine because if you watch his</v>
<v Speaker 3>last few fights,</v>

3532
02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:43.230
<v Speaker 3>he likes to mount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not like this big leg locker,</v>

3533
02:32:43.290 --> 02:32:44.970
<v Speaker 3>leg locker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an expert at leg locks.</v>

3534
02:32:44.971 --> 02:32:48.990
<v Speaker 3>He's got that whole system down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he likes to mount under Jack and get</v>

3535
02:32:48.991 --> 02:32:53.130
<v Speaker 3>arm triangles and that's perfect for mms</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't triangles in mma.</v>

3536
02:32:53.130 --> 02:32:56.670
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to be a savage with arm</v>

3537
02:32:56.671 --> 02:32:59.220
<v Speaker 3>triangles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're fighting MMA plus this person,</v>

3538
02:32:59.250 --> 02:33:01.790
<v Speaker 3>how you cause a star is a star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3539
02:33:02.010 --> 02:33:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Well it was a handsome kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a 28 pack tattoo on his chest,</v>

3540
02:33:07.370 --> 02:33:09.870
<v Speaker 3>on his chest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might have the most ridiculous six pack</v>

3541
02:33:09.871 --> 02:33:12.360
<v Speaker 3>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His him and Wiz Khalifa should have a</v>

3542
02:33:12.361 --> 02:33:15.180
<v Speaker 3>six pack off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>separate in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a solid,</v>

<v Speaker 1>have to go chocolate body.</v>

3578
02:34:41.650 --> 02:34:42.970
<v Speaker 1>You can consider that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3579
02:34:43.380 --> 02:34:44.710
<v Speaker 1>What does he weigh now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>something crazy and get two one 70 like</v>

3581

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3582
02:34:53.350 --> 02:34:54.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to be.</v>

3583
02:34:54.461 --> 02:34:56.680
<v Speaker 1>He used to fight at one 70 that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>credentials.</v>

3584
02:34:57.430 --> 02:35:01.480
<v Speaker 1>He decided to bulk up how many picos all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

3585
02:35:01.481 --> 02:35:02.800
<v Speaker 1>It no killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's testing?</v>

3586
02:35:03.130 --> 02:35:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we got Picos and your Usada,</v>

3587
02:35:06.970 --> 02:35:07.870
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

3588
02:35:08.090 --> 02:35:11.950
<v Speaker 1>If you are a young guy and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>indulging in various ways to enhance</v>

3589
02:35:11.951 --> 02:35:15.490
<v Speaker 1>your physical recovery and then you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>off of that stuff,</v>

3590
02:35:15.491 --> 02:35:16.990
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have an adaptation</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

3591
02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And that adaptation period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is an issue.</v>

3592
02:35:21.570 --> 02:35:22.690
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

3593
02:35:22.691 --> 02:35:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Why is it an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>

3594
02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:24.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3595
02:35:24.791 --> 02:35:26.920
<v Speaker 1>the issue is your performance is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to suffer.</v>

3596
02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:31.630
<v Speaker 1>You're saying if you're getting off it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're on it and you get off of it,</v>

3597
02:35:31.890 --> 02:35:33.730
<v Speaker 1>he's a young guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's on it,</v>

3598
02:35:33.731 --> 02:35:35.500
<v Speaker 1>we're assuming he's on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we don't know.</v>

3599
02:35:35.530 --> 02:35:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Gordon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3600
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3601
02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:39.940
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have phenomenal genetics.</v>

3602
02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All jokes aside,</v>

3603
02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:43.780
<v Speaker 1>if you do find someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3604
02:35:43.810 --> 02:35:45.100
<v Speaker 1>not him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say someone else.</v>

3605
02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Let's say he just has taken Jeanette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else that does it.</v>

3606
02:35:48.310 --> 02:35:51.030
<v Speaker 1>If they do do it and they're doing it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an untested forum,</v>

3607
02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:52.780
<v Speaker 1>like like submission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling,</v>

3608
02:35:52.810 --> 02:35:53.110
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

3609
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Which most you can get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.</v>

3610
02:35:55.991 --> 02:35:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Meyers,</v>

3611
02:35:57.050 --> 02:36:01.060
<v Speaker 1>speech outline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generalists tests like in the speaking</v>

3612
02:36:01.061 --> 02:36:01.990
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

3613
02:36:02.090 --> 02:36:05.590
<v Speaker 1>we know for a fact that some competitors</v>
<v Speaker 1>are indulging.</v>

3614
02:36:06.250 --> 02:36:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3615
02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:08.911
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3616
02:36:08.911 --> 02:36:12.320
<v Speaker 1>all I'll say from I would say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3617
02:36:12.370 --> 02:36:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3618
02:36:14.010 --> 02:36:16.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just shoot it to,</v>

3619
02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:18.830
<v Speaker 1>we know for sure some are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3620
02:36:19.090 --> 02:36:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Not accuse any individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know for sure summer when when</v>

3621
02:36:23.831 --> 02:36:27.650
<v Speaker 1>you do have that situation where someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>is on something and then they get off of</v>

3622
02:36:27.651 --> 02:36:30.460
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have this adaptation period</v>

3623
02:36:30.461 --> 02:36:32.500
<v Speaker 1>where they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their body's not producing testosterone</v>

3624
02:36:32.501 --> 02:36:33.760
<v Speaker 1>as much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to get on</v>

3625
02:36:33.761 --> 02:36:35.500
<v Speaker 1>something else in order to kickstart it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>

3626
02:36:35.770 --> 02:36:37.720
<v Speaker 1>But you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can do that.</v>

3627
02:36:37.930 --> 02:36:41.240
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know with this John Jones thinking</v>

3628
02:36:41.270 --> 02:36:44.020
<v Speaker 1>the Pico granting and he did test</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive now with Vata,</v>

3629
02:36:44.021 --> 02:36:44.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3630
02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And they still allow him to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now let's say you are a Jujitsu guy</v>

3631
02:36:47.741 --> 02:36:51.430
<v Speaker 1>who comes to the UFC and you did do</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff prior and those Pico,</v>

3632
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Pico Graham's get flagged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3633
02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:56.410
<v Speaker 1>What'd he intends entirely on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3634
02:36:56.470 --> 02:36:58.660
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends in tyler who you are.</v>

3635
02:36:58.661 --> 02:36:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3636
02:36:59.741 --> 02:37:01.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Usada it does not.</v>

3637
02:37:01.690 --> 02:37:04.120
<v Speaker 1>It depends entirely on what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

3638
02:37:04.121 --> 02:37:08.350
<v Speaker 1>general terms here in terms of whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not you get punished twice for the</v>

3639
02:37:08.351 --> 02:37:12.100
<v Speaker 1>same crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they can prove exactly the same</v>

3640
02:37:12.101 --> 02:37:14.170
<v Speaker 1>way they approve with John the fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things is happening.</v>

3641
02:37:14.171 --> 02:37:15.920
<v Speaker 1>He said the testing is getting far</v>
<v Speaker 1>better</v>

3642
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:19.970
<v Speaker 2>so they can test you for stuff now that</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year ago was absolutely impossible for</v>

3643
02:37:19.971 --> 02:37:22.770
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the threshold right now that they</v>

3644
02:37:22.771 --> 02:37:24.440
<v Speaker 2>were saying this is where it's confusing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

3645
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:29.480
<v Speaker 2>The threshold that they tested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John was supposed to be more stringent</v>

3646
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:31.370
<v Speaker 2>than Vada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3647
02:37:31.371 --> 02:37:33.050
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the night of the fight,</v>

3648
02:37:33.051 --> 02:37:36.410
<v Speaker 2>this is where it gets weird to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The night of the fight to commission</v>

3649
02:37:36.411 --> 02:37:40.250
<v Speaker 2>tested them all the same period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same pice commission you,</v>

3650
02:37:40.251 --> 02:37:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Sada and Vada all test them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>St Piss.</v>

3651
02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:46.040
<v Speaker 2>You soughted didn't report anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Commissioned report anything,</v>

3652
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy Foster,</v>

3653
02:37:46.770 --> 02:37:48.980
<v Speaker 2>you clear them to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then Vada did,</v>

3654
02:37:49.010 --> 02:37:51.350
<v Speaker 2>does he found to have better testing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's all the same.</v>

3655
02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:55.330
<v Speaker 2>So how's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think shenanigans with you side</v>

3656
02:37:55.331 --> 02:37:56.920
<v Speaker 2>of yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's shiniest.</v>

3657
02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Here's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

3658
02:37:58.110 --> 02:38:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Here's what no one talks about with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sada in the rule book,</v>

3659
02:38:04.250 --> 02:38:06.170
<v Speaker 2>no matter if it's Picos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever is,</v>

3660
02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:09.320
<v Speaker 2>if you get flagged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if it's from residue,</v>

3661
02:38:09.321 --> 02:38:11.960
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot compete until that is out of</v>

3662
02:38:11.961 --> 02:38:12.620
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

3663
02:38:12.620 --> 02:38:14.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the rule book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black and white.</v>

3664
02:38:14.990 --> 02:38:16.270
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if it's Pico Graham,</v>

3665
02:38:16.271 --> 02:38:17.990
<v Speaker 2>just still good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

3666
02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you understand that he's not</v>

3667
02:38:19.341 --> 02:38:21.400
<v Speaker 2>testing positive for the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids?</v>

3668
02:38:21.410 --> 02:38:22.243
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't matter.</v>

3669
02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:24.620
<v Speaker 2>That tablet in the rule book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't say that.</v>

3670
02:38:25.210 --> 02:38:28.800
<v Speaker 2>It says if you test pop regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your weekend?</v>

3671
02:38:28.801 --> 02:38:31.700
<v Speaker 2>I for the metastasis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we cannot grant you the license to</v>

3672
02:38:31.701 --> 02:38:33.770
<v Speaker 2>compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

3673
02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Which is interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now I'm not saying they should.</v>

3674
02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:38.420
<v Speaker 2>This is why they don't suspect this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3675
02:38:38.421 --> 02:38:42.440
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think why they're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't know exactly how this</v>

3676
02:38:42.441 --> 02:38:43.970
<v Speaker 2>is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they have their,</v>

3677
02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:45.950
<v Speaker 2>their theories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

3678
02:38:45.951 --> 02:38:48.890
<v Speaker 2>it works right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately they don't really know</v>

3679
02:38:48.891 --> 02:38:51.620
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they were to suspend John and he's</v>

3680
02:38:51.621 --> 02:38:53.480
<v Speaker 2>really not taking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can sue the fuck out of him.</v>

3681
02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:55.400
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's what's going well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that.</v>

3682
02:38:55.401 --> 02:38:57.830
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also this concept of</v>
<v Speaker 2>double jeopardy that they've already</v>

3683
02:38:57.831 --> 02:39:01.460
<v Speaker 2>punished him for having this stuff in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>system is no indication that he has</v>

3684
02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:03.860
<v Speaker 2>recently taken it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the only hat,</v>

3685
02:39:03.861 --> 02:39:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

3686
02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:06.170
<v Speaker 2>But they're making the rules up as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>go along,</v>

3687
02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:08.900
<v Speaker 2>which is an issue because if this was</v>
<v Speaker 2>corey Anderson,</v>

3688
02:39:08.930 --> 02:39:11.660
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the same drawing powers.</v>

3689
02:39:11.661 --> 02:39:13.030
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens at Galileo?</v>

3690
02:39:13.130 --> 02:39:14.210
<v Speaker 2>The words word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument,</v>

3691
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:16.250
<v Speaker 2>the evening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're making it up as they go</v>

3692
02:39:16.251 --> 02:39:17.870
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parameters are changing.</v>

3693
02:39:17.900 --> 02:39:20.330
<v Speaker 2>So the ability to test things is</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing.</v>

3694
02:39:20.331 --> 02:39:24.080
<v Speaker 2>So if someone takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you take creatine,</v>

3695
02:39:24.110 --> 02:39:28.040
<v Speaker 2>creatine is tainted and you'd have some</v>
<v Speaker 2>forbidden substance in your system and</v>

3696
02:39:28.041 --> 02:39:31.370
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to only stay in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>system for six months if it's this</v>

3697
02:39:31.371 --> 02:39:34.820
<v Speaker 2>certain stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now the testing gets better and so</v>

3698
02:39:34.821 --> 02:39:39.821
<v Speaker 2>now instead of punishing you for</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you accidentally took and</v>

3699
02:39:40.371 --> 02:39:41.840
<v Speaker 2>then they test you and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3700
02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:43.850
<v Speaker 2>we can prove that you accidentally took</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3701
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:45.710
<v Speaker 2>so we'll only going to give you a six on</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspension,</v>

3702
02:39:45.711 --> 02:39:48.140
<v Speaker 2>but then after the six months is over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could still test it in you.</v>

3703
02:39:48.410 --> 02:39:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the testing has gotten better.</v>

3704
02:39:50.250 --> 02:39:53.060
<v Speaker 2>What do they do now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in the past they would've said,</v>

3705
02:39:53.061 --> 02:39:53.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

3706
02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:54.680
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's time served.</v>

3707
02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:58.400
<v Speaker 2>This is the only argument for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the John Jones thing that makes sense is</v>

3708
02:39:58.401 --> 02:39:59.810
<v Speaker 2>that you don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>

3709
02:39:59.811 --> 02:40:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to punish a guy for</v>
<v Speaker 2>something you've already punished him</v>

3710
02:40:02.871 --> 02:40:05.180
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you proven that it's,</v>

3711
02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:08.420
<v Speaker 2>this is what he took with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the at the rule book is it's you can</v>

3712
02:40:08.421 --> 02:40:12.130
<v Speaker 2>only compete when you pass the tab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You read this rule.</v>

3713
02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3714
02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3715
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:15.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did discussion this morning with me</v>

3716
02:40:15.751 --> 02:40:18.600
<v Speaker 1>and channel went back forth on texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does shale feel about this?</v>

3717
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:21.900
<v Speaker 1>What does he think he shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to compete because his</v>

3718
02:40:21.901 --> 02:40:24.150
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because still show no matter what you</v>

3719
02:40:24.151 --> 02:40:25.310
<v Speaker 1>meant to take it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3720
02:40:25.311 --> 02:40:25.700
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3721
02:40:25.700 --> 02:40:30.150
<v Speaker 1>The rule is if you do not pass the test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't grant you're licensed to fight.</v>

3722
02:40:30.270 --> 02:40:33.560
<v Speaker 1>That is the rules as explained to most</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the fighters separate job.</v>

3723
02:40:33.570 --> 02:40:37.230
<v Speaker 1>The real problem would be is what if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's proven at some point in time,</v>

3724
02:40:37.231 --> 02:40:40.080
<v Speaker 1>let's just say a big for riff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if rather,</v>

3725
02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:43.770
<v Speaker 1>what if it's proven one time that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell if you've ever taken anything</v>

3726
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:47.670
<v Speaker 1>ever your whole life and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>disqualify anyone forever.</v>

3727
02:40:47.671 --> 02:40:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Even if he'd snatch bullshit task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if that happened,</v>

3728
02:40:50.251 --> 02:40:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't have a sport.</v>

3729
02:40:51.991 --> 02:40:53.160
<v Speaker 1>This thing is a weird thing.</v>

3730
02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:54.660
<v Speaker 1>This pulse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the weird thing of the</v>

3731
02:40:54.661 --> 02:40:56.090
<v Speaker 1>metabolite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really understand.</v>

3732
02:40:56.091 --> 02:40:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Here's where it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense.</v>

3733
02:40:57.481 --> 02:41:00.240
<v Speaker 1>With our youth thought of testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Usada testing,</v>

3734
02:41:00.241 --> 02:41:02.610
<v Speaker 1>their parameters are based off a Olympic</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing,</v>

3735
02:41:02.611 --> 02:41:04.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Based off suspending guys two to four</v>

3736
02:41:04.951 --> 02:41:07.170
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how fucked up that is to do a</v>

3737
02:41:07.171 --> 02:41:10.260
<v Speaker 1>fighter like Josh Barnett that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how small is your window?</v>

3738
02:41:10.261 --> 02:41:10.771
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

3739
02:41:10.771 --> 02:41:12.450
<v Speaker 1>the Olympics doesn't come every four</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

3740
02:41:12.470 --> 02:41:13.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a small window.</v>

3741
02:41:13.591 --> 02:41:16.050
<v Speaker 1>You suspend these guys for two to four</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

3742
02:41:16.070 --> 02:41:18.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking silly question.</v>

3743
02:41:20.190 --> 02:41:24.150
<v Speaker 1>But if a guy does juice and he hurts</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone and gets away with it and then</v>

3744
02:41:24.151 --> 02:41:26.640
<v Speaker 1>you catch them like you've been trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to catch up and then you catch him,</v>

3745
02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:29.360
<v Speaker 1>how much should you suspend them for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Save.</v>

3746
02:41:29.370 --> 02:41:34.370
<v Speaker 1>You got a guy who's hired some victor</v>
<v Speaker 1>content type individual back when victor</v>

3747
02:41:34.471 --> 02:41:37.890
<v Speaker 1>was doing this with the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clear and he some guy and this guy</v>

3748
02:41:37.891 --> 02:41:41.070
<v Speaker 1>gets him on some shit that no one knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is and he's just running through</v>

3749
02:41:41.071 --> 02:41:44.450
<v Speaker 1>people and he's looking like Yoel Romero</v>
<v Speaker 1>and smashing people but,</v>

3750
02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:47.700
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy it.</v>

3751
02:41:47.700 --> 02:41:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one day you catch them,</v>

3752
02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:51.570
<v Speaker 1>you spend for food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he shouldn't have a career ever</v>

3753
02:41:51.571 --> 02:41:52.860
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what she does.</v>

3754
02:41:52.890 --> 02:41:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Not with years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

3755
02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Cause we're going based off Olympic</v>
<v Speaker 1>curriculum.</v>

3756
02:41:57.690 --> 02:42:00.270
<v Speaker 1>What's the real question is like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people are cheating?</v>

3757
02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what should the punishment be?</v>

3758
02:42:02.461 --> 02:42:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Should it be based on how many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are cheating or she'd be based on the</v>

3759
02:42:05.521 --> 02:42:07.650
<v Speaker 1>philosophy we're trying to get cheating</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the sport.</v>

3760
02:42:08.010 --> 02:42:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever can get it out.</v>

3761
02:42:09.391 --> 02:42:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And as you cited the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause obviously some shady,</v>

3762
02:42:12.090 --> 02:42:16.740
<v Speaker 1>do you wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you wish that the Japanese were super</v>

3763
02:42:16.741 --> 02:42:19.740
<v Speaker 1>crazy strict about steroids back before</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride?</v>

3764
02:42:19.890 --> 02:42:20.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3765
02:42:20.910 --> 02:42:21.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3766
02:42:21.530 --> 02:42:22.351
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a fan,</v>

3767
02:42:22.351 --> 02:42:24.600
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you saw as really wouldn't have</v>

3768
02:42:24.601 --> 02:42:25.490
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3769
02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:30.600
<v Speaker 1>So Anderson was making a point the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day in a rational point for letting a</v>

3770
02:42:30.601 --> 02:42:33.210
<v Speaker 1>guy like him take something so that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could recover.</v>

3771
02:42:33.810 --> 02:42:34.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's 40 years old,</v>

3772
02:42:34.891 --> 02:42:36.840
<v Speaker 1>he still enjoys fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his body doesn't produce</v>

<v Speaker 1>got to pass over.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was like a conspiracy theory was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3798
02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:39.910
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It just got exploited in,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And now it's too strict and it's fucking</v>

<v Speaker 3>rocks?</v>

3818
02:44:21.101 --> 02:44:24.100
<v Speaker 3>It's just making it more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll put the money elsewhere.</v>

3819
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:26.470
<v Speaker 3>It's honestly not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do about steroid testing?</v>

<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

3825
02:44:38.801 --> 02:44:43.600
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know if there wasn't a Usada</v>
<v Speaker 3>and state would have their own,</v>

3826
02:44:44.620 --> 02:44:47.040
<v Speaker 3>the commission would be responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3827
02:44:47.050 --> 02:44:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is it?</v>

3828
02:44:48.670 --> 02:44:49.900

<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3829

3830
02:44:52.270 --> 02:44:53.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't do it weeks before.</v>

02:47:35.090 --> 02:47:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Bob Sapp is up to lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

<v Speaker 1>scouts to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a real problem in Japan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh for the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>wouldn't let him sign a contract before</v>

3912
02:47:50.541 --> 02:47:51.171
<v Speaker 1>he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3913
02:47:51.171 --> 02:47:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fighting without a contract.</v>

<v Speaker 1>first you fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we give you a contract.</v>

3916
02:47:58.971 --> 02:48:03.380
<v Speaker 1>was the end of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Sapp would become a huge star in</v>

3917
02:48:03.381 --> 02:48:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Japan and I don't think he'd do in</v>

<v Speaker 1>because he was literally 370 pounds with</v>

3925
02:48:27.411 --> 02:48:30.290

02:49:17.111 --> 02:49:18.480
<v Speaker 1>land and I'm on his head.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bob Sapp was so big,</v>

3948
02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:33.060
<v Speaker 1>so ginormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a nightmare.</v>

3949
02:49:33.061 --> 02:49:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because he was on everything,</v>

3950
02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:41.430
<v Speaker 1>his fucking cardio wasn't the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that best fighter's heart.</v>

3951

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3954
02:49:48.241 --> 02:49:50.480
<v Speaker 1>That was an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't fight it for a while.</v>

3955
02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3956

<v Speaker 1>beatings and he's like,</v>

3957
02:49:53.461 --> 02:49:54.630
<v Speaker 1>gets it good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's enough.</v>

3976
02:50:39.181 --> 02:50:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember this movie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am DB that did I know my database.</v>

3978
02:50:45.690 --> 02:50:48.630
<v Speaker 1>It's useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get nineties references for four days.</v>

3979
02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:52.050
<v Speaker 1>So we wrapped this pitch up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think so man Pinto around me out</v>

3980
02:50:52.310 --> 02:50:54.600
<v Speaker 1>fade or it didn't bum me out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3982
02:50:57.030 --> 02:51:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Suck them off so hard before that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for corrals it's a great thing.</v>

3983
02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:03.000
<v Speaker 1>And for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for martial arts,</v>

3984
02:51:03.001 --> 02:51:06.930
<v Speaker 1>when something like that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every young fighter gets another little</v>

3985
02:51:06.931 --> 02:51:11.370
<v Speaker 1>piece of information in his database of</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that he can at least view,</v>

3986
02:51:11.670 --> 02:51:14.670
<v Speaker 1>maybe not have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but view and put that in your mind.</v>

3987
02:51:14.700 --> 02:51:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what happens when you throw</v>

3988
02:51:16.741 --> 02:51:19.650
<v Speaker 1>caution to the wind and you just slug it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with somebody.</v>

3989
02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:22.170
<v Speaker 1>When you just slug it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stand right in front of somebody.</v>

3990
02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get knocked out to bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea and you know,</v>

3991
02:51:25.860 --> 02:51:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was winning the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up until that moment he'd cracked the</v>

3992
02:51:28.711 --> 02:51:29.610
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had hurt him,</v>

3993
02:51:29.611 --> 02:51:32.760
<v Speaker 1>he looked amazing and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's standing.</v>

3994
02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's still human.</v>

3995
02:51:35.640 --> 02:51:39.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's just the reality of being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being that's fighting and I'm</v>

3996
02:51:39.181 --> 02:51:41.190
<v Speaker 1>bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3997
02:51:41.370 --> 02:51:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know the guy,</v>

3998
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3999
02:51:45.090 --> 02:51:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that I think those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those experiences,</v>

4000
02:51:48.871 --> 02:51:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4001
02:51:50.701 --> 02:51:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Cause it happened again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting knocked down for anybody got</v>

4002
02:51:53.221 --> 02:51:54.670
<v Speaker 1>hurt bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

4003
02:51:54.671 --> 02:51:59.671
<v Speaker 1>it's valuable for all of us to take in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when,</v>

4004
02:52:00.270 --> 02:52:01.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4005
02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:03.510
<v Speaker 1>every time I got gets knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

4006
02:52:03.511 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 1>it's valuable for the overall database</v>
<v Speaker 1>of martial</v>

4007
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:06.813
<v Speaker 2>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4008
02:52:07.090 --> 02:52:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Even a striker Mirko Cro cop has decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>on at least two fights,</v>

4009
02:52:14.561 --> 02:52:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he decided,</v>

4010
02:52:15.821 --> 02:52:18.160
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a better shot taken this</v>

4011
02:52:18.161 --> 02:52:19.390
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4012
02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:22.700
<v Speaker 2>And throwing elbows on the ground from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Taco Taco.</v>

4013
02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:25.210
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like a strategy that he</v>

4014
02:52:25.211 --> 02:52:26.044
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

4015
02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:29.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting clipped every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Russian roulette.</v>

4016
02:52:29.230 --> 02:52:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Even he's one of the greatest strikers</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all time,</v>

4017
02:52:31.690 --> 02:52:33.580
<v Speaker 2>one of the most dangerous motherfuckers</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

4018
02:52:33.730 --> 02:52:36.280
<v Speaker 2>And he even got to the point where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

4019
02:52:36.430 --> 02:52:38.470
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'll have a better shot taking</v>

4020
02:52:38.471 --> 02:52:42.160
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker down and smashed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even vandelay Silva did that once or</v>

4021
02:52:42.161 --> 02:52:42.994
<v Speaker 2>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4022
02:52:43.470 --> 02:52:47.520
<v Speaker 2>You remember when cro cop fought random</v>
<v Speaker 2>and random and chaotic and random mom</v>

4023
02:52:47.521 --> 02:52:50.410
<v Speaker 2>was known as more of a wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4024
02:52:50.590 --> 02:52:52.110
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking stud athlete.</v>

4025
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best sport.</v>

4026
02:52:55.810 --> 02:52:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly the craziest to watch me</v>

4027
02:52:57.821 --> 02:52:58.720
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pico got knocked out.</v>

4028
02:52:58.721 --> 02:53:00.640
<v Speaker 2>We all jumped out of our chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fell on the ground.</v>

4029
02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:03.820
<v Speaker 2>We all walked around on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

4030
02:53:04.730 --> 02:53:06.700
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy fucking sport,</v>

4031
02:53:06.701 --> 02:53:08.200
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A crazy sport.</v>

4032
02:53:08.730 --> 02:53:10.630
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is it that we all work in it</v>

4033
02:53:10.631 --> 02:53:11.560
<v Speaker 2>somehow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened?</v>

4034
02:53:11.561 --> 02:53:15.610
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family is fucking still confused.</v>

4035
02:53:16.920 --> 02:53:21.730
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck is anybody paying you tie</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to fight?</v>

4036
02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pulling it off.</v>

4037
02:53:23.831 --> 02:53:25.300
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My family does not,</v>

4038
02:53:25.320 --> 02:53:28.720
<v Speaker 2>does not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left my family as a musician,</v>

4039
02:53:28.810 --> 02:53:32.650
<v Speaker 2>not theirs as a pussy who never got into</v>
<v Speaker 2>any fights.</v>

4040
02:53:32.800 --> 02:53:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I got in a couple of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't known as a fighter.</v>

4041
02:53:36.190 --> 02:53:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4042
02:53:36.980 --> 02:53:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrestled a couple of years so I</v>

4043
02:53:39.280 --> 02:53:41.920
<v Speaker 2>thought I was cheating when I would find</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just double legged d dude and</v>

4044
02:53:41.921 --> 02:53:44.300
<v Speaker 2>punch him in the stomach until the</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher broke it up tight.</v>

4045
02:53:44.350 --> 02:53:49.350
<v Speaker 2>But I was never ever considered a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous guy at all by my family,</v>

4046
02:53:49.690 --> 02:53:52.780
<v Speaker 2>by my closest friends that I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even today they're like,</v>

4047
02:53:52.781 --> 02:53:53.950
<v Speaker 2>they still like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4048
02:53:53.951 --> 02:53:56.900
<v Speaker 2>How did you pull that off dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

4049
02:53:56.910 --> 02:53:57.491
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

4050
02:53:57.491 --> 02:53:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got lucky.</v>

4051
02:54:00.610 --> 02:54:03.610
<v Speaker 2>You paid attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know I got fucking lucky.</v>

4052
02:54:03.630 --> 02:54:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Good pat though because it shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody that if you really just learn</v>

4053
02:54:07.901 --> 02:54:09.760
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get good at it.</v>

4054
02:54:09.790 --> 02:54:12.850
<v Speaker 2>You keep getting better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep acquiring information,</v>

4055
02:54:12.851 --> 02:54:15.460
<v Speaker 2>testing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really being obsessed with it.</v>

4056
02:54:15.490 --> 02:54:18.700
<v Speaker 2>You eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day after years of training,</v>

4057
02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:22.810
<v Speaker 2>you become a fucking wizard at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is in comparison to how you</v>

4058
02:54:22.811 --> 02:54:25.420
<v Speaker 2>were when you first started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what you do,</v>

4059
02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:28.750
<v Speaker 2>like stand up like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you doing standup to your dude.</v>

4060
02:54:28.751 --> 02:54:32.230
<v Speaker 2>You did two years in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did a fucking showtime special.</v>

4061
02:54:32.230 --> 02:54:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Me and Brian were in the back room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were shaking our head.</v>

4062
02:54:34.421 --> 02:54:37.520
<v Speaker 2>He's like two years anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

4063
02:54:37.630 --> 02:54:40.390
<v Speaker 2>But you put in the fucking work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you started out,</v>

4064
02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:42.820
<v Speaker 2>you were uncomfortable at first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got better and better.</v>

4065
02:54:42.821 --> 02:54:45.100
<v Speaker 2>You kept working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He chipped away at it.</v>

4066
02:54:45.101 --> 02:54:47.710
<v Speaker 2>You were constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly doing sets,</v>

4067
02:54:47.711 --> 02:54:50.590
<v Speaker 2>constantly going over your material and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pulled it off.</v>

4068
02:54:50.650 --> 02:54:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Got The nma work ethic with comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4069
02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:57.120
<v Speaker 2>and it pro athlete f work ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

4070
02:54:57.220 --> 02:54:59.650
<v Speaker 2>it's that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good for people to see.</v>

4071
02:54:59.890 --> 02:55:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I know it feels bad if you're not doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything in your life.</v>

4072
02:55:02.321 --> 02:55:04.190
<v Speaker 2>And I was one of the things that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>do when they hate,</v>

4073
02:55:04.460 --> 02:55:05.660
<v Speaker 2>once these two people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they hate,</v>

4074
02:55:05.661 --> 02:55:08.660
<v Speaker 2>like if you're kicking ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get upset because they're not and</v>

4075
02:55:08.690 --> 02:55:11.180
<v Speaker 2>they're looking at you like you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>that good or you're not that this.</v>

4076
02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:14.420
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes those criticisms are valid,</v>

4077
02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:17.210
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why they're expressing them</v>

4078
02:55:17.211 --> 02:55:19.970
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as exuberantly as they are is because</v>

4079
02:55:19.971 --> 02:55:23.330
<v Speaker 2>they're find flaws in their own life</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't like to address.</v>

4080
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:25.010
<v Speaker 2>And when they see someone that's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4081
02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:26.530
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go after them.</v>

4082
02:55:26.570 --> 02:55:30.260
<v Speaker 2>They shit on what I'm trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's natural.</v>

4083
02:55:30.261 --> 02:55:31.280
<v Speaker 2>It is an incident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Natural.</v>

4084
02:55:32.180 --> 02:55:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to say though is for all</v>

4085
02:55:34.191 --> 02:55:37.910
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just stop putting any energy into</v>

4086
02:55:37.911 --> 02:55:40.040
<v Speaker 2>that stock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help you.</v>

4087
02:55:40.041 --> 02:55:42.050
<v Speaker 2>I've done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it when I was younger.</v>

4088
02:55:42.051 --> 02:55:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I 100% guilty of what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a waste.</v>

4089
02:55:44.900 --> 02:55:48.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just get better at stuff,</v>

4090
02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:49.730
<v Speaker 2>just find a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4091
02:55:49.731 --> 02:55:52.760
<v Speaker 2>That if can see too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's stand up comedy or whatever it</v>

4092
02:55:52.761 --> 02:55:55.100
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just find that thing and keep going.</v>

4093
02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My fave trade or getting better.</v>

4094
02:55:57.320 --> 02:55:59.480
<v Speaker 2>My favorite is when people go rogue and</v>
<v Speaker 2>righteous shit.</v>

4095
02:55:59.481 --> 02:56:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4097
02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what he did.</v>

4098
02:56:03.580 --> 02:56:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I had the time to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4099
02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:07.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm barely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my own comedy.</v>

4100
02:56:07.310 --> 02:56:09.390
<v Speaker 2>He's given my perspective and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing it.</v>

4101
02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:12.530
<v Speaker 2>You fucking bad to stare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is impossible.</v>

4102
02:56:12.690 --> 02:56:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Impossible comedy doesn't work that</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

4103
02:56:15.231 --> 02:56:17.790
<v Speaker 2>You know who did do that though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a lot of guys will definitely do</v>

4104
02:56:17.791 --> 02:56:20.150
<v Speaker 2>that for Chris Rock was Richard Jeni,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard,</v>

4105
02:56:20.151 --> 02:56:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Jenny would tighten up dudes material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

4106
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:24.770
<v Speaker 2>you would punch it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4107
02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:28.100
<v Speaker 2>you would go do sets and he would sit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of the room and he'd watch it.</v>

4108
02:56:28.101 --> 02:56:29.090
<v Speaker 2>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to drop that.</v>

4109
02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:30.500
<v Speaker 2>You've got to drop that to get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4112
02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:38.390
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of cool like a cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some guys have done that,</v>

4113

<v Speaker 2>crusher where like I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't say do this.</v>

4115
02:56:44.661 --> 02:56:45.580
<v Speaker 2>He'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's too long here.</v>

4117
02:56:46.820 --> 02:56:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4118
02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:49.490
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Focused on this and do this.</v>

4119
02:56:49.850 --> 02:56:54.230
<v Speaker 2>They meaning like focus on all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this back when I did,</v>

4120
02:56:54.380 --> 02:56:55.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4121
02:56:55.610 --> 02:56:58.100
<v Speaker 2>those few open mics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 15 years ago,</v>

4122
02:56:58.101 --> 02:57:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I remember I bombed so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one set and the r that you just</v>

4123
02:57:03.051 --> 02:57:05.900
<v Speaker 2>grabbed me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow me and you just drag me to the</v>

4124
02:57:05.901 --> 02:57:06.900
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to tell you,</v>

4125
02:57:07.570 --> 02:57:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was high and I had to tell you why</v>

4126
02:57:10.221 --> 02:57:11.720
<v Speaker 2>it was because when you're high like</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>

4127
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:14.930
<v Speaker 2>they're slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mad not mad at you.</v>

4128
02:57:14.931 --> 02:57:16.830
<v Speaker 2>I was never mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never mad at you.</v>

4129
02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:18.541
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4130
02:57:18.541 --> 02:57:19.640
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not disappointed.</v>

4131
02:57:19.641 --> 02:57:21.410
<v Speaker 2>But I recognize what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I had done it.</v>

4132
02:57:21.650 --> 02:57:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I've done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went in there,</v>

4133
02:57:23.121 --> 02:57:25.310
<v Speaker 2>it didn't go well and then you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>crashed and burned.</v>

4134
02:57:25.990 --> 02:57:28.130
<v Speaker 2>But what happened with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is interesting,</v>

4135
02:57:28.131 --> 02:57:30.890
<v Speaker 2>is you got really good at talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly.</v>

4136
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:34.220
<v Speaker 2>And as you got better at talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly and doing classes and teaching</v>

4137
02:57:34.221 --> 02:57:36.140
<v Speaker 2>classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then a transition back to,</v>

4138
02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:38.600
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stand up comedy actually made sense</v>

4139
02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:42.080
<v Speaker 2>because now you weren't nervous at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>because before you were always really</v>

4140
02:57:42.081 --> 02:57:44.690
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the hard part was you being yourself</v>

4141
02:57:44.810 --> 02:57:46.680
<v Speaker 2>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's uh,</v>

4142
02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:48.020
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still,</v>

4143
02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:51.470
<v Speaker 2>and I had no public speaking experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's huge.</v>

4144
02:57:51.710 --> 02:57:54.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be rose zero public</v>

4145
02:57:54.081 --> 02:57:56.840
<v Speaker 2>speaking experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I knew it and I thought,</v>

4146
02:57:56.841 --> 02:57:59.540
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to really spend a lot</v>

4147
02:57:59.541 --> 02:58:01.220
<v Speaker 2>of fucking time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4148
02:58:01.470 --> 02:58:02.970
<v Speaker 2>with this if I'm going to do it right.</v>

4149
02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:04.770
<v Speaker 2>And I just didn't want to spend the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

4150
02:58:04.771 --> 02:58:05.730
<v Speaker 2>so I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

4151
02:58:05.731 --> 02:58:07.470
<v Speaker 2>I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just focus on Jujitsu.</v>

4152
02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:08.161
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could do,</v>

4153
02:58:08.161 --> 02:58:09.390
<v Speaker 2>if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone,</v>

4154
02:58:09.450 --> 02:58:14.450
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to do it eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you could get joey diaz to for</v>

4155
02:58:14.591 --> 02:58:14.871
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4156
02:58:14.871 --> 02:58:19.080
<v Speaker 2>his comedy to come off on a special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the same way he had all of us in</v>

4157
02:58:19.081 --> 02:58:21.180
<v Speaker 2>the back of the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing some of that story.</v>

4158
02:58:21.330 --> 02:58:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm town,</v>

4159
02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you after the show my,</v>

4160
02:58:25.180 --> 02:58:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I thought I broke my rib the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>

4161
02:58:27.121 --> 02:58:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I was laughing so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in tears.</v>

4162
02:58:29.180 --> 02:58:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a plan.</v>

4163
02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:34.470
<v Speaker 2>My rebuttal was Ari and I were literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>just texting right before the show</v>

4164
02:58:34.471 --> 02:58:36.150
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of watches Netflix</v>

4165
02:58:36.151 --> 02:58:37.500
<v Speaker 2>special and not that anything's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

4166
02:58:37.501 --> 02:58:38.760
<v Speaker 2>he's still a fucking monster.</v>

4167
02:58:38.910 --> 02:58:42.880
<v Speaker 2>But if you could capture that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get that game over best in the world,</v>

4168
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:45.330
<v Speaker 2>those netflix specials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing is a half an hour set</v>

4169
02:58:45.331 --> 02:58:47.340
<v Speaker 2>they're doing with a bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that they probably don't work</v>

4170
02:58:47.341 --> 02:58:50.130
<v Speaker 2>with a lot and they have two shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the first show and then they</v>

4171
02:58:50.131 --> 02:58:53.190
<v Speaker 2>have second show and sometimes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work out as well.</v>

4172
02:58:53.220 --> 02:58:54.990
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're under pressure.</v>

4173
02:58:55.140 --> 02:58:57.390
<v Speaker 2>It feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not used to the crab.</v>

4174
02:58:57.391 --> 02:58:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience's lit up in a weird way.</v>

4175
02:58:59.970 --> 02:59:03.570
<v Speaker 2>It also gets lost in the shuffle though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause there's a ton of them on there.</v>

4176
02:59:03.571 --> 02:59:04.830
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Joey,</v>

4177
02:59:04.950 --> 02:59:06.950
<v Speaker 2>he's in with a bunch of other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

4178
02:59:06.951 --> 02:59:09.690
<v Speaker 2>you can't fault that because the ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stand out,</v>

4179
02:59:09.691 --> 02:59:11.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean look at whether you like it or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

4180
02:59:11.521 --> 02:59:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Nanette thing from Hannah Gatsby.</v>

4181
02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:17.160
<v Speaker 2>I still haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know what stood out in a lot of</v>

4182
02:59:17.161 --> 02:59:19.050
<v Speaker 2>people liked it or not though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4183
02:59:19.080 --> 02:59:20.520
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was other ones that didn't</v>

4184
02:59:20.521 --> 02:59:22.680
<v Speaker 2>stand out for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they stood out because people really</v>

4185
02:59:22.681 --> 02:59:23.930
<v Speaker 2>responded to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

4186
02:59:23.931 --> 02:59:26.280
<v Speaker 2>yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean tom selling out these places</v>

4187
02:59:26.281 --> 02:59:28.600
<v Speaker 2>because people responded so well to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>

4188
02:59:28.920 --> 02:59:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4189
02:59:29.340 --> 02:59:29.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4190
02:59:29.980 --> 02:59:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Netflix is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying,</v>

4191
02:59:31.110 --> 02:59:33.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying how his was released in</v>
<v Speaker 2>degenerates.</v>

4192
02:59:33.690 --> 02:59:36.660
<v Speaker 2>There's eight 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a package,</v>

4193
02:59:36.700 --> 02:59:41.200
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't give us a lot about</v>

4194
02:59:41.460 --> 02:59:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Neal Brennan special from people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch three months while he was on</v>

4195
02:59:44.161 --> 02:59:44.994
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

4196
02:59:45.300 --> 02:59:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Comedians in the world.</v>

4197
02:59:48.590 --> 02:59:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Brendan's event set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil Brennan Ready.</v>

4198
02:59:51.870 --> 02:59:54.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to say anything about his new</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff because they'll give away the</v>

4199
02:59:54.001 --> 02:59:55.640
<v Speaker 2>premises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's murdered that he's,</v>

4200
02:59:55.760 --> 02:59:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not super impressed with Neal</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brennan.</v>

4201
02:59:58.570 --> 02:59:59.311
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

4202
02:59:59.311 --> 03:00:00.510
<v Speaker 2>this is the funniest I've ever heard</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

4203
03:00:00.750 --> 03:00:01.561
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4204
03:00:01.561 --> 03:00:04.020
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very good.</v>

4205
03:00:04.050 --> 03:00:06.330
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely the best one I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far on that,</v>

4206
03:00:06.480 --> 03:00:08.310
<v Speaker 2>on that speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very smart man.</v>

4207
03:00:08.340 --> 03:00:10.620
<v Speaker 2>He's very smart and his new stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 2>excellent.</v>

4208
03:00:10.880 --> 03:00:13.490
<v Speaker 2>She has isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his analogy of Isis,</v>

4209
03:00:14.310 --> 03:00:15.120
<v Speaker 2>don't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

4211
03:00:16.020 --> 03:00:18.480
<v Speaker 2>He punches up a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your favorite comedians?</v>

4212
03:00:18.481 --> 03:00:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ellen's rock.</v>

03:00:21.151 --> 03:00:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Chris Rock's Whitney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was Dave Chappelle's writing partner</v>

4215
03:00:26.010 --> 03:00:27.050
<v Speaker 2>for the Chapelle show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4216
03:00:27.550 --> 03:00:28.920
<v Speaker 2>that was back when we were friends with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

4217
03:00:28.950 --> 03:00:31.560
<v Speaker 2>He hadn't even done stand up yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that when we hung out with them</v>

4218
03:00:31.561 --> 03:00:33.900
<v Speaker 2>in New York and he came with me when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

4219
03:00:33.901 --> 03:00:35.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fear factor,</v>

4220

<v Speaker 2>Chappelle sketch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did a weird ass warehouse.</v>

4221
03:00:39.630 --> 03:00:43.080
<v Speaker 2>How long ago was this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>2004.</v>

4222
03:00:43.081 --> 03:00:44.970
<v Speaker 2>It was a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it even,</v>

4223
03:00:44.971 --> 03:00:49.971
<v Speaker 2>it might might've been three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we fly out to New York and they're</v>

4224
03:00:51.090 --> 03:00:55.320
<v Speaker 2>filming all day in this fucking old ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>warehouse with no windows and it's</v>

4225
03:00:55.321 --> 03:00:58.860
<v Speaker 2>freezing every bodies in winter coats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had a,</v>

4226
03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:02.800
<v Speaker 2>like one of those burner here,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the crackhead character,</v>

4231

4233
03:01:21.911 --> 03:01:24.100
<v Speaker 2>day and he's trying to tell him about</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

4234
03:01:24.101 --> 03:01:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Like he introduced me to Dave Chappelle</v>
<v Speaker 2>and goes,</v>

4235
03:01:26.020 --> 03:01:29.180
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just tapped Hoya gracie and uh,</v>

4236
03:01:29.230 --> 03:01:31.330
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

4239
03:01:35.620 --> 03:01:38.200
<v Speaker 2>every time we ran into each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the day,</v>

4240
03:01:38.201 --> 03:01:39.990
<v Speaker 2>he'd look at me and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tap wise.</v>

4241
03:01:39.990 --> 03:01:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Grazie he was just staring at us over</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over.</v>

4242
03:01:46.331 --> 03:01:49.730
<v Speaker 2>He would say the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder why it took so long to get into</v>

4243
03:01:49.750 --> 03:01:52.090
<v Speaker 2>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a brilliant mom.</v>

4244
03:01:52.180 --> 03:01:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I think he sat back and watched it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably thought he could do it and then</v>

4245
03:01:55.991 --> 03:01:56.531
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no on,</v>

<v Speaker 2>up with him last night.</v>

4250
03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I just saw Sebastian special yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last night.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we've seen him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just one of the regulars at the</v>

4254
03:02:14.381 --> 03:02:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Olr when we'd go in like right after</v>

<v Speaker 2>He just chose that one four shows at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison Square Garden.</v>

4256
03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:23.730

<v Speaker 2>thousand people a show.</v>

03:02:23.731 --> 03:02:28.120
<v Speaker 2>He showed us</v>

4258
03:02:28.121 --> 03:02:29.650

4261
03:02:33.071 --> 03:02:34.920
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be number one fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>gas.</v>

4262
03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Seinfeld's saying hold my beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4264
03:02:37.331 --> 03:02:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Sipho can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't sell out four shows at Madison</v>

4265
03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Square Garden like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might sell at one flip.</v>

4266
03:02:42.910 --> 03:02:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Foresoft for is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's guys like Louis C K and</v>

4267
03:02:46.410 --> 03:02:49.960
<v Speaker 2>capturing hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Louie c Kathy sold out two in a row.</v>

4268
03:02:50.170 --> 03:02:53.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he ever did like four like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and Chappelle's copyright to it and</v>

4269
03:02:53.231 --> 03:02:55.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a weekend dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He saw out for it.</v>

4270
03:02:56.380 --> 03:02:58.090
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

4271
03:02:58.091 --> 03:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>It's almost unprecedent dice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it die?</v>

4272
03:03:00.191 --> 03:03:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Sold out Madison Square Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many times?</v>

4273
03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

4274
03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Hart's for coming onto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about dice that you always</v>

4275
03:03:06.401 --> 03:03:09.430
<v Speaker 2>have to give up is at dice was z numero</v>
<v Speaker 2>uno.</v>

4276
03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Nobody did that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody did anything like that before</v>

4277
03:03:12.520 --> 03:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>with dice done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he did,</v>

4278
03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>he would sell out arenas when nobody had</v>
<v Speaker 2>even heard about doing this before.</v>

4279
03:03:18.700 --> 03:03:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Nassau Coliseum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even Eddie Murphy's dice.</v>

4280
03:03:21.220 --> 03:03:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Dice Murphy was close though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4281
03:03:23.650 --> 03:03:27.070
<v Speaker 2>He was until he stopped doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he never quite reached the heights</v>

4282
03:03:27.071 --> 03:03:29.650
<v Speaker 2>at dice did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dice was absolutely without a doubt.</v>

4283
03:03:29.651 --> 03:03:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Unprecedented cause I remember it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening as I was getting into standup,</v>

4284
03:03:34.540 --> 03:03:38.680
<v Speaker 2>but so he as I was getting into standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>dice was selling out arenas and he would</v>

4285
03:03:38.681 --> 03:03:41.380
<v Speaker 2>sell them out like two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three nights in a row and they just had</v>

4286
03:03:41.381 --> 03:03:43.780
<v Speaker 2>done hundreds of arena shows all over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>

4287
03:03:43.781 --> 03:03:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean nobody had been like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every before everybody was doing like</v>

4288
03:03:47.561 --> 03:03:51.700
<v Speaker 2>places that I used to do this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a different version,</v>

4289
03:03:51.701 --> 03:03:54.760
<v Speaker 2>a newer like cleaned up version of dice</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

4290
03:03:54.761 --> 03:03:55.870
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they used to go on the road</v>

4291
03:03:55.871 --> 03:03:57.220
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sebastian,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and he did eight and he came to the back</v>

<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and a half later he came backstage.</v>

4303

<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

4306
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:31.850
<v Speaker 1>He just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

4307
03:04:32.710 --> 03:04:34.790
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>

4308

4309
03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:38.720

<v Speaker 1>So I walked out through the green room</v>

4310
03:04:38.721 --> 03:04:40.640
<v Speaker 1>door onto the stage and the audience is</v>

4320
03:04:56.001 --> 03:04:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should go out.</v>

4321
03:04:58.490 --> 03:04:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He used to do stand up and then he</v>

4323
03:05:03.321 --> 03:05:04.970
<v Speaker 1>stopped doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it.</v>

4324
03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:09.980
<v Speaker 1>He had a regular job too and he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't doing it as much in need.</v>

4325
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he was drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know him when I know him.</v>

4326
03:05:12.200 --> 03:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Good guy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like him a lot.</v>

4328
03:05:16.250 --> 03:05:17.630

<v Speaker 1>Hopefully figure it out,</v>

4329
03:05:17.660 --> 03:05:20.240
<v Speaker 1>but like it's fucking hard man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even harder in England,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to make of New England.</v>

4331
03:05:21.620 --> 03:05:23.210

<v Speaker 1>it's not as easy as it is.</v>

4332
03:05:23.270 --> 03:05:26.780
<v Speaker 1>If you ever had like just a nightmare</v>
<v Speaker 1>show like that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Not that one of my one hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm on the road,</v>

4335

4336
03:05:33.580 --> 03:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the comedy story,</v>

4337
03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I've ate all the ticks in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

4338
03:05:40.330 --> 03:05:42.740
<v Speaker 1>coming to see you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4339

<v Speaker 1>When I'm on the road though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are my people.</v>

4340

03:08:14.070 --> 03:08:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I was beaming like half the way home</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I started getting tired.</v>

4411
03:08:16.890 --> 03:08:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I was super happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so happy.</v>

4412
03:08:20.270 --> 03:08:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Where does it come out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4413
03:08:23.130 --> 03:08:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I would say may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may or April.</v>

4414
03:08:26.490 --> 03:08:31.440
<v Speaker 1>So you got a tour now and then try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work in new material while you're</v>

4415
03:08:31.441 --> 03:08:33.090
<v Speaker 1>touring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

4416
03:08:33.140 --> 03:08:33.541
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4417
03:08:33.541 --> 03:08:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going on the road to March.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have and you're gonna be like,</v>

4418
03:08:37.261 --> 03:08:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost have seen because I record this</v>

4419
03:08:40.221 --> 03:08:42.040
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with that man.</v>

4420
03:08:42.450 --> 03:08:43.620
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>

4421
03:08:43.770 --> 03:08:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll still do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I have to do certain bids when</v>

4422
03:08:46.651 --> 03:08:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I did the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to get at least 30</v>

4423
03:08:49.861 --> 03:08:52.010
<v Speaker 1>minutes before you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4424
03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a bad idea to do the road</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you still can because you can make</v>

4425
03:08:56.551 --> 03:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>money doing clubs and theaters and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different than reps.</v>

4426
03:09:00.360 --> 03:09:03.930
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strategy that I always employed,</v>

4427
03:09:03.931 --> 03:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not the best one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do whatever you want,</v>

4428
03:09:05.821 --> 03:09:08.820
<v Speaker 1>but what I like to do is do a bit that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know works and then some new shit and</v>

4429
03:09:08.821 --> 03:09:10.410
<v Speaker 1>then a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we're responding to new shit.</v>

4430
03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Shit Sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

4431
03:09:13.250 --> 03:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually after events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4432
03:09:15.120 --> 03:09:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I turned that shit into beef jerky and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then eventually it's a steak.</v>

4433
03:09:18.510 --> 03:09:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just takes time.</v>

4434
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the best way I've found is</v>

4435
03:09:22.600 --> 03:09:24.330
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to give him some stuff that's</v>

4436
03:09:24.331 --> 03:09:26.820
<v Speaker 1>100% legit or have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

4437
03:09:26.850 --> 03:09:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I definitely still do workout sets like</v>
<v Speaker 1>in town where there's fucking around.</v>

4438
03:09:30.811 --> 03:09:33.240
<v Speaker 1>But even now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I do a workout side of the</v>

4439
03:09:33.241 --> 03:09:35.280
<v Speaker 1>store?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of times it's mobbed,</v>

4440
03:09:35.281 --> 03:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a story.</v>

4441
03:09:36.961 --> 03:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Can I can't do my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom and that made them good shit.</v>

4442
03:09:40.830 --> 03:09:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And you go on stage and they go fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

4443
03:09:42.481 --> 03:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Like they'd got babysitters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

4444
03:09:44.520 --> 03:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I got a plan cause that horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

4445
03:09:46.351 --> 03:09:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Literally the next morning I woke up at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst thing,</v>

4446
03:09:48.261 --> 03:09:48.720
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4447
03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I come up with all new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4448
03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I got a plan cause I feel better about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4449
03:09:52.051 --> 03:09:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't bump people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I understand</v>

4450
03:09:54.460 --> 03:09:59.410
<v Speaker 2>it because with a guy like Chris Rock or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis C K or a lot of the guys that</v>

4451
03:09:59.411 --> 03:10:00.580
<v Speaker 2>would would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4452
03:10:01.030 --> 03:10:03.550
<v Speaker 2>when I say bump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not thought of as a negative thing.</v>

4453
03:10:03.580 --> 03:10:06.160
<v Speaker 2>It's thought of as a negative thing if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really don't deserve it.</v>

4454
03:10:06.400 --> 03:10:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a certain person who</v>

4455
03:10:07.811 --> 03:10:10.360
<v Speaker 2>tried to bump people and people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking guy is pumping people.</v>

4456
03:10:11.080 --> 03:10:14.860
<v Speaker 2>But you know if Chris rock shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally most people just let them go</v>

4457
03:10:14.861 --> 03:10:18.350
<v Speaker 2>on stage and Dave Chapelle perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>example and it just let him go.</v>

4458
03:10:18.351 --> 03:10:20.110
<v Speaker 2>He's already spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's awesome.</v>

4459
03:10:20.111 --> 03:10:21.910
<v Speaker 2>It's complete respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what it is,</v>

4460
03:10:21.911 --> 03:10:26.770
<v Speaker 2>it's how they managed to try stand up</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they know it's not their audience.</v>

4461
03:10:26.890 --> 03:10:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Like they're famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like every audience is</v>

4462
03:10:29.291 --> 03:10:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Dave Chappelle's audience home games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's how you develop material</v>

4463
03:10:33.640 --> 03:10:36.940
<v Speaker 2>because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people are common to see you 100% and</v>

4464
03:10:36.941 --> 03:10:39.430
<v Speaker 2>then you feel more inclined to do new</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

4465
03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:43.090
<v Speaker 2>whereas if you just drop it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you could work on new</v>

4466
03:10:43.091 --> 03:10:45.550
<v Speaker 2>stuff better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people come to see rather you,</v>

4467
03:10:45.570 --> 03:10:47.800
<v Speaker 2>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do stuff that's tried</v>

4468
03:10:47.801 --> 03:10:48.634
<v Speaker 2>and proven.</v>

4469
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:52.730
<v Speaker 3>I caught him last his and it was in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I was leaving and I pass by and I'm</v>

4470
03:10:52.731 --> 03:10:53.960
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

4471
03:10:54.230 --> 03:10:57.590
<v Speaker 3>Dave Chappelle's onstage and everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4472
03:10:57.591 --> 03:11:02.591
<v Speaker 3>there was so much God damn loving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive energy in that room because,</v>

4473
03:11:03.170 --> 03:11:07.340
<v Speaker 3>and he was just sitting on a chair</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking a cigarette and he was just</v>

4474
03:11:07.341 --> 03:11:11.780
<v Speaker 3>standing recruiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said people lost their fucking mind.</v>

4475
03:11:11.781 --> 03:11:13.910
<v Speaker 3>Like one line he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would just sit there,</v>

4476
03:11:18.450 --> 03:11:20.790
<v Speaker 3>don't ever tell your wife's gay friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

4477
03:11:23.230 --> 03:11:28.230
<v Speaker 3>And then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't even have to hear the rest</v>

4478
03:11:28.921 --> 03:11:30.180
