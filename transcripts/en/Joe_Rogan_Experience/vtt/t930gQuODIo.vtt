Hello Dorks.
Hello Fellow dorks.
How about that?

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.040
That's better because that means I'm a Dork to this episode of the podcast is

3
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:12.420
brought to you by Squarespace.

4
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:17.421
Squarespace is the all in one platform for you to create your own website,

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.480
a very easy way to do it in a,

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.990
in a very beautiful professional way.

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.320
Squarespace has incredible designs and it is a simple drag and drop interface.

8
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:32.910
They offer 24 seven support.

9
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:37.140
It's a website where you can create your own website and you could do it very

10
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:40.350
swiftly and easily and it would work on everything.

11
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:43.830
It'll work on an iPhone or to work on an android phone and to work on windows.

12
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:45.000
It'll work on Unix,

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.480
it'll work on anything you want and that was always a big problem.

14
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.950
Before Squarespace was around,

15
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:53.070
before it used to be like even if you've got a good designer would made a

16
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:56.730
website for you.
It was always like when you would go to different platforms,

17
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:59.880
he would try it on.
The Safari Browser would look all fucking wacky and shit,

18
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.220
but now they've got it nailed.

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.460
You can also start an online store like within minutes.

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.820
It's one of the easiest things you'll ever do.
That looks awesome.

21
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.080
You won't be able to believe how cool the websites you can create on
Squarespace.

22
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.480
We had a contest last year and uh,

23
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.940
it wasn't a matter of trying to find good ones.

24
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:21.180
It was a matter of there was too many good ones.
It's too easy to do.

25
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.920
A plan started eight bucks a month and that includes a free domain name.

26
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.460
If you sign up for a year free domain name,

27
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:34.020
I think I slept through that domain name,
responsive design,

28
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:36.750
your site will look awesome.
E commerce,

29
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:40.260
you could sell digital audio if you're like a musician or something like that.

30
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.930
Do you want to have online downloads?

optimization website.

85
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.990
And if we don't find it,
we want,
we get it made.
What we,

86
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.580
what we sell is all things that help human performance,
whether it's your,

87
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.510
the way your brain works,
whether it's your,
your mood itself.

88
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.640
We literally sell mood supplements.

89
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.680
It's been known for a long time that a supplement called five HTP.

90
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.810
It enhances your body's ability to produce serotonin.

91
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.840
It's the raw building blocks of Serotonin l trip to fan and five HTP.

92
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.230
And what it is is El Tryptofan converts to five HTP,

93
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:38.290
five HTP converts to Serotonin.

94
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.320
And we have both of those along with vitamins like vitamin B six,

95
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:48.360
which is a converting catalyst.
Um,
what it,

96
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:51.940
what it is essentially is your food that you eat.

97
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.130
It's very difficult to get a diet that's like as rich in nutrients as your body

98
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.580
requires to function optimally.
And everybody's concerned with,
uh,
you'll,
you,

99
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.330
you read all these,
um,
articles,
especially by,
uh,
the,

100
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:08.280
the no nonsense type folks.
The ne'er do you know,
like these,

101
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.930
there's a bunch of people that believe that Paul,
your needs is a good diet.
Yeah.

102
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.090
Don't need all the vitamins.

103
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:17.630
Vitamins are bad for you might have a wall tell you what vitamins,
you know,

104
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.060
she don't need them.
It's a waste of money.
Your peanut all out.

105
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.260
It's not a waste of money.
If you want to function at your very best,

106
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.330
you really need to optimize your nutrients.

107
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:28.570
The best way to do that is to get your blood work done,

108
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.140
find out what you're low in and then,
uh,
and then supplement those things.

109
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:34.730
Talk to someone who's an actual expert,

110
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:39.731
but I guarantee you five HTP and l trip to fan those two things,

111
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:45.170
especially with the,
the mix that's provided with,
uh,
with um,
um,
uh,

112
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.130
new mood,
which provides a magnesium,
vitamin D three.

113
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:54.131
It's all the idea is to give you this synergistic effect where your body is able

114
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:59.990
to produce more serotonin and it literally will make you a happier person.

115
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.400
It sounds ridiculous,
right?

116
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.440
Like a vitamin supplement that makes you a happier person.
Give it a shot,

117
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:09.860
bitches.
It's so po.
It's so potent that people that are on antidepressants,

118
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:12.200
they actually tell them to not take five HTP.

119
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.410
They'd tell him to not take things like new mood because you,

120
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.490
you can get what's called Serotonin Syndrome where you have too much serotonin

121
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.020
kind of Freaky,
Huh?
Don't do that.
Um,
anyway.
Uh,

122
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:26.420
all the other things that we carry are,
you know,
we,

123
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.020
we carry the best strength and conditioning equipment,
kettlebells,
battle ropes,

124

things along those lines.

125
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:36.260
If you are a person who's into improving your body and improving the way your

126
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:40.130
body functions while your brain functions go to on a.com and a guarantee,

129
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.960

you have 90 days to send that shit back or to not even send that shit back.

131
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:57.950
Rather I should,
you don't even have to send it back.
All you have to do is say,

132
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.560
this doesn't do anything for me and you get all your money back.

133

I still kind of feel young.
I was 34 yeah,</v>

146
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:56.040
I'm 47 today.
And do you feel 47 no,
but I take all kinds

147
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.180
<v 3>of shit right?
Me Film fucking fresh.
Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.700
Hormones and fucking athletic supplements and Shit.
You know,

149
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:06.480
guys like guys like you just made me feel like I'm going to die soon because

150
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.120
you,
you seem like a buddy.

151
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.830
I would hang with like that and you know you are,

152
00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:15.120
but like you seem like somebody that's my age and then when I realize,
oh yeah,

153
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.550
you're not,
I'm like,
how the fuck am I going to feel?

154
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.050
Because I definitely feel less energetic than I was when I was 25.

155
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.850
Yeah.
But do you,
what do you do about it?

156
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:26.970
It's all about what do you do about your hand?
Exercise.

157
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.230
How often do you exercise?
I used to exercise so sides humping.
Yeah.
No,
that's,

158
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:34.140
that's my cardio
cardio.

159
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.110
I used to exercise so much and I just don't,
man.
Yeah,
you got to,

160
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.160
and especially when you hit your thirties.
Is it hot in here,
Jamie?
Or is it me?

161
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.560
Yeah.
Turn the AC on,
man.
I'm fucking sweating.

162
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.590
I think he'll be two screws to Leah.
Been in the room,

163
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.630
young Kristalina um,
you gotta take care of it,

164
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:58.010
otherwise it starts to atrophy.
There's no other way around it.
I know.

165
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.780
If you don't,
your body's gonna slowly atrophy.

166
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.720
I gotta I gotta and I just keep saying I got it.

167
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:06.810
But then it's like I do the roads,
so you know,
I do the road and it's like,

168
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:09.360
so it's like,
when are you going to fucking start?
And then it's like,
you know,

169
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:11.460
that's the hardest part.
I know what you know,
you're like,
yeah,

170
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:14.970
you just fucking do it.
But it's like you just got to write it down.

171
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.490
That's the number one thing.
What do you mean?
Write it down?

172
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:21.300
Write down what you have to do in a day and then do that.
Like

173
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.640
the writing and the down thing.
It's fucking hard putting the pen

174
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.460
and you know,
I'm not,
I'm really not lazy.
I'm really not.
Like,

175
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.470
I know you're not constantly doing sets.
You're always working on your act.

176
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.870
I see you at the Improv.
You were there almost every night.

177
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:39.960
You're there constantly.
Yeah.
You're not lazy when it comes to stand up.
No,

178
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:40.830
not at all.

179
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.310
But that's also because stand up is like just such a rewarding thing now.

180
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:49.490
You know?
Right.
Immediately.
People are like,
yeah,
you know,
but if you work out,

181
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:54.420
there's nobody there that's like,
yeah,
but if you don't see,

182
00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:57.720
like if you had an amazing body and he took your shirt off and people went,

183
00:10:57.721 --> 00:10:59.850
Oh shit,
Chris,
you're right.

184
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.710
And then became what you have now.
He'd be like,

185
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:07.590
what the fuck happened to my body?
My amazing body.

186
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.590
But now you just used to having a normal body,
right?
And so it's become the,
yeah.

187
00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.670
The other thing is too,
like I'm pretty lucky with jeans,
my jeans.
So I'm like,

188
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.350
you know,
I'm like,
Hey,
I,
I don't know if I can get to do shit,
you know?
Yeah.

189
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:26.400
You're not going to get fat really easy.
And I eat,
I eat pretty well.

190
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:30.450
I don't eat like Shit,
you know?
So that's more for people that don't like,

191
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:33.140
they have no slow genes and the mental,
what happens?

192
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.360
They just start getting fat really quickly.
That's it.
Dot.

193
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.400
It is a drag that is really,
you're just,

194
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:41.670
those are the cards do ectomorph it's what it's called,
right?

195
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.280
Our endomorph endomorph and morph is the fat one.

196
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.310
Ectomorph is the people that can't put on weight no matter what they do,

197
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.340
I will start to,
well,

198
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.210
someday don't want to start by when it's already fading though.
Yeah.

199
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.520
You know,
like right now you're still look good.
Yeah.

200
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.630
You look athletic and a tram.
Good,
good,
good.

201
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.520
Everything's good.
Yeah,
it'll go though no matter what.

202
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.040
But then there's like,
I have this guy who does my podcast,

203
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:13.030
sometimes it trainer's name is Steve Maxwell,
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt 60.

204
00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:17.320
What is he?
63,
64 64 fucking guy.
Looks Great.

205
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.680
He's ripped,
shredded six pack,
works out all the time.

206
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.900
Just constantly add it never gives his body a chance to get old.

207
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:30.150
So flipping awesome dude.
Yeah,
I just,
you know,
my,

208
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.040
my thing is also like for me,

209
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:37.270
like I'll focus on one thing and I'll just obsess about it.
And what that is,

210
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:40.100
is comedy to me like that stand up to me.
I mean,

211
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.050
I told you I trained like Jujitsu,
right?
Five.
Yeah.
For five years.

212
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:48.700
And where did you train it again?
Uh,
with John Machado.
Ah,
right.
Um,
and,
uh,

213
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.530
I did it like every day and I worked out and I lifted away,

214
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.800
stood and it was just what I did,
right.

215
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.890
And then I did stand up and I was like,
ah,

216
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:04.000
what the fuck am I doing rolling around because it wasn't,
you know,

217
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.240
I found out that that wasn't me.
You know?
Like I got to a point where I was like,

218
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.790
good for me,
but it was like other guys were,
this was their life,
you know?

219
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.290
And then once I did stand up,

220
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:18.070
it was just so obvious that that was who I was and that was my life,

221
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:19.810
that I was like,
I'm just going to excel at this.

222
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:23.650
I feel like if I work really hard and I did well,
stand up as a strange thing.

223
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.830
You definitely do work really hard.
I,
like I said,
I see you there all the time,

224
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.040
but standup is a strange thing in that like its potential is entirely based on

225
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.180
like the contents of your mind and putting it all together.

226
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.830
And it's all the whole thing is you,
it's not like,
you know,
like Jujitsu,

227
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:42.551
there's moves,

228
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:45.850
there's armbars right triangles and you can be very creative and you could even

229
00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:49.860
come up with your own moves.
But with standup,
like literally everything,

230
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.580
everything that you can think of could possibly drink.
Yeah.
And you can,

231
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.950
you can,
you know,
I remember like,

232
00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.850
especially when I first started out not being able to figure out,

233
00:14:00.851 --> 00:14:05.851
like I had Pat Pat after pad filled with these ideas that were just ridiculously

234
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:07.750
stupid idea.
They could never be comedy.

235
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.800
But I was trying to figure out what are the ideas that I could come up with.

236
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.090
It could be comedy,
you know,
cause some of them I would like still to this day,

237
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:19.210
I'll go back and find some of my old notebook and I was like,

238
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:21.250
how did you ever make it?
You fucking idiot.

239
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.450
How did embarrass when you read the Shit?
Yeah.

240
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.650
That's like when now I watch old tapes of me,
like when I watch,

241
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.610
it's hard.
It's hard to watch tapes from a couple of years ago.
I know.
Yeah.

242
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.910
It's hard to fucking look at a picture and see how you used to dress a couple of

243
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.660
years,
but there are some are the photos,

244
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.420
photos of me from Newsradio when I had earrings too.

245
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.310
Oh Wow.
I had earrings though.
I mean,
you know,

246
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:52.610
it's like he kicked you fucking imagine me with earrings.
No,

247
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:57.270
I can't now.
Yeah.
It's just so not me,
but I was it.

248
00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.650
I was at the fucking mall and I was like,
I'm getting a fucking hearing.

249
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.840
They punch it through.
It's a fake diamond.
Absolutely.

250
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:10.310
Then I got one of those.
Yeah,
me and my roommates,
we all went at the same time.

251
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.910
Got Her ears pierced.
Wow.
My one roommate was crazy.
You went both ears.

252
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:18.530
Pirate style.
My brother had to hear both years.
Yeah.
That's a gangster move.

253
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.090
Especially in the nineties you look at and you look at those.
Yeah.

254
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.830
And you look at those pictures and like you think,
Oh man,

255
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.340
like you're like I,
how did I get any pussy?

256
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.750
Like for real?
Not even like I'm,
I know it's funny,

257
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:40.640
but like not even to be funny.
Like how did somebody be like,
yeah,
that guy.

258
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.630
Yeah.
Well girls settled just like guys side.
No,

259
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.550
I don't want to think of girl is settling with me though.

260
00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:48.290
That doesn't mean that doesn't go well with me.

261
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.980
I actually stopped wearing an earring because of Jujitsu.
Oh yeah.

262
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.350
Cause I used to have to take it out every time I rolled.

263
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.030
No tape it who fucking off?
I start guys tape it.
Really?
Yeah,
just tape it.

264
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.030
Wow.
That's crazy.
So I don't know why they wouldn't just fucking take it out.

265
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.960
I know dudes who taped her ears because they have those stretchy things,

266
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:06.441
you know,

267
00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:11.441
they have those giant holes in their ears and so they pull the end together.

268
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.270
Oh,
this is the guy who fights in the UFC?
Yeah,

269
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.530
they put those,
what are those things called?
Those,
I don't know,

270
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.490
endings things wrong.
They're called,
they're called,
what do they call it?
Plugs,

271
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:27.110
plugs.
Those things are ridiculous.
I was arc.
Yeah.
Yeah.

272
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.090
That's a whole culture is there was girls like that that'll be like,

273
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:32.900
Yo fuck that guy.
Yeah.
Cause he's got the biggest holes right here.
Right.

274
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.150
Well it's like,
um,
the,
uh,
those African women that have those plates,
Surrey,

275
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.440
Surrey women,
they have those plates in their lips and the larger the plate,

276
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.800
the more cattle they're worth when they get married.
Yeah.

277
00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:49.580
That's what I don't know about that at all.
I mean,
I know about that.

278
00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:52.760
I've seen it,
but yeah,
that's a strange choice.

279
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.400
It is weird when you think about,
well also,
so that's attractive to that.
Right?

280
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.700
I didn't want any more,
apparently the word is that,
uh,

281
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.340
obviously I'm not hanging around with a lot of African broads,

282
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.570
but the word is that it was a,

283
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.300
it was like much more common,
but now women are rebelling against it.

284
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.490
A lot of young women don't do it because they have to bang their teeth out,

285
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:21.050
their lower teeth.
Like,
like what?
As the plate gets larger,

286
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.190
like as you start doing that,

287
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.880
it starts like going into your mouth and you drool constantly.
Yeah.

288
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.720
And none of that man.
Like,
what the fuck are you doing?

289
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.770
Like just less pain always.
No,
no bang and teeth out.
Well,

290
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:38.630
it doesn't make any sense.
I just does.
It doesn't,
I mean that's a weird thing.

291
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:42.110
Like what culture like decides is beautiful.
Well yeah,

292
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:45.170
it's also like different in the world currently.

293
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.100
Like you go fucking thousands of miles across the world and completely different

294
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.480
and it's still now,
which is crazy to me.
Yeah.
Yeah.

295
00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:58.920
Now 2014 there's a chicken Africa walking around with a giant plate on their lip

296
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:02.340
and some dude's like,
oh man,
I want to fuck that girl.
Get that plate.

297
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.270
I could put my food on her plate and fuck her at the same time.

298
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.350
But if it were us here,
we would be like,
oh yeah,
it should be too hard to focus.

299
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.920
She's got to play with her.
But imagine if that became hot.

300
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.100
Imagine if that mean if it became hot anywhere.

301
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.660
If you came like a style anywhere,
it could be a style anywhere else.

302
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.560
It just needs to catch,
right.
Yeah.
It's all what we fucking made up.

303
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.790
I mean like yeah,

304
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:31.350
it used to be where girls who were very fair skin were hot because that meant

305
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:34.410
they were rich and they were indoors and fucking that was awesome.
Yeah.

306
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.470
And then it was and the,
and the workers got all tank cause they were outside.

307
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.670
But then it was like,

308
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.210
oh fucking 10 chicks are hot because they have a lot of money because they go

309
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:46.430
vacation.
Yeah.
And then the fair girls were not hot.
Right.

310
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.620
And then it turned around again where was like,

311
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.490
well that girl doesn't want cancer.
So she's,

312
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.430
she's got the money to know and have the skincare,

313
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:57.550
but it's like we're just making that shit up in our minds.
Yeah.

314
00:18:57.551 --> 00:19:01.470
I decided like I used to date a girl,
he's to Tan a lot in the,

315
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.960
I had to talk to her.
I go,
you know,
you're not,

316
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.150
you don't look better when you're Tan.
Right.
You look great when you pay it.

317
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.890
It's just you look different.
Solid.
It is.
It's not bad.
Yeah.

318
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.690
Like it's all in your head.
Like some girls would be like,
I can't call it,

319
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:15.300
so I'm not,
I know.
Yeah,
I don't.

320
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.740
And how about like girls that are tan,
like Filipino girls would be like,
I can't,

321
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:24.510
I need,
I need to get Tan.
You're like,
you are,
you got that.

322
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.240
You're brown.
You're lucky you don't have to do that shit and get cancer.
Well,

323
00:19:28.241 --> 00:19:31.260
even weirder.
There's a lot of Filipinos that take a,

324
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:35.160
this stuff called glutathione.
It's um,
it's an amino acid,

325
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:39.210
but they haven't injected in their skin somehow to light,

326
00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:44.070
to lighten their skin tone.
Like permanently lighten their skin tone.
Yeah.

327
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:44.904
What the fuck?

328
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.440
It was like a whole procedure involving this glutathione stuff where they,
uh,

329
00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:53.330
it's very common with Filipinos.
Apparently chicks will,
yeah.

330
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.480
It's just kind of,
they'll just do whatever to make themselves look,
whatever.

331
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.800
But then there's dudes that do that too.
And that's just absolutely not.
Yeah.

332
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.550
There's certain things that dude's do that like immediately I can't talk to
them.

333
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.700
Like if you're waxing your eyebrows,
we were working out.

334
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.950
We have nothing to say to each other.
Yeah.
Well if you have two earrings really,

335
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.450
cause you have a unit brow and you want to like get that human brow trimmed.

336
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:19.860
I get that.
I get,
that's fine.
But if you have like sculpted eyebrows,

337
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.840
you can go fuck yourself.
Right.
Then I talk to you do.
Absolutely.

338
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.850
You're trying too hard,
man.
Yeah,
there is.
Yeah.

339
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.300
I don't even like like any,

340
00:20:30.301 --> 00:20:34.770
any type of like shave some part of your beard.

341
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.930
Right,
right,
right.
Just let it go or have it not,
not at all.
Yeah.

342
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:42.770
Like especially if you have like stripes,
well shaved it.

343
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.890
I mean honestly if you're a fucking like,

344
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:48.971
<v 0>you know,</v>

345
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:52.090
fighter or some shit and you're just going to put lines in my beard because I'm

346
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:55.060
crazy to psych to be fucking,
then fine.

347
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.510
But if you're just like a guy and you work at crate and barrel,
right,

348
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.550
and you're just like,
dude,
it's fucking on with my,

349
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.690
with my sideburns.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Yeah.

350
00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:10.870
This is a lot of work involved in that.
It's just you peacock.

351
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.100
And Alan was talking about this once in a book he read about,
um,

352
00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.390
the reason why men disdain men who wear a lot of jewelry.
And then it,

353
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.030
it goes back to,
um,

354
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.840
the hunting days that men who would wear like shiny,

355
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:30.480
flashy things,
they would distract animals like they'd be,
they'd be a problem.
Oh,

356
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.820
on hunting journeys.
And the same thing with men who talk too much.

357
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.830
Like men were like,

358
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.760
if you look at like movies where there's a,

359
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:43.360
there's a hero and the hero is like someone to be looked up to.

360
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:48.250
They were always very stoic,
very quiet elected,
and they know how to stay calm.

361
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:51.550
They keep their shit together because those are qualities valued in hunting

362
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:55.730
parties.
That's crazy.
Isn't it weird?
But it makes sense.
Yeah.

363
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.180
Which is like with women,
right?
Um,

364
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.100
the difference in the way women communicate with each other and the w difference

365
00:22:03.101 --> 00:22:06.430
between the way men communicate with each other.
Like men value stoicism.

366
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.810
Men value a guy who can keep his shit together when,
when the chips are down.

367
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.850
But when women would be gathering and making,
you know,
food and Shit,

368
00:22:15.851 --> 00:22:19.180
what men were off being quiet and sneaking up on animals,

369
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.370
the woman would be talking all kinds of shit about the men.

370
00:22:21.371 --> 00:22:24.670
This motherfucker I've seen is going to remember he's running around out there

371
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:29.140
hunting.
What is beads on?
Shit.
Scary.
You know,

372
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:33.000
like that's,
that's the reason why the culture of females,
the culture of men,

373
00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.970
it has to do with hunting and gathering.
Yeah.
That's fucking crazy and deep.

374
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.080
But what about then you get the movies with the female characters that are calm

375
00:22:41.081 --> 00:22:45.130
and collected and cool.
Yeah.
Those are fiction.
Yeah.
I mean,
yeah.
Okay.

376
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.610
But I mean,
it's all fiction,
but then that,
yeah.

377
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.210
And then I'll watch that and be like,
come on.
Well,
this,
um,

378
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.220
this movie's going feel like I'm sexist and you are,

379
00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:00.320
but not because of that.
I am too.
Um,

380
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:04.720
but not really.
I mean,
look,
just,
it's more realistic than sexist.

381
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.720
It's not saying that those,
those possibilities don't exist.

382
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.250
They can absolutely exist,
but the reality is most of the time they don't.

383
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.430
You know,
I think there's,
you know what anthropomorphism is?

384
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:18.680
It's like we put a human characteristics to animals,
you know,

385
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.870
like Yogi bear and shit.
You know,
we,
we give them a human.
We,

386
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:28.020
I think we also do that with gender and sometimes we'll give women like these

387
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.780
male qualities in like especially superhero women like Brian Holtzman,

388
00:23:34.361 --> 00:23:37.150
you know Brian Holtzman.
Yeah.
Brian Altima had this fucking,

389
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:40.420
this bit that he was doing about Charlie's angels.

390
00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:44.170
When Charlie's angels came out and Drew Barrymore was kicking people,

391
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:45.800
knocking them out,
and he goes,

392
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.710
<v 3>he goes,
you're too fucking woman.
She's not beating up nobody.
Come here,</v>

393
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.070
come here.
And he goes,
he goes,
that was my woman.

394
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.990
And she thought she was going to go out there,
fight crime.

395
00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.380
I beat her fucking ass.
I beat her fucking ass right in the house.

396
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:04.910
You're a woman that guys truly funny.
He's hilarious.

397
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:10.070
He's one of the most hilarious guys that for whatever reason,
never made it.
And,

398
00:24:10.071 --> 00:24:11.300
you know,
I don't,
I mean,

399
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.150
I got to get him on the podcast if actually definitely should.

400
00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.880
He'd just like you,
but he'll also go,

401
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.460
he would go up at like 1:00 AM and walk the room.
Oh yeah.
But,

402
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:23.930
but the 17 people that stayed would be crying,
crying.

403
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.590
He,
uh,
I,
I'll never forget it,
sorry.
He had this bit,

404
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.310
the Brian Holtzman bid that I always quote about Susan Smith.

405
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:32.720
That's as she drowned her kids.
You know.

406
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.180
Remember that woman [inaudible] the woman who was she?

407
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.740
She pretended somebody else did it.

408
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.870
He went on stage like a week after this happened,
he goes up,
he goes,

409
00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:44.780
ladies and gentlemen,
uh,
I heard there were bad kids.

410
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.710
They sat that close to the TV.
They didn't put away their blocks so well,

411
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.460
they were always spilling the milk.
Those kids will not be missed.
Oh my God.

412
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.200
But it's funny the way he does it.
It's weird.
Yeah.
Oh,
it's,
it's awful.

413
00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.880
It goes awful.
It's awful.
But it's hilarious.
Yeah.
Do you remember when,

414
00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:05.120
um,
there was that a Florida didn't?
It's just,

415
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.150
it was a really cheap airline that,
uh,

416
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:12.110
I forget what it express air or something like that.
Some Airbus,

417
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:17.270
it was like a really cheap airline and they went down the everglades and he had

418
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:19.540
this hilarious bit about,
uh,

419
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:24.350
trying to walk his dog and there's fucking body parts washing up on the shore

420
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.220
and these people with their fucking cheap airline tickets,

421
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.480
his anger and the,

422
00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:36.570
that these fucking people to stupid by irregular airplane ticket and now he had

423
00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:39.200
to deal with it.
Well,
I'm trying to walk my dog,

424
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:41.800
I'm trying to walk my dog and I got to pick it up feet and shit.

425
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:47.600
He had to see it.
I'm not doing the guys material any justice,
but yeah,

426
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:51.270
he's one of those guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.

427
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.720
I don't know where the fuck he is.
Yeah.
I don't know.
He was a meter maid.
Oh,

428
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.180
that's right.
Yeah.
He actually looks like he would be a meter maid.

429
00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.600
We'd be like this fucking guy.
And you'd be like,
what does this guy do?

430
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.680
What does this guy do besides this?
And the answer is he fucking goes on stage.

431
00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:10.700
That's crazy.
Well,
it didn't make any sense because he was so good.
He,

432
00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:14.180
he was so good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like I'm like,
how are you not like,

433
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:19.530
but what at what Ma let him to be so good was like he had this stage stage was a

434
00:26:19.821 --> 00:26:22.130
store he very rarely did anywhere,
but the guy,

435
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:25.990
he would do the laugh factory sometimes.
Yeah.
And it didn't feel right.
No,
no,
no,

436
00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:29.800
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He would be up there with Jo Koy and shit and I know.
Right.

437
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.230
And then fucking Travis Bickle would come up though real life Travis pickle and

438
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:44.100
just people would be like,
oh no,
this is not for me.
Yeah.
Those guys

439
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.660
<v 0>that everybody knows and everybody remembers that.
Um,
you know,
or like,</v>

440
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.250
you know what,
when you would call comic's comic comics,
those are the guy.

441
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:56.010
Like if you,
if you ask like a lot of comments to go to the store,

442
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:57.630
who is like your 10 favorite comics ever?

443
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:01.020
A lot of them were going to say Holtzman.
Oh yeah.
Well Brody's like that,

444
00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:05.820
you know?
Yes.
But Brody's catching on at least comedy central show,
Hbo,

445
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.430
what does it,
HBO,
Comedy Central,
but central industry.

446
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.370
But the Internet can help you do that.
When Holtzman was,
you know,
young,

447
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.080
there was no internet.
Yeah.
So it's like now people can find what they want.
Yeah,

448
00:27:16.081 --> 00:27:20.010
it's true.
Well it's also true that like you used to need a network,

449
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:22.500
like we were talking about this before the podcast started,

450
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.210
you used to need a network and you used to need someone to come along and say,

451
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:31.800
hey,
you know you are the guy,
we're going to put you as the star of our show.

452
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.120
You're going to be this guy.

453
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.600
But now all you have to do is have like a funny video on Youtube.

454
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.310
And then everybody goes,
who was that guy?

455
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.880
And then they send it to their friends at work and next thing you know it's

456
00:27:41.881 --> 00:27:44.970
passed around to [inaudible] office.
And the next thing you know like look,

457
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:49.140
a Russell Peters,
Russell Peters became gigantic,
not because of television,

458
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.610
because of fucking youtube.

459
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.140
So Russell Peters sells out the o two arena in London,

460
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:56.640
two shows in a row.

461
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.470
That's like 18,000 fucking seats or something like that.
I mean,

462
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:05.700
he's gigantic and that's all because just because he was funny,

463
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.650
nobody picked him.
Nobody.
Right.
You know,
and that can happen now,

464
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.790
but when Holtzman was around,
especially when Holtzman started,
it just did.

465
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:19.370
Didn't exist.
Yeah.
No network.
I would be like,
hey,
you'll be on my sitcom.

466
00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.150
You'd be the lead.
You would never take the chance.
No Way.

467
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.860
He took the chance with that guy.
Who knows what the fuck he would do.
You know,

468
00:28:25.861 --> 00:28:30.450
like we were talking about like guys getting in trouble for saying things off

469
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:35.370
off the author show off their show on stage as a comedian.
Yeah.
I remember,

470
00:28:35.371 --> 00:28:38.460
um,
the rumor was,
I dunno if it was substantiated or not,

471
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:43.380
but that ABC had told Tim Allen to stop doing stand up while he was doing home.

472
00:28:43.381 --> 00:28:46.680
Really?
Yeah.
Because,
well,
it was,

473
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.440
he was on this huge Sitcom and it's his stand up,

474
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.580
even though it wasn't even well back then.
Maybe then.
Yeah.
See,

475
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.090
what are you talking about?
He would talk about being a man.
Yeah.

476
00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.300
But apparently like people could think that it was sexist or wow,
you know,

477
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.900
it could be too harsh for a family show.

478
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.870
Cause like that was the other thing with Bob Saget,
Bob Saget,

479
00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:09.970
that's super family show and he's real dirty.
Right?

480
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.260
Like he didn't do standup at all while he was on that show at all.

481
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:18.270
I guess he didn't know.
They must've,
well I'm also,
he was getting so much money.

482
00:29:18.271 --> 00:29:19.800
Maybe he just didn't feel the need to do it,

483
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:22.740
but probably it probably had something to do with his,

484
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:27.720
his willingness to say yes.
Right.
Yeah.
I don't know man.

485
00:29:27.721 --> 00:29:29.370
I mean I,
I,

486
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.350
but that to me it's like I've gotten everything from standup,

487
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.480
so to not do that is just weird to me.

488
00:29:36.481 --> 00:29:40.170
Like I can't wait to get off set and go on stage when I was on news radio.

489
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.340
But did you,
you did it,
you did stand up.
Oh yeah.
Always

490
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.560
<v 3>right.
Always.
Never stopped.
I did get lazy though.
There was a time,
uh,</v>

491
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.420
in the early nineties when I first got on television,

492
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:55.290
like 94 95 I did fuck all with my act.

493
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.390
Oh really?
You're just doing what?
I just did what you do.

494
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.560
Did the jokes that I had been doing for years and I didn't write at all for how

495
00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:06.790
long?
Um,
at least a year,
maybe more,

496
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:07.683
maybe more.

497
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.140
And then one day some of the writers from news radio came to see me at the store

498
00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:13.230
and I had a late night spot and I ate

499
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:20.140
ugly.
Oh really?
I'd love to see you eat tick.

500
00:30:20.141 --> 00:30:21.790
That's crazy.
I went down to,

501
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.310
and it was a in front of somebody.

502
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:30.250
I respected a couple of people that I respected and it just wasn't good.

503
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:34.840
And I realized that I had been coasting and I was like,
God,
I just is not good.

504
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.170
I the few moments in my career,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

505
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.860
the real standout eat dick moments,
like there'd been some bad.

506
00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:45.850
So that's along the way,
but there's a few standout really eat plates of Shit.

507
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:52.080
You know what,
those moments made me way better.
And that,
that happened to me,

508
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.750
that moment of eating tic in front of those writers at the,
uh,

509
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.800
at the comedy store in the main room late night.
The crowd was dead.

510
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.410
There was no ready fad.
It was not,
there was no one there.

511
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.650
I mean it might've been plus the writers,
there might've been 30 other people,
uh,

512
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.180
when they were scattered throughout the room,
maybe 50 maximum,

513
00:31:10.181 --> 00:31:13.360
I don't even think 50 but it started out a full house,
you know,

514
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:15.430
and then as the show goes on,

515
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.890
I got on it like probably one o'clock in the morning or something like that.

516
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.900
It was just,
you were on this show already,
right?
Yeah.

517
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:23.770
So how did you have such a late spot?

518
00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.440
I always had lakes ponds and they always gave me light spots.
Yeah.

519
00:31:26.441 --> 00:31:30.310
Well when I first got on news radio,
I was a non paid regular.

520
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.580
Mitzi used to put me on [inaudible] after the show was over.

521
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.350
So it would go on like afternoon Sia.

522
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:40.630
It's like when nobody knew him and see what it was.
But actually I think of me,

523
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:44.110
he might have already gotten an HBO special by then.
I was like 94.

524
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.240
But my point was that at one point in time,
the executive producer,

525
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.990
he actually said to me,
he goes,
why are you still doing standup?

526
00:31:52.991 --> 00:31:55.540
You're an actor now.
Yeah,
they don't.
People don't get that.

527
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.830
People think that when you do stand up,
it's to make it.
Yeah.
And you're like,
oh.

528
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.910
And then when you make it,
you're like,
you did it dude,
you graduated.
Yeah,
that's,

529
00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.620
that's what that's you though.
That's your job.
That's you.
That to me,

530
00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:11.890
that's what like that's why I say when I don't understand,

531
00:32:11.891 --> 00:32:15.910
when comedians who have a show apologize for some shit they did.
Right.

532
00:32:15.911 --> 00:32:19.930
Because it's like that's in a way that's disrespecting who you are,

533
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.770
unless you really feel bad about yourself.
Of course,
if you're like,
yeah,

534
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.550
you know,
I mean I,
you know,
whatever,
whatever it is is a fuck this.
Fuck that.

535
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:28.001
And then you're like,

536
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:30.760
oh well I shouldn't have said that and you mean that and you feel bad then fine.

537
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.030
But,
but the thing is that we're,
you know,

538
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.660
to be a comedian means your somebody who people are going to go to see jokes and

539
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:40.070
if you are telling jokes and that somebody gets

540
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.880
<v 4>offended and then you say you're sorry,
I,
I,
I didn't mean that.</v>

541
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:46.490
I shouldn't have said that.
Then what you're saying is you're kind of serious.

542
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.600
You were kind of serious onstage when he said that.
Yeah,
exactly.

543
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.120
To just be like,
well,
no,

544
00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:57.590
I'm not sorry because I was joking and I'm sorry you feel that way,
but I,

545
00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:01.100
I'm not sorry for making a rape joke or whatever because it was a joke.

546
00:33:01.101 --> 00:33:02.560
I was trying to fucking be funny.
Right.

547
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:07.910
That's why the only thing worse than what,
uh,
was that Michael Riche,

548
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.260
Michael Richards,
when that was terrible,
that was,

549
00:33:10.261 --> 00:33:13.320
did not seem like a joke at all.
It seemed real as fuck.
Well,

550
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.010
we didn't around back then.
I was,
I was,

551
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:20.750
I was like an open Mike or at the Aha cafe when that shit happened.
So,

552
00:33:20.751 --> 00:33:24.260
and I kind of knew Frazier Smith a little bit because he was who he was,

553
00:33:24.261 --> 00:33:27.020
who was hosting that night,
you know,
and I was like,
oh wow.

554
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.640
Frazier was hosting that night.
And,
um,
and uh,
and when that happened,

555
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:32.563
when you saw that,

556
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.420
like there's nobody in the right mind that would have seen what went down with

557
00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:38.930
Michael Richards onstage and being like,
oh no,
he was joking around.
Well,

558
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:43.370
Michael bitches is the exact opposite because Michael Richards started out as an

559
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:48.230
act,
got super fast,
and then tried to be a comedian.
Right,
right.
That's,

560
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:52.130
that's tough.
That's real fucking tough.
That's way harder.

561
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.320
It's way fucking harder.
You know who Charlie Murphy did that too?
Oh,
he did?
Yeah.

562
00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.980
Oh yeah.
Charlie Murphy was an actor for his entire career,

563
00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.820
then gone on Chappelle show.
And then when he was on Chappelle show,

564
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.990
everybody wanted him to do standard.
Right.
And then he started doing standup,

565
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.710
like a headline.
Wow.
That's,
I can't fucking imagine that he's got balls.

566
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:18.350
Charlie Murphy has giant fucking iron balls.
I don't,
I,
you know,

567
00:34:18.351 --> 00:34:21.950
I don't know him,
but,
um,
but,
but yeah,
Michael Richards.
But,

568
00:34:21.951 --> 00:34:23.420
but what happened with Michael Richards would then,

569
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:27.780
when he went on to Letterman to do apologize,
it was even worse.
Yeah.

570
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:32.070
I mean,
he was talking about the war in Iraq.
It was like,
dude,

571
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.880
just say you're sorry,
or whatever.
But,

572
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:38.810
and then he called and then he said something he called black people blacks,

573
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.280
which just sounds,
you're like,
yeah,
you're so out of touch.

574
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.500
Just a blast blast.
It was just,

575
00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:50.360
it was just all you had to do was be like,
Yo,
I was,
look,

576
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.290
we've all been in that situation as a comedian where something goes wrong and

577
00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:55.041
you're like,
and you,

578
00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:59.840
and you push the envelope and sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't.

579
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:05.050
Like I remember one time a lady mouth off at me and the audience and I called

580
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:08.240
her con a bunch of times.
Okay.
Whether or not I,

581
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.600
I feel like I should have done that.
Uh,
the point is,
is,
um,

582
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.690
you're up there fighting for your fucking life,
man.
And if you fuck up,

583
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.260
so be it.
You're,
this is a safe place.

584
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.200
You're a comedian and you're an entertainer.
And if they,

585
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.120
if they try to fuck with you,

586
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.070
you're just kind of fighting for your life and your,

587
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.700
and if somebody were to have seen that and say,

588
00:35:31.701 --> 00:35:35.750
oh Chris Delea called a woman a con out of context,
that sounds fucking terrible.

589
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.090
But I was trying to be funny about it,
you

590
00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:43.020
<v 0>know?
Yeah.
So to just,
I can't imagine,
I mean God,
his apology was so bad.</v>

591
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.490
It was so bad.
It's also,

592
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:48.460
you're trying to figure out how to get out of a situation on the flop.
Right?

593
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.320
Like when Michael Richards onstage,
the,

594
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:55.830
the scenario was Michael Richards was onstage and these guys were heckling him

595
00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:00.030
and Michael Richards,
look,
he was a bad comedian.

596
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.420
He don't even know his stuff at all.
I never knew.
I never saw it.

597
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.780
I saw it live in the flesh.
He was terrible.

598
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:12.000
He would go on stage and everyone would be waiting for the funny stuff to start.

599
00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:16.140
Cause he's so funny aside though,
cause he's Seinfeld Kramer,

600
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:21.440
he goes on stage and he would like do these pratfalls and stumbled or just does

601
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:23.290
this work,
right?
And even work,

602
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.620
he would do all this crazy shit and they would fall down.
It would slip and,

603
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.910
and it would be,
you know,
kind of like silly.

604
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.760
Like you had thought that it was going to set up some common.
Got It.

605
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.880
But it never did.
It would never,
it would never go anywhere.

606
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.950
And so he said the laugh factory and it's like a Friday night and it's late.

607
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.760
It's a weekend night,
it's late.
And uh,

608
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.830
he's fucking bombing and these guys are heckling right.

609
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.030
They're heckling them brutally.

610
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.660
And he just pointed them and starts calling them niggers.
Look,

611
00:36:51.661 --> 00:36:56.060
there are some nigger,
there's a nigger over there.
Whoa.
And I'm,

612
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.670
he was Jesus.

613
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:02.810
But the backstory is he was on stage at the comedy store before that he went and

614
00:37:04.521 --> 00:37:08.940
did a spy the store and then did a spot at the factory and he was coked out of

615
00:37:08.941 --> 00:37:13.800
his board on stage at the store.
Oh,
I don't even know about this.
Yeah.
Well,

616
00:37:13.801 --> 00:37:18.060
he,
he definitely enjoys stimulants.
You know,

617
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:21.510
I guess that's not surprising or not.
He absolutely does cocaine.

618
00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:23.400
Can I prove that in court?
No,
I tend not.

619
00:37:23.401 --> 00:37:26.040
I'm just speculation was that he was coked out of his head.
Right.

620
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.330
But then he was like super aggressive and confident on stage for no reason.

621
00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.540
That's great.
Cocaine confidence,
you know,
let me bet.

622
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.260
And it was apparently it's just,
it was ugly and,

623
00:37:40.261 --> 00:37:42.880
but he got through it without saying nigger.
Right,
right.

624
00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.350
We went across the street,
went home.

625
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.720
She could get away without saying they onward.
If he didn't do that,

626
00:37:48.721 --> 00:37:53.500
set me think about that.
His life would be insanely different.
He would,
he could,

627
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:57.060
he would still be doing stand up.
Who would have sitcoms.
He would be beloved.

628
00:37:57.061 --> 00:37:58.890
People would take your meetings with them.

629
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.560
They'd be excited to see him in a movie.
You know,

630
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:05.580
cause it was starting to fail though.
It was all starting to fall apart on him.

631
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.770
Stand up will expose you if you're not a stand.
Oh yeah.

632
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.710
It'll expose the shit out of you and you have to keep sharp too.

633
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.490
It's like people are like,
when you know,
my favorite,

634
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.250
one of my favorite hours is Eddie Murphy.
You know,
and people were like,

635
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:18.510
he should come back.
You should come back,
dude.

636
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.750
If could you imagine coming back after 30 years of not doing it and getting

637
00:38:21.751 --> 00:38:24.570
busted with transsexual hookers?
We'd have to talk about it.

638
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.940
But unless you're Jim Norton and you can just completely own it,

639
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.870
most people can't completely own weird perverted shit.

640
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.130
Especially when you're a giant.
That's why you can't

641
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:40.690
<v 3>apologize if you're a yeah.
That's why.
Unless you really did a Kramer,</v>

642
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.890
you know,
unless you,
unless you truly feel like you fucked up.

643
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.400
What hey should could have done is he could have said,
listen,

644
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:52.180
I got a cocaine problem,
and I don't know if you've ever gotten cocaine,

645
00:38:52.181 --> 00:38:56.950
but cocaine makes an idea.
Seem like a good idea.
That's a terrible idea.

646
00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.950
Even people who don't do cocaine know that they're aware that he's like,
look,
I,

647
00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:06.670
you know,
I got on stage and I was under the influence and I was bombing.

648
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.810
Here's the deal.
I'm not that good at comedy.
Right.
Okay.
I'm a good comedic actor.

649
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.590
Right.
But as a standup,
I'm marginal at best.
I mean,
if he owned it,

650
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.320
he had said that it would have been like,
oh,
okay.

651
00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.950
I get what people forgot about it.
Yeah.
They really would have.
I believe that.

652
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:21.933
I think,
you know,

653
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.180
at the very least he would have gained a lot of people's respect because it

654
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:29.540
would have been like hours.
Yeah.
Like ours.
Our respect,
big time.
You know,

655
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.390
your peers that Matt didn't matter if he had done a black only show,

656
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:39.250
like if he had invited only African Americans to come to come back on me,

657
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.900
come back,
watch me get through it.
We were at the store.

658
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.810
I didn't see the spot that he had at the laugh factory,

659
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:50.740
but we were at the store that night.
I had missed Kramer.
My spot was,

660
00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:55.210
I'm calling them Kramer forever.
Fuck him.
I missed him.
And I had,
uh,

661
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.230
I had gone to the store like just after his spot.
So,
uh,

662
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.920
I got there and they were all talking about how bad he was.
Like,
it's like,

663
00:40:01.921 --> 00:40:03.370
oh Kramer.
So coked up.

664
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.880
And so then we're hanging around in the pocket of the lights were hanging around

665
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:08.290
in the parking lot and Brent earns,

666
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:12.310
comes over from the laugh factory and you know Brent,
he was like,
Yo,

667
00:40:12.311 --> 00:40:15.220
you ain't got to fucking believe what just went down to the laugh factory.

668
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:20.050
And so he starts telling us the whole story about Michael Richard going off and

669
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.010
you know,
and drop it in bombs and the whole deal.
And we were like,
Whoa,

670
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.120
I didn't think anything of it.

671
00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.990
And then Monday morning the video came out and then you know,

672
00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:33.070
it was one of the very first of those videos that like catches someone doing

673
00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:35.440
something really fucked.
That's the other thing man,

674
00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:40.441
is that if that wasn't a big thing then and it became a big thing then that was

675
00:40:40.451 --> 00:40:42.640
one where you're saying one of the first times that that happened,

676
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:47.980
that that is just fucking,
that was when I saw that I was like,

677
00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.690
I actually had a thought where it's like,
man,
we live in a different world now.

678
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:58.750
I mean,
how many times has something like that happened?
Undocumented.

679
00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.460
Oh,
or that.

680
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:04.660
How many times have I done things like that on [inaudible] haven't cause I grew

681
00:41:04.661 --> 00:41:08.180
up in this fucking age.
So it's like you're getting fucked pal.

682
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.620
I know you're not getting fucked as much as 21 year olds are getting fucked.

683
00:41:11.621 --> 00:41:16.330
Like they,
they have no knowledge of any time before this,

684
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.780
you know,
at least you being 34 you can,

685
00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:24.940
I mean you kinda are watching it come to fruition as you're an adult and you're

686
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:29.650
kind of seeing all these fuck ups happen like the Kramer fuck up and all these

687
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:33.920
other fuckups seeing them as you were becoming a successful standby.

688
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.870
<v 0>Ooh,
don't do that.
Ooh,
learn from that guy.
Right.</v>

689
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.970
There is a mistake I don't want to make but these kids like they don't even get

690
00:41:40.971 --> 00:41:41.804
that

691
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:45.850
<v 4>like the music spo.
I know,
but then that's the thing we,
we,</v>

692
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:50.480
there has to be some sort of backlash where it's like,
um,
we're like,

693
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.230
look,
I I think,

694
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.190
I think I'm a good guy.
I think I'm a good guy.
You know,
I try to,

695
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:00.050
I try to be good to people.

696
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.740
I think my friends would say that the guy guy for sure.
Well thank you.
But,
but I,

697
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:08.090
I'm trying to not be braggadocious or even modest.

698
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:10.850
I'm just trying to like think outside myself and think I think I'm a good
person.

699
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:14.180
Okay.
And I definitely fuck up.

700
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:18.890
There's absolutely things out there that if I were to run for a Po for some sort

701
00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:23.150
of office ti,
I will be fucking buried before I've been stuck.
There's no way.

702
00:42:23.151 --> 00:42:24.020
There's no fucking way.

703
00:42:24.021 --> 00:42:27.620
Even if I was really politically minded and very smart and the best candidate,

704
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:31.370
there's no fucking way I would get elected because I've already done the thing

705
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:34.580
that buried me and somebody got a screenshot of it.
Yeah.
Do you know what I mean?

706
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.070
But,
so here's the thing though.

707
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:42.400
I think that we live in a time now where you've got to just like look there.

708
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.510
That shit's out there.
It's videotapes somewhere.
Somebody's got something.

709
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:51.260
I fall asleep.
Chicks fucking probably take a pictures of me with all the sheets.

710
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:55.730
I,
my Dick's probably it's been probably is out there somewhere.
Probably.

711
00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:00.040
You just got to be,
somebody's got to come out to the,
we're,

712
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.920
we're where they get exposed and they just have,
and there's a video of the guy,

713
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:07.310
are you sorry,
did this happen?
What you have to say about this fucking Dick pic?

714
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:11.150
And you just gotta be like,
look,
you either like me or you don't.

715
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.650
I fuck up.
You fuck up.
There's shit out there like this because of me,

716
00:43:15.651 --> 00:43:18.770
because of my stature and where I am.

717
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.640
And if you like me,
you like me.
And if you don't,
you don't,

718
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.410
then I'm sorry and subscribed to me or don't.

719
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.530
And a lot of it isn't even a fuck up.
I know.
It's not,

720
00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:30.670
<v 0>let me think about that.
Like if you're like the scenario that you proposed,</v>

721
00:43:30.671 --> 00:43:33.040
if you're lying there and some chick takes a picture of your Dick,

722
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:38.090
<v 4>that's not a fuckup man.
Fuck up.
It's not a fuckup that's life.
But,
but,
but if,</v>

723
00:43:38.091 --> 00:43:41.210
uh,
if that happens,
we'll politician.
He doesn't get elected.
That's true.

724
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.640
And that's,
that's fucking bullshit.
Yeah,

725
00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:44.860
<v 0>it's ridiculous.
That's bullshit.</v>

726
00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.690
But I think it's only ridiculous based on the standards of the,
the,
the,

727
00:43:48.691 --> 00:43:50.200
the previous generations.

728
00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:54.240
I think that we're judging these politicians on these previous generation's

729
00:43:54.241 --> 00:43:57.790
standards.
And then as time goes on,
we'll,
we'll look.

730
00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:01.920
Obama is one of the first presidents that said he did coke and smoked weed would

731
00:44:01.921 --> 00:44:05.770
have never happened in the 60s.
You know,
I was,

732
00:44:05.771 --> 00:44:08.080
I've retweeted this thing today was about Nixon.

733
00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:13.510
It's about Nixon during the Watergate administration or during the Watergate

734
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.720
scandal.

735
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:18.720
Nixon brought in a bunch of generals and was testing the waters for taking over

736
00:44:19.721 --> 00:44:24.680
Congress and having a cool,
having like a military intervention to takeover.

737
00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:29.230
It's really fascinating.
I don't want to,
um,
misquoted or anything,

738
00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:30.453
but

739
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.400
<v 4>that guy,</v>

740
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.970
<v 0>like he,
his era was a different era.
Like the,</v>

741
00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:39.870
the Nixon administration's error was a completely different era.
Like his,

742
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.610
the standards that he was judged by was,

743
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.630
was things that there was no one was exposed for anything in the past.

744
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.240
And so all of a sudden he gets exposed to Watergate,

745
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:50.890
had missed the Watergate scandal,
happens,
he gets busted,
right.

746
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.200
Spying on other candidates.
And then,
you know,
he feels this,

747
00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.330
there was also when Kent state happened,

748
00:44:57.331 --> 00:45:01.440
when they shot those kids that were protesting the Vietnam war and he was

749
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:04.990
constantly worried about lefties constantly worried about liberals and the

750
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.800
liberals taking over the lefties and the east coast lefties.

751
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.870
And he apparently had some crazy meeting with these uh,

752
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:16.380
these generals.
And this is the one of the,
the guy says,

753
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.910
I got the impression he said that he was sort of testing the water with us to

754
00:45:20.911 --> 00:45:22.860
see whether or not there would be support.

755
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:26.820
Any nodding of heads or some of these other things.
Uh,
one,

756
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:32.220
one could well have come to the conclusion that here was the commander in chief

757
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:36.150
trying to see what the reaction of the Joint Chiefs of staff might be if he did

758
00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:40.360
something unconstitutional.
He was trying to find out whether or not,
uh,

759
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.260
in a crunch there would be support to keep him in power.

760
00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.650
So like if they were trying to keep him,

761
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.580
then we're going to kick him out of power because of the Watergate thing.

762
00:45:47.581 --> 00:45:50.670
He was going to bring in the military,
like he was trying to test the waters,

763
00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.950
but today and that same sort of scenario,
right?

764
00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:01.350
Like a guy [inaudible] it's over,
you know,
you,
you,
you,
you,

765
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:05.490
you can't,
you can't hide things.
Like you could hide things.

766
00:46:05.491 --> 00:46:08.880
Then so he got busted and he thought they were going to try to kick him out of

767
00:46:08.881 --> 00:46:12.660
office and like,
you know,
he's a,
Nixon was a really bad guy.

768
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:17.310
It was a really bad guy,
but they were all really bad guys.
Like I probably,

769
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:22.200
everybody that was present was a really bad guy and that's how they did it.

770
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.230
I think the standards that people are going to be judged by are going to be very

771
00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:29.310
different because I don't think really bad guys are going to be able to be

772
00:46:29.311 --> 00:46:31.830
present in the future.
I don't think a guy like Nixon,

773
00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:36.780
we'll get to a point where he could be the president and not have all the dirt

774
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.930
on him that would be revealing,
illuminated,

775
00:46:39.931 --> 00:46:44.380
but long before he ever got an office,
there's that.
It has to be that way.
Yeah,

776
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.940
there's good to that.
And there's bad because the good thing is a guy like Nixon,

777
00:46:47.941 --> 00:46:52.941
like there'd be enough on him before he ever got into office that no one would

778
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.900
accept him.
Right,
right.
Yes.
Yeah,
totally.
But like the stuff,

779
00:46:57.901 --> 00:47:01.370
like the sexual stuff that people do,
you know,
like,

780
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:05.160
like JFK wouldn't ever been president.
Right.
Never.
Never,

781
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:10.110
never chance if there,
if there was Facebook back when JFK or direct messages.

782
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.480
I mean,
JFK was an animal.
He was a fucking animal.
He didn't,

783
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.960
didn't care if he was married.
He didn't care.
He was going to party.

784
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.210
He was a goddamn president.
United States,

785
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.720
the commander in chief and he was going to get his dick wet.
That was just it.

786
00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:29.620
He just did it.
That's so crazy.
And a president today,
no chance.

787
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.890
<v 3>Clinton was the last guy,
the last of the Great Presidential Dick.
Slingers.</v>

788
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.940
That's it.
From now on,
you'll be judged and it's a completely different way.

789
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:45.400
I don't know if that's,
I don't,
you know,
is that good?
Well,
it's not,

790
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.490
it's good when it comes to things that aren't sexual because that affects the

791
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:53.380
job.
Yes.
But it's not fair to judge somebody's sexual prowess because of,
uh,

792
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.770
you say prowess.
Is it prowess or is it practices?

793
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.640
Here's the thing,
it's not,

794
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:04.540
but is it because what if instead of like sex,

795
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.600
what if it was a gambling thing?
Right.

796
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:11.080
What if he had this crazy gambling thing,
right.
Where you found out that,

797
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:15.430
you know,
hey man,
Obama can't stop gambling on shit.

798
00:48:15.431 --> 00:48:19.630
He gambles on everything.
Roll the dice to roaches running across the table.

799
00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:23.050
I killed just gamble.
Raindrops coming down a window.
But that,

800
00:48:23.051 --> 00:48:26.090
that arguably does affect a job.
Yeah.
You know,

801
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:30.970
but I don't know if you wanting to get ass would be like,

802
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:32.710
you know,
what are we going to do in Gaza?

803
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.760
I don't know what you see that ass like that doesn't feel,

804
00:48:35.761 --> 00:48:39.190
but gambling could affect that.
There was thoughts that the,
the,

805
00:48:39.191 --> 00:48:43.720
one of the things that could affect a president if the president was like a real

806
00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:47.490
pussy chaser was that someone could blackmail him.
That if,

807
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:51.500
if someone had some information,
like if you say,
if you hire,
I gotcha.
I hired.

808
00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.640
Yeah,
sure.
That makes sense.
Soviet spy,

809
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:56.820
super hot to fuck them to fuck the prison,

810
00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.450
some presidential dick and she fucks him.
And then she has some dirt on them.

811
00:49:01.451 --> 00:49:05.890
And so the pillow talk pillow talk's a motherfucker till it talks a
motherfucker.

812
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.730
Um,
yeah,
that's a thing.
But that's kind of more,
I mean,

813
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.180
is that really a thing?
I don't think so.
I mean,
come on.

814
00:49:13.181 --> 00:49:17.140
I don't know what hot chick around the W.
I mean,
what?
You know what I mean?

815
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:22.260
Come on.
What happens in movies?
I'm like,
come on James Bond.
Yes.

816
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:25.570
Yeah.
First of all,
there's no hot spy.

817
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:31.960
There must be to be to,
to,
to make it,
to make it,

818
00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.100
to make it took for that instance,
right?
I mean to be like,

819
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:40.510
we have to get you into,
he's just going to chase it.

820
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.440
Top 10 beautiful lady spies.
Let me tell you something.
Let me do some right now.

821
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.620
Pull.
The nine of them are not hot.
Nine of them are not hot.

822
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:51.280
10 of them are not hot.
They're all disgusting.

00:51:33.651 --> 00:51:37.580
government without notifying the u s attorney general and was deported back to

Number five.
Yeah,

Well that's about it.

856
00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:01.100
Well,
this is an Asian one and they're number three.
That's pretty hot.
Young,

857
00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:05.660
beautiful female spy during the Chinese civil war between Blah,
blah,

blah,

858
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:09.350
blah.
Can't even,
I can't even read that.
That K,

859
00:52:09.351 --> 00:52:14.351
u o m I n t [inaudible] Tang and the communist party,

860
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:19.660
she was only 15.
She was only 15.
He should put that part up.

861
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:23.930
42 to 1947 wines.
No,
that's,
that's the,

862
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.110
no,
that's when the image,
wait,
what,

863
00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:31.640
see right here is the whole birth.
I'm confused.

864
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:39.740
That's a ridiculous,
but,
but 19 is not that old.

865
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:44.330
That's confusing.
Cause his 1932 32 to 1947,
what does that mean?

866
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:49.850
I don't know.
That's a still from a did she die?
Maybe

867
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.630
she must've back in the Oh,

868
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:56.810
the life and death of her has become a symbol of the courage of the Chinese

869
00:52:56.811 --> 00:53:00.860
people is often cited as a homily.

870
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:04.850
H O m I l y of their Lord.
I don't even know that word is what's homily?

871
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.580
I don't know.
I've never heard that word used.
Okay,
let's Google it.

872
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:12.960
I love the Internet.
What a weird world we live in.
[inaudible] homily is,
um,

873
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:18.310
a religious discourse that is intended primarily for spiritual edification

874
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:22.580
rather than doctrinal and struggle.
Oh fuck.
Are you using that word for,

875
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:26.010
of their loyalty to communism?
Her story is often told as

876
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.000
<v 3>an homage to this struggles endured and the sacrifices made for the cause of</v>

877
00:53:30.001 --> 00:53:34.290
liberating China from the centuries of rule by foreign powers.
Okay.

878
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.950
That's one of those words that he uses.
Other words,
I don't know to describe it.

879
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:41.100
Okay.
This is a picture of this other chick that's clearly not a real picture.

880
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:46.140
Number two,
because she was from 1551 you fucks,

881
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:50.090
right?
You can't have pictures of this check from the 15th goddammit.

882
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:54.600
Sons of bitches and he's somebody draw nigh and then Mata Hari Mata,

883
00:53:54.601 --> 00:53:58.270
Hari.
That was in 1877 yeah,

884
00:53:58.271 --> 00:54:02.110
but that sounds like some old,
old way of thinking to be like,

885
00:54:02.111 --> 00:54:06.600
well we can't have a president that wants to fuck a lot because a spiraled get

886
00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:10.480
them like,
come on.
It is kind of ridiculous that,

887
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:12.940
that sounds like that sounds ridiculous.

888
00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:17.590
But we kind of proved our own point because the top 10 throughout history,

889
00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:18.970
we only found one.

890
00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:24.010
One of them was 15 one of them was legitimately hot and like I said,

891
00:54:24.011 --> 00:54:28.640
she was Russian.
Right.
That's it.
So you're saying what?
There was one hot,

892
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:33.760
right.
So we kind of proved our point.
It's not really worried about,
yeah.

893
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:36.280
But all throughout human history,
there's only been 10 months.

894
00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:40.120
She was 28 what is she now?
This is,
well now she's still hot.
She still had,

895
00:54:40.121 --> 00:54:43.000
this was only four years ago.
Yeah,
so she's 32

896
00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:48.350
32 out there.
[inaudible]
she was already caught so she's fucked.
Yeah.

897
00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.100
We know about her now.
Maybe.
Maybe she got a raise,

898
00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.630
you know in Russia they brought it back to Russia.
She probably got damn hero.

899
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:58.900
Yeah.
Where is she today?
Let's find if that were really a thing.

900
00:54:58.901 --> 00:55:01.270
I think people would,
I mean maybe we don't know about it,

901
00:55:01.271 --> 00:55:05.780
but people would be like raising hot spies.
That's true.
I mean that they're wire.

902
00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.640
There's no way we wouldn't do that too.
She's even hotter than that picture.

903
00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.810
There's like,
if you go to Google images,
Woo.
Yeah,
she was smoking.

904
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:19.410
Look at this part can be a maximum.
Oh yeah,

905
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:25.250
totally.
She sees from,
that's from stuff magazine.
Yeah.

906
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:30.260
She's got these long red gloves on and his hot lingerie.

907
00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:32.760
Look at this one.
Yeah,
look at,
by the way,
if you're a spy,

908
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:34.080
don't take fucking pictures like that.

909
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:39.120
This whole thing doesn't make sense to not be a spy dude.

910
00:55:39.121 --> 00:55:43.860
She's pretending just be hot,
but just stay out of the fucking light.
Okay.

911
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:47.610
Come on son.
Look at that.
That's really,
really sexy.

912
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:53.760
I mean,
come on.
Not a spy to it.
Should the picture should say under it.
Not a spy.

913
00:55:53.761 --> 00:55:58.170
Hold it right up to her head while a banger or dirty girl.
That's crazy.
Yeah.

914
00:55:58.171 --> 00:56:00.930
There's a lot of dirty pictures of her.
Somebody should've known.

915
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:07.320
Yeah,
she was on maxim.
Yeah.
See,
she was on Russian maximum.
Right.

916
00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.580
It's like not really maximum.
Yeah.

Don't really count,
but rush.

917
00:56:11.581 --> 00:56:15.390
I'm mix him.

Wonder where she's at today.
Let's see.

918
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.960
Anna Chapman today.
I bet she's got a good gig somewhere in Russia.

919
00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:20.190
She's probably got a podcast.

920
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.460
She probably does one show explaining

921
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.810
<v 0>how she twic stupid American just by dressing sexy.</v>

922
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:34.570
Yeah,
she refuses to discuss it.
Okay.
Oh,
like a true spot.

923
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.350
Refuses to die,
Huh?
Interesting.

924
00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:44.520
Pretty well,
but she's connected somehow to Edward Snowden.
Oh Wow.

925
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:49.140
There was a recent tweet proposing marriage to Edward Snowden.
That's real.

926
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.840
Yeah.
She proposed marriage to Snowden.

927
00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:55.560
I want him to marry me so I can double spy.

928
00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:58.740
Spy on Medica from Russia.

I'm a very private,

930
00:57:03.661 --> 00:57:06.770
discreet person on average.
She's on Twitter and many interview.

931
00:57:06.771 --> 00:57:09.030
Is she on Twitter?
I thought she just said,
yeah.

932
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:13.550
You said there was a tweet about it.
She's kind of a Twitter page.
That's what,

933
00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:16.830
yeah,
but I thought like maybe like somebody else put it.
Oh,
got it.
That's fine.

934
00:57:16.831 --> 00:57:20.130
Now,
Anna Chapman,
Twitter spars need to work on their social networking

935
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:26.490
and the Chapman on Twitter to tweet alibis.
You can tweet alibis,

936
00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.890
put up a twit pic.
Why are you somewhere else?
Yup.

937
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.650
If I went to her Twitter page and she followed me,
I would panic,

938
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.190
but I'm following her.
Or you're blocked?
Nope.

939
00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:40.320
Have you ever gone to someone's page and find out you were blocked and like,

942
00:57:48.451 --> 00:57:53.430

948
00:58:07.681 --> 00:58:12.681
how are you a girl and your Instagram page and you don't have 100,000 followers.

949
00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:15.120
How's that happen?
How's that happen?

950
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:19.290
I went to a girl's page and it was just her doing yoga.

951
00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:21.660
It was her ass like her and yoga jeans.

952
00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:25.290
She had 2 million followers on Instagram.
Yeah,

953
00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:29.550
I was walking by in,
I was in Las Vegas or some shit,

954
00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:33.660
And there was a poster,
it was like,
come see Instagram sensation,
Yada Yada.

955
00:58:33.661 --> 00:58:36.450
And it was just some chick.
That's crazy man.

956
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:40.740
Girls are raised to be a tens on Instagram than in real life.
Oh yeah,

957
00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:43.200
they would because they just won't show up the shit.
I want the followers.

958
00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.750
And then you get the followers for having an ass.

959
00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:50.760
And let me ask you something and then what and then what?

960
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:54.450
That's a good question because there was an article in like one of those New

961
00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:59.190
York magazines that was all about this woman who was an Instagram fitness

962
00:58:59.191 --> 00:59:01.650
sensation.
Sure.
It was just,
they didn't say it,

963
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.880
but it was just because she had a fence.
Udacity.
Yeah,
sure.

964
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:08.010
It was just incredible.
Right.
They were just talking about her lovely figure.

965
00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:12.590
It's on her figure.
It's her big juicy fireable Boudin and uh,

966
00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:14.880
they were talking about all these projects that they're putting together and

967
00:59:14.881 --> 00:59:18.990
there was a media team behind her and they were going to marketer how fucking

968
00:59:18.991 --> 00:59:21.980
cause of an ass.
Yeah.
Just because of a body part,

969
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:25.190
<v 4>a big fleshy body part that carries a lot of,</v>

970
00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:29.780
and that the hips so that you could give birth easy and fat so that you could

971
00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:31.370
sustain the pregnancy and that's fine.

972
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:36.200
But then when a girl posted a picture of her from behind and it's like,
you know,

973
00:59:36.201 --> 00:59:40.700
some quote inspiration shit and you're just like,

974
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.500
no,
I'll,
I know they have millions of comments on their fucking thing,

975
00:59:45.501 --> 00:59:49.580
but I'll still comment.
No,
I will.

976
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:54.920
You'll just say,
no,
no,
100% know.
All right.

977
00:59:56.110 --> 01:00:00.380
Because it's not,
it's not okay.
It's not okay.
You can do it,

978
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.060
but then you're an asshole.

979
01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:04.970
There's nothing funnier than when you go to a girl's page or whether it's

980
01:00:04.971 --> 01:00:06.080
Instagram or Twitter,

981
01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:10.550
and there's just a plethora of images of her and sexy positions.

982
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:14.390
Their ass out in her underwear and Bikini's doing selfies it,

983
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:19.130
and then there's a quote about men needing to respect boundaries.
That's,
yeah,

984
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:21.210
that's something that's just like,
no,

985
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:25.610
the treating women like women,
like a sex object.

986
01:00:25.611 --> 01:00:29.780
You're crazy that that would be like,
if I fucking,
that will be like,

987
01:00:29.781 --> 01:00:31.550
if I took a bunch of peanut butter,

988
01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.470
put it all over my eyes and face and mouth and then said to you,
dude,

989
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:41.120
why does it fucking tastes like peanut butter in here?
You'd be like,
well,

990
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:44.420
you got fucking Pete.
You will give in.
Say it.
You'd be like,
oh,
you're crazy.

991
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.630
So why don't we fucking say that about those girls?
Well,
we do kind of,

992
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:53.300
but then when we do,
we're sexist.
Yes.
Well there's also,

993
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:57.800
you have no hope of fac of banging them then.
If you're a guy that true.

994
01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.410
I don't know.
I mean it depends how probably,
right.

995
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.100
You're probably right if you shoot them down and then a million other guys or a

996
01:01:04.101 --> 01:01:06.110
bombing on them,
those,
you know what?
You know what?

997
01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.810
Those guys are fucking worse than those girls and those guys are traders.

998
01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.820
They are trader sons of bitches.
No,
but for real,
when it do,
it's like,

999
01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:16.580
hey I or when you're,
when you're,
when you're trying to,
you know,

1000
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:19.550
kick it with a girl and then some other dudes like,
Yo,

1001
01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:23.930
I heard that dude's bad dude.
Are you?
Oh yeah,

1002
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:28.100
that's the best I heard that dude.
He just fucking,
you know,

1003
01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:32.120
he's just out for pussy isn't even carry a lot of girls.
You know what?

1004
01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:35.060
That dude usually did helped you by the way.
Yeah.

1005
01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.450
Cause she's not going to be like,
Oh really?
By,
she's not going to do that.

1006
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.140
She's going to be like,
hmm,
I think I still know better.

1007
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.850
That is a weird thing that dude's do.
What do you do that some dudes,

1008
01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.520
I would never do that.
As a matter of fact,
I've been wanting,
I've been trying,

1009
01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:54.800
like if I'm like really trying to get this girl and she's so hot or whatever,

1010
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.120
and then I,
and,
and,

1011
01:01:57.210 --> 01:02:00.770
and I find out she has a boyfriend and there's been situations in my life where

1012
01:02:00.771 --> 01:02:01.551
I was like,
oh,

1013
01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.130
I found out a girl had a boyfriend and I found out that the is cheating.

1014
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:08.100
I would never fucking that that's them.
That's their thing.
Yeah.

1015
01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:09.980
To be a fucking dude.
This gonna be like,
dude,

1016
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:11.150
I think I'm going to do the right thing,

1017
01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.470
but really just doing it because of the Instagram asks,
you're a fucking asshole.

1018
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:18.020
Well,
there's a lot of dudes that are fake white nights.

1019
01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.190
They're just trying to look good,
just trying

1020
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.410
<v 3>to come off as like,
I'm different than men.</v>

1021
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:25.050
I have ethics and morals and they're really important to me.

1022
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.880
They're just trying to position themselves.

1023
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.810
If you're a dude and your best friend is a woman,

1024
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.780
it's,
it's,
it's,
uh,
it's suspect.
It's suspect.
It's very suspect.

1025
01:02:36.781 --> 01:02:41.730
Highly suspect.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Unless she's really unusual.
Well look,
there are,

1026
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:42.390
there are,
look,

1027
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:47.390
and I'm not saying that women and hot women and whoever are,

1028
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.170
I mean they're fucking good.
They can be great friends,
but you all,

1029
01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:55.740
if they're hot and even if they're not,
you sometimes still wanna.
Yeah.
Fuck that.

1030
01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:58.110
And that's okay.
Right.

1031
01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:02.160
You know the guys that do have like a hot woman,

1032
01:03:02.161 --> 01:03:07.161
that's the best friend that they're not banging and they'd pretend now it's just

1033
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:09.360
totally platonic.
Like,
okay,

1034
01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.840
I could never trust that guy unless he has like an insanely hot wife that,

1035
01:03:15.301 --> 01:03:19.430
that yeah.
Or if they used to date,
yes.
That's possible.

1036
01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:20.641
That's possible.

1037
01:03:20.641 --> 01:03:24.030
If they like legitimately have nothing to do with each other anymore.
Right.

1038
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.440
Like I have x's that like I wouldn't want her to sleep with,
but in they're hot.

1039
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:31.950
You know what I mean?
Right.
It's stover.
Yeah,
it's over.
But you're still friends.

1040
01:03:31.951 --> 01:03:36.810
Yeah.
Yeah.
Friendly and did not your best shit.
Fucking weird.

1041
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:38.880
That's weird.
What's weird when anybody,

1042
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:44.090
like when a guy is like working on an angle and trying really hard to like

1043
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:50.390
position himself as better than he positioned himself as being like different

1044
01:03:50.431 --> 01:03:52.860
than every other guy.
You know,

1045
01:03:52.861 --> 01:03:55.140
and there's a lot of guys out there to doing really negative things.

1046
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:58.350
Like I read this one guy's fucking Twitter page of the day.
It was amazing.

1047
01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.110
It was just like,
he's,
he might be the ultimate White Knight.

1048
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.550
I don't want to give out his Twitter page,
but he,

1049
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.090
he might be like the greatest if I met him,

1050
01:04:06.091 --> 01:04:08.680
he probably has almost no blood in his veins.
He says,

1051
01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:13.050
<v 0>blood sugar is probably zero.
You probably faints all day long.
But</v>

1052
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:18.670
it was so weak.
But one of the things he said is,
he said,

1053
01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:24.940
all,
he said,
although I still practice feminists,

1054
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:26.980
uh,
still practice feminism,

1055
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:31.780
I no longer associate I no longer w what'd you say?

1056
01:04:31.781 --> 01:04:36.781
Advertise myself as a feminist because I feel like it's up to women to decide

1057
01:04:37.331 --> 01:04:41.890
whether or not I'm doing feminism correctly.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1058
01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:45.070
So I'll still practice feminism,

1059
01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:49.870
but I will no longer advertise myself as a feminist.
Jesus Christ.

1060
01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:56.130
<v 3>Got It.
That's a,
I actually don't even know what to say about that.</v>

1061
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.900
Male feminism is a very strange thing.
Not male

1062
01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.250
<v 0>wallet,
it specialists or equality promoters,</v>

1063
01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:09.330
specialist egalitarian people who only look out for the greater good of all

1064
01:05:09.771 --> 01:05:14.120
humanity and don't gender identify or don't.
They're not,

1065
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:17.590
they're not gender specific in how they think that people should rights.

1066
01:05:17.591 --> 01:05:21.930
And actually that's,
I think equality is a beautiful thing.
I mean,

1067
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:25.540
when it comes to like how people were treated and when it comes to laws and

1068
01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:30.400
without a doubt that's how it should be.
But this idea of male feminism,

1069
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:34.720
it strikes me as a bit pandering.

1070
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:39.020
There's a little bit of pandering going on.
There's a little bit of a absolutely.

1071
01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.020
A little bit of role playing going on.

1072
01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:42.530
<v 4>Absolutely.
Well,
yeah,</v>

1073
01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:47.830
because because a male has it in them to want to sleep with women.

1074
01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:53.900
If so,
it's like that's not going away.
This guy,

1075
01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.760
just because you respect a woman doesn't mean you can't see a woman and be like,

1076
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:07.370
Damn,
look at that ass.
Right.
Okay.
That's what those guys are acting like.

1077
01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:12.380
Like that,
that,
no,
I'm not,
I'm better than that.
I don't look at her as an object.

1078
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:16.190
You have,
you have a midbrain.
What's a midbrain?

1079
01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:19.190
What will your midbrain is like?
You're reacting like a lizard.

1080
01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:23.270
You know what I mean?
You're like,
yeah,
of course it'll read fast.
Red Car goes by.

1081
01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:27.230
He's like,
well shit,
you,
even if you don't physically do that,
you fucking,

1082
01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.870
well you,
you,
you,
you will notice it,
right?

1083
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:35.900
You can be fucking a girl,
a beautiful girl.

1084
01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.760
And then on the TV,

1085
01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.120
a commercial comes on with a beautiful girl and you'll be like,
who's that?

1086
01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:47.810
<v 0>Yes.
You could be.
And we're not supposed to acknowledge that.
Well,
yeah,
I know.</v>

1087
01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:54.700
I don't think this about that.
I think with them it's,

1088
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:59.770
it's about positioning themselves as being what women have a problem with men in

1089
01:07:00.501 --> 01:07:02.510
the same way that men have prom with women,
like what,
what,

1090
01:07:02.511 --> 01:07:04.560
what are the issues that men have a problem with women?
All right,

1091
01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:07.550
and this is just some men and some women.
These are generalizations,

1092
01:07:07.551 --> 01:07:12.170
but there's always like,
oh,
that girl's a gold digger.
She just wants a rich guy.

1093
01:07:12.171 --> 01:07:16.850
She wants a guy with a big Dick,
she wants some big stud,
some big ape,

1094
01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:20.030
you know,
she doesn't even realize,
and I'm the guy for her.

1095
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:24.290
These like issues that a lot of men have with women,
right?
And a lot of women,

1096
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:28.360
the issues they have with men is,
oh,
he's an animal.
The guy's a savage.

1097
01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.640
He's just trying to fuck a bunch of women.
He doesn't ever want to settle down.

1098
01:07:31.641 --> 01:07:35.210
He doesn't want to ever have a family.
He's never going to be loyal to one woman.

1099
01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:40.130
And so men will position themselves as being different than every other man.

1100
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.900
They'll come along and they'll say,
I've seen the,
the evil of,

1101
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:49.010
you know,
Male,
uh,
you know,
patriarchal behavior.

1102
01:07:49.011 --> 01:07:51.380
And I just think it's not cool.
I'm a feminist.

1103
01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:54.680
I'm basically looking out for all women's rights and I'm different than all

1104
01:07:54.681 --> 01:07:59.000
women.
What you don't ever find is men who,

1105
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.880
well,
I guess you could find,

1106
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:06.910
but it's very rarely guys who were savages who identify with being a feminist.

1107
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:12.170
Like,
it's not like I don't,
I Studley athletic,
you know,

1108
01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:16.520
pro football players,
like little muscle,
a feminist.
Right.
Basically,
you know,

1109
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:19.160
it sounds funny.
It's guys that are like,

1110
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:22.250
they're not very manly and so their,

1111
01:08:22.251 --> 01:08:26.330
their shtick is I'm going to position myself as being the solution to all these

1112
01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:30.200
other men that are out there.
I'm socially retarded.
I don't,

1113
01:08:30.201 --> 01:08:32.300
I'm not attractive in the traditional sense.

1114
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:37.160
So when I'm going to do is just be like super ultra sensitive and super aware of

1115
01:08:37.161 --> 01:08:42.161
women's needs and super attentive and I'm just going to live my life in misery

1116
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:46.700
and attempt and I guess that works sometimes.

1117
01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:50.720
Got have fucking platinum albums.

1118
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:56.510
Do they though?
Who are you thinking of?
Like which guy?

1119
01:08:56.570 --> 01:09:00.920
I don't guys don't get a guitar and just be like,
but those guys get mad pussy.

1120
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:04.570
Well that,
that's what I'm saying.
Like John Mayer.
Let's about that.
I don't know,

1121
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:07.400
but he's not a feminist.
That's true.
But if that guy's just,

1122
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:11.540
he's constantly got a new girlfriend in the picture.
Yeah,
I guess you're right.

1123
01:09:12.730 --> 01:09:13.580
Yeah,
I guess shit.
Right.

1124
01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:18.320
Then maybe those guys don't know that he's more like a romantic,
right,
right.

1125
01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.770
Like,
you know,
he's positioning himself as well.
But I mean look,

1126
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:25.910
people position them.
So like what,
what,
what do we do as comedians?
I mean,

1127
01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:27.950
one of the reasons why guys got into comedy,

1128
01:09:27.951 --> 01:09:30.530
I know one of the reasons what I loved about doing comedy,

1129
01:09:30.531 --> 01:09:32.210
he's all sudden girls liked me.

1130
01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:36.440
Like they didn't like me when I was a fighter.
I was,

1131
01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:40.480
it was very rare that girls were really excited to hang out with some guy who

1132
01:09:40.481 --> 01:09:43.670
was hanging out with sweaty dudes all day getting kicked in the face.

1133
01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.090
And it's not that attractive but me and gets here a famous fighter.
But,

1134
01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:53.270
but,
but comedians like they,
you can make them laugh and so you would,

1135
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.910
you would work hard on being more funny,

1136
01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:59.540
be more funny around girls to get girls to like you.
I mean,

1137
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:03.770
pretty much every comedian that's heterosexual has had that motivation be

1138
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:08.350
funnier because girls like funny guys.
Yeah.
And when do you feel less attractive?

1139
01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:11.630
You ever taken a girl to a show and you ate dick on stage?
Cool.

1140
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:18.380
Well,
that's a terrible,
terrible,
terrible place to be because then you have,

1141
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.700
then you have nothing.

1142
01:10:19.701 --> 01:10:23.500
You have what you thought was going to work and it's worked.
It's laughing.

1143
01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.300
You're like,
oh,
she should have just youtube to me.

1144
01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.480
But it's even worse because she,
you know,
you're,

1145
01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:36.650
you're worse than a guy who does nothing because what you do,

1146
01:10:36.651 --> 01:10:40.250
you're awful at.
It's not like I'm trying to find my place in this life,

1147
01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.330
but I've got good features.
No,
right.
He's made,
he's got potential lunch.

1148
01:10:44.331 --> 01:10:48.050
Chris gets his shit together.
But no,
you bomb on stage.

1149
01:10:48.051 --> 01:10:51.500
Like they saw what you do and you do it awful.

1150
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:53.420
That's really fucking funny.

1151
01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:58.180
But you're positioning yourself as like being a funny guy.
You'll like,
hey,

1152
01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:01.760
you know,
hey,
I'm the guy.
You want to come to me for labs.
I'm the guy.

1153
01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:04.070
Some people are not that guy there.

1154
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:06.560
The guy you want to come to me for your quality talk.

1155
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.980
I know a lot about women's rights and I don't,

1156
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:12.170
I used to identify as a feminist,

1157
01:11:12.171 --> 01:11:15.600
but I found that like insulting to actual women.

1158
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.880
So I no longer identify as a feminist.

1159
01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:21.300
I will leave it up to women to decide whether or not I'm doing feminism

1160
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:22.980
correctly.
Yeah.
Amazing.

1161
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.990
If that guy picked up a box of cookies,

1162
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.510
he would fall asleep in the middle of lifting it up.

1163
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.940
It would fall and hit his head and

1164
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.100
outside the shit hits the fan.
That guy's not going to be able to rebuild.

1165
01:11:38.101 --> 01:11:41.970
Society has to be a singer that said,
oh,

1166
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:46.860
I think he's a comedian.
You don't even know.
That's the funny.

1167
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:51.210
It's whatever it is.
It's a disaster.
It's,
it's a bunch of people,

1168
01:11:51.211 --> 01:11:55.710
his shitty friends and like no one pulls him aside.
He goes,
no man,
no,

1169
01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:58.350
no on these fuckers Instagram and just

1170
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:04.260
do it and tag me in it so I can find that motherfucker.
He ain't go no.
It.

1171
01:12:04.261 --> 01:12:07.380
Matter of fact,
find these dudes on Instagram.
I know a lot of you listen,

1172
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:12.030
find these dudes,
these,
these bitch made dude's on Instagram.
Pic.
You comment,

1173
01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:13.530
you comment.
No.

1174
01:12:13.531 --> 01:12:18.420
And you tag at Crystal Leah and I want to see these duets.
Yeah,

1175
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:19.680
so I can laugh.
Well,

1176
01:12:19.681 --> 01:12:22.560
women position themselves as being different than other women too.

1177
01:12:22.561 --> 01:12:26.700
Like Amy Schumer's got a funny fucking sketchy.
She did our show about that,

1178
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:31.160
about the girl who can hang.
It's like there's a girl like,
hey,

1179
01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:36.510
I played.
Yeah,
she's hilarious.
It's like,
Hey guys,
I love sports.
You know,
God,

1180
01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.320
you know,
bitches are a fucking pain in the ass.
Tired of bitches.

1181
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:44.340
Oh hang out with you guys.
And they'll position themselves as being different.

1182
01:12:44.341 --> 01:12:49.140
Right.
Then all these other women that want a certain thing from a guy,
you know,

1183
01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.280
like I,
I knew this one chick and she had no female friends like nun,

1184
01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:59.100
but she was t f all day.
She would down to fuck everybody.

1185
01:12:59.410 --> 01:13:03.790
And that was her thing that she all had all male friends and you know,

1186
01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:06.870
she had boyfriends and she always banged other dude's was,
she had boyfriends.

1187
01:13:06.871 --> 01:13:09.930
I mean this chick was just always right,
but that was her hustle.

1188
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.550
Her Hustle was that she was,
you know,
one of the guys,
you know,

1189
01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:18.900
and that's how she got all these guys to like,
and she sorta morphed,
you know,

1190
01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.540
I mean kind of,
that's kind of what she liked.

1191
01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:23.850
But really when you get to know her,

1192
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:28.560
which she really wanted was like a real steady relationship.
And,
but guys,

1193
01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:32.790
she'd gotten in that trap where guys didn't take her seriously because sure she

1194
01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:35.790
was banging guys while she had other boyfriends and it was always like,

1195
01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:39.450
chaos and what does the cigarette,
I gotta get Outta here.
I gotta go home late.

1196
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:41.461
You know,
people,

1197
01:13:41.461 --> 01:13:44.940
they get in that position where their whole life is like a constant,
I'm late.

1198
01:13:44.941 --> 01:13:47.520
I got to go fuck my life.
Fuck my life.

1199
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:53.100
That was this check.
She was just,
it was always like,
oh,

1200
01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:56.090
Bobby thinks I'm fucking Stephen.
She's like,
it's all bullshit,
Stephen.

1201
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.440
I've been friends for years.
I told him,
well,
are you fucking Stephen?

1202
01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:03.630
I've been fucking Steve.
And we went to college together.
It's like,
not even,

1203
01:14:03.631 --> 01:14:05.130
it's like,
see,
I mean,
it's like,
you know,

1204
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:07.980
he comes over and sometimes they're both horny and you're like,
oh my God,

1205
01:14:07.981 --> 01:14:11.820
you're crazy.
But her hustle was,
she was different than all the other girls.

1206
01:14:11.821 --> 01:14:16.120
She was like just one of the guys she could hang and cheap.

1207
01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:19.150
But she deep down inside wanted a committed relationship course,

1208
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:21.400
but no guy who wanted to give it to her.
Well,

1209
01:14:21.401 --> 01:14:24.430
not if she's fucking all of his friends.
People Morph,
man.

1210
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:29.200
They morph and become who they think that other people want them to be.

1211
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:30.130
That's true.
You know,

1212
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.270
whether it's they become a male feminist or the weather it become a down ass

1213
01:14:34.271 --> 01:14:38.350
bitch or whatever,
you know,
people and then along the way,

1214
01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:42.460
they actually are that person along the way.
They actually become now.

1215
01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:46.570
That becomes all they know of themselves.
Yeah.

1216
01:14:46.571 --> 01:14:48.310
Well it's cause that's what they're,
you know,

1217
01:14:48.311 --> 01:14:52.420
it's like Oj probably thinks he didn't kill his wife.
You know what?

1218
01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:56.110
Everything so,
well,
I dunno.
I mean I wonder,
I don't know.
That's what they say,

1219
01:14:56.111 --> 01:15:01.000
but it's like the mind is fucking insane.
You make yourself who you want to be.

1220
01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:04.030
I think it's totally possible that he really believes at this point.

1221
01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.390
I don't know if he does or did,
you know,
it doesn't completely possible though.

1222
01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.590
I mean,
people have been way crazier than that.
Right.
Oh yeah.
That's just crazy.

1223
01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:14.770
It's not super duper crazy.
Crazy.
No,
it's not.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

1224
01:15:14.771 --> 01:15:18.040
if you lie to yourself for fucking 10 15,
what does it 20 years now?

1225
01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.390
93 94 or something like that.
Yeah,
20 years.
Yeah.
20 fucking years.

1226
01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:26.980
God,
that flew by almost 20 years.
Yeah.
Yeah.
People,

1227
01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.350
they become like religious people.

1228
01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:33.580
Think about how many religious people have like almost the exact same way of

1229
01:15:33.581 --> 01:15:36.940
talking,
almost the exact same inflection.

1230
01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.780
Like how many late night preachers have the same way of talking.

1231
01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:45.700
They all talk about God's word in the same way,

1232
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.250
the same way Chris Delea.
So we're,

1233
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:52.780
Jesus came down with these rules came down from the mountain.

1234
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.930
But why is that that they do that?

1235
01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.320
Because it's something they adopt just like a male feminist adopts sort of an

1236
01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:03.310
emo way of tracking in a more subtle way of like,

1237
01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:08.320
I'm more like,
I'm less aggressive passive.

1238
01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:13.120
I'm like much,
much more people that adopt comedians to go on stage.

1239
01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:15.700
And I uh,
yeah.
How many guys?

1240
01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:19.510
Like you remember when there was like 10 guys that sounded exactly like David

1241
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:22.810
Tess?
There was like 10 guys there and everybody would just be like,

1242
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:28.280
they were doing a towel.
They would go on stage.
They would do

1243
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:33.270
also with the uh,
sports announcers.
They,
you know,

1244
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:36.910
that's the A,
we go out again,

1245
01:16:36.911 --> 01:16:40.300
side retired that when I do that,
you're not like,
oh,

1246
01:16:40.301 --> 01:16:43.090
that's that sports announcer.
You're like,
that's the sports announcer guy.

1247
01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:47.320
Or like morning zoo Dj's.
Oh,
I did a tour,

1248
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:50.540
one of those radio tours the other day where it was promoting something.

1249
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:53.920
Worst things ever.
Yet they're not the worst things ever,
but dang,

1250
01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:56.290
almost like North Korean prison

1251
01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:02.830
would be on the list of worst things ever.
Nice folks.
I'm sure they're all,

1252
01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:04.390
they're all,
they're all nice individually,

1253
01:17:04.391 --> 01:17:07.820
but when you have to do four hours of bed,
it's the worst.
Well,
it's the,
well,
you,

1254
01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.590
you really appreciate when you call one and it's like,
and they know their shit.

1255
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:16.670
A good dude.
Yeah.
Like,
or a good gal.
Or You're taught how to say it.
Good.
Yeah.

1256
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.520
She's a good gal.
It sounds like you're just seeing in salt.

1257
01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:22.220
They were super imposed over your face.

1258
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:27.980
She's a good gal.
But you know,
I did four hours of this shit,

1259
01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:31.070
you know,
from like 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM and um,

1260
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.340
I spoke to 10 people that their exact same person.

1261
01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.190
I'll ride Chris Delea on the line.
Crystal,

1262
01:17:37.191 --> 01:17:41.590
he has new comedy tour starts this week.
Boom,
boom,
ha,
woo.

1263
01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:49.200
<v 4>And then their questions.
So what's the deal?
What do you,</v>

1264
01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.120
what when I did on dateable and I did these fucking things.
Are you dateable

1265
01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:59.760
<v 0>well,
what,
what is your fear factor?
That's what I used to get.</v>

1266
01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:00.780
What are you afraid of?

1267
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:06.900
<v 4>Cause I'm sure you don't want to eat bugs,
right?
No.
What,</v>

1268
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:11.130
what now what now?
The show's called on datable.
You're a good looking guy,
Chris.

1269
01:18:11.131 --> 01:18:11.964
What's the deal?

1270
01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.910
Just watch the boat.
What's the most uh,
data but what,

1271
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:22.660
what are you find a datable at a girl?
Ooh,
Ooh.

1272
01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:29.020
Floating shoes.
Whoa.
Take it out.

1273
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:34.470
<v 0>Or Strip club Dj come into this stage where Lexus Mercedes on stage to do</v>

1274
01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:41.860
gentlemen,
$15 Comma Cassie's.

1275
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:45.880
<v 4>Alright,
here we go.
Jenna.
Later years he goes,
oh,
I'll give it up for Anastasia</v>

1276
01:18:47.370 --> 01:18:52.270
<v 0>safe next batter.
Yeah.
It's uh,
yeah,
that,</v>

1277
01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:57.190
those,
those inflections,
those like patterns that people choose,
they,

1278
01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.790
they think that like this is how comedians supposed to talk.

1279
01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:03.630
I'll talk like that and then I'll be a comedian.
Like I dunno if it you did it,

1280
01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:06.570
but um,
a lot of comedians do it when they're starting out.

1281
01:19:06.571 --> 01:19:10.350
I had a real problem where I would mimic other comedians and I would catch

1282
01:19:10.351 --> 01:19:11.184
myself.

1283
01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:14.460
<v 4>Yeah.
If you watch too much or if you're like,
you know,</v>

1284
01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:17.070
in the beginning we were going to be like,
I like that guy,
you know,

1285
01:19:17.071 --> 01:19:21.330
and then you go on stage and,
but you figure it out if you do it enough,
you know,

1286
01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:22.231
it's like,

1287
01:19:22.231 --> 01:19:26.280
it's like reading one author and just siding with him and then you're like,
wait,

1288
01:19:26.281 --> 01:19:27.031
there's other books out there.

1289
01:19:27.031 --> 01:19:28.440
You've got to read a wall and then come with your own opinion.

1290
01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.340
<v 0>Yeah.
You talking about Brian County end,</v>

1291
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:36.250
we were talking about that earlier on.
The fucker look,
get on.

1292
01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:39.470
He will read a book and he probably doesn't even read the book and where he's

1293
01:19:39.471 --> 01:19:41.480
like one chapter.
It's amazing book.
You,

1294
01:19:41.481 --> 01:19:46.481
you have to read this and he basically seekers out life and you're like,

1295
01:19:47.161 --> 01:19:48.900
wait a minute,
did you know that guy's crazy?

1296
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:54.300
And I'll start sending him like debug things you that guy disagrees with Nobel

1297
01:19:54.301 --> 01:19:58.650
prize winning scientist and he misquotes their work and I'll send him like all

1298
01:19:58.651 --> 01:20:02.220
this fucking Brian and I got in this huge argument once because he kept quoting

1299
01:20:02.221 --> 01:20:06.240
this asshole that he had on his podcast.
So in the middle of the conversation,

1300
01:20:06.241 --> 01:20:09.570
cause I saved this my phone cause I was tired of having this conversation with

1301
01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:09.870
them.

1302
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:13.380
I just start reading off all the different things where this guy has lied and

1303
01:20:13.381 --> 01:20:18.150
said things wrong and you see him slowly get deflated.
I go,
do you ever just,

1304
01:20:18.170 --> 01:20:20.910
just Google debunked after that guy,

1305
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.350
just whatever guy you have.
Yes,
I do that with everybody.

1306
01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.540
I do that with everybody now that I have as a guest,

1307
01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:30.360
I had this one guy on named Dave Asprey and this guy,

1308
01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:35.760
he's a nice nice guy.
He's a little ass burglary and uh,
he,

1309
01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:38.730
he said a bunch of shit is going to want to have him on in the first place.

1310
01:20:38.731 --> 01:20:40.860
I didn't know.
I don't know.
I don't mean that.

1311
01:20:40.861 --> 01:20:41.970
I mean what was the reason he was on the,

1312
01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:44.850
she said knowledgeable guy knows a lot of shit.
About what though?

1313
01:20:44.851 --> 01:20:48.790
Like what different,
like he calls himself a biohacker.
And how did you know,

1314
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:52.200
learn about him?
I think Tate Tate Fletcher turned me into,
I'm pretty sure,

1315
01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:56.580
pretty sure it was Tate Tate loves a,
He created this,
um,
we didn't create it,

1316
01:20:56.581 --> 01:21:01.581
but he popularized this idea of a mixing coffee with grass fed butter and MCT

1317
01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:06.720
oil.
So it's like a slow burn of the caffeine gets,
it's a delicious beverage.

1318
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:09.360
That's really all it is.
But along the way,

1319
01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:13.320
he started promoting this type of coffee that he has.

1320
01:21:13.321 --> 01:21:15.480
That's what's called micro toxin free.

1321
01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:19.350
This is a long story that has been beaten to death on his podcast.

1322
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:24.120
So I don't want to go ahead too much.
But after that guy,

1323
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:28.950
it was so much misinformation that I felt responsible for it because I put it

1324
01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:31.650
out cause I,
and I repeated the things that he had told me.

1325
01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.330
So now I Google debunked.
I just,
you know,

1326
01:21:36.331 --> 01:21:38.090
eat a lot of times when you Google debunked,

1327
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:40.110
you find out a bunch of fucking crazy people.

1328
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:44.310
Don't even a guy like if you Google me debunked,

1329
01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.960
you'll find out that I'm like a CIA disinformation agent who is hiding the truth

1330
01:21:48.961 --> 01:21:51.450
about chem trails and for real.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1331
01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.660
That's a lot of people that believe that I'm a dis information ancient and then

1332
01:21:54.661 --> 01:21:57.540
I'm hiding the truth about chem trails,
chem trails,

1333
01:21:57.541 --> 01:22:00.630
which are the evil spraying that the government does with planes.

1334
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.260
When you see those contracts behind planes,
those are artificial clouds.

1335
01:22:04.261 --> 01:22:09.130
Chris Taleah and those are things
that government,

1336
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:14.290
yeah,
people are out of their fucking mind.
They,
they,
they,

1337
01:22:14.410 --> 01:22:17.610
I've been called a paid disinflation agent.

1338
01:22:17.611 --> 01:22:21.960
Like they believe that I get paid.
Like I'm waiting for my fucking checks.

1339
01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:25.800
First of all,
I'm not getting any checks from getting paid.

1340
01:22:25.801 --> 01:22:30.450
It might be a lump sum at the end of my life.
Yeah,
but people,

1341
01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.970
if you don't believe in the things that they believe in,

1342
01:22:32.971 --> 01:22:35.970
they automatically assume that you're a government agent.
I Guy,
this guy,

1343
01:22:35.971 --> 01:22:40.110
Mick West who was on the podcast who he was on my Scifi show too,

1344
01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:44.610
he runs this site called Metta bunk and it's all about debunking conspiracy

1345
01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:47.640
theories and all people ever say she works for the government.

1346
01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.900
This guy works for the government.
Of course,

1347
01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:54.140
he's a multi multimillionaire who sold a video game company as super successful

1348
01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:59.250
video game company was a part of the video game company that makes like Tony

1349
01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:00.083
Hawk videos and shit,

1350
01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:05.240
but dude's loaded and just he's into conspiracies like he's a scientist

1351
01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:08.090
essentially and a lot of ways he's not,
I wouldn't say he,

1352
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:13.270
he's a guy who's very educated and intellectually curious and so he tries to

1353
01:23:13.451 --> 01:23:17.980
figure out what it is about people that makes them gravitate towards these

1354
01:23:17.981 --> 01:23:22.240
unlikely scenarios that they believe that the government is spraying chemicals

1355
01:23:22.241 --> 01:23:23.074
in the sky.

1356
01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:27.070
And all you hear about this guy is that he's a paid disinformation agent,

1357
01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:29.890
which I know not to be true.
I know it's that true.
Right.

1358
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:33.940
But people want to believe that kind of shit.
Yeah,
it's more,

1359
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:38.940
it's more exciting if there's like big secrets out there certainly is.

1360
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:42.130
Do you think you,
do you ever hear that shit and you're like,

1361
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:46.000
I mean like I don't know Dick about that stuff,
you know,
so when I hear like,

1362
01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:50.380
like there's a part of me that doesn't believe,

1363
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.980
even though I know it has happened for sure they've covered stuff up like I

1364
01:23:53.981 --> 01:23:54.791
think like to come on,

1365
01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:59.791
they can't do that shit of the world is when we talked about earlier the Nixon

1366
01:24:00.131 --> 01:24:04.930
story that's out that I tweeted today,
that's a perfect example of the,

1367
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:06.970
there is fuckery in the world.

1368
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.920
Like Nixon tested the waters of like trying to see if there's any support for

1369
01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:15.970
military Coogan's congress.
That stuff does happen.
Look,

1370
01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:20.570
Watergate did happen.
They did spy on people that did record.
Um,

1371
01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:21.880
Kent State did have,

1372
01:24:22.150 --> 01:24:26.440
they did hire that they meet did take the national guard and make them break up

1373
01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:28.210
student protests and shoot students,

1374
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:32.650
shoot American students nonviolent non armed.
They did that,

1375
01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:36.190
you know,
they,
they did.
There's a lot of shit that's been done.

1376
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:38.860
So I think conspiracies are real.

1377
01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:44.130
But I think that the problem is that most people don't go into any scenario with

1378
01:24:44.231 --> 01:24:47.860
an open mind.
They don't really try to find out all the facts.

1379
01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.470
They have a predetermined idea that they want to,

1380
01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:55.510
they want that conclusion to be,
you know,
they want it to be valid.

1381
01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:58.930
They want to validate their conclusion more than they want to objectively look

1382
01:24:58.931 --> 01:25:03.460
at the truth.
Yeah,
that's a fucking huge problem.
Yeah.

1383
01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:05.650
Oh it's huge problem.
Well like look,

1384
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.460
here's another thing like say we were talking about like you're a good guy,

1385
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:14.140
right?
But if somebody wanted to find dirt on you,
if they wanted to dig deep,

1386
01:25:14.141 --> 01:25:16.780
you are the president.
They could find something fucked up about you.

1387
01:25:16.781 --> 01:25:21.160
Well in finding that fucked up thing about you,
that one fucked up thing.

1388
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:24.970
They could decide what Christa,
Leah,
he got drunk,

1389
01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:28.420
wants a jerked off in this girl's hair and he fucking asshole.

1390
01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:33.550
They could decide he is a chronic masturbator in girls' hair while they're
drunk.

1391
01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.250
Like this is what he does.
It's all he does is this his whole life.

1392
01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:40.150
Everything else is just setting himself up so he could jerk off people's hair

1393
01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:43.600
like,
like they could decide that one thing that you've done,

1394
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:47.410
you made sure you are.
Yeah.
Is We wore all the time.

1395
01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:50.880
They'll find one aspect of the personality that you know,

1396
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:55.480
like maybe you did this once or maybe you ran a red light and they'll just say,

1397
01:25:55.481 --> 01:25:59.200
he's a fucking reckless driver.
We've got runner show,
red light runner.

1398
01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:02.960
This guy's an asshole.
Did you see this Tony Stewart thing?
Do you know what?

1399
01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:05.390
Know what happened?
Ran over a guy,

1400
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:08.180
he's a NASCAR driver and he ran over guy.

1401
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:10.730
We were talking about it on the way home and um,

1402
01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.970
we were driving home from the Jolla.
We did a,

1403
01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:15.200
the La Jolla San Diego this weekend.

1404
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:19.310
Did American comedy and as we were driving back,
um,

1405
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.880
it was right when it was breaking,
right?
Yup.
And uh,
Tony Stewart,

1406
01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:25.160
who's this big time NASCAR driver,

1407
01:26:25.161 --> 01:26:29.870
ran over a guy in this dirt race with,
what are those called?
Sprint.

1408
01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:33.890
Sprint car,
I think Brent car,
they ride,
they,
this is crazy cars,

1409
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:34.940
that weird looking cars.

1410
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:40.010
They have wings on them and they drive around the dirt and he hit this guy's
car.

1411
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:45.140
The guy got out of the car and was yelling at Tony Stewart and Tony Stewart ran

1412
01:26:45.141 --> 01:26:48.440
him over with his car.
It's really fucked up.
He meant to do it.

1413
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:53.270
See that's where things get weird.
He says,
absolutely not.

1414
01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:57.350
Of course the uh,
the,
the local cops,

1415
01:26:57.430 --> 01:27:00.110
w whoever investigated it,
they're not pressing charges.

1416
01:27:00.170 --> 01:27:01.760
They think it was a total accident.

1417
01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:05.210
But now because of that,

1418
01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:09.780
everybody starts pulling up all the different shit that this guy's done right.

1419
01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.980
Past drive,
of course,
because apparently he's bumped people's cars before.

1420
01:27:12.981 --> 01:27:16.750
He's a very aggressive driver and there's been a lot of aggressive drives.
I,
I,

1421
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:20.300
I'm completely new to this stuff.
I don't follow racing,

1422
01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.970
but Tony Hinchcliffe does.

1423
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:26.720
And Hinchcliffe was the one that told me that Tony Stewart is known for being

1424
01:27:26.721 --> 01:27:28.670
this like really super aggressive driver.

1425
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000
So now I'm reading all this stuff online and these people are just bringing up

1426
01:27:34.731 --> 01:27:38.540
all these times in the past where he's,
he's clipped cars,

1427
01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:41.960
he's yelled at people or hit people.
He's,
he's,
you know,

1428
01:27:41.961 --> 01:27:45.560
he's a maniac and they're concentrating all on this.

1429
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:50.660
The negative aspects of this guy,
all negative aspects to try.
I mean who,
it,

1430
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:54.160
I don't understand exactly what it is cause they want to believe that he hit,

1431
01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.580
he hit him on purpose.

1432
01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:58.850
They want to believe that he hit the gas when he's near the guy cause he knew

1433
01:27:58.851 --> 01:28:01.910
the asset and the car would kick out and the acid in the car kicked out.

1434
01:28:01.911 --> 01:28:05.090
The Guy who get run over,
right.
Like it's,

1435
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.780
it's just one of those things where when something happens,

1436
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:12.460
if something goes wrong,
people will find the one,

1437
01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:17.620
one thing or the APP and then concentrate wholly on that instead of like,

1438
01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:22.190
I mean,
this is pure speculation because I don't know exactly what happened.

1439
01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:23.630
Instead of,
you know,

1440
01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:28.280
maybe he did drive aggressive and knock that guy on the wall and the guy got out

1441
01:28:28.281 --> 01:28:31.400
of his fucking car and the guy was on the track yelling at him.

1442
01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:36.320
And I don't understand,
I've never raced,
I don't know what it's like,

1443
01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:41.220
but I would imagine that there's some really fucking split second decision

1444
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:42.020
going,

1445
01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:47.020
flying around a track and you see a guy on the fucking track pointing at you.

1446
01:28:48.670 --> 01:28:49.430
Uh,
I would,

1447
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:54.430
I would imagine that the decisions like the pro and con do this and you,

1448
01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.640
you wouldn't be okay,
do that and that guy's going to die there.

1449
01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:02.010
There's such a small window of,
because this guy's

1450
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.290
<v 3>walking around on a fucking restraint.</v>

1451
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:06.700
You're not supposed to get out of your car and walk around.
Right?

1452
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:10.590
But all these people all online,
I've been looking at it all day yesterday.

1453
01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:12.510
All of them were saying that he killed this guy.

1454
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.640
So many people are blaming him for it.
Well,

1455
01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:18.180
that's also the people who write on the Internet though.
That's true.
No,

1456
01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:21.480
you know what I mean?
Yeah,
it's true.
But even eye witnesses,

1457
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:24.270
people who were there at the time,
I dunno.

1458
01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:26.930
I mean maybe it's not the best example because,
no,
it's a good example.

1459
01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:28.020
It definitely is.
I mean,

1460
01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.690
but there's kind of a lot of evidence that he's a wild man,
you know?
Well that's,

1461
01:29:32.691 --> 01:29:33.041
but that's,

1462
01:29:33.041 --> 01:29:37.330
but what you're saying is totally different than fucking trying over rationally.

1463
01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.200
But it could be that he was trying to like bump into him.

1464
01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:43.770
Like he was trying to prompt him with his car and instead he asked how fast was

1465
01:29:43.771 --> 01:29:48.720
he going?
I don't know.
Probably 25 to 35 he's under caution.
Not even that fast.

1466
01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:52.740
It was under caution.
So that's not fast at all.

1467
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:56.360
So you would think at 25 you'd be able to not hit the gun.

1468
01:29:56.370 --> 01:30:00.030
I knew for out of the way.
Yeah.
Did he,
did he hit his gas?
They don't know.

1469
01:30:00.031 --> 01:30:03.450
That's why people are singing.
Espn maybe muted the audio so you can't hear that.

1470
01:30:03.451 --> 01:30:06.810
But there's also a lot of people yelling.
They just muted the audio probably.

1471
01:30:06.811 --> 01:30:10.410
And just in general.
Let's watch it.
Let's watch it.
It's quiet.

1472
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:16.370
It's fucked up to watch cause he know a guy died.
But yeah,

1473
01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:19.500
I don't like watching that shit.
You ever watch that faces a death shit.
Oh yeah.

1474
01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.510
Yeah.
I watched it when I was a kid and I was like,
Nah,

1475
01:30:21.511 --> 01:30:24.240
I can't watch this anymore.
Today kids are so spoiled.

1476
01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:28.480
They could just Google murder and just watch a hundred videos where,

1477
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:29.910
where do you even watch that shit?
I don't know.

1478
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:34.380
Live leak live leak.com lively extends scary.
It is scary.

1479
01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.570
It's Worldstar hip hop plus murder.

1480
01:30:39.150 --> 01:30:42.030
Live League is like all the most fucked up things on the Internet.
Like A,

1481
01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.770
here's the,
let's go full screen in this shit.

1482
01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:48.630
<v 6>So you're going to get with it.
This is going to show the initial accident.</v>

1483
01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:52.590
See those cars?
They're like dump trucks.
What are we looking at?
Hand is froze.

1484
01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:54.173
Powerful Internet

1485
01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:59.360
<v 3>unfree sorry,
it's on deadspin.
Yeah.</v>

1486
01:30:59.361 --> 01:31:01.160
Sometimes it does that when you go full screen,
right?

1487
01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:02.133
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1488
01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:08.170
<v 3>Get it together to computer.
Just,
I dunno.
Might've lost it.
Why it's got to</v>

1489
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:09.263
<v 7>beach ball.</v>

1490
01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:13.850
<v 3>They're color wheel.
Yeah.
We've got a beach ball from that.
That's it.</v>

1491
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:17.560
We'll click it off and try again.
Reboot it or a fortune.

1492
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:21.080
It's going to take a long time.
A piece of shit computer.

1493
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:22.520
Why we still out that computer?

1494
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:25.390
Is there any benefit and keep talking about this off the air.

1495
01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:29.210
See if you can pull that up though and see.
We could pull it up on another site.

1496
01:31:29.211 --> 01:31:33.060
Does allow you to pull another side up,
but that's a NASCAR guy on,

1497
01:31:33.150 --> 01:31:37.370
I'll let you if I find it.
Okay.
Yeah.
He's a NASCAR guy,
but that was a nice guy.

1498
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:41.390
Wasn't NASCAR
race.

1499
01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:45.350
Well I think those guys that race,
they race and all kinds of shit.
They just,

1500
01:31:45.351 --> 01:31:47.390
they got to just sort of like,
just get me in a fucking car.

1501
01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:51.620
Looks like us with comedy.
Just give me on a stage somewhere.
Yeah,
like they do.

1502
01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.890
Crystal is doing a coffee shop.
Yeah.
What the fuck?
He's got an NBC show.

1503
01:31:54.891 --> 01:31:58.520
I'll play a laundromat,
I'll do a coffee shop.
I've got to do,
what do you do?

1504
01:31:58.521 --> 01:32:00.340
Open mikes show up at like weird spots

1505
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:01.130
<v 4>and do sets.</v>

1506
01:32:01.130 --> 01:32:06.130
Since I started getting into clubs like few years ago and just being able to go

1507
01:32:06.431 --> 01:32:09.850
up wherever I want,
I was like,
I just was like,

1508
01:32:09.851 --> 01:32:14.590
why would I go play buzz coffee?
You know what I mean?
Why would I go play?
Like,

1509
01:32:14.591 --> 01:32:17.410
because it's just like,
because there's going to be,

1510
01:32:17.411 --> 01:32:20.000
oh cause there's gonna be an audience at a comedy club.
So go there.
Right.

1511
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:24.260
A real audience.
Yeah.
And,
and I,
you know,
I don't know.
Some of the,

1512
01:32:24.261 --> 01:32:26.320
some of these old rooms are fucking awesome.

1513
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:30.240
But then it's like some of them are dog shit,
dog shit.
And they'll,

1514
01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:32.500
and they'll pretend they're awesome and then you get to the Gig and they're
like,

1515
01:32:32.850 --> 01:32:34.750
oh man,
last week it was great.
I don't know what happened,

1516
01:32:35.010 --> 01:32:36.010
how many times you're fucking her dad.

1517
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.270
A lot of all rooms are real weird in that like alt rooms that like almost like

1518
01:32:40.271 --> 01:32:43.420
everyone's making agreement to put out as little energy as possible.
Yeah.

1519
01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:48.430
And then if you come along and you've got,
you're like,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,

1520
01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:52.460
what are you doing man?
Yeah.
Don't you knew?
And this is warming room.

1521
01:32:52.810 --> 01:32:56.480
What are you trying to be funny?
You're trying too hard to be fun.
Yeah.

1522
01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:58.300
You trying.
There was like a,

1523
01:32:58.301 --> 01:33:02.780
there is a stigma in alt rooms on trying to entertain.
Yup.

1524
01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:07.000
You don't want to try.
Yeah.
I'm trying to though to that idea.
I just say,

1525
01:33:07.001 --> 01:33:09.420
write a book,
write a book.
No,

1526
01:33:09.421 --> 01:33:13.900
they want you to be on stage and be like that.
But that's guy,

1527
01:33:13.930 --> 01:33:18.310
not to me.
I mean,
look,
dude,
fucking some of the all comic,
whatever.

1528
01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:19.990
All funny is funny.
I don't give a fuck.
You know,

1529
01:33:20.050 --> 01:33:22.930
somebody's all comic is hilarious and some of them are fucking hilarious,

1530
01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:27.880
but it's like very few.
All comics,
very few are hilarious.
However,

1531
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:32.470
very few comics are hilarious.
That's true too.
But at all comics,
it's very few.

1532
01:33:32.471 --> 01:33:36.940
Very few.
I,
it's been awhile since I've been to one of those.

1533
01:33:36.941 --> 01:33:41.380
True,
true all,
you know,
like meltdowns.
Good and shit.

1534
01:33:42.330 --> 01:33:44.980
But the,
is that all though?
No,
it's not.
It's not.

1535
01:33:45.250 --> 01:33:49.870
It's like Chris Hardwick who's on comedy central.
Right.
It's his thing.
Yeah.

1536
01:33:49.871 --> 01:33:50.800
I guess you're right.
Yeah.

1537
01:33:50.801 --> 01:33:54.040
You want to fucking hate Koolaid the whole room just fucking run right through

1538
01:33:54.041 --> 01:33:58.840
it.
Yeah.
I don't know.
A lot of those all chose,
well,

1539
01:33:58.841 --> 01:34:01.360
you put them on,
you put some of those guys up on the comedy store.

1540
01:34:01.361 --> 01:34:06.040
It's like death.
It's,
it's uh,
yeah,
it's different.
It's a different show.
Yeah.

1541
01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:09.160
Well that's why they,
they built those rooms in the first,
first place.
Right.

1542
01:34:09.161 --> 01:34:10.420
That's why those rooms exist.

1543
01:34:10.421 --> 01:34:13.030
So that's why I'm saying if you can get into comedy clubs,

1544
01:34:13.150 --> 01:34:14.200
get the fucking comedy clubs,

1545
01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:18.640
those people are paying to see comedy and it has the word comedy in the fucking

1546
01:34:18.641 --> 01:34:22.960
thing.
Comedy Club.
That's what it's for.
Yeah.
It's not fucking,
you know,

1547
01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:25.960
buzz coffee is coffee.
Yeah.

1548
01:34:25.961 --> 01:34:30.730
Freddy Soto stopped doing those a long time ago before he died.
He,
uh,

1549
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.270
he used to tell people like,
they would always ask him,
you know,
hey,

1550
01:34:34.271 --> 01:34:38.950
we do my room.
I've got this thing is,
no,
I had a guy,
dude.
Okay.
How many clubs?

1551
01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:41.310
I had a guy the other night.
I don't know his name,
but he was like,
you know,

1552
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:43.390
the comedy store,
there'll be like fucking,

1553
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:48.310
you'll be literally like Jim Carrey will show up and then somebody will be like,

1554
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:51.370
Hey,
will you be my documentary?
And you're like,
Whoa,

1555
01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:54.190
like just fucking derelicts there.
Do you know what I mean?

1556
01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:59.540
I was at a comedy show and I was at the comedy store and then some kid was like,

1557
01:34:59.810 --> 01:35:03.380
hey man,
um,
I was wondering if you want to come by and do my room.
And I was like,

1558
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:07.550
oh,
well where is it?
What is it?
He's like,
yeah,
it's this.
Um,
it's,
well,
it's just,

1559
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:11.750
it's on Saturday night and it's just pizza place and um,
you know,

1560
01:35:11.751 --> 01:35:12.501
we can't pay you,

1561
01:35:12.501 --> 01:35:16.210
but it'd be awesome if you like did 15 minutes and you can have like the Pete

1562
01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:19.940
whatever pizza you want.
And I said,

1563
01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.310
you have to repeat yourself

1564
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:28.490
because I think I heard what you said,
but can you say it?

1565
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:33.480
Can you just say it again?
And he said it again.
And I said,
dude,
I,

1566
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:37.130
I can't be doing that.
I didn't know how to say.
It was like,

1567
01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.850
I can't be doing that.
I can be doing your pizza place.
I said,

1568
01:35:40.851 --> 01:35:44.480
you want me to perform and and for pizza.
I was like,
I can't be doing that.

1569
01:35:45.370 --> 01:35:50.210
And then I turned to the guy that was next to us that wasn't with me or him and

1570
01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:54.680
I said,
did you hear this guy?
And I was trying not to be a dick,
but I was.

1571
01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:56.240
It was amazing.

1572
01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.570
<v 0>But it's hard to not be like,
hey bro,
I'm on billboards.</v>

1573
01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:09.110
It's hard to do that.
I'm an actual television,

1574
01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:13.280
like a real TV show.
It's hard to not be a dick.
Yeah,
no,

1575
01:36:13.281 --> 01:36:14.750
I know what you're saying.
It's,

1576
01:36:14.751 --> 01:36:17.420
it's a weird situation when someone asks you to do something like that.

1577
01:36:17.421 --> 01:36:20.900
But to them it's like stage time,
you know?

1578
01:36:20.901 --> 01:36:24.890
That's how they get stage time and they see you like maybe crystal do my room.

1579
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:29.510
The problem with those rooms is most of the people there are not there to see

1580
01:36:29.511 --> 01:36:32.360
comedy doing comedy to pizza players sitting this way,

1581
01:36:32.361 --> 01:36:36.800
eating the pizza and the stages over there.
Yeah,
and you're,
you're interrupting.

1582
01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.200
Really.
Yeah.
It's like,
it's kind of rude.

1583
01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.590
It's not like you set up and play a song.
See if you sat up,

1584
01:36:42.591 --> 01:36:46.910
you can just zone out and listen to the music and eat.
Ah,
yeah.
It's no problem.

1585
01:36:47.210 --> 01:36:50.450
But if you were like talking about your,
uh,
your eight year old cousin,

1586
01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:54.380
that debit details,
I know that requires people to pay attention,
pay attention.

1587
01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:54.891
Yeah.

1588
01:36:54.891 --> 01:36:59.420
You can't tell a fucking story to somebody who's not listening to the story.

1589
01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.410
Right.
You'll have like 20 people in the crowd and at any given time,

1590
01:37:03.411 --> 01:37:06.680
one person will be paying attention to the story,
but they'll lose you.

1591
01:37:06.681 --> 01:37:09.180
And then a new personal pay attention.
What does that talking about?

1592
01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.730
That people are paying attention.
It's like in short bursts.
Exactly.

1593
01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.380
So you have the video now?

1594
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:18.110
<v 4>Yup.
All right.
Jamie's got the video now.
Nice.
I think.</v>

1595
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:23.400
<v 0>Yeah,
maybe.
Okay,
so here's the dude's,</v>

1596
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:26.630
they'll be these weird wings they have on their cars.
Oh yeah,
I've seen those.

1597
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:29.760
So he spun the guy out.
Okay.
Okay.
So he,

1598
01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:32.650
let's back that up so we could see what happened before.

1599
01:37:32.651 --> 01:37:35.400
So that's the guy that he hit first.
Yeah.
That's the okay.

1600
01:37:35.490 --> 01:37:37.530
Back it all the way up to the beginning.
Here it goes.

1601
01:37:37.531 --> 01:37:38.670
So they're going around the corner.

1602
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:40.560
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1603
01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:43.950
<v 0>And he clipped the guy with his teddy.
Okay.
Yeah.
It looked like his,</v>

1604
01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:46.710
his tire bumped into the guy.
The guy spun around.

1605
01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.390
They're all flying.
Right?
It's got,
gets out.
Yeah.
So this guy's pissed.

1606
01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:55.860
He climbs out of his car

1607
01:37:57.970 --> 01:38:02.760
<v 3>and he's pointing to them.
You,
you fucker,
you hit me.
You fucking hit me.
Wow.</v>

1608
01:38:02.761 --> 01:38:07.250
This is crazy.
This guy's crazy.
He just hit him.
Oh wait,
right there.

1609
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.550
Right there.
Boom.
He hit them Christ.

1610
01:38:11.110 --> 01:38:11.943
<v 8>Whoa.</v>

1611
01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:16.320
<v 3>Oh Man.
See,</v>

1612
01:38:16.321 --> 01:38:18.960
I don't know enough about what he talking about 25 miles an hour roughly.

1613
01:38:18.970 --> 01:38:20.640
And there some people were able to avoid him.

1614
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.590
You'd think that they'd be able to avoid him.
I mean,
it looks pretty bad.
Yeah.

1615
01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:27.420
Just from,
I don't know anything about it,
but Jesus Christ.
Well,

1616
01:38:27.421 --> 01:38:31.080
they're also saying that when you hit the gas,
like,
uh,

1617
01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:34.850
your acid kicks out because it's all dirt riding around.
Right,
right.

1618
01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:35.430
So when you hit,

1619
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:40.290
he hit the gas on purpose and making these das slide out like he was gonna hit

1620
01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:43.530
up the guy like he was going to bump them out of the way and he would certainly

1621
01:38:43.531 --> 01:38:47.140
know that as a driver.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's a voc.
Yeah.
You wouldn't know that.

1622
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:51.870
Yeah.
Oh man,
that's crazy.
Well that,
what's the craziest thing about that?

1623
01:38:51.871 --> 01:38:53.310
Is it the guy got out,
guys,

1624
01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:57.630
crazy fucker forgetting out like that and then running on the track and voiding

1625
01:38:57.631 --> 01:39:01.920
cars and pointing at this guy like,
you fucking did this to me.
Like wow.

1626
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:05.090
Also isn't that the game to do that to somebody?
I don't think so.
No.

1627
01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:10.230
There's no rule about it.
Apparently.
No rule about accidentally hitting guys.

1628
01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:13.010
No on on getting out in the car.
I'm sorry,
I'm getting out of,
oh no,

1629
01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.240
I just made the track.
What do you mean there's no rule.

1630
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:17.430
They don't have a rule about that.
Like it's,

1631
01:39:17.650 --> 01:39:19.630
it's not illegal to get out of your car.
Right.

1632
01:39:19.670 --> 01:39:23.100
I'm saying ESPN yesterday I was hearing the debate about should they make a rule

1633
01:39:23.101 --> 01:39:26.790
about this?
Fuck.
Yeah,
you should make a rule.
Yeah,
right.
Stay in your fucking car.

1634
01:39:26.791 --> 01:39:31.470
What are you crazy?
You know,
because if he got clipped in the car,

1635
01:39:31.471 --> 01:39:33.200
he probably would have been fine.
You know,

1636
01:39:33.230 --> 01:39:36.360
if like someone came along and guys are,
he did get clipped in the car.

1637
01:39:36.361 --> 01:39:40.200
He was fine.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly right.
And at high speed.
Yeah.
Right.

1638
01:39:40.201 --> 01:39:43.500
And then there they were at a caution.
So there may be only you have to stay in,

1639
01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.860
you can get out if your car is on fire,
if like,
if it's a life life,

1640
01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:51.630
life changing situation.
Yeah.
That makes sense.
Other than that shit.

1641
01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:55.410
Yeah.
I can't watch it like that,
man.
I saw an image of that guy stuff,

1642
01:39:55.411 --> 01:39:57.600
that terrorist stacking in those three heads on the fucking thing.

1643
01:39:57.601 --> 01:40:00.300
And I was like,
no,
I don't know if you saw that.
But that's like,

1644
01:40:00.690 --> 01:40:05.690
I remember the first one from the Iraq war where we watched a guy get his head

1645
01:40:06.031 --> 01:40:10.890
cut off on video and you can watch that shit.
Well,
I mean,
I can,
I have,

1646
01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:15.540
I like it like even two girls,
one cup.
I'm like,
Nah,
Nah.

1647
01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.130
Oh,
she shits in her mouth.
No.
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh,

1648
01:40:20.131 --> 01:40:22.470
isn't there a video of you watching that?
Yeah,
that's right.

1649
01:40:22.471 --> 01:40:24.000
I saw that video barely.

1650
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:28.680
I posted fear factor for six years and I still had to turn away.

1651
01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:31.280
I think about all the shit that I've seen.
Yeah.

1652
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:35.780
But you could throw up in front of me and I never,
I don't gag.
Yeah.

1653
01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:39.930
Like my,
that's like,
um,
I'm the in charge of throw up around my house.

1654
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:45.240
Like anytime anybody throws up and I just,
my,
my little girls throw up.

1655
01:40:45.241 --> 01:40:49.110
I always cleaned it up.
Well,
my wife just gives it to me.
Like I handle it.

1656
01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:52.320
It doesn't bother.
Right,
right.
I'm immune to puke.
It's like,

1657
01:40:52.321 --> 01:40:53.920
it used to be when I was a kid,

1658
01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.550
<v 0>somebody threw up in the room.
All this extra saliva would be my mouth.
Yeah,
yeah,</v>

1659
01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:02.260
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And I would have to look away or I throw up,

1660
01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:06.400
if someone threw up in the hallway,
I'd be gagging,
but not now.
It's over.

1661
01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:08.980
I cleaned up,
picked the other night and I am a little girl.

1662
01:41:08.981 --> 01:41:12.640
My four year old was sick.
It's threw up in the bed.
Who Cleans it up?
Me.

1663
01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:16.000
I go in their towels and shit.
Picking up the fucking,

1664
01:41:16.110 --> 01:41:20.680
the picking up all the sheets,
putting the puke into a big puke,

1665
01:41:20.681 --> 01:41:23.650
like one of those little stork things at the store carries.
Yeah.

1666
01:41:24.450 --> 01:41:27.960
<v 4>My Dad,
the first time I threw up my,
uh,
my,</v>

1667
01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:30.260
when I was a kid and my dad tells a story where it's like,
you know,

1668
01:41:30.261 --> 01:41:32.910
you don't know what's happening to your body.
You know,
you're like,
what the heck?

1669
01:41:32.911 --> 01:41:37.590
I feel weird,
like a nauseous.
And my dad like identified it and he was like,
Oh,

1670
01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:42.340
you're going to throw up.
He was like,
this is normal.
Like,
I don't know,

1671
01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.950
it's 32
stupid jokes.
And,
um,

1672
01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:50.340
I don't know.
Young,
young,
young,
you know,
and uh,
he would,
he was like,

1673
01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:53.310
you're gonna,
you're gonna throw up and it's going to be fine.
And I was so,

1674
01:41:53.490 --> 01:41:55.680
I was like,
oh,
I don't know what's going on.
You don't know what's going on.

1675
01:41:55.860 --> 01:42:00.150
And he turned me to him and he said,
look,

1676
01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:04.440
it's fine.
Just throw up on me.
You're going to throw up.

1677
01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:07.110
And it's going to just go all over me and it's fine.

1678
01:42:07.110 --> 01:42:12.110
And he said that that made me relax and he said that I just want to throw up all

1679
01:42:12.391 --> 01:42:17.340
over them,
but as this fucking cute I thought,
but it was like,

1680
01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.330
I just thought that this is funny to think about like the first time that that

1681
01:42:21.331 --> 01:42:25.710
shit happens with you as like,
you're like,
that's scary as shit.

1682
01:42:26.430 --> 01:42:31.260
Yeah.
It is scary shit.
The first time you're like,
what's happening?

1683
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:33.000
This isn't something trying to get out of my body.

1684
01:42:34.570 --> 01:42:38.460
The food poisoning is the worst
food.

1685
01:42:38.461 --> 01:42:41.100
Poison the worst when you're just,
when you're just,
when it's coming out in your,

1686
01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:45.660
you're screaming it out.
You know what I mean?
Violent,

1687
01:42:47.190 --> 01:42:51.980
inadequate poisoning in a wash it,
knock on wood once you've had an a cup

1688
01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.630
<v 0>all times.
But uh,</v>

1689
01:42:53.631 --> 01:42:57.470
I had it real bad one time in Illinois.

1690
01:42:58.250 --> 01:43:02.490
Oh,
it was awful.
I couldn't clench my fist,
like my hands were so weak.

1691
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:03.440
It was just so,

1692
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:08.770
and I just spent the entire night puking and shitting both ways.
Yeah.

1693
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:12.470
What can you do to prevent,
someone told me garlic.
Someone told me if you're,

1694
01:43:12.471 --> 01:43:16.340
if you have like some funky shit inside your stomach,
if you eat raw garlic,

1695
01:43:16.670 --> 01:43:20.330
raw garlic apparently destroys like a lot of bad bacteria.

1696
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:25.160
<v 4>Yeah.
You just got to sit down near the toilet and just fucking curl up and</v>

1697
01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:27.850
<v 0>Dale son and just shouldn't puke.
I heard garlic,</v>

1698
01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:30.220
I heard garlic is really good for you but it takes a while to get down there.

1699
01:43:30.230 --> 01:43:33.620
You're a fucking shit impute and walked away I e.
Bro.
You put it in your ass.

1700
01:43:33.621 --> 01:43:37.750
Fucking Cias it down.
Give it an express delivery.
I go like,

1701
01:43:37.751 --> 01:43:39.140
I put it on the end of my thumb and I,
I guess

1702
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:43.790
it hits the back of my shit and then just goes right.

1703
01:43:43.791 --> 01:43:47.130
Then it goes right down like a shoot.
Yeah,

1704
01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:50.750
they didn't to figure that out did it should be a way to scan things.

1705
01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:52.040
We out if it's got food

1706
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.670
<v 3>poisoning,
you know like just to me,
why doesn't someone come out with a scanner?</v>

1707
01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:59.480
I just something that just can breed the contents of the food was like,

1708
01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:03.560
oh this eco lie all of your fucking salad.
Don't eat it.
It'll happen.
You know,

1709
01:44:03.561 --> 01:44:07.550
that's the number one thing that people get sick from salad.
Oh yeah,
no,
I,
yeah,

1710
01:44:07.551 --> 01:44:09.800
I know that sounds bad.
Be fucking sound.
Yeah.

1711
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:14.720
Salad gives people food poisoned meat but or some shit.
Fish.
Yeah.

1712
01:44:14.721 --> 01:44:18.440
You would think it was like bad fish or bad meat salad is because they don't,

1713
01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:22.460
not Washington.
It's not washed.
Right.
But um,
yeah.

1714
01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:27.020
Well remember all those people were dying from spinach is cause the spinach was

1715
01:44:27.021 --> 01:44:31.420
tainted with Nikolai waste from the uh,
from cows and shit.

1716
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:32.450
You found what?

1717
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:35.660
<v 9>There's a uh,
electronic nose that sniffs out.
Food poisoning.</v>

1718
01:44:35.730 --> 01:44:40.600
<v 3>What,
what to APP and APP sniffs.
Study Cola.
I think you've come on the bottom.</v>

1719
01:44:40.601 --> 01:44:41.770
Your phone.
I'll check what,

1720
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:42.783
<v 5>yeah,</v>

1721
01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:45.800
<v 3>new electronic nose.
Sniffs out.
Food.
Poison.</v>

1722
01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:51.030
Isn't it amazing when you,
you say something thinking like this is,
yeah.

1723
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:54.220
Component one of years away from that.
Completely impossible.

1724
01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:56.780
No one's going to ever come up with something like that.
How is that possible?

1725
01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:57.790
It really works.

1726
01:44:58.090 --> 01:45:01.350
<v 9>It checks the freshness and quality of meat,
poultry and fish.</v>

1727
01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:05.860
<v 3>Wow.
It's an APP.
What's the APP?
Crawler will download that fucker right now.</v>

1728
01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:08.620
I might not.
I mean you probably have to have an ignorance to something.

1729
01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:11.320
It doesn't look like it.
He or she is.
No Way.

1730
01:45:11.321 --> 01:45:13.450
You just take your phone and fucking go like this.

1731

Yes.

1732
01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:21.940
All right.
I'm downloading that bitch right now and we'll see if it works.

1733
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.790
I'm going to put it on Krista,

P.

Okay.

1735
01:45:28.730 --> 01:45:32.420
<v 9>He knows world's first portable,
he knows and it's Ios.</v>

1736
01:45:32.421 --> 01:45:35.990
Android mobile APP enables users to determine quality freshness of meat,

1737
01:45:35.991 --> 01:45:39.490
poultry and fish and whether it's gone bad and could potentially cause food.

1738
01:45:39.570 --> 01:45:43.680
<v 3>Wait a minute.
It's called p.
E.
R.
E.
S.
What's the name of the APP?</v>

1739
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:48.130
<v 9>I believe it's what says developers say Perry's or peer.
Perry's.</v>

1740
01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:49.180
Perry's right here.

Hmm,
but is this available already prominent assume?
No.</v>

1742
01:45:54.810 --> 01:45:58.650
Yeah,
because when I went to p e r e s,
it gives me some Russian shit.

1743
01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:05.270
Oh,
back to that spy.
Perestroika.
That's what it gives you.
Yeah.
See that's,

1744
01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.420
that's what comes up.
Here's the video.
That Russian writing and shit.

1745
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:11.690
See if it says that it's a actually available.
Yeah.
Pull the video up.

1746
01:46:11.691 --> 01:46:12.524
Let's listen to it.

1747
01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:18.190
<v 10>The gas is in the sample and adjust play from the beginning so we can actually</v>

1748
01:46:18.191 --> 01:46:21.810
look at that fucking bullshit.
Beads go into a green thing.

1749
01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:25.340
Detecting food in the USA.

1750
01:46:25.710 --> 01:46:30.710
76 million cases of foodborne illness resulting in 325,000 hospitalizations and

1751
01:46:33.211 --> 01:46:36.450
5,000 death.
First of all,
pause that.
Estimated to it.
That,

1752
01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:40.500
<v 3>why is that?
I got to talk like that in the USA.
Yeah.
Three hey,</v>

1753
01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:44.250
15 million paper.
It just sounds like bullshit already.

1754
01:46:45.630 --> 01:46:50.010
Numbers 76 cases of food borne illnesses in

1755
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:51.570
<v 0>three to five zero,</v>

1756
01:46:51.571 --> 01:46:56.370
zero they just 5,000 deaths are estimated to occur each year.

1757
01:46:56.371 --> 01:47:00.180
Holy Shit.
That doesn't surprise me.
That surprises you.
That's a lot.
It really,

1758
01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:03.510
there's so many people.
That's true of a lot of fucking people,

1759
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:07.170
but 5,000 deaths from food borne illness.
All right,
play it out.

1760
01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.153
<v 11>Kurt cheer.</v>

1761
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:14.500
The Paris story began when the team who created the device collaborated with

1762
01:47:14.501 --> 01:47:18.490
scientists from count US University of Technology in Lithuania.

1763
01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.930
After more than a year of research and develop

1764
01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:30.850
a team has now created a second working prototype of the Perez device.

1765
01:47:31.210 --> 01:47:35.500
Paris works by taking a sample of the air from around the pork,
beef,

1766
01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:40.680
poultry or fish by detecting the concentration of volatile organic compounds and

1767
01:47:41.021 --> 01:47:45.070
other gasses in the sample and adjusting them according to temperature and

1768
01:47:45.071 --> 01:47:45.904
humidity.

1769
01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:50.590
It calculates the freshness and quality of the food product using sensor away

1770
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:54.850
and Bluetooth technology data are transmitted directly to a smartphone,

1771
01:47:54.890 --> 01:47:59.130
a tablet for calculation of sample data users immediately.

1772
01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:02.440
So it's a thing to help them make the transference.
It's smells.

1773
01:48:02.441 --> 01:48:05.170
Your food and safety of their pork,
beef,

1774
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:07.520
poultry and fish smell SmartCare

1775
01:48:08.210 --> 01:48:12.740
<v 3>oh yeah,
my fart.
Right into that day or just breaks.
What did your part,</v>

1776
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:13.583
I call your mom,

1777
01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:19.840
get Joey d as a fart into that thing and it just sort of wets isn't attractive.

1778
01:48:19.850 --> 01:48:22.670
Streamline.
Yeah.
Well if it's another device,

1779
01:48:22.671 --> 01:48:24.630
I mean I thought that was your fucking good design,

1780
01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.490
but saying it's a prototype so it's not ready yet or read it on your iPhone.

1781
01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.800
But they're saying prototype,
right?

1782
01:48:34.570 --> 01:48:35.780
Yeah.
We can dress this guy

1783
01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.870
we asked you for contribution knocked on upon my family,

1784
01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:45.960
but for yours as well,
trust me.
Okay,

1785
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:48.990
<v 0>give me money and I'm going to make this.
I swear to God it works.</v>

1786
01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:54.120
I switched to good in mother's Russia.
I promise you,
and swear to Anna Chapman,

1787
01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:59.340
who if I make enough money I can make wedding vow with her,

1788
01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:01.260
the Russian spy.

1789
01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:06.980
Then she will leave this traitor Edward Snowden and come with me to make food

1790
01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:12.180
safe.
Or everyone give money to Kickstarter.

1791
01:49:13.290 --> 01:49:15.000
Everybody's got a fucking kickstarted man.

1792
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:16.960
I'm getting a little annoyed when people's kickstarters,

1793
01:49:17.210 --> 01:49:20.070
you know there's people that have kickstarters are their like for their own

1794
01:49:20.071 --> 01:49:21.810
business and they actually have money already.

1795
01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:25.540
Like whatever happened to just investing your fucking money.
You know why?

1796
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:27.230
Why were you trying to steal money from everybody?

1797
01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.880
But isn't that how investment works though?
No,
I mean they get,

1798
01:49:29.881 --> 01:49:34.500
you get other people to invest in it.
Yeah.
But Kickstarter is like,
like it's,

1799
01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:36.540
it's,
some of the Kickstarter ones are pretty,

1800
01:49:36.541 --> 01:49:37.920
I don't know much about Kickstarter.

1801
01:49:37.921 --> 01:49:40.080
All I know is that that people are given Zach Braff shit.

1802
01:49:40.081 --> 01:49:42.240
And I don't think that that's cool that they're given Zach Braff.

1803
01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:46.980
Zach Braff was the guy who made,
um,
the garden state,
the guy from scrubs.
Oh.

1804
01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:48.010
And he

1805
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.310
<v 3>put out a Kickstarter to make fund his next film and people give them money to</v>

1806
01:49:51.311 --> 01:49:54.720
make his next film.
And I think that that's cool.
Why are people giving him shit?

1807
01:49:54.730 --> 01:49:57.190
Because they're like,
well,
he's made a lot of money.
Why didn't he do it?

1808
01:49:57.191 --> 01:50:00.640
It's like,
what are you talking about?
It doesn't how investment works.
Um,
yeah,

1809
01:50:00.641 --> 01:50:05.110
I guess so.
That's,
put it that way though,
actually kickstarted.
Makes sense then.

1810
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:07.960
Well,
because people,
because they're like,
well,
I mean,

1811
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:11.050
because movies cost well because movies cost millions of dollars.
That's why,

1812
01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:12.220
and yeah,
he's got millions of dollars.

1813
01:50:12.221 --> 01:50:14.340
But what kind of fucking asshole is going to be like,
oh,

1814
01:50:14.341 --> 01:50:17.980
I'm gonna make this movie.
I'm gonna put $10 million into it.
Mel Gibson,
right.

1815
01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:22.750
That's how crazy dash.
Yeah.
That's how he got rich as fuck.
Yeah.
But meanwhile,

1816
01:50:22.751 --> 01:50:26.100
I don't think he's rich as fuck anymore.
No,
really?
No.
Apparently.
Wow.

1817
01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.460
It took a beating.
Mel took a bath.
The ex wife got a big chunk.

1818
01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:34.480
The,
uh,
the girlfriend who went chief recorded him.
No,
that was the girlfriend.

1819
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:37.540
It wasn't the wife that was just some Russian chicky knocked up.

1820
01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:42.280
But that was with Russians,
man.
Spy in recordings,
spying,

1821
01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:47.170
recording very around a Russian.
Very mercenary.

1822
01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:48.910
But that was the perfect,

1823
01:50:48.911 --> 01:50:52.600
what does this potato salad could ask for $10 to make potato salad on

1824
01:50:52.601 --> 01:50:55.570
Kickstarter.
And he ended up getting over $55,000 for it.

1825
01:50:55.571 --> 01:50:57.430
So what happens with that?
He gets to keep that money.

1826
01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:01.810
He's actually going to throw a party in Columbus and have a big concert and

1827
01:51:01.811 --> 01:51:02.411
Deloitte donate,

1828
01:51:02.411 --> 01:51:05.800
and I'm like $35,000 to charity and started nonprofit to the closer.

1829
01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:10.420
That's a nice guy.
But that's just the updated version of pet rock.
Yeah.

1830
01:51:10.450 --> 01:51:15.450
You know the guy who made the pet rock made a fucking kajillion dollars pet rock

1831
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:16.940
made a lot of fucking her.

1832
01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:20.590
Now I remember that I was a kid when that was going on the pet rock.

1833
01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:25.540
It's ridiculous.
I think that was that the seventies that was before me,
I think.

1834
01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:30.760
I believe it was guy.
Basically packaged rocks.
Rocks and that's it.

1835
01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:34.600
And sold them and people's doors.
And this is before Internet?
Yes.
Yeah.

1836
01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:37.720
And not one person bought them millions.
Yeah,
he made a lot of money.

1837
01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:40.900
I'm going to how much the pet rock made?
What do you guess?
I want to bet.

1838
01:51:42.370 --> 01:51:46.150
I want to say made 50 million bucks.
Yeah.
Jesus.

1839
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:50.140
How much do you think I can't be 50.
I bet he made about 15 million bucks.

1840
01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:55.690
How much do you think Tayga?
I'd say a few million.
Three,
4 million.
Okay.

1841
01:51:55.691 --> 01:51:59.200
Marketing corporate director.
Her,
I don't know much about it though.

1842
01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:03.160
A few million.
That's it.
How?
I guess I,

1843
01:52:03.161 --> 01:52:08.161
I'd like to believe that pet rock millionaire offers new method to get stoned.

1844
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.500
That's an actual coupon copy of a newspaper.
Uh,

1845
01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:19.840
how much of this Guy Mac development doesn't say,

1846
01:52:19.841 --> 01:52:21.670
how could the Wikipedia not say that would,

1847
01:52:21.730 --> 01:52:25.360
I would think that would be one of the first things that people at 1.5 million

1848
01:52:25.361 --> 01:52:30.130
pet rocks.
Oh,
so then at least how much do they cost?

1849
01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:31.713
A few dollars.
Right?

1850
01:52:32.350 --> 01:52:37.180
The fad lasted about six months ending after a short increase in sales during

1851
01:52:37.181 --> 01:52:41.890
the Christmas season of December,
1975 timing.
Although by February,
1976,

1852
01:52:41.891 --> 01:52:46.160
they were discounted due to lower sales.
He sold

1853
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:50.010
<v 0>1.5 million pet rocks and became a millionaire.
Crazy.</v>

1854
01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:55.230
A 32 page official training manual tile titled The Care and Training of your pet

1855
01:52:56.391 --> 01:53:01.070
rock was included with instructions on how to properly raise and care for one's

1856
01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:05.940
new pet rock.
Notably net lacking instructions for feeding,
bathing,
Cetera,
Perra.

1857
01:53:06.170 --> 01:53:10.720
So if it costs five bucks,
homeboy made a lot of money,
made 5 million bucks,

1858
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:11.930
20 bucks.

1859
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:16.290
Now you can still buy the shit that rock.com.

1860
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:20.570
Same Company you think?
Yeah.
Since 1975.
Wow.
Whoa.

1861
01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:22.160
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1862
01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.960
<v 0>yeah.
Since then he sold 10</v>

1863
01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:30.620
1975 he sold 1.5 million gone real bad.
Slipped off,
dude.

1864
01:53:30.621 --> 01:53:33.290
I don't know what happened.
Six months were great after Watergate.

1865
01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:36.110
He would just get really squirrely about their money by blaming.

1866
01:53:36.111 --> 01:53:40.040
I'm going to let nine 11 didn't do Mel Gibson one was probably when we're just

1867
01:53:40.041 --> 01:53:43.370
playing worst than Kramer or the same.

1868
01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:45.333
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1869
01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:48.650
<v 0>Worse I think.
Not,
no.</v>

1870
01:53:48.651 --> 01:53:53.390
Well the Kramer one was worse because it was videotaped.
Right.
That's true.

1871
01:53:53.410 --> 01:53:58.160
That you saw in his eyes hate.
That's true it Mel Gibson,
you're like,
yeah,

1872
01:53:58.430 --> 01:54:02.030
but he's an actor and you heard it and who knows?
But it was so funny.

1873
01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:03.080
It was fucked up.

1874
01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:07.480
But she has shut up and blow may,

1875
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:10.940
but it was,

1876
01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:14.270
it's fucked up that we're getting a window into this guys kind of feel like you

1877
01:54:14.271 --> 01:54:18.950
shouldn't be able to say whatever you want on in your house and,

1878
01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:24.050
and it,
they can't use that against you.
Well,
definitely,
you know,

1879
01:54:24.051 --> 01:54:28.490
especially because there's a lot of times like we were talking about jokes,

1880
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:33.500
like I have this whole bit in my act about the difference between someone joking

1881
01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:35.460
and soon as I saw you do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
Yeah.

1882
01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.370
But the point is like that when you're onstage in a comedy club,

1883
01:54:40.371 --> 01:54:44.400
you should assume that someone's fucking around.
Right,
right.
Because,
um,
I,

1884
01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:48.170
you know what you came to see,
you know,
you came to see comedy.
Well,

1885
01:54:48.171 --> 01:54:49.220
when you're at home,

1886
01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:53.540
you don't expect that other people are going to hear what you're saying.
Right.

1887
01:54:53.690 --> 01:54:57.680
So there's a lot of times people just say fucked up shit just to say it and not

1888
01:54:57.681 --> 01:55:02.030
even mean it.
You're a fucking con.
I hope you rot at the bottom.

1889
01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:05.810
I'm million by the way.
All of dog shit.
And by the way,

1890
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:08.750
you're by yourself when you say that.
Yeah.
Maybe cause why not?

1891
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:10.460
You're fucking home and you're alone,

1892
01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:13.580
or you're at home and you've got your Dick in your hand and you're talking to

1893
01:55:13.581 --> 01:55:16.990
your girlfriend on the phone and she's been an asshole to you and you,

1894
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:18.790
she didn't,
won't come over and have sex with.
Yeah.

1895
01:55:18.850 --> 01:55:21.200
So he just screams because you're drunk.

1896
01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:24.430
He screamed some horrible obscenities or you don't mean at all?
No,

1897
01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:28.250
and the next day it's on the Internet.
You're like,
I was fucking kidding.

1898
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:32.510
I wasn't being serious.
Yeah.
There's statements,

1899
01:55:32.511 --> 01:55:33.710
there's public statements,

1900
01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.700
and then there's things that can be turned into public statements if they record

1901
01:55:37.701 --> 01:55:39.080
you and then just transmit it.

1902
01:55:39.081 --> 01:55:41.510
And that's what happened with Mel Gibson that destroyed him.

1903
01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:44.050
He was a giant superstar.
Really?

1904
01:55:44.050 --> 01:55:44.883
<v 3>Did he really?</v>

1905
01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:50.360
Was that more just the business of things that weren't going well for him or was

1906
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:53.180
he,
he was,
he was at the top of his game.
I can't remember when that happened.

1907
01:55:53.181 --> 01:55:55.870
He was at the top of his game.
It was two things happen to him.

1908
01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:59.820
Two things have the,
the,
the anti-semite thing that,
to me,

1909
01:55:59.821 --> 01:56:04.440
that was what buried him.
But the anti-semite thing was there was no recording.

1910
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:06.990
Right?
Right.
No,
I don't think there was.

1911
01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:10.800
Was that come that those cops record everything?
I don't think there was.

1912
01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:14.790
I don't know if there was,
I don't think the,
I don't believe it got out publicly,

1913
01:56:14.791 --> 01:56:18.840
but I do believe that the cops were saying that Mel Gibson was calling them Jews

1914
01:56:18.841 --> 01:56:23.841
and saying that Jews Control Hollywood and also his dad is like a Holocaust

1915
01:56:25.111 --> 01:56:29.940
denier.
And also he was drunk driving,
right?
Yes.
Right.
So the,
that,

1916
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:34.710
that in itself is just like,
oh,
he's a fuck up.
Yeah.
Those things are all bad

1917
01:56:36.450 --> 01:56:40.560
drunk driving and screaming about Jews.
Right.
People frown upon those,

1918
01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:41.813
that combination.

1919
01:56:42.170 --> 01:56:45.750
If you're screaming positive things about Jews and you're hammered,

1920
01:56:45.751 --> 01:56:49.380
you're just like,
it's just weird.

1921
01:56:50.190 --> 01:56:53.730
You wouldn't lose some validity in your head.
You open your door,
car door,

1922
01:56:53.731 --> 01:56:58.510
fuck a beer.
Kids fall out.
He falls.
I love

1923
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:06.570
bagels are the shit who he said a Yamaka on right now.

1924
01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:11.580
His Dad is apparently a serious anti-semite,
but enough of those things,
few,

1925
01:57:11.581 --> 01:57:14.280
a few of those things will bury you.
Yeah.
You know,

1926
01:57:14.281 --> 01:57:17.210
and if you're screaming about fuck,
you can't come over while you're,

1927
01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:20.280
why I also think there's a mental illness aspect to it too.

1928
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:22.950
I think some people have something wrong with,

1929
01:57:22.951 --> 01:57:27.951
but also how do you be famous for 40 years?

1930
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:34.320
It's super stupid.
Famous how,
but yeah,
no,
not famous.
Like you're on a show,

1931
01:57:34.650 --> 01:57:38.730
right?
He's mailed fucking Gibson.
He's,
he's Matt.
Matt.

1932
01:57:38.731 --> 01:57:43.731
How do you be famous that famous for 40 years and just be like,

1933
01:57:46.650 --> 01:57:50.850
be normal.
We have to ask Tom Cruise with the pull Tom Cruise.

1934
01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.380
Tom Cruise is the best at it,
I think.
Yeah,
but,

1935
01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:58.110
but you see him cracking a little bit sometimes.
It's crazy.
All right.
I know.

1936
01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:00.300
But you see him holding it together.
Well,

1937
01:58:00.301 --> 01:58:04.110
when he was on the today show and he was talking to that dude,
um,
uh,
Matt,

1938
01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:04.981
whatever his name is,

1939
01:58:04.981 --> 01:58:09.600
Matt Lauer at Maria about psychedelics or a psychiatric drugs,
right?
Oh yeah.

1940
01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:14.640
I remember that being glib about very Glib Chilton.
I,

1941
01:58:15.570 --> 01:58:20.430
dude,
there's,
let me tell you something right now.
There's no fucking way.

1942
01:58:20.610 --> 01:58:24.810
If I was Tom cruise dude,
I wouldn't even be on the today show.

1943
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:27.300
Might be no,
no,
no,
no.

1944
01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:31.260
I wouldn't be allowed there because I would already have fucked up complete.

1945
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:37.230
I would be on buildings screaming shit out positive and negative about you.

1946
01:58:37.231 --> 01:58:41.800
It's just everything.
Yeah.
It just,
just,
just who care.

1947
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:45.460
Just I would be the war sky.
There's no way I,
I'm,

1948
01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:50.080
I'm on a fucking show kind of and that already I'm already getting nuts.

1949
01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:54.610
Do you think that,
yeah.
More power to Tom.

1950
01:58:54.611 --> 01:58:56.020
Tom Cruise is amazing for that.

1951
01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:59.920
Do you think that the average person could ever understand what it would be like

1952
01:58:59.921 --> 01:59:03.520
to be scrutinized on?
Just the level that your scrutinized on?

1953
01:59:03.521 --> 01:59:07.300
Just being a sh being on a show,
having people talk shit about you online,

1954
01:59:07.301 --> 01:59:11.660
reading Twitter pages.
We,
you know,
communicating with people,

1955
01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:14.080
like seeing people talk about you and just,

1956
01:59:14.110 --> 01:59:17.460
it seemed that overwhelming hard to not respond to every single one.
Yeah,

1957
01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:18.550
it's hard to,
it's hard to,

1958
01:59:18.670 --> 01:59:22.250
I saw a lady with a fucking crazy hat on the other day at the airport and she's

1959
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:24.160
a black lady and I said,
Hey,
what?

1960
01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:28.180
I said something about how this hat looks like you put chips on the top and

1961
01:59:28.181 --> 01:59:32.200
guacamole around the side of it and people just wrote racist.
No,

1962
01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:34.660
the hats fucking weird looking.

1963
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:39.160
You're a racist because you don't like her.
I was black until people were saying,

1964
01:59:39.161 --> 01:59:43.630
I was like,
oh yeah,
cause she's black.
You does nothing.
Fucking racist.

1965
01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:46.990
Racist Tom 46 or whatever the fuck.

1966
01:59:48.650 --> 01:59:51.850
You don't respond to them.
I sometimes I do.
Yeah,

1967
01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:55.910
I have a bit about it that I do sometimes when said it,
just like a guy,
uh,

1968
01:59:56.030 --> 02:00:00.100
see I get in with thing with a fuck you fuck you as a,
I say to that person,

1969
02:00:00.190 --> 02:00:03.970
I'll fuck your whole family.
And then the person writes back,
I am eight

1970
02:00:07.210 --> 02:00:08.950
and he was saying he was a fucking eight year old.

1971
02:00:08.951 --> 02:00:11.080
You never know who these people are.
That is a problem.

1972
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:13.360
There's a lot of times you're dealing with like little kids.

1973
02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:15.550
You're getting into things with little kids,

1974
02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:19.060
but you know you don't know cause you just fuck you.
Oh,
all right bro.

1975
02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:22.450
And your board is shit.
You're on the road.
I'm coming for you,
dude.

1976
02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:25.930
I used to get in those.
I kind of think,
I can't imagine you didn't,

1977
02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:30.430
I can't imagine you didn't.
You're like the Tupac of Comedians.
I'm the Tupac.

1978
02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:31.333
I don't know what that means.

1979
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:36.310
Just like fucking like I'll get you.
You know what I mean?

1980
02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:38.710
If this happened,
I'll fuck with you.
I'll get you.

1981
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:42.790
I had a guy who was a tweeting me back or it was my space,
my space.

1982
02:00:42.791 --> 02:00:47.320
He me back and forth when a way back in the day say really mean shit to me and

1983
02:00:47.321 --> 02:00:50.620
then I just engaged him and went back and forth with them and then I put it

1984
02:00:50.621 --> 02:00:54.130
online.
I put like our whole conversation online and people got so mad at me.

1985
02:00:54.131 --> 02:00:56.170
He just,
he was 20,
I didn't know he was 20.
I know,

1986
02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:59.830
but then I started commenting on what I was doing when I was 20 and how he's a

1987
02:00:59.831 --> 02:01:04.150
loser in comparison to me.
That'd be funny as shit,
but people,

1988
02:01:04.151 --> 02:01:06.880
but people will be like,
Yo,
uh,
people will be like,

1989
02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:10.770
like I'll just,
people will make fun.
We'll say you're,

1990
02:01:10.771 --> 02:01:12.550
you're a shitty or whatever.
And I'll just,

1991
02:01:12.730 --> 02:01:15.400
I'll look at their picture and I'll be like,
you're a six.

1992
02:01:15.970 --> 02:01:20.080
Like that's how good looking you are.
A guy or a girl either.

1993
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.270
And,
and then and then and then I'll,
we'll get just a,

1994
02:01:25.271 --> 02:01:29.770
that's not cool dude.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well yeah,
but you entered the octagon.

1995
02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:35.860
I am a,
I am a,
so I make fun of things.

1996
02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:40.280
That's what I do for a living.
Right.
So if you tweet

1997
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:45.080
<v 0>me,
fuck you and your show you,
you entered the octagon,</v>

1998
02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:49.940
right?
That they done.
But then the other people public,

1999
02:01:50.150 --> 02:01:53.450
the other people that aren't even involved in it,
then they'll come after you.

2000
02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:57.110
Not Cool Bro.
Right.
That's where,
that's where,
yeah,

2001
02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:01.700
you get fucked and your and your,
but you know what,
dude?

2002
02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:07.040
Whatever,
it's wasted energy and you should stop doing it.

2003
02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:11.630
Should not engage.
You should definitely,
that's the right thing to do.

2004
02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:16.720
The right thing to do is find the ones that are worthy and make them jokes and

2005
02:02:17.631 --> 02:02:21.640
that's take that people have said to you and turn them into bits,
you know,

2006
02:02:21.710 --> 02:02:23.510
against the person who said something to you.

2007
02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:25.660
Like that way you're not even addressing them personally.

2008
02:02:25.670 --> 02:02:28.250
Just taking what they said and then bring it to the stage like,
well,

2009
02:02:28.251 --> 02:02:31.320
that's what I did with the thing,
right?
Yeah.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2010
02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:33.570
That's the way to do it.
It is the way to do it,

2011
02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:38.570
but it problem is if you get anytime publicly you get into any sort of an

2012
02:02:38.571 --> 02:02:39.141
altercation,

2013
02:02:39.141 --> 02:02:42.740
like this is one of the things that I learned about the Carlos men see a

2014
02:02:42.741 --> 02:02:45.830
situation when,
when the thing with Carlos went down,
which

2015
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:50.900
if I had to do it again,
I wanted to ask you that.
Yeah.
I would do it again.

2016
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:54.950
In that case would that guy,
that guy's a bad guy.

2017
02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:57.500
What he did was bad and what he did,

2018
02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:01.730
what people saw was a 10th of what he did.
Oh,

2019
02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:03.050
what he did,

2020
02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:07.520
he would go on stage in front of guys and do their best bits and then bring them

2021
02:03:07.521 --> 02:03:12.050
up.
Really?
Yeah.
On TV shows.
He did it with Johnny Sanchez had a bit,

2022
02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:15.350
it's funny.
Fucking bed.
I don't know if he still does it.
Johnny Sanchez.

2023
02:03:15.351 --> 02:03:18.020
Funny Guy.
I was always at the store and he was funny.

2024
02:03:18.170 --> 02:03:21.500
He had a great bit about this Persian next door neighbor when people were always

2025
02:03:21.501 --> 02:03:24.260
parking in his spot and the guy would freak out and he would freak out with

2026
02:03:24.261 --> 02:03:28.120
broken English.
Right.
And he's a fucking parking in my fucking parking right?
Yes.

2027
02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:30.740
It's very fun.
It's a great bargain.

2028
02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:33.440
But he's parking in my parking [inaudible] seen it,

2029
02:03:33.441 --> 02:03:37.610
does it on stage on television before he brings Johnny Sanchez up on a

2030
02:03:37.611 --> 02:03:41.030
television gig.
He was hosting loco slam one of those shows and,

2031
02:03:41.130 --> 02:03:45.110
and Johnny was going to do it.
Johnny was the next act going to do that bit.

2032
02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:48.920
Johnny doesn't matter one bit.
It says closing bit,

2033
02:03:49.090 --> 02:03:51.260
so when see it does it before he brings him up.

2034
02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:57.620
Exactly.
And no one was doing anything about it.
None of the agents,

2035
02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:00.350
none of the clubs,
no one was doing anything about it.

2036
02:04:00.351 --> 02:04:03.530
And when you would bring it up,
they would say,
this is just business.

2037
02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:07.880
Like this was the Gersh said to me,
Oh really?
Gus said to me,
you know,

2038
02:04:07.881 --> 02:04:11.840
when they asked me to apologize to him and see you or they were going to drop
me.

2039
02:04:12.050 --> 02:04:15.980
Really?
Yeah,
they dropped.
Well,
I told them I would never work with him again.

2040
02:04:15.981 --> 02:04:19.190
I said,
I'm like,
I said our,
our conversation's over.
I said,
look,

2041
02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:20.860
you guys are already made this decision for,

2042
02:04:20.910 --> 02:04:23.660
there's no way I could ever work with you knowing that you will.

2043
02:04:23.661 --> 02:04:28.280
You guys do is you sell art.
That's what you sell.
You sell a comedian works.

2044
02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:31.970
We,
right.
We sit things,
we sit by ourselves,
we come up with ideas,

2045
02:04:31.971 --> 02:04:34.190
we write things down in the car.
We take these ideas,

2046
02:04:34.191 --> 02:04:38.130
we tried to craft and we try to turn them into bits like we all do it.

2047
02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:43.200
And in what they do is they come along and they sell that art.
They say,
hey,

2048
02:04:43.201 --> 02:04:46.680
crystal has got a new hour that he put together and uh,

2049
02:04:46.681 --> 02:04:49.100
he's going to go on the road and he's going to give us 10%.
Right?

2050
02:04:49.130 --> 02:04:52.560
So they're selling your art.
Right.
And this guy was a vampire.

2051
02:04:52.561 --> 02:04:57.390
He was stealing from the artists and they were selling the vampires work.

2052
02:04:57.810 --> 02:04:59.760
They were selling what he had done,
right.

2053
02:04:59.761 --> 02:05:03.660
But all had done is like take from these other artists and piece it together.

2054
02:05:03.661 --> 02:05:08.430
But it was all thievery.
It was all theft.
And they were talking that they were,

2055
02:05:08.850 --> 02:05:11.940
when they were saying that he was a bigger star than me at the time and steely

2056
02:05:11.941 --> 02:05:15.370
it was,
especially when it came to,
um,
um,

2057
02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:18.930
movies and television shows because he had minded Sia.

2058
02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:24.100
And it was after I was done doing fear factor and they didn't have me for film.

2059
02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:29.130
I was with a another car,
another agency.
Right.
They only had me for stand on it.

2060
02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:33.750
And so we had this situation when they were saying that I had to apologize to

2061
02:05:33.751 --> 02:05:37.290
him and in their eyes it was just business.
Right.

2062
02:05:37.530 --> 02:05:41.850
And so I would have done it again just because it needed to be done.

2063
02:05:41.851 --> 02:05:43.110
Like there was a real problem.

2064
02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:48.140
There wasn't this like there was like a few minor instances plagiarism or there

2065
02:05:48.481 --> 02:05:53.481
was parallel thinking or two guys did jokes about a similar subject and you

2066
02:05:53.671 --> 02:05:56.280
think that one guy came up with the other guys bit?
It was,

2067
02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:00.750
he was one of the worst plagiarist I've ever seen.
Wow.
And a bully with it.

2068
02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:05.300
Like a mean guy.
Like you like the Sanchez thing.
Well that's crazy.
Yeah that,

2069
02:06:05.301 --> 02:06:08.490
that's that's,
that's weird.
He would bump guys uh,

2070
02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:10.350
when they were headlining like um,

2071
02:06:10.770 --> 02:06:14.070
like there would be headlining for the first time like Brad Williams or Brad

2072
02:06:14.070 --> 02:06:14.903
Williams or was it,
um,

2073
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:19.560
I forget which guy was but his first gig headlining and Sia shows up,

2074
02:06:19.561 --> 02:06:21.980
does a guest spot in front of him for 45 minutes.
Right.

2075
02:06:22.170 --> 02:06:24.480
And its first ever headlining gig.

2076
02:06:24.481 --> 02:06:28.500
Like the guys finally there and [inaudible] it just goes up and steals his

2077
02:06:28.501 --> 02:06:33.180
thunder for 45 minutes.
I think it was actually someone else.

2078
02:06:33.181 --> 02:06:35.880
I'm trying to figure out who it was,
but it wasn't the only time he's done that.

2079
02:06:36.230 --> 02:06:38.280
Like he would guys,
their name would be on the marquee.

2080
02:06:38.281 --> 02:06:40.530
He would show up and bump them.
Like the bumping.

2081
02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:42.540
It was a big thing we'd go on right before then.

2082
02:06:42.541 --> 02:06:44.580
There was this thing sneak right in.

2083
02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:50.580
My point is that the negative stuff that I got from that,

2084
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:55.500
like the,
the people that when two people see or when two people are fighting,

2085
02:06:55.650 --> 02:06:59.070
right.
Um,
and then all the public gets to chime in their opinion.

2086
02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:04.380
Then you just open yourself up to this like attack.
Even if you're right.

2087
02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:07.770
And I was right.
Most people were on my side,

2088
02:07:08.190 --> 02:07:10.530
but most people doesn't mean everybody.

2089
02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:12.810
If there's a million people that were on my side,

2090
02:07:12.811 --> 02:07:16.710
there was 300,000 that were angry at me,
you know,
and the 300,000,

2091
02:07:16.711 --> 02:07:21.360
it's slowly eroded to zero.
Right.
It did over time.

2092
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:23.910
Like he still gets hate.
I don't get any from that.

2093
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:27.150
Like over time it was proven that I was correct.

2094
02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:29.020
Everybody saw the bill Cosby thing,
right?

2095
02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:32.070
All these other comedians came out and then he did mark Marin.

2096
02:07:32.250 --> 02:07:36.070
Did you ever hear those podcasts that he did?
I think I did,
yeah.
While ago.
Yeah.

2097
02:07:36.290 --> 02:07:41.230
Was that bad?
I don't remember it though.
Bone curl.
Really?
Yeah,
I got it.
What?

2098
02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:43.120
Curdling yeah,
I don't remember it at all.

2099
02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:46.180
It was ugly because you got to see like how crazy he is.

2100
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:49.980
Especially the first one.
Marion was kind of like,
Oh yeah,
you did it twice.

2101
02:07:50.710 --> 02:07:55.450
But the second one was he came back on to address things that all these other

2102
02:07:55.451 --> 02:07:57.070
comedians had said about him.
Oh,

2103
02:07:57.280 --> 02:08:00.550
all these other comedians who talked about him stealing and then he sort of fell

2104
02:08:00.551 --> 02:08:03.430
apart.
Oh,
he's fell apart in the second one.
And then he did that.

2105
02:08:03.431 --> 02:08:07.300
I am comic documentary and admitted on Iam comic that he steals people's stuff

2106
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:12.330
and reworks it.
Sort of like a rapper samples bit.
Really?
Yeah.
And he goes,

2107
02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:14.320
yeah,
you ever see that?
Pull that up.

2108
02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:19.540
Just pull up men's SIA admits to stealing and I am comic.
It's,
it's really,

2109
02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:24.940
but what he did was it was after years and years of pressure,

2110
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:28.450
like he's been open about the fact that he had to go to therapy because of all

2111
02:08:28.451 --> 02:08:31.660
this and he's just a beaten man.
I mean you look at his,

2112
02:08:32.110 --> 02:08:36.370
he's got like 40,000 Twitter followers and he's had 40,000 Twitter,

2113
02:08:36.371 --> 02:08:37.930
a lot of Twitter followers for years.

2114
02:08:37.931 --> 02:08:41.650
I mean that is who that guy is now like here it is like he's getting
interviewed,

2115
02:08:41.670 --> 02:08:45.290
<v 2>fill out there are going to ask why did they interview Carlos about this?
Yeah.</v>

2116
02:08:45.670 --> 02:08:47.110
Carlos is a joke thief.

2117
02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:51.940
Carlos steals jokes and we know this and not listen to me and look at me when I

2118
02:08:51.941 --> 02:08:56.020
tell you this with all honesty,
if you think that I still jokes,

2119
02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:59.320
fuck yeah,
you're right.
Of course I fucking steal jokes.

2120
02:08:59.321 --> 02:09:03.550
I out of your fucking mind when I come to a comedy club,
you better run bitch.

2121
02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:07.720
You better get the fuck off stage because if anything you say is even remotely

2122
02:09:07.721 --> 02:09:11.180
funny,
I'm going to make it mine and all I'm going to do it.

2123
02:09:11.181 --> 02:09:13.330
Say Mexican in the front.
I'm like a rapper.

2124
02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:17.920
I just sampled shit and make it my own.
What's that really my song?
I don't know,

2125
02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:21.250
but it sounds like mine,
but it kinda sounds like somebody else's.

2126
02:09:21.410 --> 02:09:23.710
It's a bitch sample sample.

2127
02:09:26.890 --> 02:09:30.520
<v 0>Wow.
I'm that crazy.
But what was it?</v>

2128
02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:35.180
What was he joking?
They're like,
what?
What is that like?
He was serious.

2129
02:09:35.190 --> 02:09:38.360
I don't know.
Yeah,
he's serious.
That's exactly what he does.
I mean,
he didn't,

2130
02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:41.980
he says he's joking though.
That's exactly what this thing does.

2131
02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:45.280
That's what he does.
That's a weird,
that's a weird,
I think you do that just,

2132
02:09:45.281 --> 02:09:47.400
he's just cracking.
He's just cracking.
Right.

2133
02:09:47.410 --> 02:09:50.920
Years and years and years and years and years and years and years of people

2134
02:09:50.921 --> 02:09:54.550
fucking yelling at him and everywhere he goes,
you fucking thief.

2135
02:09:54.551 --> 02:09:56.440
And then they found out that it wasn't really Mexican,

2136
02:09:56.441 --> 02:10:01.180
so the Mexicans got mad at them.
Oh,
you're,
you're,
you're,
you're,
yeah.
Yeah.

2137
02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:06.340
That's weird,
man.
Yeah,
it's not good.

2138
02:10:06.670 --> 02:10:10.540
But the,
the,
the initial point was that,

2139
02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:15.820
that in that situation,
something had to be done right.
But for the most part,

2140
02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:19.210
engaging with someone is not worth it.
Right.
Especially publicly,

2141
02:10:19.450 --> 02:10:24.450
unless you got like something really important to prove when you do it publicly,

2142
02:10:24.491 --> 02:10:29.010
man,
you just open yourself up to so much,
so many idiots opinions,

2143
02:10:29.011 --> 02:10:31.570
so much negativity.
It's just not worth it.

2144
02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:33.980
It's Harvard and do an interview is though,
and then somebody

2145
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.180
<v 3>asks you a certain question and you're like,
oh,
here we go.</v>

2146
02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:37.540
And they get in trouble.
Yeah.

2147
02:10:37.850 --> 02:10:39.290
And then they take it out of context and you're like,

2148
02:10:39.291 --> 02:10:42.380
that's not what I fucking even said.
You know what I mean?
And it's like,
well,

2149
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:46.580
there's gotta be better ways,
better ways to,
I mean there's,

2150
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.440
there's ways to get a point across and then there's ways and not thinking,

2151
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:56.210
but also in the,
in this time we live in now,
it's all soundbite shit.

2152
02:10:56.630 --> 02:11:00.500
And when you're asking somebody a question about like,

2153
02:11:00.501 --> 02:11:03.790
I did an interview for huffpost and it was like they asked me about something

2154
02:11:03.791 --> 02:11:06.770
and then it took a bite of that and they put it onto the headline and it's like

2155
02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:09.830
now fucking everyone.
You know what I mean?
It was a wooded four g's a year.

2156
02:11:09.831 --> 02:11:14.330
We'll say they're,
you know,
yeah.
It's like that's not fair.

2157
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:17.810
No,
that's weird when they do that.
And that goes back to,

2158
02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.190
you know me saying it's like,
look,
I think I'm a good guy and you fucking,

2159
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:25.480
they took that and spun it.
You know what I mean?
And Yeah,

2160
02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:29.630
when people take things out of context,
context is everything.
It's everything.

2161
02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:32.900
It really is.
And the ability to take things in quotes,

2162
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:36.560
like I've had people take quotes that I said like on a Twitter,

2163
02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:40.920
like just a Twitter joke and write a whole blog about it.
Right.

2164
02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:42.253
And you know,

2165
02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:46.580
come up with all these weird assumptions of how I feel about things.
Right.

2166
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:48.830
This whole blog about it.
Like why did they do that?

2167
02:11:48.831 --> 02:11:50.330
Because because it's a cheap shot,

2168
02:11:50.331 --> 02:11:53.630
cause it's an easy thing to do because it's an easy way to get their attention.

2169
02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:55.710
You can talk shit about crystal Leah,
right?

2170
02:11:56.450 --> 02:11:59.580
They know crystal is a known character.
Oh Crystal.

2171
02:11:59.581 --> 02:12:03.080
He is an asshole who Chris to Leo row.
Oh,
what a piece of shit.
And they'll,

2172
02:12:03.170 --> 02:12:04.370
you know,
they'll do things about,

2173
02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:08.900
that's one of the reasons why Twitter is kind of funky in a way.
It's like,

2174
02:12:09.170 --> 02:12:13.850
well everyone's famous.
Yeah.
Well it's also,
it's 140 characters.

2175
02:12:13.851 --> 02:12:18.230
It's just not enough nuance to opinion on it.
Yeah,
no,
that's totally true.

2176
02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:22.610
It's just you're not going to really get to the heart of what someone thinks

2177
02:12:22.611 --> 02:12:23.240
about something.

2178
02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:27.890
You're just going to get some weird snippet that you have to kind of piece

2179
02:12:27.891 --> 02:12:31.670
together.
And like,
especially when it's a joke,
right?

2180
02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:35.180
Like I'll say fucked up things on Twitter that I don't really mean just as a

2181
02:12:35.181 --> 02:12:39.920
joke.
And then people will decide that this is actually your opinion.
You know?

2182
02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:43.850
That's true.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,
they can't hear it.
I don't,
I don't like,
you know,

2183
02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:48.440
I don't,
I'm not into sports,
you know,
and I'll,
I,
when the World Cup was on,

2184
02:12:48.441 --> 02:12:51.740
I was just tweeting about how,
how stupid sportswear,
but I was making jokes,

2185
02:12:51.741 --> 02:12:53.540
you know,
and it was like,
if look,

2186
02:12:53.570 --> 02:12:55.700
if you're a kid and you're coming up in sports is your way out,

2187
02:12:55.701 --> 02:13:00.530
that's fucking awesome.
I'm not,
I don't think that kid's an Asshole,
you know?

2188
02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:03.890
But people were sending me death threats,
cold cuts.

2189
02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:07.640
The World Cup is a Weirdo man.
I know people get super attached to it.

2190
02:13:07.641 --> 02:13:09.560
They were like talking sports,
don't me.

2191
02:13:09.561 --> 02:13:12.960
I did this thing where I would make like quick videos of like where I was,

2192
02:13:12.961 --> 02:13:15.710
I'd be at a bar and there's World Cup will be going on and then some people

2193
02:13:15.711 --> 02:13:18.080
would cheer and I will be like,
yeah,
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

2194
02:13:18.081 --> 02:13:21.200
I would just be screaming.
It doesn't matter.
And people were like,

2195
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:25.880
you fucking piece of shit.
Your stand up.
Doesn't matter if sports don't matter.

2196
02:13:25.881 --> 02:13:29.620
And I'm like,
well yeah,
no shit dude.
I'm fucking around.
Guess what?

2197
02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:30.860
Standup doesn't,
I know,
you know,

2198
02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:34.860
you like stand up and soccer doesn't matter if you don't like soccer.

2199
02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:38.310
Yeah,
yeah.
I was a,

2200
02:13:38.311 --> 02:13:42.300
I was working on a bit about the annoying white guy that pretends he likes

2201
02:13:42.301 --> 02:13:45.900
soccer more than he really does.
Yeah.
Which is like really in Hollywood.

2202
02:13:45.901 --> 02:13:46.734
There's fucking,

2203
02:13:47.970 --> 02:13:51.810
we were eating dinner at this place and the World Cup was on in the background

2204
02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:56.430
and there was these annoying white guys that were screaming whenever the USA one

2205
02:13:56.700 --> 02:13:59.970
or the USA scored a goal.
They were like jumping around,

2206
02:13:59.971 --> 02:14:03.930
getting their high fiving each other.
It was just like,
it was,
it was like,

2207
02:14:04.050 --> 02:14:06.990
there's it,
there's nothing wrong with rooting for a team,

2208
02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:10.410
but there's something artificial about the way they were doing it.

2209
02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:14.430
It was just too obvious.
Right.
Well,
because it's also,

2210
02:14:14.431 --> 02:14:16.980
it's every four years,
they forget about it.

2211
02:14:16.981 --> 02:14:20.460
Two years after that and then it comes back again and they're like,
oh yeah,

2212
02:14:20.461 --> 02:14:24.570
fuck it.
Whoa.
You know?
Yeah.
Also,
you're not,

2213
02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:27.570
you probably weren't even watching the fucking USA game.
They were like,
yeah,

2214
02:14:27.571 --> 02:14:32.400
I'm fucking Botswana.
It's like,
you don't fucking care.
I'm rooting for Germany.

2215
02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:35.790
Germany has always been my team.
I have a VW,
I love Germany.

2216
02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:38.940
It's like I can't,

2217
02:14:39.630 --> 02:14:44.520
I don't like anybody who gets to in the sauce and just like,

2218
02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:50.010
they're just like,
oh fuck yeah man.
And let's like,
that's not your life dude.

2219
02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:54.810
But I have a particular fascination about the World Cup because I find it very

2220
02:14:54.811 --> 02:14:56.850
interesting that soccer gets,

2221
02:14:57.090 --> 02:15:00.570
it doesn't move the needle at all outside of the World Cup.

2222
02:15:00.810 --> 02:15:03.630
Like nobody gives a shit about soccer in America.

2223
02:15:03.810 --> 02:15:05.760
And when they tried to sell David Beckham,

2224
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:10.410
they brought David Beckham to La and they paid some fucking ungodly amount of

2225
02:15:10.411 --> 02:15:13.530
money to have.
Hence why no one gave a fuck.
Nobody gave a fuck.

2226
02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:18.360
I forgot about that.
I forgot about that.
No one gave a fuck.

2227
02:15:18.690 --> 02:15:23.160
They spent so much money to bring David back up to La to play soccer.

2228
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:26.800
And only the only people that watch soccer in la or Mexicans,
right.

2229
02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:31.010
They love soccer.
You know,
Mexico has a long history of,
of,

2230
02:15:31.110 --> 02:15:34.830
of soccer as does England,
but not in America.

2231
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:38.310
They brought this English guy over to America to play soccer and everybody's

2232
02:15:38.311 --> 02:15:39.720
like a,
yeah,

2233
02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:45.440
where's Palae Brazilians love soccer.

2234
02:15:45.811 --> 02:15:47.940
You know that there's a lot of countries that love soccer.

2235
02:15:47.941 --> 02:15:49.920
United States is not one of them.
Wow.

2236
02:15:49.921 --> 02:15:52.260
They want to soccer to be big and nobody gives a fuck.

2237
02:15:52.290 --> 02:15:56.130
So they try this really high tattooed up English guy bring him over here.

2238
02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:57.930
Chicks went to soccer games.

2239
02:15:57.931 --> 02:16:02.400
I know girls that went to see a fucking soccer game cause they were in love with

2240
02:16:02.401 --> 02:16:05.670
David Becker.
Right.
But that didn't last because they don't care about soccer.

2241
02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:07.590
Plus there was a bunch of drunk Mexican

2242
02:16:10.050 --> 02:16:14.670
fucking disaster.
They don't,
nobody gives a shit about soccer in America.

2243
02:16:14.970 --> 02:16:18.060
I don't know why it meets.
It's more exciting than baseball.

2244
02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:19.880
I think soccer is more athletic.

2245
02:16:19.881 --> 02:16:22.410
It's more exciting than just because it's about downtime and baseball.

2246
02:16:22.411 --> 02:16:26.610
It's mostly downtime.
Yeah,
it's more exciting.
Um,
and that,

2247
02:16:26.611 --> 02:16:29.950
which is why I like baseball because it's downtown because of the children.

2248
02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:34.870
Cause he's like,
you know,
I was like,
oh he'll,
he'll get it.

2249
02:16:35.410 --> 02:16:36.250
I used to love playing,

2250
02:16:36.251 --> 02:16:38.530
but I used to go to see baseball games when I lived in Boston.

2251
02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:39.640
I used to go to Fenway park.

2252
02:16:39.670 --> 02:16:41.440
You don't really have to pay attention at a baseball game.

2253
02:16:41.441 --> 02:16:42.274
That's why it's so great,
right?

2254
02:16:42.370 --> 02:16:45.130
You can go get a hot dog and come back and be like,
Oh hey,
that guy's still up.

2255
02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:48.450
Yeah,
and if you happen to be there when a great moment happens,

2256
02:16:48.451 --> 02:16:52.240
some makes a great catch.
Great.
Not a great home run.
Right?
Yeah.

2257
02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:56.590
But still it's,
if you try and inventing baseball today,
people be like,
wait,
wait,

2258
02:16:56.591 --> 02:16:58.990
what?
Right.
That's true.
They'd be like,
this game is retarded.

2259
02:16:58.991 --> 02:17:00.170
Like what's going on you?

2260
02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:05.030
So you have nine innings and what happens if it's a tie?
You just keep going.

2261
02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:07.930
You keep playing.
No.
You know what?
That's actually,

2262
02:17:07.931 --> 02:17:10.600
to me that's better than what soccer does,
which is,
hey,

2263
02:17:10.601 --> 02:17:14.470
let's play a different game now you just fucking under,

2264
02:17:14.471 --> 02:17:19.330
you undersold your whole game by saying it's tide.
Let's do a different game.

2265
02:17:19.570 --> 02:17:23.840
You play Jenga,
then play Jenga,
play fucking Jenga.
You're just,

2266
02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:26.860
you're just going to kick at the goal.
Now,
which is the exciting part,

2267
02:17:26.861 --> 02:17:29.250
which is what should have just started.
That's how it should have started.
Right?

2268
02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:32.320
The whole sport should be just kicking in hockey.
We go to shootout,
well,

2269
02:17:32.321 --> 02:17:35.530
fuck hockey.
I can't watch that.
I can't watch it.
Here's what should happen.

2270
02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:38.650
Baseball,
nine innings at the end of nine innings.

2271
02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:43.120
If it's tied the game still over,
they go to hits.
Okay.
Whoever has more hits,

2272
02:17:43.121 --> 02:17:47.080
winds,
same hits.
Then you go to fucking errors.
If the other team has more errors,

2273
02:17:47.081 --> 02:17:51.040
they lose.
Dude,
you should restructure baseball.
That's what it,
you know what?

2274
02:17:51.041 --> 02:17:53.110
In my mind,
that's what it is.
That's a good idea.
Yeah.

2275
02:17:53.170 --> 02:17:57.430
That is actually a good idea.
Yes.
Why do you keep playing?
You said,

2276
02:17:57.460 --> 02:17:59.790
how long has this whole less nine innings.
Oh wait,
it's the die.
Oh,

2277
02:17:59.791 --> 02:18:02.110
well let's go 10 here's the flaw with that problem though,

2278
02:18:02.350 --> 02:18:07.350
because what if like one team scored a run because they got four hits.

2279
02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:09.940
Like they've got a guy on first and another guy got a single,

2280
02:18:09.941 --> 02:18:13.480
you've got on second and another guy got on third and then another guy came

2281
02:18:13.481 --> 02:18:17.860
along and had a single and then he brought in the third baseman comes in.

2282
02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:22.240
But if you watch like a home run,

2283
02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:25.210
like that would like discourage home runs because that's the only one hit.

2284
02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:30.580
But it counts as one.
But if you get more runs,
you win.
Right?

2285
02:18:30.581 --> 02:18:34.030
But if there's more hits than you don't win,
you only get it if your tie.

2286
02:18:34.031 --> 02:18:38.290
And then they hit her more with Lex.
But I wonder,

2287
02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:41.250
we probably sound so dumb right now.
Yeah,
we're done.
It's fine.
We're done.

2288
02:18:41.251 --> 02:18:42.790
We're ready.
We're dumb already.
Well,

2289
02:18:42.791 --> 02:18:46.420
I'm definitely dumb abdominal a lot of things.
You know how I know I'm dumb.

2290
02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:49.780
You know how I know I'm done because when I'm doing this podcast,

2291
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:52.900
a time will go by and I'm just listening to you and I'm like,

2292
02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:58.000
that's fucking interesting.
And I realize I haven't said Shit.
I legitimately,

2293
02:18:58.001 --> 02:19:01.150
I'm just listening to your podcast.
That's a part of podcasting though.

2294
02:19:01.770 --> 02:19:03.070
That's means you're good at it.

2295
02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:06.400
I know I'm dumb because I get offended when people tell me I'm smart.

2296
02:19:07.150 --> 02:19:10.990
What do you mean?
Cause people telling me I'm smart and I go,
oh,
this is wrong.

2297
02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:15.280
This is incorrect.
I know what actual smart people like.
Oh,
I know.

2298
02:19:15.281 --> 02:19:18.940
I know actual smart people.
I've talked to them.
I know the difference.
I just,

2299
02:19:18.970 --> 02:19:22.930
I just have memorized a bunch shit.
I know some things.
That's where that you,

2300
02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:26.440
that's when when I,
when I listen to you or talk to you or whatever it is,

2301
02:19:26.441 --> 02:19:28.190
whenever I hear you,
I always

2302
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:32.900
<v 0>think,
how do you,
I,
I just,
before you even know knew me,
I would be like,</v>

2303
02:19:32.901 --> 02:19:36.650
how do,
how does Joe Rogan remember that much shit?

2304
02:19:37.370 --> 02:19:41.560
I don't fucking remember anything.
I don't know how I remember someone that's,

2305
02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:44.930
that's like,
I don't even bother.
I'm at the point now where I'm slightly

2306
02:19:46.550 --> 02:19:47.880
by on it,
but I don't,

2307
02:19:47.930 --> 02:19:50.010
I'm at the point where I don't even look shit up because I'm not going to

2308
02:19:50.011 --> 02:19:54.050
remember it.
And that's satisfying.
If things are important to me,
I remember them.

2309
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:55.400
Yeah.
But a lot of stuff's important.

2310
02:19:55.401 --> 02:19:59.780
But the important stuff's important to you to me,
but not unimportant shit.
Like,

2311
02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:03.260
like someone will tell me something and I don't give a fuck and then I'll go,

2312
02:20:03.261 --> 02:20:05.540
what are you talking about?
And they go,
I just told you I'll go.
Really?

2313
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:09.890
I don't remember.
Yeah.
You know?
So I have a very selective memory.

2314
02:20:09.890 --> 02:20:12.740
It's awesome.
If it's something that's actually interesting to me.
Yeah.

2315
02:20:12.741 --> 02:20:14.900
You retained shit and you're interested,
which is good.

2316
02:20:14.930 --> 02:20:17.690
You have to learn to be interested.
A lot of the time though,
like people,

2317
02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:21.710
did you have to learn to be interested or is it usually that people have too

2318
02:20:21.711 --> 02:20:24.890
many other things going on that are not interesting so they don't have the time

2319
02:20:24.891 --> 02:20:25.631
to get interested?

2320
02:20:25.631 --> 02:20:28.940
I think you have to learn to be interested because like you said,

2321
02:20:28.941 --> 02:20:32.450
context is everything,
right?
So if you give me a book that's very interesting.

2322
02:20:33.470 --> 02:20:36.490
I don't know how to read it if I don't fucking read books.
Right.

2323
02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:39.890
And I don't know the context of it.
Like I don't take Shakespeare.

2324
02:20:40.730 --> 02:20:44.240
Is that important to somebody who doesn't read Shakespeare?
You're like,

2325
02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:47.450
I don't know.
This is stupid.
Yeah.

2326
02:20:47.451 --> 02:20:52.451
If you wanted to just go back and kind of look at Shakespeare is like the

2327
02:20:52.941 --> 02:20:56.490
origins of literature and the origins of storytelling,
then it,

2328
02:20:56.491 --> 02:20:58.510
then it becomes interesting and important and essential.
Yeah.

2329
02:20:58.820 --> 02:20:59.660
But it's not an interesting,

2330
02:20:59.661 --> 02:21:04.640
like it's hard to take things like do you listen to old stand up?
Yeah.

2331
02:21:04.970 --> 02:21:07.850
Do you ever try to go back and listen and Lenny Bruce?
Uh,

2332
02:21:07.851 --> 02:21:11.450
I haven't in a long time.
I'm a big fan of standup and Lenny Bruce,

2333
02:21:11.451 --> 02:21:13.520
I have posters on my wall at home.

2334
02:21:13.521 --> 02:21:16.250
This Lenny Bruce posters from concert films and stuff.

2335
02:21:16.251 --> 02:21:17.690
And I'm a huge Lenny Bruce.

2336
02:21:17.730 --> 02:21:20.480
I have like maybe four or five Lenny Bruce Pictures of my house.

2337
02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:24.590
Cause I think that Lenny Bruce is,
I think he was the godfather of all.

2338
02:21:24.591 --> 02:21:28.610
He was the reason why we could do what we did.
Right,
right.
Oh absolutely.

2339
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:30.260
Like for folks who don't realize,

2340
02:21:30.261 --> 02:21:34.040
like at one point in time stand up was just jokes.

2341
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:38.060
It was like set up punchline set up punchline and there was these guys that

2342
02:21:38.061 --> 02:21:41.060
would tour,
they would do like the Catskills what all do each other's act.

2343
02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:45.770
Exactly.
They would all do the same jokes.
Right.
And um,
they were,

2344
02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:49.400
they were just joke,
like almost like street jokes.
Right.
And they would put,

2345
02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:51.470
they would put together an act and then act would never change.

2346
02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:55.640
And then Lenny Bruce came along and Lenny Bruce started talking about things

2347
02:21:55.641 --> 02:21:59.960
that he saw a thing,
the behavior people had hypocrisy,

2348
02:22:00.290 --> 02:22:03.590
religion,
racism and the left.
But he's like,

2349
02:22:03.591 --> 02:22:05.420
what the fuck is this guy doing?

2350
02:22:05.690 --> 02:22:08.210
And people would come to see him and they would be blown away.

2351
02:22:08.211 --> 02:22:11.230
Like no one in the 50s and the 60s was talking like that.

2352
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:16.040
No one was communicating the way Lenny Bruce was and he lit the fire that

2353
02:22:16.041 --> 02:22:19.520
created George Carlin and Richard Pryor and all these different guys.

2354
02:22:19.521 --> 02:22:21.770
I think he was the original,
the,
the,

2355
02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:26.580
the original source of American standup comedy.
Oh,
that's the Dustin Hoffman,

2356
02:22:26.581 --> 02:22:30.990
the movie,
right?
Yeah.
Did you ever see it?
Uh,
no.
It's fucking great man.
I know.

2357
02:22:30.991 --> 02:22:35.940
My Dad loves it.
Look,
put it off for a second.
Niggers.
Oh,
I know.

2358
02:22:35.941 --> 02:22:38.010
There's one slot and Bob's getting dropped in the show.

2359
02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:43.410
<v 12>Let's see,
there's two niggers and between those two nuggets,</v>

2360
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:50.110
and there's another case that's two catching three niggers and there's a Spec,

2361
02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:51.673
right?

2362
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:52.663
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

2363
02:22:53.020 --> 02:22:57.140
<v 0>He's doing this in an audience that people get a super uncomfortable.
Oh,
okay.</v>

2364
02:22:57.270 --> 02:23:00.270
<v 12>Polak and Oh,
a couple of weeks balls.</v>

2365
02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:04.880
And there's three lace curtain Irish mix.
And here's one.

2366
02:23:05.130 --> 02:23:09.440
<v 5>Yep.
Dick Hunky,
Hunky,</v>

2367
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:12.150
boogie.
Boogie.
Boogie.

2368
02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:13.413
<v 0>Jesus.</v>

2369
02:23:13.550 --> 02:23:14.383
<v 5>Right.</v>

2370
02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:22.270
<v 12>I got three.
I got five black guy got sick.</v>

2371
02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:27.360
Do I have seven?
I've got seven Niggas told American.
What?

2372
02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:30.570
Seven Nigga six [inaudible] five [inaudible].
Three guineas.

2373
02:23:30.610 --> 02:23:34.620
One while you almost punched me out.
Did it?
Well,

2374
02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:36.270
I was just trying to make a point.

2375
02:23:36.450 --> 02:23:40.170
And that is that it's the suppression of the word that gives it the power.

2376
02:23:40.570 --> 02:23:43.260
Violence,
the fishes big.

2377
02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:47.470
If President Kennedy would just go on television and say,

2378
02:23:47.530 --> 02:23:51.710
I'd like to introduce you to all the niggers in my cabinet,

2379
02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:55.060
and it'd be just say nigger,
nigger,
nigger,
nigger,
nigger.

2380
02:23:55.061 --> 02:23:59.490
Every Nigga he saw Boogie,
Boogie,
Boogie,
Boogie,
boogie.
Well,
nigger,
nigger,
nigger,

2381
02:23:59.491 --> 02:24:00.324
nigger,
nigger too.

2382
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:04.060
<v 0>This isn't a whore and Balmy podcasts.</v>

2383
02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:07.710
<v 12>Let's cover why,
because somebody called them a nigger at school.</v>

2384
02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:16.060
<v 0>Is it fascinating what a part of what Jesus Christ.
Yeah.</v>

2385
02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:21.110
Well he did a great job.
Yeah.
He's like one of the,
that's one of the best.
Like,

2386
02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:23.830
well,
you don't seem like a scam.
He was doing,
he did it.

2387
02:24:23.860 --> 02:24:27.300
I actually laughed because yeah,
when guys play Comedians,
you just like,
oh,

2388
02:24:27.310 --> 02:24:30.250
he's such a,
I don't know.
I don't know how to parent to other people.

2389
02:24:30.310 --> 02:24:33.700
Tom Hanks and punchlines.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like you can just tell.

2390
02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:37.140
You can just tell it's not a comedian.
How about Sally field and line.

2391
02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:41.200
Fucking clearly remember that.
I would have to watch that again.
You don't,

2392
02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:43.210
you don't have to do that for you,

2393
02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:45.790
but that was actually a really good representation of that.
Yeah.
Well,

2394
02:24:45.791 --> 02:24:49.230
it's a really good representation of Lenny Bruce.
That's why I mean he,

2395
02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:53.450
he played Lenny Bruce and that bit,
boy,
it's,
it's,

2396
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:58.510
it's all about the context of the times because that bit like if you did that

2397
02:24:58.541 --> 02:25:02.200
today,
like boy,
you'd have to do a way better job.
Right.
Sing it together.

2398
02:25:02.201 --> 02:25:03.700
It's just the times are different.

2399
02:25:03.701 --> 02:25:07.330
Like back that was at the time what he was doing was like completely

2400
02:25:07.331 --> 02:25:09.780
groundbreaking.
Yeah.
I want to never done anything.
Yeah.

2401
02:25:09.790 --> 02:25:13.420
You couldn't do that right now.
No,
but it would be a different thing.
But yeah,

2402
02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:18.540
if you went and watched him do stand up today,

2403
02:25:19.631 --> 02:25:22.360
like if Lenny Bruce was on stage doing standup that you wouldn't be laughing.

2404
02:25:22.630 --> 02:25:25.010
Right.
It's too late.
Well,
comedy.
Yeah.

2405
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:28.180
Comedy changes and it's like when you look at the shit back then,

2406
02:25:28.181 --> 02:25:31.000
it's not funny anymore.
No,
no.
Even stuff from 20 years ago.

2407
02:25:31.001 --> 02:25:34.930
It's not funny anymore.
Yeah.
Isn't that weird?
It's very weird.
It's very weird.

2408
02:25:35.140 --> 02:25:36.620
You remember those like the number,

2409
02:25:36.621 --> 02:25:40.930
the boxer guy that would like punch his face in the eighties yeah.
Bob Nelson.

2410
02:25:40.931 --> 02:25:45.130
That was funny.
Yeah,
that's,
did you look at that now and you're like,
what?

2411
02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:51.190
And it's just,
that's,
that's fucking crazy dude.

2412
02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:54.580
Bob Nelson is the reason why I have my manager.
Really.

2413
02:25:54.610 --> 02:25:59.610
My manager was Managing Bob Nelson and Bob Nelson found Jesus and Bob Nelson

2414
02:25:59.681 --> 02:26:02.170
decided to get a prayer partner,

2415
02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:06.460
was going to be his new manager and so my manager was like,
Oh fuck.

2416
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:10.150
So he had to go find some new talent and so he came to Boston and the ninth that

2417
02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:12.940
he came to Boston,
I had written a joke.
I'd only been doing it.

2418
02:26:12.941 --> 02:26:16.210
There he is right there.
Shit is so weird place of it.

2419
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:20.920
<v 1>Hello.
Hello.</v>

2420
02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:28.010
My
name.

2421
02:26:30.090 --> 02:26:31.170
My name is Jeff.

2422
02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:38.720
My name is Jeff.
I own,
I own a gym.

2423
02:26:39.810 --> 02:26:40.643
Okay.

2424
02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:45.150
<v 0>Stop it.
I mean that's,
that's,
this is 1980 opposite of funny,</v>

2425
02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:51.300
but it is now.
It is back then he used to kill.
He was a killer.
Yeah,

2426
02:26:51.660 --> 02:26:55.890
it's weird.
It was a different time,
but he was always like a real slap sticky.

2427
02:26:56.070 --> 02:27:00.210
I don't know.
Fine.
I don't know if he had a substance abuse problem or what.

2428
02:27:00.211 --> 02:27:03.120
I don't know like how he got involved with his prayer partner,

2429
02:27:03.121 --> 02:27:06.030
how he found Jesus.
I Dunno,
like what was so extreme about it,

2430
02:27:06.330 --> 02:27:10.380
but he fired my manager and then my manager,
um,

2431
02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:13.830
like just randomly came to Boston.
He was in New York,

2432
02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:18.420
just randomly came to Boston and look for talent and I just happened to be up on

2433
02:27:18.421 --> 02:27:21.000
stage that night.
It wasn't even scheduled.
Really.
Yeah.

2434
02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:24.570
And I've been with them ever since.
Thank God for that guy.
Yeah,
that's it.

2435
02:27:24.810 --> 02:27:27.540
But that's how that should happen back.
I never did that set.

2436
02:27:27.541 --> 02:27:30.480
You wouldn't have this podcast.
I might not.
I'm seeing you.
Look,

2437
02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:34.620
my managers are very important part of my career.
He's,
he's awesome.

2438
02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:38.670
He's the best he said and he's a great friend and I love the guy and we'd been

2439
02:27:38.671 --> 02:27:42.870
together since I was an amateur.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
That's crazy.

2440
02:27:42.930 --> 02:27:47.580
I've had the same manager for 22 years.
Wow.
Yeah.

2441
02:27:47.850 --> 02:27:52.620
At least maybe 23,
it might be 23 years now.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2442
02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:57.000
Crazy.
That's a great fucking thing,
man.
Because,
uh,

2443
02:27:57.030 --> 02:28:01.020
that whole thing of like having the right representation that like the whole

2444
02:28:01.021 --> 02:28:02.490
situation that I went through with [inaudible],

2445
02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:04.680
whether it was trying to get me to apologize to him and see it,

2446
02:28:05.070 --> 02:28:06.330
you don't have to worry about that.

2447
02:28:06.331 --> 02:28:09.380
If you've got a guy in your corner for exactly fucking 12 years already the

2448
02:28:09.381 --> 02:28:10.890
imagine if that was my guy.

2449
02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:13.680
Imagine if the garage was my guy and they were telling me that I,

2450
02:28:13.681 --> 02:28:15.290
that was the only people I had represented me.

2451
02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:17.220
You're telling me I had to apologize to a criminal.

2452
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:22.010
That's the sneaky part about this business,
right?
It's like dealing with all the

2453
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:26.420
<v 3>people that sell it.
I know.
Yeah.
That's the business part of it,
right?</v>

2454
02:28:26.490 --> 02:28:30.710
It's like owners.
Yeah,
but it's like,

2455
02:28:30.711 --> 02:28:33.830
who else is gonna Rep who's,
we're not going to do it.

2456
02:28:33.831 --> 02:28:38.090
We're not going to fucking just tell me where to go and I'll go.
Yeah.

2457
02:28:38.270 --> 02:28:41.450
Can you imagine if the Crista Leah Talent Agency got started?

2458
02:28:42.250 --> 02:28:45.770
We'd fucking rap back.
Then we'd rent as his goof.

2459
02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:49.160
We'd be like me and him in that fucking thing.
He would open for me.

2460
02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:52.280
That's a thing that happens too,

2461
02:28:52.281 --> 02:28:56.660
right guys bring terrible acts to open for forum.
Yeah.
We were talking about,

2462
02:28:56.700 --> 02:29:00.710
we were talking about that.
I don't get that.
I don't,
I don't get it.

2463
02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:01.880
Like I bring,

2464
02:29:02.810 --> 02:29:05.780
I bring money guys,

2465
02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:09.230
Brent Morin who was the other guy on my show and Jason Callings and those guys

2466
02:29:09.231 --> 02:29:13.790
are so good.
Yeah.
And,
and I don't,
I,
you know,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't,

2467
02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:16.160
I don't get the idea of yeah,
I get a guy,

2468
02:29:16.161 --> 02:29:18.200
he's okay and then I'll go up and crush.
Yeah.

2469
02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:21.590
Well we were talking about it cause we were at the Improv and the,
you know,

2470
02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:26.960
Chris,
very funny act and some guys don't want to go after Chris and uh,

2471
02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:31.800
some guys specifically get upset if they wind up having to go after you.

2472
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:35.840
And we were talking about this one guy who kind of tweaks about it and how

2473
02:29:35.841 --> 02:29:40.660
ridiculous it is,
is if you being funny takes away from him being funny.
Yeah.

2474
02:29:41.930 --> 02:29:45.470
To me.
It's about going up and people being different and it's fun.

2475
02:29:45.471 --> 02:29:48.830
And you go up and crush and then I have to go on after you,

2476
02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:52.480
I don't want to fucking follow you,
but I do,
you know what I mean?
It's like,
oh,

2477
02:29:52.510 --> 02:29:55.600
then it'll be fucking,
yeah.
Oh good.
I get to go after Joe.
It's going to be hard,

2478
02:29:55.610 --> 02:29:59.610
but it'll be fun.
I'm different.
But you've done it.
You do it.
You're fine.
Yeah.

2479
02:29:59.630 --> 02:30:04.520
The other week,
but I don't,
I never would be like,
no,
no way,
dude.
No Way.

2480
02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:07.910
That's,
that's bitch made shit to me.
Bitch made.
Yeah.

2481
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:12.380
To me that w w what are you saying?
You're saying you can't go up and who can't?

2482
02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:15.500
Who Even,
how about this?
You bomb.
Who gives a fuck?

2483
02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:17.690
But bombing is just,

2484
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:20.870
the whole thing that you've been working for is to build confidence so that you

2485
02:30:20.871 --> 02:30:23.690
can get to this point where you finally feel like you're worthy of staying
alive.

2486
02:30:24.260 --> 02:30:26.050
And then one bad side after crystally.

2487
02:30:30.920 --> 02:30:35.090
But that's the test the universe gives you.
Look,
I we were talking about,
um,

2488
02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:39.170
Scott Shore.
Who's Mitzi shores,
I guess oldest son.

2489
02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:42.740
He's a buddy of mine and uh,
I ran into him in La Jolla.

2490
02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:45.320
This phone when you were there in um,

2491
02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:50.360
San Diego this weekend and we were talking about what Mitzi used to do to
comics,

2492
02:30:50.361 --> 02:30:54.500
like how she develops comedians and what she used to do is anybody who's any

2493
02:30:54.501 --> 02:30:59.501
good she would put you on after the biggest killers she could find like all

2494
02:31:00.201 --> 02:31:01.820
throughout my days at the comedy store,

2495
02:31:01.821 --> 02:31:05.840
I had to follow Martin Lawrence back when,
when you so crazy when,

2496
02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:09.740
when he was doing that
I was an unknown white guy.

2497
02:31:09.770 --> 02:31:13.370
The audience was mostly black and he was going on stage with a leather jumpsuit

2498
02:31:13.371 --> 02:31:14.210
on.
Yeah.

2499
02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:19.170
He was just drawing like people have forgotten how God damn funny.
Mark Morrow,

2500
02:31:19.250 --> 02:31:19.890
funny,

2501
02:31:19.890 --> 02:31:23.720
I will never forget because he went crazy and he wore like that rubber suit had

2502
02:31:23.730 --> 02:31:26.160
gone and just fucking loose running around traffic.

2503
02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:29.790
He's still funny when you see him in movies.
He's very fun.
Like he's very funny.

2504
02:31:29.850 --> 02:31:33.630
I haven't seen him do stand up lately,
but I don't know if he does anymore.

2505
02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:35.160
I'm not sure about the comedy store.

2506
02:31:35.161 --> 02:31:37.770
Maybe two years ago and started doing some stuff,
but I never really watched.

2507
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:41.100
Well,
I know he took a long time off and then it came on stage and he was talking

2508
02:31:41.101 --> 02:31:45.660
about how they got them on pills.
Oh yeah.
Pretty relatable.

2509
02:31:45.920 --> 02:31:50.910
You got to be on pills and um,
yeah,
it was tough action.
And the audience is like,

2510
02:31:50.970 --> 02:31:53.830
Ooh,
is this a Ted talk?
Um,

2511
02:31:55.260 --> 02:31:58.050
but when I saw him,
that's the thing too.

2512
02:31:58.051 --> 02:32:00.390
We're talking about people going crazy when they get so famous.

2513
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:04.290
Martin Lawrence was goddamn gigantic.
He had that show.
Martin norm.

2514
02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:07.370
He was doing movies,
big Mama's house and all these little different,

2515
02:32:07.470 --> 02:32:10.150
see big Mama's house.
Jim Wright.
Yeah.
Where's it at?
He morphine was that,

2516
02:32:10.170 --> 02:32:12.490
America was another big,
big black woman Mama's house.

2517
02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:16.290
They all play big black women at one point in time in their life.
But uh,

2518
02:32:16.440 --> 02:32:20.010
he did all those movies and he was just a giant superstar.

2519
02:32:20.011 --> 02:32:23.070
But what people forget is his stand up.

2520
02:32:23.250 --> 02:32:28.170
He was a murderer.
He destroyed and I went on after him.

2521
02:32:28.770 --> 02:32:30.710
I don't know how many times,
I don't know how many,

2522
02:32:30.810 --> 02:32:32.460
anytime he was performing at the store,

2523
02:32:32.490 --> 02:32:37.380
I was going on after him right away every time.
And I was nobody.

2524
02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:40.620
I was nobody and I wasn't that good.
I was okay.

2525
02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:44.160
So you would get them all on at times and sometimes not.
I would eat shit,

2526
02:32:44.520 --> 02:32:48.690
eat shit and then eventually get to like a respectable few laughs before I

2527
02:32:48.691 --> 02:32:49.524
bailed.

2528
02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:54.060
But the beginning was all just watching giant groups of black people get up and

2529
02:32:54.061 --> 02:32:58.440
leave.
They were leaving anyway is when Martin,
yeah,
of course.

2530
02:32:59.540 --> 02:33:03.600
You know.
And then he had to bring me up to,
he was very gracious.
He gave,

2531
02:33:03.601 --> 02:33:08.130
gave you a great introduction.
And how long would he do?
Oh,
at least half hour.

2532
02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:11.560
At least.
Maybe more.
40 minutes.
Crazy man.
I mean when I went on,

2533
02:33:11.610 --> 02:33:14.820
when I was in the comedy store,
I would have to,
they would make like,

2534
02:33:15.090 --> 02:33:19.140
they would make me go after like Kappa Rolo who crushed.
But um,
yeah,

2535
02:33:19.141 --> 02:33:21.580
that's nothing like Martin Lawrence and the fucking,
yeah,

2536
02:33:21.690 --> 02:33:26.070
copper rule is a good comic.
But Lawrence was a superstar.

2537
02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:31.040
He was so famous in the 90s.
He was,
yeah,
I would,
you know what,

2538
02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:33.030
when I was going to the comedy store,

2539
02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:35.880
there weren't people on TV that were at the comedy store.
Oh yeah.

2540
02:33:35.881 --> 02:33:40.050
That was the dark ages.
2008.
Yeah,
it was.
It was.
There was no,

2541
02:33:40.350 --> 02:33:43.140
literally nobody.
It was,
and these guys are funny.

2542
02:33:43.141 --> 02:33:45.080
I'm not saying they're not funny,
but they just weren't on TV.
Keppra,

2543
02:33:45.090 --> 02:33:48.780
low Bret Ernst,
Sebastian,
Sebastian was,
this was before he,
you know what I mean?

2544
02:33:48.781 --> 02:33:53.470
Like right.
And then,
and dove.
Yeah.
Um,
you weren't there.

2545
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:56.940
This was after you.
It was after I left.
I left in 2007.

2546
02:33:56.941 --> 02:34:00.880
That's when the men thing happened.
Right.
And then I went in 2008 and then,

2547
02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:04.230
and then I would be going on after these guys that would,
that would crush it.

2548
02:34:04.231 --> 02:34:05.490
So I know what you're talking about.
A little bit.

2549
02:34:05.491 --> 02:34:06.600
Not like the Martin Lawrence thing,

2550
02:34:06.601 --> 02:34:10.500
but I followed Richard Pryor five weeks in a row.
You're dead.
And you know,

2551
02:34:10.890 --> 02:34:14.430
that's five weeks in a row.
Richard Pryor did stand up.
I'll never forget,

2552
02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:18.030
it was the weirdest thing because he was already on his way out.
Right.
He's

2553
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.950
<v 0>dying.
Right.
And they would carry him to the stage.
Wow.
And,
um,</v>

2554
02:34:22.750 --> 02:34:24.400
the audience would clap like,

2555
02:34:24.610 --> 02:34:27.460
like fucking Moses at origin from risen from the grave.

2556
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:30.520
And it was just fascinating just to be in the room with them,
man.

2557
02:34:30.521 --> 02:34:34.270
Just to be in the room.
Lord love the greatest comic of all time in my opinion.

2558
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:39.100
And he would go on stage and you know him well,
I think I should qualify that.

2559
02:34:39.101 --> 02:34:42.610
I think Sam Kinison in 1986 was the greatest comic of all time,

2560
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:46.810
but it was only the greatest comic for a year.
I think he was,
he was a murderer.

2561
02:34:46.990 --> 02:34:49.750
Louder Than Hell when he did that.
He couldn't be stopped.

2562
02:34:49.751 --> 02:34:52.600
He was just unstoppable.
He was the greatest ever.

2563
02:34:52.930 --> 02:34:55.690
But it was a shock when he did the thing about homosexual necrophilia acts.

2564
02:34:55.691 --> 02:35:00.610
Did you ever see that?
Yes,
I did.
What's the bit again?
And he goes,
uh,
folks,

2565
02:35:00.670 --> 02:35:05.290
it goes,
uh,
there's these guys,
homosexual necrophilia acts.

2566
02:35:05.291 --> 02:35:06.490
They were paying,

2567
02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:11.880
paying morgues to spend a few hours undisturbed but their freshest male corpse.

2568
02:35:12.820 --> 02:35:16.840
And he goes,
could you imagine the lion out there on that slab saying,
well,

2569
02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:20.260
I'm dead now.
I guess I'm going to go with Jesus.
And,

2570
02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:24.100
and he's like rocking back and forth.
He's lying on his stomach on stage.

2571
02:35:24.670 --> 02:35:25.660
He's like,
Hey,

2572
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:29.940
<v 13>the fuck is this.
It feels like there's a dick in my ass.</v>

2573
02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:34.680
You may live,
keeps walking.
It never ends.

2574
02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:36.920
It never ends.
Oh

2575
02:35:37.430 --> 02:35:42.020
<v 0>yeah.
To see it.
Yeah.
At the time did,
but nobody liked him.</v>

2576
02:35:42.140 --> 02:35:45.320
Nobody even really,
he was so original.

2577
02:35:45.490 --> 02:35:47.690
Like there was no one like Kennison before he came along.

2578
02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:52.210
Everybody else was doing jokes.
He was Sko reaming

2579
02:35:52.330 --> 02:35:54.760
<v 13>I live in.
He goes,</v>

2580
02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:59.350
Oh,
I was married twice.

2581
02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:00.791
<v 0>Wow.
Yeah.</v>

2582
02:36:00.791 --> 02:36:04.450
He did a joke about going to hell and about how Satan wouldn't even bother

2583
02:36:04.451 --> 02:36:07.340
trying to scare you.
And he goes,
Oh,
you've been married?
Oh No,

2584
02:36:07.410 --> 02:36:10.980
this is all old hat for you.
Come on in.
Oh,
that's funny.
Shit.

2585
02:36:10.981 --> 02:36:13.540
You had to see him at the time.
Well that's a,
you know,

2586
02:36:13.770 --> 02:36:15.910
Kennison is an interesting thing because when I think about Kinison,

2587
02:36:15.911 --> 02:36:19.630
I would have loved to seen what the fuck would have happened to him as a comic.

2588
02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:24.650
He would have gotten worse.
Well it was all,
but it would have been ugly to I,

2589
02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:29.230
I mean,
I'm just guessing,
but he's,
his act was so bad at the end.
Oh really?

2590
02:36:29.350 --> 02:36:33.660
He had,
he's the best example that I give to young comics when they,
uh,

2591
02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:38.130
want to talk about the perils of fame and what can happen to you.

2592
02:36:38.430 --> 02:36:41.550
And when you stop writing,
when you stop working on your sets,
I mean,
you're,

2593
02:36:41.551 --> 02:36:44.470
you're not,
you're no longer trying to hone it as a,
as an art form.
He's just,

2594
02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:46.050
he was just being Kinison.

2595
02:36:46.051 --> 02:36:49.810
He was doing blow and write and being a superstar.

2596
02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:52.540
If you listen to louder than hell,

2597
02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:57.230
you go watch his first HBO special and watch that stuff,
the good stuff.
Um,

2598
02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:00.220
and then watched the subsequent specials.
They were,

2599
02:37:00.310 --> 02:37:04.420
they were slowly but surely terrible,
like not as good.

2600
02:37:04.421 --> 02:37:08.110
The first one after it was not nearly as good.
And then it got really bad.

2601
02:37:08.111 --> 02:37:09.790
And then the at the end,
it was awful.

2602
02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:14.170
He just had fallen apart and I got to see him live after he had fallen apart.

2603
02:37:14.310 --> 02:37:17.630
Hmm.
I saw him at Great Woods in Mansfield,

2604
02:37:17.631 --> 02:37:21.050
Massachusetts and Carla Bo open forum.
Carl,
who's the funny guy,

2605
02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:23.800
he wasn't as funny as Carl.
He just,

2606
02:37:23.930 --> 02:37:27.320
he'd already like used up all his best material,
all the,

2607
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:30.260
the hunger right from being an up and coming comic,

2608
02:37:30.261 --> 02:37:31.490
like years and years of struggle.

2609
02:37:31.491 --> 02:37:36.170
He developed like all these killer bits and then within a year he had to rewrite

2610
02:37:36.171 --> 02:37:38.720
the whole thing.
He had to come up with all this new material,
right?
Yeah.

2611
02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:40.730
And it was just gimmicky stuff.

2612
02:37:40.731 --> 02:37:44.570
Like you would have some guy on stage and the guy would tell them about a

2613
02:37:44.571 --> 02:37:47.660
heartbreak that he had and then he would bring up a phone and he would call the

2614
02:37:47.661 --> 02:37:52.220
girl from the stage and scream at her like that was his gimmick.
Right.

2615
02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:57.350
<v 13>You fucking God,
I'm here with Tom Tar tar.
Right.
Go fucking con.</v>

2616
02:37:57.650 --> 02:37:58.310
You're fucking,

2617
02:37:58.310 --> 02:38:03.260
I hope you rot are beside under a gas truck and tissue and blood die,

2618
02:38:03.350 --> 02:38:04.730
die back.
You can hide

2619
02:38:06.330 --> 02:38:09.930
<v 0>and that's how he would get offstage.
It was,
it wasn't that good.</v>

2620
02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:14.390
It was over like it was over like the wind,
the Terry to sales was over.

2621
02:38:15.210 --> 02:38:19.810
But during that 1986 year,
Marin has the best fucking stories,
really innocent.

2622
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:25.110
Cause Marin used to work at the comedy store when Kennison was coming up and he

2623
02:38:25.111 --> 02:38:25.944
did coke with them.

2624
02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:30.840
They really did coke for like 72 hours and stayed up for days and it broke.

2625
02:38:30.841 --> 02:38:32.130
It broke Marin's brain,

2626
02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:35.340
the port where Marin said that he was hearing voices for almost a year.

2627
02:38:39.390 --> 02:38:41.310
<v 13>Jesus,
anybody who's listening to this,</v>

2628
02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:45.680
<v 0>if you like,
want to hear more of it.
Mark Marin's episode of this podcast.</v>

2629
02:38:45.681 --> 02:38:48.170
When Mark Mark Marin was on this podcast,
I'm sure it's easy to find.

2630
02:38:48.171 --> 02:38:52.880
He told some fucking awesome stories.
Kennison they were amazing.

2631
02:38:53.150 --> 02:38:57.850
Like I would just like my,
my jaw was hanging open,
my eyes were glued open.
Ooh,

2632
02:38:58.340 --> 02:38:59.151
fantastic.

2633
02:38:59.151 --> 02:39:03.350
But he was there at the darkest moments of the beast.

2634
02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:07.640
Like when Kennison was just do wish if I could go back home in time anywhere,

2635
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:10.640
it would be just the 80s and I'd go to the comedy store.
Yeah,
me too.

2636
02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:14.450
Fuck Caveman.
I don't care.
I don't even give a shit.

2637
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:16.850
I don't even care Napoleon.
Cool.

2638
02:39:17.150 --> 02:39:20.540
I would go see the in 1986 comedy store,

2639
02:39:20.810 --> 02:39:22.850
I'm with you 100% yeah.

2640
02:39:22.851 --> 02:39:26.690
I would love to see a prior when like the live of the son says trip time,

2641
02:39:26.970 --> 02:39:31.220
like during those days.
I mean just people clamoring to get in on a Monday night.

2642
02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:35.360
I would love to see that.
Fuck.
I want to see that guy.

2643
02:39:35.361 --> 02:39:39.620
The fucking tie down.
Is that Guy Jeff?
What?
Huh?

2644
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:44.150
Huh?
I want to see that.
Yeah,
no kidding man.
Yeah,

2645
02:39:44.151 --> 02:39:46.970
but that's cause you're a real comic,
you know,
you really love it.

2646
02:39:47.210 --> 02:39:49.280
You know one of the things,
I saw one of your tweets the other day,

2647
02:39:49.281 --> 02:39:52.670
I really loved it or only I would love it,
but only comics would love it.

2648
02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:55.480
You like,
all I want to do is be on this day.
I don't want to go to your party.

2649
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:58.770
I don't want to go to the beach.
Yeah.
People don't get it.
Like the,

2650
02:39:58.790 --> 02:40:03.020
the rush and the fun that you have when you're crushing,
when you're crushing.

2651
02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:06.140
Like I love watching comedy still.

2652
02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:09.170
And this is something that I've really come to you do.
Yeah.
I notice you.
Yeah.

2653
02:40:09.171 --> 02:40:11.510
That's the cool about you.
Yeah,
I love it.
Yeah.
It's,

2654
02:40:11.511 --> 02:40:15.540
I love laugh like when we were watching.
I know it's great.
I love laughing man.

2655
02:40:15.790 --> 02:40:19.190
And I love the art form and when Shalon was doing,

2656
02:40:19.210 --> 02:40:22.980
I don't want to give his bid away but he was doing this bit and I was howling in

2657
02:40:22.981 --> 02:40:24.030
the back of the room cause he was like,

2658
02:40:24.031 --> 02:40:28.380
see you added a bunch of new lines to you before.
Yeah.
I love it.
I still love it.

2659
02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:30.810
Some people don't man.
And that's something,

2660
02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:32.610
if I could give advice to young comics,

2661
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:37.320
don't lose the love as a fan because sometimes comics,

2662
02:40:37.470 --> 02:40:39.810
they become comics and then it's all about them.

2663
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:44.520
It's all about getting better and it's all about the them killing and not about

2664
02:40:44.521 --> 02:40:48.150
other people.
And then it becomes all about like,
you know,

2665
02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:50.730
like you sort of dissect,
like I talked to Norton once,

2666
02:40:50.731 --> 02:40:53.940
he was telling me he doesn't watch other comedy because he worries that he's

2667
02:40:53.941 --> 02:40:56.700
going to be influenced.
And I was like,
God,

2668
02:40:56.730 --> 02:41:00.460
I might have to quit comedy really if that was the case.

2669
02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:01.710
Something to be said for that though.

2670
02:41:01.711 --> 02:41:05.180
I mean at least he's got a reason and I fricking,
oh,
he's an ethical reason.

2671
02:41:05.610 --> 02:41:09.750
But I don't think you can avoid being influenced.
You're going to be,
I'm,

2672
02:41:09.751 --> 02:41:11.730
I think I'm influenced by other comics for sure.

2673
02:41:11.731 --> 02:41:15.960
I think I'm also influenced by pop culture influenced by art and music and

2674
02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:19.670
movies that I see in books that I read.
I think life is,
uh,

2675
02:41:20.100 --> 02:41:21.570
the entire culture.

2676
02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:25.620
The entire civilization of human beings is a series of influences.

2677
02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:29.160
People influencing people,
people enhancing people.
There's a whole,

2678
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:32.910
the whole reason to have good friends,
his good friends enhance you.
Right?

2679
02:41:33.210 --> 02:41:33.571
You know,

2680
02:41:33.571 --> 02:41:38.250
if you are around people that are constantly like pushing and they're constantly

2681
02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:41.040
getting shit done,
like it makes you get shit done.

2682
02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:45.720
When I was a kid and I was in high school,
I had my two,
two of my best friends,

2683
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:49.080
Jimmy did Teleo and Jimmy lawless.
Those guys sound great guy friends.

2684
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:51.570
They're the great,
they sound like great guys.
There are two great guys,

2685
02:41:51.571 --> 02:41:55.800
but one of the things that was great about those guys is that they worked hard

2686
02:41:55.860 --> 02:41:58.290
when I was in high school,
these guys had like,

2687
02:41:58.291 --> 02:42:02.820
Jimmy has an electrical company and uh,
he's a electrician and um,
uh,
the other,

2688
02:42:02.821 --> 02:42:06.420
Jimmy is a carpenter and a while I was in high school,

2689
02:42:06.421 --> 02:42:09.630
these guys like we're constantly working.
They would get up early,

2690
02:42:09.631 --> 02:42:10.291
they would do things.

2691
02:42:10.291 --> 02:42:13.780
Jimmy had it with Jimmy to tell you how to fucking snow plow operation.
He had a,

2692
02:42:13.781 --> 02:42:15.780
a truck that he had bought when we were in high school.

2693
02:42:15.781 --> 02:42:18.840
You had a fucking flower and a truck,
a pickup truck had kids,

2694
02:42:18.930 --> 02:42:22.330
he'd be me making money.
He was hustling.

2695
02:42:22.331 --> 02:42:24.060
He was always getting shit done.

2696
02:42:24.210 --> 02:42:28.350
And so I would feel lazy if I didn't like hustle like these guys did.

2697
02:42:28.351 --> 02:42:31.920
And I developed a lot of my work ethic from being friends with these guys

2698
02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:36.630
because they were hustlers because they were constantly getting shit done.

2699
02:42:36.910 --> 02:42:39.120
And if you're around guys that constantly get shit done,

2700
02:42:39.330 --> 02:42:43.980
it becomes sort of contagious,
you know,
and I think comics,

2701
02:42:44.190 --> 02:42:46.290
um,
they tend to be,

2702
02:42:46.530 --> 02:42:49.840
a lot of us tend to be very not

2703
02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:56.720
with the best way to look at it is you concentrate too much on yourself to the

2704
02:42:57.391 --> 02:42:58.440
point where you,

2705
02:42:58.500 --> 02:43:03.390
you will avoid other things being good that don't have anything to do with you.

2706
02:43:03.391 --> 02:43:05.160
Like especially like struggling comics.

2707
02:43:05.430 --> 02:43:08.700
That's one of the reasons why they don't enjoy watching other standup there.

2708
02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:11.230
You're,
you know,
you wish you came up with those jokes.

2709
02:43:11.231 --> 02:43:15.190
You wish it was you that was up there.
He see it like I went to uh,

2710
02:43:15.460 --> 02:43:20.460
this place cap city once and Jim Norton was onstage and um,

2711
02:43:21.610 --> 02:43:25.690
I was watching and beside me with the two guys that were on before,
Jim Norton,

2712
02:43:26.130 --> 02:43:27.660
they didn't laugh at all.
Right?

2713
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:31.690
They would just sitting there while he was on stage murdering.
He was,

2714
02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:35.680
and I was car ride and laughing.
And I remember looking over and saying,

2715
02:43:35.681 --> 02:43:39.550
these guys aren't enjoying this comedy and there was like a tinge of,

2716
02:43:39.551 --> 02:43:40.910
I wish it was me up there.

2717
02:43:41.410 --> 02:43:46.120
There was a tinge that these guys were exhibiting of I wish it was me.
I wish.

2718
02:43:46.290 --> 02:43:49.450
And I was like,
you poor bastards.
Like you're missing out on what?

2719
02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:52.210
Why did you become a comic in the first place?
Interesting.
Yeah.

2720
02:43:52.460 --> 02:43:54.910
Became a comic in the first place.
Cause you love comedy,
right?

2721
02:43:55.210 --> 02:44:00.210
Like I love standup comedy long before I ever thought to go on stage with no

2722
02:44:00.731 --> 02:44:03.040
nothing and just say shit and people are entertained.
Yeah.

2723
02:44:03.041 --> 02:44:04.630
And the coolest thing to watch too,

2724
02:44:05.020 --> 02:44:09.190
like I went to see a bunch of live standup but for ever got paid to do it.

2725
02:44:09.700 --> 02:44:12.850
Like I saw Kennison long before I ever did standup,

2726
02:44:12.910 --> 02:44:16.240
I saw Kennison and 86 and Mansfield,

2727
02:44:16.241 --> 02:44:19.960
Massachusetts at the Great Woods Center for the performing arts and I saw him

2728
02:44:19.961 --> 02:44:24.370
again at this place down the Cape and it was all long before I saw Rodney

2729
02:44:24.370 --> 02:44:25.400
Dangerfield long before ever saw it.

2730
02:44:25.401 --> 02:44:30.401
I thought about doing standup and these guys like that don't appreciate it as

2731
02:44:31.331 --> 02:44:36.190
just a thing to enjoy because they do it themselves.
Like guy,

2732
02:44:36.191 --> 02:44:40.360
you're missing out on a lot,
man.
It's easy to get caught up in though.
So,

2733
02:44:40.361 --> 02:44:41.560
but so it is interesting.

2734
02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:45.250
I mean to say that is important I think because it's easy to get caught up in

2735
02:44:46.540 --> 02:44:50.230
your own head.
Your own head.
Yeah,
exactly.
Your own head,
your own career,

2736
02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:55.060
your own selfishness.
Think about it only,
you know,
in terms of like your success,

2737
02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:59.440
like how many comics do you know where other guys will get shit and then they'll

2738
02:44:59.441 --> 02:44:59.990
get jealous.

2739
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:04.870
You were talking about that's happened to you like you when you started taking

2740
02:45:04.871 --> 02:45:08.710
off like and you started out.
Definitely.

2741
02:45:09.070 --> 02:45:13.330
They get angry,
they get angry.
Yet it's,
it's very weird man,

2742
02:45:13.331 --> 02:45:16.600
because all the gold,
that'd be no gold fast case,

2743
02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:21.640
which is exactly wrong because if let's all go do this.

2744
02:45:21.670 --> 02:45:25.630
Yes.
And you can.
That's the thing.
Absolutely.
Especially in comedy,
you get,

2745
02:45:25.780 --> 02:45:29.110
you get your crew and I mean,
well not only that,

2746
02:45:29.260 --> 02:45:33.910
how about the fact that there's 350 million people in the country and there's

2747
02:45:34.060 --> 02:45:37.090
how many fucking clubs?
It's not like there's one club in New York.

2748
02:45:37.091 --> 02:45:40.150
We all have to go there and get on stage and there's no god damn stage time.
No.

2749
02:45:40.151 --> 02:45:44.800
New York itself has a hundred clubs at least.
Yeah,
just New York.

2750
02:45:44.830 --> 02:45:49.720
La Has.
How many fucking clubs are in la?
Jesus Christ.
There's the main ones.

2751
02:45:49.721 --> 02:45:52.180
There's the Improv,
the laugh factory,
the comedy store,

2752
02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:56.320
and then you've got the ha ha.
Then you've got fucking the Ice House in Pasadena.

2753
02:45:56.321 --> 02:46:00.840
You have it all the right in Irvine.
You can go there.
Irvine,
Ontario,

2754
02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:04.120
on and on and on.
The comedy and Magic Club in her Mosa.

2755
02:46:04.510 --> 02:46:06.340
I mean Jesus fucking Christ.

2756
02:46:06.341 --> 02:46:10.070
There's a lot of places to perform here and then across the country,

2757
02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:12.230
<v 3>like everywhere you go,</v>

2758
02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:14.660
there's a comedy club everywhere he goes as a place to perform.

2759
02:46:14.900 --> 02:46:18.470
If you develop an act and you have a following,
you develop a following,

2760
02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:21.050
you're going to work,
you're going to have a great time.
Yeah.
It's,

2761
02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:26.630
there's plenty of prosperity.
Just keep doing it.
Keep doing it.
And just,

2762
02:46:26.930 --> 02:46:31.790
and also,
yeah,
just fucking don't do one club either.

2763
02:46:31.791 --> 02:46:36.200
Don't just be in cap city and just do that.
Yeah.
No,
that's not good either.
Right.

2764
02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:39.650
You know,
you know,
one of the things I love about comedy as I still love comedy.

2765
02:46:39.860 --> 02:46:41.780
Fucking still love it man.
You know,

2766
02:46:41.781 --> 02:46:44.510
I'm getting ready to do the special and I'm filming my special,
uh,

2767
02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:48.520
not this upcoming weekend,
but the next upcoming really that sooner.
And so I'm,

2768
02:46:48.521 --> 02:46:52.220
I'm hammering it,
man.
I'm doing like,
yeah,
you're always out five nights a week.

2769
02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:56.600
I'm having so much fun though.
Cool.
To,
it's cool to see,
to see that.
You know,

2770
02:46:56.630 --> 02:47:00.980
you still well,
what's this time?
We did a special two years ago.
Oh really?
Yeah.

2771
02:47:01.310 --> 02:47:03.770
And where are you taping this one?
This one's in Denver.
Oh,
right.

2772
02:47:03.771 --> 02:47:08.060
Comedy works comedy works in Denver.
Um,
which is one of my favorite clubs ever.

2773
02:47:08.210 --> 02:47:11.270
How are you putting it out?
Comedy Central.
Oh,
okay.
Cool.

2774
02:47:12.060 --> 02:47:14.570
What'd you do you need to do last one?
I did comedy central.
Yeah.

2775
02:47:14.630 --> 02:47:19.340
Where'd you film it?
In New Orleans.
Uh,
yeah.
It was fucking awesome.

2776
02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:22.530
It was awesome.
That's a good place to do cause.
Awesome.
Yeah,
it's,

2777
02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:25.170
it was such a good place to comedy because they don't,
they don't have any good,

2778
02:47:25.171 --> 02:47:29.090
I have a club,
a club scene though.
They have like bars,

2779
02:47:29.690 --> 02:47:32.370
but it was awesome.
I was,
I was unsure cause caught me.

2780
02:47:32.420 --> 02:47:35.000
It was my first and comedy central's,
we want you to do it here.
And I was like,

2781
02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:37.430
all right dude,
I'm so happy.

2782
02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:39.320
Did they piggyback you with a bunch of other specials?

2783
02:47:39.321 --> 02:47:42.470
They were filming where they had the same stage.
We each had a night.
Yeah.

2784
02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:46.400
But yeah,
it was like three nights.
It was me.
Steve ran is easy.
And Neal Brennan?

2785
02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:49.400
Yeah.
They like to do that.
They like to do that where they like,

2786
02:47:49.401 --> 02:47:53.750
they like get a place.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm,

2787
02:47:53.751 --> 02:47:56.480
I'm doing this one in a comedy club was my first one in a comedy club.

2788
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:58.970
I decided that like,
I'm like,

2789
02:47:59.030 --> 02:48:02.660
there's a thing about watching comedy in a liberty.
You're right.

2790
02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:04.910
You know what I mean about,
yeah,
absolutely.

2791
02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:08.030
It's intimate and you'd just get to do it in a comedy club.
It's just not,
it's,

2792
02:48:08.060 --> 02:48:12.260
it's better.
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.
The shows better too.

2793
02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:15.530
It's like there's a difference in the show that you see in a theater.

2794
02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:16.970
It's still great,

2795
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:22.190
but it's missing that crackling intimacy that a 300 seat,

2796
02:48:22.220 --> 02:48:25.940
250 seat comedy club was,
yeah,
like I just did American comedy company,

2797
02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:30.620
San Diego fucking perfect.
I love that club.
Ooh,
it's perfect.

2798
02:48:30.650 --> 02:48:32.930
It's the perfect club.
Yeah,
that's perfect.
It can't get any better.

2799
02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:37.520
It's just the perfect size and before that I did wiseguys and Utah.
Same thing.

2800
02:48:37.660 --> 02:48:41.090
I don't know that one Paul.
I know the name,
but you got to go there.

2801
02:48:41.810 --> 02:48:43.910
Fucking rip that place apart.
It's amazing.

2802
02:48:43.970 --> 02:48:47.960
And the people are cool as fuck you think of like Salt Lake City.

2803
02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:51.440
It's been all bunch of weird religious freaks,
but it's not,

2804
02:48:51.441 --> 02:48:54.920
it's only like a percentage of the population and everybody else is like working

2805
02:48:54.921 --> 02:48:58.550
really hard to not be like that guy.
Well yeah,
if you have that,

2806
02:48:58.551 --> 02:49:01.370
you definitely have the opposite of that in one town.
Yeah.

2807
02:49:01.730 --> 02:49:04.400
Where's the places you'd like to work?
I do like the American comedy company.

2808
02:49:04.401 --> 02:49:07.530
I love Caroline's.
Caroline Zimbabwe of Caroline's on Broadway.

2809
02:49:07.531 --> 02:49:11.410
That's a great place.
I love Addison Improv.
That's all great.

2810
02:49:11.430 --> 02:49:16.170
I love that fucking room.
That's a wild room,
man.
It is not a Dallas.
Ooh,

2811
02:49:16.171 --> 02:49:20.100
that's a fun place.
My favorite place comedy store though,
man,
it's great spot.

2812
02:49:20.350 --> 02:49:23.670
Favorite was that original room?
Yeah.
That's probably one of the best rooms ever.

2813
02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:26.110
Yeah,
if not the best.
It's,
it's,
that's like the,

2814
02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:31.160
that's like the only room that's built every other clubs built for the audience

2815
02:49:31.620 --> 02:49:33.060
that is built for a comedian.

2816
02:49:33.570 --> 02:49:36.570
It's like the only room really that I can pick up that's built for you.

2817
02:49:37.230 --> 02:49:39.690
I'm working my way to get back there.
I might go back there.

2818
02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:43.830
Joey started going back there again.
Joey's my fucking canary in a coal mine.

2819
02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.460
Joey's one of the main reasons why I decided not to go back to the first bus.

2820
02:49:47.461 --> 02:49:50.130
He actually quit before them and see a thing went down.
Oh really?
Yeah.

2821
02:49:50.131 --> 02:49:52.680
He didn't like a lot of the things about the way the store was going.
Oh yeah.

2822
02:49:52.681 --> 02:49:54.690
It's different now.
I mean we wish it would come back to it.

2823
02:49:54.691 --> 02:49:58.770
Don't be hitting awesome.
He didn't get along with Paul either.
Oh gotcha.
Yeah.

2824
02:50:01.050 --> 02:50:04.710
I'm there all the time.
Yeah.
Well maybe I will.
Maybe I will.
But listen man,

2825
02:50:04.711 --> 02:50:08.040
it's been fun doing gigs with you.
I've,
I've been enjoying doing the Improv.
I've,

2826
02:50:08.041 --> 02:50:10.540
I've had uh,
yeah,
it's been really fun.
It's,

2827
02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:14.010
it's just been fun to have somebody not in the group.
Not In the green room with,

2828
02:50:14.250 --> 02:50:16.320
yeah,
cause there's no bedroom there.

2829
02:50:16.650 --> 02:50:20.790
We were talking about the Improv in Hollywood is like if we were on the road and

2830
02:50:20.791 --> 02:50:22.620
like we,
we worked at that club,

2831
02:50:22.621 --> 02:50:26.040
people like there's no fucking green room is nowhere to stand like in between

2832
02:50:26.041 --> 02:50:26.371
shows.
