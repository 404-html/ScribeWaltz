1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches and I attributed it to cutting out refined sugars and</v>

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:06.690
<v Speaker 1>refined carbohydrates.</v>

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that stuff's poison,</v>

5
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>but there's been studies showing it also affects your brain and negative way as</v>

6
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:11.971
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

7
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>And people that eat refined sugar,</v>

8
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

10
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>there's more brain atrophy.</v>

11
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lots of correlations.</v>

12
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>The one thing I will say is that,</v>

13
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>there are people that are super physically active and they're like working out</v>

15
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>two hours a day and you know,</v>

16
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:25.704
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>

17
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>they'll use refined sugar yeah.</v>

18
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.411
<v Speaker 1>To,</v>

19
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.941
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

21
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>their increased transport glucose transporter in their muscles and you're using</v>

22
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>it as an anabolic way to like get bigger muscle.</v>

23
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>And I know guys who do that after they work out the candy.</v>

24
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.680
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

26
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

27
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's,</v>

28
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.851
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

29
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>you can't compare like people that aren't working out like two hours a day or</v>

30
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.030
<v Speaker 1>two to normal people as Freeman sedentary people,</v>

31
00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:49.864
<v Speaker 1>weight lifters.</v>

32
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Weightlifters he pulled it are just ripping their body apart.</v>

34
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of savages out there that are doing crazy power lifting workouts</v>

35
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>and benching and squatting.</v>

36
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>And I know a lot of guys who like to eat candy afterwards.</v>

37
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

38
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.931
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

40
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:04.171
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

41
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.004
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly,</v>

42
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I think that those people,</v>

44
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

46
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

47
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.411
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

48
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not acting the same way.</v>

49
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>It's radically different requirement that their body needs in terms of glucose.</v>

50
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

51
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.171
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is,</v>

52
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:16.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

53
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:16.831
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

54
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:17.191
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

55
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>the way I think about it is it's not really nutrient dense.</v>

56
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:19.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

57
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:20.574
<v Speaker 1>I like to like,</v>

58
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

59
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of,</v>

61
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.793
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason.</v>

62
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

63
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why I like to like take and if you want the sugar and then,</v>

64
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:25.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:28.570
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't get an orange or an apple or something like that,</v>

66
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>you should probably the better move than eating candy.</v>

67
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>But I think they just want a ton of it.</v>

68
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 1>And what is the,</v>

69
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>what's the anabolic factor?</v>

70
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:35.131
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

71
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>if you were going to eat candy or something like that,</v>

72
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>has a bunch of refined sugar after like an intense workout.</v>

73
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 1>What would be the antibiotic factor?</v>

74
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:41.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>the glucose,</v>

76
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.171
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

77
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>the workout causes,</v>

78
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

79
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Glucose transporters that transport glucose to like go through the roof.</v>

80
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>And so you start the glucose from your bloodstream gets like sucked into the</v>

81
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>muscle and then in the muscle,</v>

82
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:54.901
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

84
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:55.651
<v Speaker 1>you're basically,</v>

85
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

86
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you can use that as,</v>

87
00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:57.391
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

88
00:01:57.391 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>as a way to,</v>

89
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

90
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>to have insulin and it can be anabolic,</v>

91
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

92
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

93
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.591
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

94
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.060
<v Speaker 1>whereas if you weren't doing that,</v>

95
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>then the glucose in your bloodstream and it can all sorts of small dense LDL</v>

96
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>particles can start to form because the inflammatory transformations that happen</v>

97
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:11.544
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>

98
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>that's at least my understanding that's in combination of course with,</v>

100
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

101
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

102
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:16.141
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

103
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:16.471
<v Speaker 1>acids,</v>

104
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>which are also important for the growth of the protein and muscle.</v>

105
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>But that's my understanding of it.</v>

106
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.373
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

107
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>So like in general though,</v>

108
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>if someone could cut one thing out of their diet,</v>

109
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>refined carbohydrates and refined sugars would be a great way to go.</v>

110
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I think the one,</v>

111
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>if you were to think about the one easiest thing that you could do that would</v>

112
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>have the biggest impact on your health,</v>

113
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.901
<v Speaker 1>and if we're talking,</v>

114
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:42.734
<v Speaker 1>if we're talking about,</v>

115
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about someone who's already Paleo or someone like you or I</v>

116
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>were talking about like standard American person.</v>

117
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

118
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that they could do to have the biggest impact on their health I</v>

119
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>would say is to cut out refined sugar.</v>

120
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.391
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

121
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the biggest thing.</v>

122
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>The easiest thing,</v>

123
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know how easy it is.</v>

124
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

125
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:03.120
<v Speaker 1>it can be addicting.</v>

127
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

128
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's been shown dopamine levels,</v>

129
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>can get activated.</v>

131
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Game B was basically proceeded from the idea that what we live in is a game</v>

132
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>theoretic landscape,</v>

133
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

134
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>That the winners in this game theoretic landscape are individuals who have</v>

135
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>figured out where there's a niche.</v>

136
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Some of them have figured out how to engage in something called rent seeking,</v>

137
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.430
<v Speaker 1>which rent seeking basically means making money without producing some without</v>

138
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>producing value.</v>

139
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of stuff that goes on in our economy that is not productive.</v>

140
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>And good,</v>

141
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.190
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless generates fortunes.</v>

142
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's rent seeking as opposed to innovation or productivity.</v>

143
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about like hedge fund type stuff,</v>

144
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>moving money around.</v>

145
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.161
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

146
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:53.161
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a little careful about this because it is quite possible for things</v>

147
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>like hedge funds to actually correct inefficiencies in the economy in a way that</v>

148
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>is productive.</v>

149
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.130
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that that's the average thing that,</v>

150
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>so do things are you referring to?</v>

151
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

152
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.671
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

153
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:03.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:04.151
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

155
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.984
<v Speaker 1>let's take the,</v>

156
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate example that will make it clear.</v>

157
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>A warlord is not responsible for,</v>

158
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.183
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

159
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>for building the road that they then stand by the side of and extort money from</v>

160
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>people who want to travel it.</v>

161
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>A cable company may produce some benefit.</v>

162
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>They obviously have infrastructure that allows you to get content,</v>

163
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>but what fraction of what you're paying for is actually about them delivering a</v>

164
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>service at some price and making some reasonable profit.</v>

165
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>And what fraction of it is about the fact that they are an economic Goliath and</v>

166
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>that you don't have enough choice to be able to negotiate a decent price with</v>

167
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

168
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>So there's some fraction of what they're producing that is productive,</v>

169
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but then there's a large amount of profit there that isn't about productivity or</v>

170
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

171
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>It's about the fact that they own a choke point and you can't get around it.</v>

172
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>so we don't know what fraction of the economy is a rent seeking and what</v>

174
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>fraction of it is productive.</v>

175
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>But there is,</v>

176
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>especially if one is broad minded about thinking about all the ways that one can</v>

177
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>engage in rent seeking,</v>

178
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>one can actually be destructive of value.</v>

179
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>If you destroy future wellbeing for our descendants,</v>

180
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it may look productive in the present,</v>

181
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:25.030
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't productive.</v>

182
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 1>It's actually destructive.</v>

183
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's a kind of um,</v>

184
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>rent seeking that we don't even typically model.</v>

185
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.323
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

186
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.613
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

188
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.593
<v Speaker 1>where are we headed?</v>

189
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.891
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

190
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

191
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>So we live in a game theoretic landscape that's both good and bad.</v>

192
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.431
<v Speaker 1>As you point out,</v>

193
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:47.431
<v Speaker 1>competition is a healthy thing and competition in markets produces a huge amount</v>

194
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:50.164
<v Speaker 1>of value.</v>

195
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>So I hear people deriding capitalism and I always want to make the same point to</v>

196
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:55.481
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

197
00:05:55.481 --> 00:06:00.481
<v Speaker 1>which is you've got two things glued together and you are challenging them as a</v>

198
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>package,</v>

199
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>but there's no reason they have to be packaged.</v>

200
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>So we would be foolish to give up markets.</v>

201
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Markets are amazingly powerful engines of innovation.</v>

202
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>They are capable of solving problems that we cannot solve deliberately,</v>

203
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>even if we want it to.</v>

204
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>So we need markets,</v>

205
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>but we don't want markets ruling the planet and deciding that anything that</v>

206
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 1>spits out a profit is therefore good and that we should be exposed to whatever</v>

207
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>the market discovers can be a viable.</v>

208
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>So what we want is ultimately to provide,</v>

209
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.483
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

210
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>provide incentive structures that cause the market to produce things that are</v>

211
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:43.184
<v Speaker 1>good for us,</v>

212
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

213
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.871
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

214
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:48.380
<v Speaker 1>if you tell the market that you want the solution to some problem,</v>

215
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 1>the market can figure out how to solve that problem and it will do it very well.</v>

216
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>But if you allow the market to decide what problems to solve,</v>

217
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 1>it may end up,</v>

218
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

219
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 1>addicting you to your phone,</v>

220
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 1>right addicting to you.</v>

221
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>To your phone in a way that harms your social relationships,</v>

222
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>harms your,</v>

223
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>your parenting of your children,</v>

224
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 1>harms all kinds of things that are really important,</v>

225
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 1>breaks the ability of your children to have a educational experience in school.</v>

226
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>We don't want the market discovering how to disrupt useful functioning of</v>

227
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

228
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>We want the market to stay out of that stuff and then to provide us benefits</v>

229
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

230
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

231
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.860
<v Speaker 1>only it can provide,</v>

232
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:29.861
<v Speaker 1>like all of the mechanisms that now allow us to navigate seamlessly in places</v>

233
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 1>that we've never been avoiding traffic that we wouldn't know to worry about.</v>

234
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.351
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

235
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:41.351
<v Speaker 1>Those are huge benefits and they're capable of taking a city that is to snarled</v>

236
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 1>with traffic and reducing the degree to which it is snarled with traffic.</v>

237
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 1>So they're very powerful,</v>

238
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>but we shouldn't,</v>

239
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath.</v>

240
00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Water markets are good.</v>

241
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Allowing markets to discover any and every,</v>

242
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

243
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.910
<v Speaker 1>mechanism for exploiting you is not good at all.</v>

244
00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.511
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

245
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a large part of why we're in the predicament that we're in,</v>

246
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:06.950
<v Speaker 1>is that we let the market decide what problems to solve.</v>

247
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
