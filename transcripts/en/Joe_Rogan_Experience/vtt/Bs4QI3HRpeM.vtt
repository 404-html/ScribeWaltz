00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 2>It's coming out like that.</v>

10
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 2>You know what it is because you speak the truth.</v>

11
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:18.770
<v Speaker 2>It's just the truth coming out.</v>

00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:25.981

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.911
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

25
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I just tell the truth and everything else takes care of itself.</v>

26
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 2>But that pitches like the Michael Jordan of soldiery songs know she could sing</v>

00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 2>the fucking shit out of some music.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't like calling anything a lifestyle company.</v>

36
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.410
<v Speaker 2>We were going to have to come up with a good name for what it is.</v>

37
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 2>It sounds so not Joe Rogan,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

51
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 2>really good job of predicting,</v>

52
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 2>projecting your brand.</v>

53

00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:31.500

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

65
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 2>What'd you say that when you say branding a brand that takes away the purity of</v>

66
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:38.860
<v Speaker 2>the intention,</v>

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.441
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest.</v>

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 2>but I just want those and then I want the jerky and all stuff I use.</v>

86
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.301
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

88
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

89
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 2>there's a lack of a celebration of a fucking exciting manly shit in this</v>

90
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

91
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Of course is.</v>

92
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.490
<v Speaker 2>There's a big suppression of it and we add on it or a against that whole</v>

93
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 2>heartedly and we think it'll take supplements if we had stuff that makes your</v>

94
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 2>dick hard.</v>

95
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 2>We're going to look into that.</v>

96
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.080
<v Speaker 2>We got some hard dick natural supplements.</v>

97
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 2>W will get you those.</v>

98
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>

99
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 2>we'll find out there any good.</v>

100
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 2>We'll run some tests and we'll get you.</v>

101
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 2>The data exists,</v>

102
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.280
<v Speaker 2>but the stuff that we have,</v>

103
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 2>everything that we have is shit that we use.</v>

104
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 2>We use the best quality ingredients.</v>

105
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 2>We put together the best possible combination of these things,</v>

106
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 2>whether it's for Alpha brain or knew mood,</v>

107
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 2>knew mood is a fascinating one because you know there's a lot of people in this</v>

108
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 2>country that are on stimulant or well,</v>

109
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that are on stimulants where there's a lot of people</v>

110
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 2>that are on Ssri antidepressants.</v>

111
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:55.971
<v Speaker 2>They're on things that essentially stimulate serotonin in your mind or or add it</v>

112
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:57.631
<v Speaker 2>to your brain,</v>

113
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:57.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 2>you can add it artificially or five htp</v>

115
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 3>and l trip defender.</v>

116
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:07.141
<v Speaker 3>Two different ways that it boosts your brain's production of Serotonin and five</v>

117
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 3>htp hasn't been as it's been explained to me,</v>

118
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.060
<v Speaker 3>five hcb converts into Serotonin and Tryptophan converts into five htp,</v>

119
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 3>so when you put them together,</v>

120
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 3>it's like a time release thing.</v>

121
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

122
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.301
<v Speaker 3>it's all.</v>

123
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:24.301
<v Speaker 3>It's just science about nutrition and what is effective for what aspect of</v>

124
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.871
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>

125
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 3>whether it's mental performance like Alpha brain or physical performance like</v>

126
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:30.761
<v Speaker 3>shroom,</v>

127
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:31.001
<v Speaker 3>tech,</v>

128
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>

129
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 3>All of it is described on it.</v>

130
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:35.240
<v Speaker 3>We describe why we're selling.</v>

131
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 3>This is what it is.</v>

132
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:36.900
<v Speaker 3>This is why.</v>

133
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 3>How we got involved in it.</v>

134
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

135
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 3>these are the people that tell you it's good and we're dealing with professional</v>

136
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 3>poker players.</v>

137
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 3>A lot of pro athletes love all the different products because they,</v>

138
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.000
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

139
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

140
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 3>we're just trying to find the most effective shit out there.</v>

141
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 3>What's the best shit?</v>

142
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.773
<v Speaker 3>Let's sell it.</v>

143
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about Kale shakes.</v>

144
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:57.710
<v Speaker 3>I make Kale shakes almost every morning and I haven't all week though,</v>

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Your skin is positive and glowing.</v>

148
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.880
<v Speaker 3>A lot of water.</v>

149
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

150
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 3>so we decided to get BLENDTEC blenders.</v>

151
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 3>We found those are the best we're selling as we sell them $200 less than the</v>

152
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 3>manufacturer suggested retail price.</v>

153
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Just because we're trying to sell you the best shot possible at the lowest price</v>

154
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:17.681
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

155
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 3>That that is the number one goal with on it.</v>

156
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 3>And everything we sell you is shit.</v>

157
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:23.160
<v Speaker 3>We use metal belt.</v>

158
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.243
<v Speaker 3>No scarves.</v>

159
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm against old dudes with scarves.</v>

160
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.830
<v Speaker 2>And I think Randy coture,</v>

161
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 2>feminist scholar,</v>

162
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.790
<v Speaker 2>but he's been wearing a scarf lately and I just want to talk to randy couture</v>

163
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.010
<v Speaker 2>was such a bad motherfucker.</v>

164
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Turn it around his neck.</v>

165
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

166
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Ballet could be in a leotard and I'd still be like,</v>

167
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 2>stay away from me.</v>

168
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 2>He could go out to clubs with a real legitimate albatross around his neck and</v>

169
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.060
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't care.</v>

170
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.721
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of which,</v>

171
00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:47.600
<v Speaker 2>did you see Matt Makani in magic?</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

174
00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:48.800
<v Speaker 2>I missed that.</v>

175
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I never met anybody wanting to have sex to themselves more.</v>

176
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.563
<v Speaker 2>That guy.</v>

177
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.850

<v Speaker 2>You took that role so you could wear outfits and go and go.</v>

192
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.871
<v Speaker 2>That's what he does.</v>

193
00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 2>And I've never seen anyone.</v>

200
00:05:24.081 --> 00:05:25.160
<v Speaker 2>I got a little panicky.</v>

201
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

00:05:28.521 --> 00:05:29.300
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

206
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Tatum o'neal or whatever the guy's name is.</v>

207
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.943
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't look better.</v>

208
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.941
<v Speaker 2>Handsomest guy.</v>

209
00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I hung out with him in Vegas for a weekend.</v>

210
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.340
<v Speaker 2>Women literally start just operating in his presence and he's a great guy.</v>

211
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.060
<v Speaker 2>They must panic.</v>

212
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.250
<v Speaker 2>He said he was an athlete going on with the sound.</v>

213
00:05:43.251 --> 00:05:44.084
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

214
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.093
<v Speaker 2>That sound like a pool.</v>

215
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.920
<v Speaker 2>When he's talking,</v>

216
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 2>it's getting really loud or screaming into a microphone.</v>

217
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.143
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

218
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.270
<v Speaker 2>It's normal.</v>

219
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm using my stage voice now.</v>

220
00:05:51.441 --> 00:05:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Mine is down.</v>

221
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about chapter two.</v>

224
00:05:54.141 --> 00:05:55.010
<v Speaker 3>Screaming in the voice.</v>

225
00:05:55.011 --> 00:05:55.920
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to pop the minute,</v>

226
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't sound good.</v>

227
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>

228
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.423
<v Speaker 3>It's very gay.</v>

229
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.263
<v Speaker 4>The easiest thing.</v>

230
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

231
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.411
<v Speaker 3>something's wrong.</v>

232
00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:02.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm not hearing myself.</v>

233
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 3>You're not hearing.</v>

234
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.890
<v Speaker 3>You're not like a like a little.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There you go guys.</v>

236
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.741
<v Speaker 3>If you screw up,</v>

237
00:06:08.741 --> 00:06:11.700
<v Speaker 3>just get your microphone technique.</v>

238
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.930
<v Speaker 3>I start talking about channing tatum and my voice was like,</v>

239
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.020
<v Speaker 3>but it shouldn't crack that easy.</v>

240
00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Brian.</v>

241
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 3>This is like some little crackle when it gets high here.</v>

242
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.600
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

243
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

244
00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:21.460
<v Speaker 4>because you're screaming into a microphone.</v>

245
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.710
<v Speaker 4>When you're,</v>

246
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.320
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>

247
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.041
<v Speaker 4>when you're on stage,</v>

248
00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:24.491
<v Speaker 4>it happens.</v>

249
00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:25.990
<v Speaker 4>You just can't hear it because it's a big stage,</v>

250
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:27.640
<v Speaker 4>but when you're in a recording studio,</v>

251
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.810
<v Speaker 4>you're screaming in a microphone.</v>

252
00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:29.644
<v Speaker 4>You're going to.</v>

256
00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:33.940
<v Speaker 4>We could turn it down like this.</v>

257
00:06:33.941 --> 00:06:37.150
<v Speaker 4>You could turn your headphones up right now and it'll be really quiet.</v>

258
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.540
<v Speaker 4>You're just not going to pop the mic.</v>

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was that the,</v>

295
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

296
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 3>the headphone Jack was really,</v>

297
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:33.974
<v Speaker 3>really low.</v>

298
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm honored.</v>

299
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

300
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

301
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

302
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.400
<v Speaker 3>we started carrying things like kettle bells and battle ropes and we're going to</v>

303
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 3>continue to supply the craziest fitness shit we can get our hands on.</v>

304
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 3>What probably club bells when moving to those next.</v>

305
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Those are pretty bad ass.</v>

306
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.153
<v Speaker 3>We use those.</v>

307
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.400
<v Speaker 3>I just started doing those.</v>

308
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

309
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 3>you do those,</v>

310
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.890
<v Speaker 3>that shield casting over the shoulders.</v>

311
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic for the wrists and the forearms and great for functional strength.</v>

312
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.420
<v Speaker 3>So what we'll probably get involved in club bells eventually to all the stuff we</v>

313
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:05.601
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>

314
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Those stuff that would improve your,</v>

315
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:08.870
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

316
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 3>your strength and your conditioning if you doing like Jujitsu or any kind of</v>

317
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:12.854
<v Speaker 3>athletics.</v>

318
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 3>It's all just about a shit for functional strength.</v>

319
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.050
<v Speaker 3>If you use the code name Rogan,</v>

320
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 3>you will save 10 percent off any and all supplements,</v>

321
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:20.650
<v Speaker 3>including camp force.</v>

322
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 3>We have hemp force protein powder that's made out of raw hemp,</v>

323
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.561
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

324
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 3>you can't grow in America.</v>

325
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Ha.</v>

326
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 3>You can buy it from Colorado,</v>

327
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:29.240
<v Speaker 3>mate,</v>

328
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 3>make marijuana legal this week.</v>

329
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 3>They did that might today.</v>

330
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.373
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>

331
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.280
<v Speaker 3>The polls show that the federal government coming to notify that.</v>

332
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

333
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.470
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

334
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.200
<v Speaker 3>have those concepts,</v>

335
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.390
<v Speaker 3>but you can't.</v>

336
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:40.581
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

337
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:40.871
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

338
00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:41.704
<v Speaker 3>we sell hamp.</v>

339
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 3>This hemp protein powder does not make you test positive for marijuana.</v>

340
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:47.780
<v Speaker 3>It's completely non psychoactive.</v>

341
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 3>It's just a related to it or the male of the plan or whatever.</v>

342
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

343
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.753
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

344
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 3>we have to buy it from Canada.</v>

345
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.260
<v Speaker 3>We can't grow it here.</v>

346
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking so ridiculous.</v>

347
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 3>I guess because people would just grow.</v>

348
00:08:58.321 --> 00:08:59.140
<v Speaker 3>We'd go to it.</v>

349
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 3>I totally thought I was going home.</v>

350
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know.</v>

351
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.261
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear,</v>

352
00:09:02.261 --> 00:09:05.650
<v Speaker 4>I heard somebody already told me last night that somebody from Israel found out</v>

353
00:09:05.651 --> 00:09:09.490
<v Speaker 4>the way a way to take out like the highness out of marijuana.</v>

354
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.900
<v Speaker 4>So you're just getting the CBDS.</v>

355
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.660
<v Speaker 4>What a jerk.</v>

356
00:09:13.661 --> 00:09:15.220
<v Speaker 4>That rarely Jewish.</v>

357
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:16.810
<v Speaker 4>Why would,</v>

358
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:17.360
<v Speaker 4>why would it,</v>

359
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:17.650
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

360
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm just,</v>

361
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.431
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

362
00:09:18.431 --> 00:09:19.010
<v Speaker 4>I want to make.</v>

363
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.170
<v Speaker 4>We're not as fun.</v>

364
00:09:20.171 --> 00:09:21.700
<v Speaker 4>Instead of doing cancer research,</v>

365
00:09:21.701 --> 00:09:24.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna ruin everybody's fucking life.</v>

366
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.641
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

367
00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:25.280
<v Speaker 3>the idea,</v>

368
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:25.750
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

369
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.021
<v Speaker 3>is it.</v>

370
00:09:26.021 --> 00:09:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Some people just want to be healed from cancer,</v>

371
00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:28.870
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to get high,</v>

372
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 3>so you're like,</v>

373
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.050
<v Speaker 3>you'll be getting high is more important than your cancer.</v>

374
00:09:32.051 --> 00:09:32.884
<v Speaker 3>Silly,</v>

375
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:33.940
<v Speaker 3>but that's not true.</v>

376
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:34.631
<v Speaker 3>For some people.</v>

377
00:09:34.631 --> 00:09:35.830
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to get the paranoia.</v>

378
00:09:35.831 --> 00:09:37.060
<v Speaker 3>They just want to cure their diseases.</v>

379
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Combined.</v>

380
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Combined,</v>

381
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.550
<v Speaker 3>it combats nausea and lowers interocular pressure while coma.</v>

382
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.030
<v Speaker 3>That's why glaucoma patients ticket,</v>

383
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.953
<v Speaker 3>is that right?</v>

384
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.060
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

385
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.751
<v Speaker 3>that Hampshire,</v>

386
00:09:46.751 --> 00:09:47.800
<v Speaker 3>we've got to get it from Canada.</v>

387
00:09:47.801 --> 00:09:48.401
<v Speaker 3>It's not cheap,</v>

388
00:09:48.401 --> 00:09:49.720
<v Speaker 3>but if you buy a Blendtec blender,</v>

389
00:09:49.721 --> 00:09:50.554
<v Speaker 3>you get a free one.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I have a just a shitty.</v>

442
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm married to this method of doing commercials.</v>

443
00:11:08.171 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

444
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

445
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.470
<v Speaker 4>well sometimes it's okay,</v>

446
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:11.281
<v Speaker 4>but other times I'm like,</v>

447
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

448
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 4>this is 20 minutes of a commercial that we're not always.</v>

449
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:14.890
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

450
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:15.850
<v Speaker 3>conversations to.</v>

451
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

452
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 3>It would be nice if I could figure out how short net,</v>

453
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.600
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is then it weaves itself into conversations that would make like</v>

454
00:11:22.601 --> 00:11:23.434
<v Speaker 3>great podcasts.</v>

455
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.980
<v Speaker 3>We should just do commercials in the middle of the podcast.</v>

456
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

457
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:27.940
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great the way you do it.</v>

458
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Does anybody else do?</v>

459
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.153
<v Speaker 3>Most guys,</v>

460
00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.650
<v Speaker 3>they stop and read it in the middle of their podcasts.</v>

461
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I just people doing it.</v>

462
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.661
<v Speaker 3>I like the way you do it,</v>

463
00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:38.710
<v Speaker 3>which is organically get into it and the problem is sometimes it goes into other</v>

464
00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:39.461
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>

465
00:11:39.461 --> 00:11:41.230
<v Speaker 3>You don't want it to be a part of the commercial.</v>

466
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I liked that you believe in every product you endorsed.</v>

467
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Well that's where we're lucky as shit.</v>

468
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Not like an advertisement is what I mean.</v>

469
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.610
<v Speaker 3>The only things that we're we're being advertised by right now is all like,</v>

470
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:52.420
<v Speaker 3>like ting,</v>

471
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.830
<v Speaker 3>which was an awesome company.</v>

472
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.030
<v Speaker 2>No contracts the way we went with them because they're like,</v>

473
00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:58.871
<v Speaker 2>they use sprints,</v>

474
00:11:58.871 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 2>backbone,</v>

475
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 2>so they have like really good service,</v>

476
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 2>but you can just cancel.</v>

477
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't make joint accounts like you and I could share an account which</v>

478
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:06.244
<v Speaker 2>share minutes.</v>

479
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Speaker 2>If you don't use your minutes,</v>

480
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 2>like say if you use like what a lower priced thing would be instead of what you</v>

481
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:12.820
<v Speaker 2>paid for.</v>

482
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Well then you get discounted on your next bill.</v>

483
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like they are like super ethical and fair,</v>

484
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 2>so that's why we went with them.</v>

485
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 2>But when you,</v>

486
00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 2>when you're involved in a wow,</v>

487
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 2>like the podcast is weird enough as it is,</v>

488
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 2>so it's like big companies probably wouldn't want to get involved with it.</v>

489
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 2>So it allows you to choose from people that are like taking chances like the</v>

490
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 2>ting people or the people or.</v>

491
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.640
<v Speaker 2>I think what's really unique about it is the fact that you can,</v>

492
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.700
<v Speaker 2>you can pinpoint exactly who your niche audiences if you're talking to very</v>

493
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:44.410
<v Speaker 2>specific people that are gonna that are interested in it.</v>

494
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

495
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>

496
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:46.843
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

497
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

498
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 2>it changes that audience a little bit too as they see the excitement and other</v>

499
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:50.651
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

500
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

501
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Speaker 2>one of the cool things about hovering cool friends is that you get to find out</v>

502
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 2>about cool things and they're into that.</v>

503
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you didn't know.</v>

504
00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.800
<v Speaker 2>When you talk to somebody,</v>

505
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 2>like if you say like if you did not talk,</v>

506
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 2>if you never knew about Jujitsu and you were hanging out with Eddie Bravo and</v>

507
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:07.384
<v Speaker 2>then you just,</v>

508
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.330
<v Speaker 2>you really had no idea and you're talking to this guy and then all of a sudden</v>

509
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 2>he starts telling you about Jujitsu and when it's like you'd be like,</v>

510
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.560
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole thing I didn't even know about.</v>

511
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:15.394
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

512
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit like it.</v>

513
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.420
<v Speaker 2>It invigorates you and fires you up.</v>

514
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:19.600
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

515
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the biggest thing is like the one of the problems with staying in</v>

516
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:25.560
<v Speaker 2>one place your whole life is you limit your exposure to,</v>

517
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.463
<v Speaker 2>to everything.</v>

518
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.853
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays though,</v>

519
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 2>the good news is you can be in one place and expose yourself to everything if</v>

520
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:33.190
<v Speaker 2>you know where to look.</v>

521
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

522
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.990
<v Speaker 2>That never used to be the case.</v>

523
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.620
<v Speaker 2>The world is so much different now than when we were like getting out of high</v>

524
00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:41.090
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

525
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.710
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>

526
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not even.</v>

527
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like we were living in the dark age.</v>

528
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 2>It really is because you're constantly exposed a little bit.</v>

529
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at how wrestling was be in the eighties and then when the wall</v>

530
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:54.010
<v Speaker 2>came down in the eastern Europeans,</v>

531
00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 2>the Russians and they came over and shared all their secrets.</v>

532
00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Wrestling even at that high school level was so completely different.</v>

533
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:02.110
<v Speaker 2>A lot of ways than it was way back.</v>

534
00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:02.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

535
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:05.980
<v Speaker 2>as in certain things just didn't work or they had answers to so many different</v>

536
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:08.860
<v Speaker 2>things and wrestling technique and for that matter,</v>

537
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:13.120
<v Speaker 2>look at Jujitsu as everybody starts experimenting and stuff and there's direct</v>

538
00:14:13.121 --> 00:14:13.990
<v Speaker 2>access to it.</v>

539
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Things grow exponentially.</v>

540
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:16.570
<v Speaker 2>They get,</v>

541
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:17.291
<v Speaker 2>they seem to,</v>

542
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

543
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.420
<v Speaker 2>become more,</v>

544
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

545
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 2>exponentially complex.</v>

546
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:20.351
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

547
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 2>it makes our life better,</v>

548
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:22.600
<v Speaker 2>but I think it does well.</v>

549
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's unavoidable.</v>

550
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Just seems to be that's the way it just goes with everything.</v>

551
00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:29.710
<v Speaker 2>And there's great from the past and all endeavors,</v>

552
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:32.920
<v Speaker 2>but it standup comedy in fighting.</v>

553
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody from the past truly holds up.</v>

554
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.350
<v Speaker 2>I know if I look at like a Joe Lewis,</v>

555
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 2>and I imagine what would happen if Joe Lewis had a flight?</v>

556
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Vladimir Klitschko,</v>

557
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

558
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.293
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

559
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.240
<v Speaker 2>that's not.</v>

560
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Even though he's Klitschkos barely a human right,</v>

561
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:49.410
<v Speaker 2>and he's totally new species of humans,</v>

562
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

563
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Six foot seven,</v>

564
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.650
<v Speaker 2>250 pounds of shredded muscle.</v>

565
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Who's got a doctorate maybe to,</v>

566
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:58.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.050
<v Speaker 2>like smart as shit.</v>

568
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Overachiever,</v>

569
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.160
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Just completely boxing your face in,</v>

571
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

572
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.570
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take any stupid chances.</v>

573
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Just keeps fucking punching you in the face and you can't punch him.</v>

574
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.583
<v Speaker 2>Good Luck Joe.</v>

575
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Get out there and do it for America.</v>

576
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.440
<v Speaker 2>He's a Nazi.</v>

577
00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:13.274

578
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Go get them.</v>

579
00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:15.074
<v Speaker 2>Joe Lewis.</v>

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Joe Lewis will get fucked up,</v>

581
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:17.750
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

582
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.261
<v Speaker 2>The only guy.</v>

583
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a few guys like Ali of course would have been great in error.</v>

584
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:22.693
<v Speaker 2>Any error,</v>

585
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 2>but I always said that.</v>

586
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Put it Mike Tyson against Ali.</v>

587
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson would have stormed them.</v>

588
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.321
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

589
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 2>but what he said is this,</v>

590
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Ali said boxing.</v>

591
00:15:30.321 --> 00:15:30.771
<v Speaker 2>People will say,</v>

592
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:31.604
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

593
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Tyson would have gotten,</v>

594
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.390
<v Speaker 2>would a storm to maybe the first time because he's so powerful.</v>

595
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>

596
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.550
<v Speaker 2>When they fought the second time,</v>

597
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.030
<v Speaker 2>Ali would have figured them out that maybe,</v>

598
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:40.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

599
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 2>maybe the way by the way he'd be.</v>

600
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Remember Ali took,</v>

601
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:46.220
<v Speaker 2>it was 220 pounds,</v>

602
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:46.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

603
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Which is a big man without lifting a big man.</v>

604
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:49.611
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

605
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:50.360
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

606
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.140
<v Speaker 2>he also fought I think nine rounds against frazier with a broken jaw.</v>

607
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.260
<v Speaker 2>The dude could take punish.</v>

608
00:15:56.261 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 2>That was Ken Norton.</v>

609
00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

610
00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.413
<v Speaker 2>But if you watch,</v>

611
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.610
<v Speaker 2>if you watch what frazier didn't,</v>

612
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 2>those amazing fights.</v>

613
00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

614
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.421
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

615
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:06.810
<v Speaker 2>and the hooks and just landing in his face and he just kept fighting and he took</v>

616
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.400
<v Speaker 2>into such incredible punishment and I think his ability to kind of rope and,</v>

617
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.780
<v Speaker 2>and move with shots with a huge part of it for sure.</v>

618
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Smarter than anybody and got into your head,</v>

619
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:17.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

620
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.470
<v Speaker 2>look what he did to Sonny Liston.</v>

621
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 2>He realized something listened was the strongest man in the world.</v>

622
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.700
<v Speaker 2>They said the one thing sending listens,</v>

623
00:16:21.701 --> 00:16:23.330
<v Speaker 2>afraid of is a crazy person.</v>

624
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Sonny's afraid of gravel,</v>

625
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.611
<v Speaker 2>crazy person.</v>

626
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:26.041
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>

627
00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 2>when he did that weigh in,</v>

628
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.740
<v Speaker 2>sunny actually said,</v>

629
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.441
<v Speaker 2>keep them away from me.</v>

630
00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I think he's going to bite me.</v>

631
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.260
<v Speaker 2>He was afraid he was going to get bit.</v>

632
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I just think skill wise,</v>

633
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I think Ali was great,</v>

634
00:16:35.931 --> 00:16:38.930
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the Ali from like the Joe Frazier fight on,</v>

635
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.490
<v Speaker 2>if you compare that guy to Tyson when he was against like say Michael spinks</v>

636
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 2>when he was just the ultimate destroyer,</v>

637
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 2>he was just too.</v>

638
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.920
<v Speaker 2>He was too blindingly fast and a really good box,</v>

639
00:16:48.921 --> 00:16:50.180
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably fast.</v>

640
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:52.990
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing that people missed and the whole thing and they were like his</v>

641
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.391
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

642
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Of course he had great power,</v>

643
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.450
<v Speaker 2>but it was the way he delivered it.</v>

644
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.490
<v Speaker 2>He delivered it like half as fast,</v>

645
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.391
<v Speaker 2>like really?</v>

646
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Like he was twice as fast as like the Tony tubs is of the world of the Pink</v>

647
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Lynn.</v>

648
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Tom.</v>

649
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.121
<v Speaker 2>He fought,</v>

650
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:05.661
<v Speaker 2>raised her run.</v>

651
00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 2>I can raise a Ruckus is the biggest,</v>

652
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.460
<v Speaker 2>strongest looking man.</v>

653
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

654
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:10.610
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

655
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.200
<v Speaker 2>He was hitting him in the forehead with,</v>

656
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.480
<v Speaker 2>with hooks and sending him like,</v>

657
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.120
<v Speaker 2>like for sitting down in the air,</v>

658
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:19.680
<v Speaker 2>like fool now now run a got back up.</v>

659
00:17:19.681 --> 00:17:20.630
<v Speaker 2>But finding the ref was like,</v>

660
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm stopping this because somebody's going to lose their brain.</v>

661
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:25.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

662
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:30.041
<v Speaker 2>He was like a few years where he was just unbelievably good.</v>

663
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's the case with basketball.</v>

664
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the case with baseball.</v>

665
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the case with all sports that everything just gets better and it's</v>

666
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.810
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating and training techniques,</v>

667
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.640
<v Speaker 2>not just steroids.</v>

668
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

669
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.680
<v Speaker 2>that's the big designer drugs when they can jean dope,</v>

670
00:17:45.681 --> 00:17:46.720
<v Speaker 2>you wonder what you're.</v>

671
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.950
<v Speaker 2>You know you're going to have 400 pound Predator nationally athletes,</v>

672
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.500
<v Speaker 2>so then it becomes 100 percent.</v>

673
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.101
<v Speaker 2>It's on the way.</v>

674
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:53.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait.</v>

675
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.050
<v Speaker 2>They're going to keep getting bigger.</v>

676
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Like if you ever met like a real giant pro football player and say I saw a real</v>

677
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.160
<v Speaker 2>law who was really rowdy and he was like at this club in Phoenix,</v>

678
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 2>and it was like a guy who's around a bunch of kids who will just like,</v>

679
00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:06.331
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

684
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Almost like a silver back on that.</v>

685
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

686
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.560
<v Speaker 2>He was gigantic.</v>

687
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.550
<v Speaker 2>The dude was at least 400 pounds and he wasn't fat athletic.</v>

688
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:17.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

689
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:18.330

<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that's a fucking man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Because he was a big dude.</v>

729
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.060
<v Speaker 2>He moved like a cat.</v>

730
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:13.740
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

731
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.960
<v Speaker 2>He was Tom Erickson,</v>

732
00:19:14.961 --> 00:19:15.880
<v Speaker 2>who was just speaking a big</v>

733
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:18.821
<v Speaker 2>Russian guy.</v>

734
00:19:18.821 --> 00:19:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm the wolf man.</v>

735
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Carolyn.</v>

736
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:21.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

737
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.380
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

738
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:21.491
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

739
00:19:21.491 --> 00:19:21.660
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

740
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:21.811
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

741
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:22.644
<v Speaker 2>Forget him.</v>

742
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.760
<v Speaker 2>That guy's legendary.</v>

743
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.160
<v Speaker 2>The last time we lost,</v>

744
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.890
<v Speaker 2>he was 16 years old and then a rulon gardner beat him by based on one of the</v>

745
00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:29.461
<v Speaker 2>mistakes you've made.</v>

746
00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:30.480
<v Speaker 2>I saw the match.</v>

747
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:30.701
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

748
00:19:30.701 --> 00:19:31.230
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

749
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.500
<v Speaker 2>That was like a new rule when you get a guy to separate their hands.</v>

750
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.800
<v Speaker 2>It's one point when he won the Olympic gold against,</v>

751
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:38.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

752
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

753
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.590
<v Speaker 2>with the Persian American,</v>

754
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.810
<v Speaker 2>a wrestler who was that who would wrestle him 19 times.</v>

755
00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:43.644
<v Speaker 2>I've never beat him.</v>

756
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.120
<v Speaker 2>And as he was winning the gold,</v>

757
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.970
<v Speaker 2>he had him and he was whispering in his ear,</v>

758
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.080
<v Speaker 2>he was whispering and essentially English saying,</v>

759
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.520
<v Speaker 2>you can never beat me.</v>

760
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not possible for you to beat me to saying,</v>

761
00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:57.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

762
00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.610
<v Speaker 2>So something like that.</v>

763
00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:01.130
<v Speaker 2>And if you see when,</v>

764
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.490
<v Speaker 2>when they are awesome,</v>

765
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.300
<v Speaker 2>when he's,</v>

766
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.920
<v Speaker 2>when he had the silver medal and he did meet and he had a silver medal in the</v>

767
00:20:06.921 --> 00:20:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Olympics and he's up there and somebody gave me,</v>

768
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.010
<v Speaker 2>gave me his name and he's crying.</v>

769
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.520
<v Speaker 2>He's crying because he just realizes that no matter what he did,</v>

770
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:15.990
<v Speaker 2>no matter how hard he trains,</v>

771
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.340
<v Speaker 2>there is that man named corral and that he will never beat.</v>

772
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.520
<v Speaker 2>He was born.</v>

773
00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 2>He was 15 pounds six for 305 pounds.</v>

774
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.840
<v Speaker 2>That's how much you weighed.</v>

775
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.290
<v Speaker 2>He trained</v>

776
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.850
<v Speaker 2>in Siberia.</v>

777
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 2>The fuck is that.</v>

778
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.590
<v Speaker 2>While he was 15 pounds when he was born and he has small parents,</v>

779
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.580
<v Speaker 2>his parents were splitting,</v>

780
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.440
<v Speaker 2>I think his grandfather or someone was a,</v>

781
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:38.191
<v Speaker 2>was a bear,</v>

782
00:20:38.191 --> 00:20:38.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

783
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:39.330
<v Speaker 2>some giant guy.</v>

784
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Carolyn was also me and a very,</v>

785
00:20:41.641 --> 00:20:42.870
<v Speaker 2>very serious competitor.</v>

786
00:20:42.871 --> 00:20:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Like a main competitor would not lose.</v>

787
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:45.831
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

788
00:20:45.831 --> 00:20:46.021
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

789
00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:48.520
<v Speaker 2>And would play games you and talk to you.</v>

790
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.080
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

791
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.200
<v Speaker 2>you know why he got really why he got really famous and we started hearing about</v>

792
00:20:53.201 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 2>him is he would suplex people and break their necks.</v>

793
00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:01.020
<v Speaker 2>He'd suplex you and drop you on your neck and that's where people were just so</v>

794
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:03.520
<v Speaker 2>afraid of him and he was just too strong.</v>

795
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.780
<v Speaker 2>He would get guys.</v>

796
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:09.340
<v Speaker 2>They would literally completely flattened themselves out on the mat to try to</v>

797
00:21:09.341 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 2>resist being taken down.</v>

798
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even try to scramble because if he scrambled and he caught you in</v>

799
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:14.771
<v Speaker 2>the scramble,</v>

800
00:21:14.771 --> 00:21:17.890
<v Speaker 2>he'd have you elevated and just fucking pile drive you on your head.</v>

801
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

802
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:23.350
<v Speaker 2>He would pick them up as they were flattening up and he was 300 plus pound men</v>

803
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.680
<v Speaker 2>and from like a lying down 300 pound man to be able to pick him up with a gable</v>

804
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:31.600
<v Speaker 2>grip and hoist him up in the air.</v>

805
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Most people have no idea how strong you'd have to be so weird.</v>

806
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Like you would have a hard time doing that with a small child.</v>

807
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Like most people would have a hard time,</v>

808
00:21:41.221 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 2>but he was also very flexible.</v>

809
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:43.490
<v Speaker 2>He was also like,</v>

810
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.340
<v Speaker 2>he was just a huge mongoose.</v>

811
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.001
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

812
00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:49.390
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't like a big stupid like power lifter looking due to.</v>

813
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:50.224
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't move.</v>

814
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:50.861
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

815
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:55.480
<v Speaker 2>he was like a big giant was all back back and traps in relation to his chest.</v>

816
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't bodybuilder,</v>

817
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.930
<v Speaker 2>his knees and his hips and his.</v>

818
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a famous photo of him hoisting a guy up in the air and he's just got</v>

819
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:04.570
<v Speaker 2>this look of rage and he.</v>

820
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.910
<v Speaker 2>He's so terrible.</v>

821
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:11.130
<v Speaker 2>It just like embodied those Cold War Olympics where everybody was afraid of the</v>

822
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.303
<v Speaker 2>Russian</v>

823
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.393
<v Speaker 2>champagne.</v>

824
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.281
<v Speaker 2>Shut it down.</v>

825
00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:17.560
<v Speaker 2>He was like the real draco but better.</v>

826
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:18.700
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

827
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 2>There's a fault.</v>

828
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 2>I got to pull up this photo.</v>

829
00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I think our boy,</v>

830
00:22:21.511 --> 00:22:22.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

831

00:22:25.331 --> 00:22:26.830
<v Speaker 2>the great Russian MMA fighter.</v>

837
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fit fit or this or he has a little of that,</v>

838
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.530
<v Speaker 2>but he's like a little bit more.</v>

839
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.180
<v Speaker 2>He's not as.</v>

840
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.013
<v Speaker 2>Or is it different?</v>

841
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.913
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing.</v>

842
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:35.411
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

00:23:26.951 --> 00:23:27.790

879
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy was ridiculously busy.</v>

881
00:23:31.691 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 2>strongest man in the world.</v>

00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:17.340

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.193
<v Speaker 6>look at that.</v>

963
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.210

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.530
<v Speaker 6>What is he saying?</v>

965
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:26.423
<v Speaker 6>Lord,</v>

966
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.291
<v Speaker 6>Lord,</v>

967
00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:30.990
<v Speaker 6>I'm producing estrogens are insane.</v>

968
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.060
<v Speaker 6>That's insane how big his legs guys.</v>

969
00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:35.410
<v Speaker 6>But Dude,</v>

970
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:39.300
<v Speaker 6>that poor guy is going to a ragdoll mid,</v>

971
00:25:39.301 --> 00:25:40.140
<v Speaker 6>poor that poor guy.</v>

972
00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:40.410
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

973
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:40.830
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

974
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:41.820
<v Speaker 6>So here's the question,</v>

975
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.690
<v Speaker 6>what is he a 100 percent roids like there's something going on there.</v>

976
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.920
<v Speaker 6>I think I would suggest that it's genetic.</v>

977
00:25:49.921 --> 00:25:53.940
<v Speaker 6>If you're born at 15 pounds and if you look at our proportion is body is and the</v>

978
00:25:53.941 --> 00:25:55.110
<v Speaker 6>amount of training he does.</v>

979
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.260
<v Speaker 6>There are people out there that are genetic freaks that don't need steroids.</v>

980
00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:58.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

981
00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.011
<v Speaker 6>But you know what?</v>

982
00:25:59.011 --> 00:25:59.641
<v Speaker 6>I bet it is.</v>

983
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:01.920
<v Speaker 6>I bet it's both because this was Russia.</v>

984
00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.780
<v Speaker 6>Russia was not fucking around back then.</v>

985
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.090
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

986
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:04.500
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

987
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.320
<v Speaker 6>we had victor content on the podcast and one of the things that he was talking</v>

988
00:26:07.321 --> 00:26:11.370
<v Speaker 6>about is that the elephant in the room when it comes to women's track and field</v>

989
00:26:11.371 --> 00:26:14.580
<v Speaker 6>is that there was a period of time where before they were testing were they</v>

990
00:26:14.581 --> 00:26:18.390
<v Speaker 6>still cannot achieve the results that these eastern bloc women got.</v>

991
00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:18.901
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

992
00:26:18.901 --> 00:26:19.141
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

993
00:26:19.141 --> 00:26:22.980
<v Speaker 6>Like this world records and no one comes close when they win the Olympics every</v>

994
00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:23.280
<v Speaker 6>year.</v>

995
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.113
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>

996
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:24.421
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

997
00:26:24.421 --> 00:26:25.141
<v Speaker 6>they just can't.</v>

998
00:26:25.141 --> 00:26:27.120
<v Speaker 6>They can't achieve what these men,</v>

999
00:26:27.121 --> 00:26:27.930
<v Speaker 6>women did.</v>

1000
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:31.430
<v Speaker 6>So because they just a matter of record or it's just what their times,</v>

1001
00:26:31.431 --> 00:26:32.530
<v Speaker 6>their ties to the top.</v>

1002
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.860
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1003
00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.693
<v Speaker 6>the Times they,</v>

1004
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.940
<v Speaker 6>the Times that they had from 10,</v>

1005
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.300
<v Speaker 6>20 years ago from whatever it was were they weren't testing with these women</v>

1006
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:43.390
<v Speaker 6>that times were stronger than they are today in the Olympics that they are</v>

1007
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 6>behind</v>

1008
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.220
<v Speaker 3>the gold metal or behind the world.</v>

1009
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Brexit,</v>

1010
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 3>no idea about that.</v>

1011
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.121
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1012
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:50.220
<v Speaker 3>he said it's 100 percent because they were taking steroids.</v>

1013
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.330
<v Speaker 3>He was a fascinating guy to have on because he fucking saw the whole thing</v>

1014
00:26:54.331 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 3>happened from the ground up.</v>

1015
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:56.191
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1016
00:26:56.191 --> 00:27:00.240
<v Speaker 3>he saw people like experimenting with all these different supplements and you</v>

1017
00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:00.421
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1018
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:00.611
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1019
00:27:00.611 --> 00:27:01.940
<v Speaker 3>he saw and he,</v>

1020
00:27:01.941 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 3>and he's seen track and field athletes like all the sudden get unbelievably</v>

1021
00:27:06.871 --> 00:27:07.201
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1022
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Like within a year.</v>

1023
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:09.360
<v Speaker 3>And everybody was suspicious.</v>

1024
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.980
<v Speaker 3>She's a perfect example,</v>

1026
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.490
<v Speaker 3>but he's a,</v>

1027
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:12.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1028
00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.760
<v Speaker 3>he's of the opinion that they all do it.</v>

1029
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Especially track and field.</v>

1030
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 3>He said all those guys are on something.</v>

1031
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.270
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1032
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:18.451
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1033
00:27:18.451 --> 00:27:18.561
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1034
00:27:18.561 --> 00:27:18.931
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1035
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:20.460
<v Speaker 7>one of the raises the question too,</v>

1036
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:23.460
<v Speaker 7>because they took two of the top fastest guys in the world,</v>

1037
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:25.770
<v Speaker 7>I think it was Justin Gatlin and then Maurice Greene.</v>

1038
00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:26.604
<v Speaker 7>I think those are.</v>

1039
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.070
<v Speaker 7>And what they found was that he was talking about steroids and he said,</v>

1040
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:29.860
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

1041
00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:34.410
<v Speaker 7>the Maurice Greene naturally has 800 grams or 600 grams of protein,</v>

1042
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.490
<v Speaker 7>would not grams a 600,</v>

1043
00:27:36.491 --> 00:27:37.220
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1044
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:37.860
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1045
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:42.860
<v Speaker 7>whatever that measurement per per gram of blood at 800 you're testosterone at.</v>

1046
00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.980
<v Speaker 7>Whereas someone like Justin Gatlin has 400,</v>

1047
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.460
<v Speaker 7>so naturally occurring,</v>

1048
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.620
<v Speaker 7>some people have just more testosterone and usually guys were faster and stuff</v>

1049
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.390
<v Speaker 7>stronger.</v>

1050
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:51.711
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1051
00:27:51.711 --> 00:27:52.081
<v Speaker 7>we'll then,</v>

1052
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:53.070
<v Speaker 7>what does that say about.</v>

1053
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.330
<v Speaker 7>So if that's the case,</v>

1054
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.080
<v Speaker 7>is it a fair competition or can this other guy take hormone replacement therapy</v>

1055
00:27:58.081 --> 00:27:59.990
<v Speaker 7>and bring his up to $800 right there.</v>

1056
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.650
<v Speaker 7>There's where you get into these weird,</v>

1057
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.100
<v Speaker 7>weird questions that the,</v>

1058
00:28:03.101 --> 00:28:05.340
<v Speaker 7>the argument for steroids,</v>

1059
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 7>you can eat foods that increase your testosterone.</v>

1060
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.390
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1061
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.080
<v Speaker 7>so they do it very marginally.</v>

1062
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 7>Maybe,</v>

1063
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 7>but so where do we draw the line?</v>

1064
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.940
<v Speaker 7>Like if the technology exists,</v>

1065
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:15.350
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

1066
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.590
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

1067
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:16.470
<v Speaker 7>it's a murky,</v>

1068
00:28:16.471 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 7>it's a murky issue,</v>

1069
00:28:17.371 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1070
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.780
<v Speaker 3>It does get murky.</v>

1071
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:20.670
<v Speaker 3>If you want to consider a level playing field,</v>

1072
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.310
<v Speaker 3>there is no level playing field because we have ectomorphs,</v>

1073
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:28.340
<v Speaker 3>endomorphs and Meza more's being the body types of ectomorphs are ones who are</v>

1074
00:28:28.391 --> 00:28:28.861
<v Speaker 3>really skinny.</v>

1075
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:30.530
<v Speaker 3>You can't gain any weight endomorph,</v>

1076
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.900
<v Speaker 3>so the really fat ones have a hard time losing weight or Mesomorphs are those</v>

1077
00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Wesley Snipes looking dudes?</v>

1078
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Just look.</v>

1079
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.890
<v Speaker 3>Just ripped and muscular.</v>

1080
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.580
<v Speaker 3>You look at Mike Tyson,</v>

1081
00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 3>classic Mesomorph,</v>

1082
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1083
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.320
<v Speaker 3>classically muscular.</v>

1084
00:28:44.321 --> 00:28:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:49.270
<v Speaker 3>That certain people that just Bruno Shapes for Cheick Kongo,</v>

1086
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 3>the extreme force,</v>

1087
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.780
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1088
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1089
00:28:52.201 --> 00:28:52.451
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1090
00:28:52.451 --> 00:28:53.071
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

1091
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Some people can never achieve that physical frame.</v>

1092
00:28:55.591 --> 00:28:56.011
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

1093
00:28:56.011 --> 00:28:57.090
<v Speaker 3>they can't naturally.</v>

1094
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.360
<v Speaker 3>So what is the what if a pill came along and all of a sudden you turn some dude</v>

1095
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:03.594
<v Speaker 3>who's got</v>

1096
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Ralphie may's genetics and all of a sudden</v>

1097
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.570
<v Speaker 7>the problem then becomes that competition is all about the best chemist.</v>

1098
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.290
<v Speaker 7>I can understand the argument steroids because total now that we all know that</v>

1099
00:29:16.291 --> 00:29:16.891
<v Speaker 7>human beings,</v>

1100
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:17.750
<v Speaker 7>if they want to win something,</v>

1101
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.020
<v Speaker 7>they'll do everything including sacrifice their own health to get to a point in</v>

1102
00:29:21.021 --> 00:29:21.390
<v Speaker 7>time,</v>

1103
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.620
<v Speaker 3>but then there's a guy like chlorella and it doesn't matter what the fuck you</v>

1104
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.961
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1105
00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:28.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's certain dudes where there's so much of a physical gift.</v>

1106
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.630
<v Speaker 3>It's almost impossible for you to overcome it.</v>

1107
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.540
<v Speaker 3>There's that.</v>

1108
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:33.811
<v Speaker 3>There's a level,</v>

1109
00:29:33.811 --> 00:29:36.060
<v Speaker 3>like the idea is that if a person is super athletic,</v>

1110
00:29:36.061 --> 00:29:37.260
<v Speaker 3>that can't be smart as well.</v>

1111
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.250
<v Speaker 3>That's not true,</v>

1112
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.263
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately.</v>

1113
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately that guy can fuck you and probably beat you in chess.</v>

1114
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Chess,</v>

1115
00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1116
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 3>It's just because someone is big and athletic,</v>

1117
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:48.810
<v Speaker 3>like that's a terrifying thing for someone.</v>

1118
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:53.820
<v Speaker 3>Someone who's intellectually dual them and still kick their ass and named Mark</v>

1119
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.370
<v Speaker 3>Court told me that GSP is a great chess player,</v>

1120
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.050
<v Speaker 3>like a phenomenal chess player.</v>

1121
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.390
<v Speaker 3>GSP is an unusual human being.</v>

1122
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.260
<v Speaker 3>He's very,</v>

1123
00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:03.280
<v Speaker 3>very bright guy.</v>

1124
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.110
<v Speaker 3>He's very open and honest.</v>

1125
00:30:05.111 --> 00:30:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Like he's one of the rare fighters.</v>

1126
00:30:06.241 --> 00:30:08.860
<v Speaker 3>It talks about being scared and you know what went through his head.</v>

1127
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1128
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:09.941
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1130
00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:10.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1131
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1132
00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.230
<v Speaker 3>like about what makes them insecure and apparently he's got this crazy thing</v>

1133
00:30:14.231 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 3>about aliens.</v>

1134
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

1135
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1136
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:17.171
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1137
00:30:17.171 --> 00:30:18.004
<v Speaker 3>He's uh,</v>

1138
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.320
<v Speaker 3>he's terrified about aliens.</v>

1139
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:24.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm finding him in the middle of the night and abducting him,</v>

1140
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.300
<v Speaker 3>but there are other things to worry about.</v>

1141
00:30:25.301 --> 00:30:30.301
<v Speaker 3>Georgia has a path to get out of his house in case of the len come to my house.</v>

1142
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 3>He's got to be kidding.</v>

1143
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:33.521
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1144
00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:33.731
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1145
00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 3>He really is obsessed with aliens.</v>

1146
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1147
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1149
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:36.551
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1150
00:30:36.551 --> 00:30:39.190
<v Speaker 3>It's so much so that they filmed a lot of shit and they wouldn't even use it in</v>

1151
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:39.851
<v Speaker 3>the countdown show.</v>

1152
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who didn't like it.</v>

1153
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Dana or someone,</v>

1154
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:42.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1155
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.010
<v Speaker 3>someone made a joke</v>

1156
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 3>about it and it tell you about everything.</v>

1157
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.560
<v Speaker 3>I think it's ridiculous to not leave it in because I think it's another little</v>

1158
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:51.610
<v Speaker 3>layer and the guy's cake.</v>

1159
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:52.750
<v Speaker 3>The guys that used to look,</v>

1160
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 3>he is a bonafide bad motherfucker and anybody who thinks he isn't a bad</v>

1161
00:30:56.921 --> 00:31:00.110
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker because he is scared to death.</v>

1162
00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:01.900
<v Speaker 3>It's so silly.</v>

1163
00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:03.090
<v Speaker 3>He's George fucking cop.</v>

1164
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.360
<v Speaker 3>I let him tell his story.</v>

1165
00:31:04.361 --> 00:31:05.560
<v Speaker 3>It's probably interesting.</v>

1166
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.500
<v Speaker 3>The aliens come from me in the middle of the night,</v>

1167
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1168
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 3>I've had my acl repair.</v>

1169
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:12.120
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1170
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:12.341
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

1171
00:31:12.341 --> 00:31:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I hear through the grapevine that Mr Nick Diaz,</v>

1172
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:15.130
<v Speaker 3>who I love,</v>

1173
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:19.330
<v Speaker 3>but my favorite fighter and a lot of ways he wants to fight Mr Anderson Silva.</v>

1174
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:20.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1175
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:20.450
<v Speaker 3>he'll fight.</v>

1176
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Anybody fight fate or he'll fight anybody who doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1177
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 3>He's a real fighter sting match.</v>

1178
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:27.080
<v Speaker 3>I think that</v>

1179
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Anderson would kick it,</v>

1180
00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.090
<v Speaker 3>kick him in the face and all that,</v>

1181
00:31:31.091 --> 00:31:31.940
<v Speaker 3>but it did.</v>

1182
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 3>He's not afraid of his boxing.</v>

1183
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:34.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean he boxes a lot and I.</v>

1184
00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:39.820
<v Speaker 3>It seems like he would be a guy who could certainly stand and trade as opposed</v>

1185
00:31:40.301 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 3>to him Damien Maia and and or forest griffin doing with Anderson.</v>

1186
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.930
<v Speaker 3>I think that if anybody could actually,</v>

1187
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:50.470
<v Speaker 3>who's a pure boxer who trains with real boxers and is a pretty good boxer,</v>

1188
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:51.221
<v Speaker 3>he might.</v>

1189
00:31:51.221 --> 00:31:54.040
<v Speaker 3>He might be able to answer ideas first of all,</v>

1190
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.950
<v Speaker 3>takes an unbelievable shot and he could take a hell of a shot.</v>

1191
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.510
<v Speaker 3>He's super determined.</v>

1192
00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.531
<v Speaker 3>No one's got wind.</v>

1193
00:31:59.531 --> 00:31:59.951
<v Speaker 3>Liked him.</v>

1194
00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:02.080
<v Speaker 3>His endurance is preposterous.</v>

1195
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Endurance is completely preposterous.</v>

1196
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:06.680
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

1197
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.080
<v Speaker 3>his endurance is preposterous.</v>

1198
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.650
<v Speaker 3>It is flip your swims back from Alcatraz for like a Goof,</v>

1199
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.210
<v Speaker 3>so we're getting the ocean and swims from Alcatraz,</v>

1200
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.680
<v Speaker 3>like his endurance is freakish and that's one of his,</v>

1201
00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.010
<v Speaker 3>one of his strengths and everybody's got to be scared of that shit.</v>

1202
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.960
<v Speaker 3>But Anderson's never showed endurance problems.</v>

1203
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.690
<v Speaker 3>He tapped Chilson in the fifth round of a fight.</v>

1204
00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:28.900
<v Speaker 3>He was getting his ass kicked in so he's never had insurance problems.</v>

1205
00:32:28.901 --> 00:32:31.750
<v Speaker 3>But I think that Nick Diaz is,</v>

1206
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.780
<v Speaker 3>he's a difficult to do to crack.</v>

1207
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:35.201
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1208
00:32:35.201 --> 00:32:37.780
<v Speaker 3>like you look at like really good start because like Paul Daley,</v>

1209
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Paul Dale is a dangerous fucking strike.</v>

1210
00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:40.760
<v Speaker 3>Decided to stand and trade with him.</v>

1211
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:41.500
<v Speaker 3>He's a much better rest.</v>

1212
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 3>I haven't standard trade on.</v>

1213
00:32:42.621 --> 00:32:43.610
<v Speaker 3>By the way you hit me with a left.</v>

1214
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>

1215
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.740
<v Speaker 3>He goes down,</v>

1216
00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.060
<v Speaker 3>gets up,</v>

1217
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Bang with the left will not only that,</v>

1218
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.390
<v Speaker 3>such a true fighter and I'm on the ground and nick is so good at wrapping you up</v>

1219
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:51.860
<v Speaker 3>and you have to look after that armbar man.</v>

1220
00:32:51.861 --> 00:32:52.700
<v Speaker 3>That shit comes quick.</v>

1221
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:54.710
<v Speaker 3>He caught Cyborg and an Armbar Cyborg.</v>

1222
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:55.221
<v Speaker 3>Never saw that.</v>

1223
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Common Cyborg was blast and him would lead.</v>

1224
00:32:57.621 --> 00:32:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Kicks to,</v>

1225
00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:58.913
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't matter.</v>

1226
00:32:59.000 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1227
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.940
<v Speaker 3>it was almost like he was just holding off the charge.</v>

1228
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:02.990
<v Speaker 3>Who just holding off the time.</v>

1229
00:33:02.991 --> 00:33:03.531
<v Speaker 3>We'll get you.</v>

1230
00:33:03.531 --> 00:33:04.364
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna get.</v>

1231
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:04.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

1232
00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Get some finally Cyborg.</v>

1233
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Like the pressure of constantly coming at him.</v>

1234
00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:09.741
<v Speaker 3>So I've walked into,</v>

1235
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:10.340
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

1236
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Kim down in nick had them arm barred and like,</v>

1237
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:13.243
<v Speaker 3>no time.</v>

1238
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1239
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Speaker 3>he's an interesting dude.</v>

1240
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.523
<v Speaker 3>Physically,</v>

1241
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.310
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1242
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.600
<v Speaker 3>he's smaller than Anderson,</v>

1243
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:18.434
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

1244
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:18.771
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1245
00:33:18.771 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 3>he's fought at 55.</v>

1246
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.891
<v Speaker 3>He's got to walk around.</v>

1247
00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:22.724
<v Speaker 3>What is it about six one?</v>

1248
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Dick is at least six feet tall.</v>

1249
00:33:24.951 --> 00:33:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Six 1:10.</v>

1250
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1251
00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.110
<v Speaker 3>he ways he walks around.</v>

1252
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.270
<v Speaker 3>And what do you think?</v>

1253
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:29.751
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1254
00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:30.710
<v Speaker 3>He's pretty healthy,</v>

1255
00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:33.450
<v Speaker 3>so he's not the type of dude that would gain a lot of ways.</v>

1256
00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 3>He definitely never gets fat.</v>

1257
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.760
<v Speaker 3>He's like very strict.</v>

1258
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.613
<v Speaker 3>This diet.</v>

1259
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.410
<v Speaker 3>I think he's mostly Vegan.</v>

1260
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:42.430
<v Speaker 3>He's drinking Kombucha all the time telling me that.</v>

1261
00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to start doing the Nick Diaz Diet.</v>

1262
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:44.991
<v Speaker 3>Well listen man,</v>

1263
00:33:44.991 --> 00:33:48.380
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to guys like rich roll or any of these like ultra endurance guys</v>

1264
00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:49.020
<v Speaker 3>like you know there's,</v>

1265
00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.760
<v Speaker 3>there's no better way to keep your body energized and constantly eating fresh</v>

1266
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:53.421
<v Speaker 3>vegetables,</v>

1267
00:33:53.421 --> 00:33:53.751
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>

1268
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:54.021
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>

1269
00:33:54.021 --> 00:33:54.920
<v Speaker 3>high carbohydrate,</v>

1270
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.630
<v Speaker 3>complex carbide.</v>

1271
00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:57.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1272
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't think for ultimate performance though,</v>

1273
00:33:59.851 --> 00:34:01.670
<v Speaker 3>for especially explosive performance,</v>

1274
00:34:01.671 --> 00:34:04.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you get the same results according to scientists.</v>

1275
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.481
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1276
00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 3>the people that have actually done studies shows that there really are some</v>

1277
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:09.650
<v Speaker 3>benefits to a complete.</v>

1278
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:11.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a complete protein.</v>

1279
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:12.563
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1280
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.760
<v Speaker 7>The thing about being a Vegan as you can get your protein,</v>

1281
00:34:14.761 --> 00:34:15.594
<v Speaker 7>but it,</v>

1282
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.310
<v Speaker 7>I think the proteins at the end of the day or whenever they start to cohesion,</v>

1283
00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:21.570
<v Speaker 7>they sort of can't.</v>

1284
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.910
<v Speaker 7>They pick up where the other ones left off.</v>

1285
00:34:23.911 --> 00:34:27.600
<v Speaker 7>So beans are one nuts have protein in and you had enough of that you'll get a</v>

1286
00:34:27.601 --> 00:34:28.351
<v Speaker 7>complete protein,</v>

1287
00:34:28.351 --> 00:34:31.980
<v Speaker 7>but meat is a very calorie dense energy dense,</v>

1288
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.600
<v Speaker 7>a complete protein.</v>

1289
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.550
<v Speaker 7>It's just better and most.</v>

1290
00:34:35.551 --> 00:34:35.881
<v Speaker 7>By the way,</v>

1291
00:34:35.881 --> 00:34:37.080
<v Speaker 7>most most cultures,</v>

1292
00:34:37.081 --> 00:34:38.760
<v Speaker 7>and you know this from the guy you had on,</v>

1293
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.470
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure he talked about it with the Paleo Diet,</v>

1294
00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:41.820
<v Speaker 7>most hunter gatherer cultures,</v>

1295
00:34:41.821 --> 00:34:42.720
<v Speaker 7>the way we came up,</v>

1296
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.430
<v Speaker 7>we were strictly carnivores.</v>

1297
00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:45.080
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1298
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.320
<v Speaker 7>if you look at where we went hunting,</v>

1299
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:47.850
<v Speaker 7>try planting anything there,</v>

1300
00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:52.020
<v Speaker 7>you would have had to live off animal protein</v>

1301
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.913
<v Speaker 3>for the most part.</v>

1302
00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.970
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of parts.</v>

1303
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.530
<v Speaker 3>We were in Montana,</v>

1304
00:34:55.531 --> 00:34:56.520
<v Speaker 3>we went hunting for this,</v>

1305
00:34:56.521 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1306
00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.780
<v Speaker 3>Steven Rinella show.</v>

1307
00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.700
<v Speaker 3>It's called the mediator.</v>

1308
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.580
<v Speaker 3>And the mediator is his second show.</v>

1309
00:35:02.581 --> 00:35:04.080
<v Speaker 3>He had this other show that was on,</v>

1310
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.143
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1311
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it was on the travel channel.</v>

1312
00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:08.370
<v Speaker 3>It's called the wild within.</v>

1313
00:35:08.371 --> 00:35:08.971
<v Speaker 3>It was really cool.</v>

1314
00:35:08.971 --> 00:35:09.751
<v Speaker 3>Show where you go,</v>

1315
00:35:09.751 --> 00:35:12.480
<v Speaker 3>like he went where Lewis and Clark went and the,</v>

1316
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1317
00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.200
<v Speaker 3>a shot a moose and made a boat out of the Moose and fucking shot loose with a</v>

1318
00:35:16.201 --> 00:35:18.210
<v Speaker 3>musket and made a boat out of the Moose.</v>

1319
00:35:18.211 --> 00:35:18.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1320
00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:18.601
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1321
00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:18.851
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1322
00:35:18.851 --> 00:35:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I like the way they would have done it.</v>

1323
00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:20.910
<v Speaker 3>It was really interesting.</v>

1324
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.290
<v Speaker 3>I make a bone out of a moose.</v>

1325
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.060
<v Speaker 3>So Brian and I went hunting with them.</v>

1326
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.190
<v Speaker 3>We went to a,</v>

1327
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.270
<v Speaker 3>I talked about it with Ari Shaffir already,</v>

1328
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.350
<v Speaker 3>but we went to Montana to what used to be the great inland Western,</v>

1329
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.750
<v Speaker 3>see the Great Western inland sea,</v>

1330
00:35:33.751 --> 00:35:35.280
<v Speaker 3>which is fast willing to a part where he</v>

1331
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:36.480
<v Speaker 7>lewis and Clark said they,</v>

1332
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.590
<v Speaker 7>they as went through it,</v>

1333
00:35:37.591 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 7>they were like,</v>

1334
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 2>we think we saw some signs of native Americans.</v>

1335
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean not even the native Americans lived there,</v>

1336
00:35:42.361 --> 00:35:43.300
<v Speaker 2>but it was a hunting role,</v>

1337
00:35:43.301 --> 00:35:44.820
<v Speaker 2>but you couldn't live there because you could grow.</v>

1338
00:35:44.821 --> 00:35:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Nothing crazy.</v>

1339
00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I use also weird how much ground we covered,</v>

1340
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:51.300
<v Speaker 2>like wake up really early in the morning and then we'd,</v>

1341
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.530
<v Speaker 2>you'd go,</v>

1342
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:52.921
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>

1343
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:53.850
<v Speaker 2>we'll go over that ridge.</v>

1344
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:54.240
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1345
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 2>that rich has a mountain range.</v>

1346
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Is it shit as far right.</v>

1347
00:35:57.241 --> 00:36:00.510
<v Speaker 2>But you could actually climb it because it was made a clay and it stuck to your</v>

1348
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:00.890
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>

1349
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:01.210
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1350
00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Well it was really difficult when you're on the edges because it was just so</v>

1351
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:06.850
<v Speaker 2>slippery and your feet would waste so much because the,</v>

1352
00:36:06.851 --> 00:36:09.060
<v Speaker 2>the bottoms would be caked with this shit.</v>

1353
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.070
<v Speaker 2>And I remember when I glassed the field,</v>

1354
00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:15.610
<v Speaker 2>I'd take my binoculars and look out for game glassing the field is a,</v>

1355
00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.220
<v Speaker 2>as a hunting terminology,</v>

1356
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:18.054
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>

1357
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be so out of breath,</v>

1358
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:19.801
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1359
00:36:19.801 --> 00:36:21.030
<v Speaker 2>because we were high elevation.</v>

1360
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:21.900
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

1361
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.820
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of hiking that.</v>

1362
00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.140
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to be in fucking cheap,</v>

1363
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:25.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1364
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 2>I've watched this show and I've seen them,</v>

1365
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1366
00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.790
<v Speaker 2>what they do is stalking after the game.</v>

1367
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.770
<v Speaker 2>But I never really considered how much actual walkers involved.</v>

1368
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

1369
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.830
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't get tired.</v>

1370
00:36:34.831 --> 00:36:35.431
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1371
00:36:35.431 --> 00:36:35.980
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1372
00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.190
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking super impressed because uh,</v>

1373
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.760
<v Speaker 2>we were me and the camera guys fucking out of breath.</v>

1374
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.970
<v Speaker 2>And Steve rebel is up their truck and you're walking forever.</v>

1375
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:45.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1376
00:36:45.511 --> 00:36:47.340
<v Speaker 2>When you're walking up some serious hills.</v>

1377
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.580
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting though.</v>

1378
00:36:48.581 --> 00:36:49.411
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about this,</v>

1379
00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:50.580
<v Speaker 2>that anything you do,</v>

1380
00:36:50.581 --> 00:36:51.900
<v Speaker 2>even like hiking,</v>

1381
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:52.770
<v Speaker 2>if you're like,</v>

1382
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:54.360
<v Speaker 2>he's doing this every week.</v>

1383
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Every year he does it all year round.</v>

1384
00:36:56.011 --> 00:36:56.844
<v Speaker 2>That's how he hunts.</v>

1385
00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 2>So he's like constantly hiking.</v>

1386
00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:02.730
<v Speaker 2>The central nervous system learns how to use your muscles more efficiently.</v>

1387
00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1388
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.500
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're talking about.</v>

1389
00:37:04.501 --> 00:37:05.101
<v Speaker 2>Like every,</v>

1390
00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:08.300
<v Speaker 2>anything you do with martial arts or wrestling,</v>

1391
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:09.600
<v Speaker 2>why they tell you if you want a bodybuilder,</v>

1392
00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:12.300
<v Speaker 2>you gotta change it up because you confuse your central nervous system so your</v>

1393
00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:14.820
<v Speaker 2>body doesn't learn to use the same muscles over and over again.</v>

1394
00:37:14.821 --> 00:37:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1395
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 2>So now your body's like confused and it goes,</v>

1396
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:17.131
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1397
00:37:17.131 --> 00:37:20.420
<v Speaker 2>we got to use these muscles now and you keep tearing the muscles down and I</v>

1398
00:37:20.421 --> 00:37:20.670
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1399
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:21.503
<v Speaker 2>that's what I want.</v>

1400
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Can you just don't like the crossfit?</v>

1401
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:24.210
<v Speaker 2>People believe in that as well.</v>

1402
00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:24.841
<v Speaker 2>That's like their,</v>

1403
00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:25.420
<v Speaker 2>their ideas.</v>

1404
00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:30.390
<v Speaker 2>You do some fitness fitness so your body gets to a comprehensive,</v>

1405
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.920
<v Speaker 2>a strength,</v>

1406
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:32.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1407
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.190
<v Speaker 2>sort of a all around kind of controversial too though.</v>

1408
00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:39.170
<v Speaker 2>The controversy behind the crossfit people is that some people like steven that</v>

1409
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.670
<v Speaker 2>you should ever be doing power lifting exercises with great reputations like</v>

1410
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:42.800
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1411
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's no way they're designed for.</v>

1412
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:46.470
<v Speaker 2>They're designed for big explosive movements,</v>

1413
00:37:46.471 --> 00:37:50.730
<v Speaker 2>moving heavy things with correct form and building up your core and your</v>

1414
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:51.600
<v Speaker 2>explosive power.</v>

1415
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Most of the people I know did crossfit and get hurt.</v>

1416
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 2>They get hurt.</v>

1417
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of injuries and in fact a lot of pro athletes that I've talked to</v>

1418
00:37:57.481 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 2>don't do it as much because first of all it's a little bit,</v>

1419
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.320
<v Speaker 2>it's so much.</v>

1420
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.440
<v Speaker 2>It's so much on your body that a lot of times they weren't having energy for</v>

1421
00:38:04.441 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 2>their practices or their games and it keeps you torn down.</v>

1422
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Now there are some ridiculously fit athletes and I think it's a great program,</v>

1423
00:38:11.551 --> 00:38:13.530
<v Speaker 2>but I try to do it as much as possible,</v>

1424
00:38:13.531 --> 00:38:17.820
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that the athletes I've talked to the fighters and even the</v>

1425
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:18.720
<v Speaker 2>football players are like,</v>

1426
00:38:18.721 --> 00:38:22.710
<v Speaker 2>well you gotta you gotta you gotta move at your own pace with that stuff.</v>

1427
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:23.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1428
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:23.401
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

1429
00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:26.790
<v Speaker 2>You can't try to keep up with those dudes because those extreme crossfit dudes</v>

1430
00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 2>they get.</v>

1431
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.100
<v Speaker 2>They get like a deep,</v>

1432
00:38:29.101 --> 00:38:29.401
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

1433
00:38:29.401 --> 00:38:34.401
<v Speaker 2>deep into the game to the point where they can do just ridiculous sets with 225.</v>

1434
00:38:35.291 --> 00:38:39.360
<v Speaker 2>They're clean and jerking for 20 reps and then they're doing 20 chin ups grants.</v>

1435
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1436
00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.020
<v Speaker 2>They can do some sport.</v>

1437
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

1438
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1439
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that it's a test of will man.</v>

1440
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.870
<v Speaker 2>That is a test of will at crossfits humbling.</v>

1441
00:38:49.871 --> 00:38:50.704
<v Speaker 2>Every time you do it.</v>

1442
00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Like if you do Fran,</v>

1443
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:52.421
<v Speaker 2>you know what Fran,</v>

1444
00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 2>his friend never gets easy.</v>

1445
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:54.641
<v Speaker 2>Like if I think about it,</v>

1446
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 2>my heart starts beating fast.</v>

1447
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Where you got 95 pounds,</v>

1448
00:38:57.131 --> 00:38:58.420
<v Speaker 2>you go into a squat thrust,</v>

1449
00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.283
<v Speaker 2>you go squat,</v>

1450
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.191
<v Speaker 2>thrust her.</v>

1451
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:01.840
<v Speaker 2>So you go down in a squat position,</v>

1452
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.580
<v Speaker 2>throw it up over your head.</v>

1453
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:04.870
<v Speaker 2>You do that 21 times,</v>

1454
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 2>go at 21 pull ups,</v>

1455
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:07.750
<v Speaker 2>15 thrusters,</v>

1456
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:08.650
<v Speaker 2>15 pull ups,</v>

1457
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 2>nine thrusters,</v>

1458
00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:10.523
<v Speaker 2>nine pull ups.</v>

1459
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.291
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1460
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:12.670
<v Speaker 2>the idea is if you could do a sub,</v>

1461
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.950
<v Speaker 2>if you it under three minutes here in ridiculous shape,</v>

1462
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:15.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1463
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.660
<v Speaker 2>but even doing it,</v>

1464
00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 2>try doing it in under seven or eight and you'll be on the ground.</v>

1465
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just never.</v>

1466
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:21.970
<v Speaker 2>It never gets easy.</v>

1467
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.240
<v Speaker 2>They have so many of those things that never get easy to so much you could do</v>

1468
00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:26.530
<v Speaker 2>out there for exercise.</v>

1469
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.423
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1470
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 2>You see most people at the gym,</v>

1471
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.590
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1472
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 2>you're barely working out.</v>

1473
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:31.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1474
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:33.020
<v Speaker 2>you might be doing curls.</v>

1475
00:39:33.021 --> 00:39:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Are doing some sets that you do though.</v>

1476
00:39:34.571 --> 00:39:34.990
<v Speaker 2>What's your,</v>

1477
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 2>how long is your workout?</v>

1478
00:39:35.921 --> 00:39:36.430
<v Speaker 2>If you're lifting,</v>

1479
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:37.190
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>

1480
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what I'm doing.</v>

1481
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Depends on I started when I hurt my back,</v>

1482
00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:45.070
<v Speaker 2>I started doing more isolation stuff like rows and stuff like that just to</v>

1483
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:48.280
<v Speaker 2>really strengthen up my back so that day is like an easy day.</v>

1484
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 2>The the fullback day that I do,</v>

1485
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:54.640
<v Speaker 2>I do one full back day that's only like 30 minutes quick workout,</v>

1486
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.850
<v Speaker 2>but just the whole idea is just to blow it out and make it really hard.</v>

1487
00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:58.500
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1488
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1489
00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.013
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

1490
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:01.270
<v Speaker 2>I just want to have,</v>

1491
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.340
<v Speaker 2>be able to build up muscle and to have explosive power so your body's got to be</v>

1492
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:09.440
<v Speaker 2>conditioned all the time to be doing explosive shit,</v>

1493
00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.400
<v Speaker 2>building up tissue exploding.</v>

1494
00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.030
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't do that all the time,</v>

1495
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.380
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't want to do all the time.</v>

1496
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:17.170
<v Speaker 2>You'll have no situation in life in which to explode.</v>

1497
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.220
<v Speaker 2>And we all know that.</v>

1498
00:40:18.221 --> 00:40:19.430
<v Speaker 2>We use that every day.</v>

1499
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.633
<v Speaker 2>Funny,</v>

1500
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.881
<v Speaker 2>like I do all this stuff.</v>

1501
00:40:21.881 --> 00:40:22.121
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1502
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:23.470
<v Speaker 2>when am I ever going to do doing kettlebell?</v>

1503
00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Until I can't walk.</v>

1504
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Like what am I going to not.</v>

1505
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1506
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bringing huge bells,</v>

1507
00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:28.360
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1508
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.880
<v Speaker 2>I like being in shape in case the shit hits the fan.</v>

1509
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.171
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't in shape,</v>

1510
00:40:32.171 --> 00:40:33.190
<v Speaker 2>but when we went on a hunting trip,</v>

1511
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.750
<v Speaker 2>we've assured I would have been fucked.</v>

1512
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1513
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Because that was.</v>

1514
00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.390
<v Speaker 2>That was a series.</v>

1515
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.570
<v Speaker 2>We would hike at least three miles in the morning.</v>

1516
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:41.490
<v Speaker 2>So funny dude.</v>

1517
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:46.150
<v Speaker 2>It was raining the first night we were freezing and the sleeping bags they gave</v>

1518
00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:47.860
<v Speaker 2>us didn't work and as I'm getting,</v>

1519
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm shivering and putting like seven layers to down jackets.</v>

1520
00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Literally I'm shivering.</v>

1521
00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.350
<v Speaker 2>I just hear Jonas in his tank.</v>

1522
00:40:55.351 --> 00:40:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Go camping.</v>

1523
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Fucking laughed so hard and somebody shoot.</v>

1524
00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:00.851
<v Speaker 2>You did.</v>

1525
00:41:00.851 --> 00:41:01.684
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

1526
00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.740
<v Speaker 2>He just goes camping below.</v>

1527
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 2>We had a great fucking time.</v>

1528
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.620
<v Speaker 2>How about me pulling fucking quilts out of your ass and legs?</v>

1529
00:41:08.621 --> 00:41:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I think we have on tape.</v>

1530
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:12.040
<v Speaker 2>We still have these red marks all over my ass and legs.</v>

1531
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I laid down on a cactus and Brian had a pull them out in the camp for the</v>

1532
00:41:17.561 --> 00:41:18.680
<v Speaker 2>campfire with all the guys.</v>

1533
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.781
<v Speaker 2>All the guys were like,</v>

1534
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:20.291
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

1535
00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:20.501
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1536
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't waste my fucking,</v>

1537
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.061
<v Speaker 2>my best friend.</v>

1538
00:41:22.061 --> 00:41:22.894
<v Speaker 2>I got to pull out.</v>

1539
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll take out your fucking thorns.</v>

1540
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 2>When I went to to drop down to kill the deer,</v>

1541
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:30.580
<v Speaker 2>I sat down right in the cactus</v>

1542
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>pat covered and</v>

1543
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 7>you see your first year,</v>

1544
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.460
<v Speaker 7>you want to kill that thing so badly.</v>

1545
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:38.091
<v Speaker 7>I literally,</v>

1546
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:41.960
<v Speaker 7>I had a bucket in my crosshairs that that third day when you got yours,</v>

1547
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:42.943
<v Speaker 7>I couldn't.</v>

1548
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 7>I had talked about buck fever.</v>

1549
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.660
<v Speaker 7>The scope was bleeding.</v>

1550
00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:47.030
<v Speaker 7>He jumping all over the place.</v>

1551
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

1552
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.373
<v Speaker 7>this is my breathing.</v>

1553
00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.590
<v Speaker 3>The first time I couldn't get them into focus.</v>

1554
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.880
<v Speaker 3>The first time I went to shoot it because in my I was too close to the scope and</v>

1555
00:41:57.881 --> 00:41:59.350
<v Speaker 3>then I realized what I was doing wrong.</v>

1556
00:41:59.351 --> 00:41:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1557
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:00.011
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1558
00:42:00.011 --> 00:42:00.970
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing over there?</v>

1559
00:42:00.971 --> 00:42:02.240
<v Speaker 3>Stupid like what?</v>

1560
00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.101
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing?</v>

1561
00:42:03.101 --> 00:42:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Like I was panicking.</v>

1562
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I just got too close to the scope and it was like,</v>

1563
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.740
<v Speaker 3>it's weird when you're looking at something through a scope,</v>

1564
00:42:08.741 --> 00:42:09.880
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to describe,</v>

1565
00:42:09.881 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 3>but it's like almost like you're,</v>

1566
00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.020
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1567
00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.610
<v Speaker 3>you see like black,</v>

1568
00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.910
<v Speaker 3>like half moons over everything.</v>

1569
00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't like close in on the actual image,</v>

1570
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.800
<v Speaker 3>the outside of his all black.</v>

1571
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Did you keep your eye from a scope and you stay and you start to be good at</v>

1572
00:42:27.131 --> 00:42:27.341
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1573
00:42:27.341 --> 00:42:30.550
<v Speaker 3>When you and I backed up just a hair and boom,</v>

1574
00:42:30.551 --> 00:42:31.331
<v Speaker 3>it was in perfect,</v>

1575
00:42:31.331 --> 00:42:31.961
<v Speaker 3>clear focus.</v>

1576
00:42:31.961 --> 00:42:32.290
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1577
00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:32.711
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1578
00:42:32.711 --> 00:42:33.281
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1579
00:42:33.281 --> 00:42:36.430
<v Speaker 3>I was too close and then the fucker went behind a cliff.</v>

1580
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:37.623
<v Speaker 3>The deer</v>

1581
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.410
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>

1582
00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:39.610
<v Speaker 7>hunting deer hunting.</v>

1583
00:42:39.611 --> 00:42:42.540
<v Speaker 7>Mule deer in a place where they know they're being hunted a lot like hunting and</v>

1584
00:42:42.541 --> 00:42:43.374
<v Speaker 7>Mirage.</v>

1585
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.760
<v Speaker 7>They'll just show up and then they just disappeared.</v>

1586
00:42:45.761 --> 00:42:46.061
<v Speaker 7>And you're like,</v>

1587
00:42:46.061 --> 00:42:48.340
<v Speaker 7>but how did it didn't go into the mountain?</v>

1588
00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.090
<v Speaker 7>Where is it?</v>

1589
00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:49.241
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1590
00:42:49.241 --> 00:42:49.900
<v Speaker 3>they're so.</v>

1591
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.310
<v Speaker 3>They're so well camouflaged.</v>

1592
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.680
<v Speaker 3>They look exactly like the mountainside.</v>

1593
00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1594
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:57.490
<v Speaker 3>You don't see them until you see like a little white tuft where their assets.</v>

1595
00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:57.751
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1596
00:42:57.751 --> 00:42:59.550
<v Speaker 7>I'm fine chasing for all morning.</v>

1597
00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:00.540
<v Speaker 7>I finally,</v>

1598
00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.860
<v Speaker 7>I got him on a stretcher,</v>

1599
00:43:01.861 --> 00:43:02.694
<v Speaker 7>got him and I'm like,</v>

1600
00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.110
<v Speaker 7>now we're this ridiculous.</v>

1601
00:43:04.111 --> 00:43:05.220
<v Speaker 7>There's no way they could have disappeared.</v>

1602
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.450
<v Speaker 7>Then I see ducks and I'm like,</v>

1603
00:43:06.451 --> 00:43:06.781
<v Speaker 7>what are those?</v>

1604
00:43:06.781 --> 00:43:07.770
<v Speaker 7>Ducks have huge ears.</v>

1605
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:08.790
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1606
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.770
<v Speaker 7>those fuckers are swimming across the river.</v>

1607
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:14.040
<v Speaker 7>I spent all morning chasing you assholes and now you're across the river and I</v>

1608
00:43:14.041 --> 00:43:15.000
<v Speaker 7>got no shot and uh,</v>

1609
00:43:15.001 --> 00:43:15.270
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1610
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:16.590
<v Speaker 7>I didn't even know they can swim.</v>

1611
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.550
<v Speaker 7>I didn't either.</v>

1612
00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:18.383
<v Speaker 7>They swabbed,</v>

1613
00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.500
<v Speaker 7>literally like swimming,</v>

1614
00:43:19.501 --> 00:43:19.741
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1615
00:43:19.741 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1616
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:21.720
<v Speaker 7>like covering serious ground.</v>

1617
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Where we went was so strange.</v>

1618
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:25.220
<v Speaker 3>It was such a bizarre,</v>

1619
00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:26.240
<v Speaker 3>bizarre place.</v>

1620
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Cold,</v>

1621
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:27.860
<v Speaker 3>cold as fuck.</v>

1622
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:28.723
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

1623
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 3>it was just so unlike anything that you never ever do in your normal life is a</v>

1624
00:43:33.171 --> 00:43:34.190
<v Speaker 3>comedian in la.</v>

1625
00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:35.483
<v Speaker 3>It's so true.</v>

1626
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.920
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have cell phones,</v>

1627
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.290
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have text messages.</v>

1628
00:43:38.291 --> 00:43:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done that in a long time man.</v>

1629
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:42.740
<v Speaker 3>And the crazy thing was.</v>

1630
00:43:42.741 --> 00:43:43.321
<v Speaker 3>Oh we will.</v>

1631
00:43:43.321 --> 00:43:45.710
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk about how you have energy all day.</v>

1632
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Like even though you're not eating the best food.</v>

1633
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean we had good food.</v>

1634
00:43:49.581 --> 00:43:50.660
<v Speaker 3>We had to like camp food,</v>

1635
00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:54.730
<v Speaker 3>like apples and we had like beef jerky and we had freeze dried meals that we</v>

1636
00:43:54.731 --> 00:43:56.690
<v Speaker 3>would have for dinner and protein bars and stuff like that.</v>

1637
00:43:56.691 --> 00:43:57.860
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like we were malnourished.</v>

1638
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:58.160
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1639
00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.010
<v Speaker 7>but we were talking about how you get there and it's so quiet.</v>

1640
00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:02.330
<v Speaker 7>You don't have access to your cell phone,</v>

1641
00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.180
<v Speaker 7>no Internet,</v>

1642
00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:03.921
<v Speaker 7>no nothing,</v>

1643
00:44:03.921 --> 00:44:04.754
<v Speaker 7>and I think,</v>

1644
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:09.260
<v Speaker 7>I think you're not spending any time taking in stimulus.</v>

1645
00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:11.750
<v Speaker 7>You just take your spending time listening to your own breathing,</v>

1646
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.050
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1647
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.620
<v Speaker 7>and responding and connecting with people.</v>

1648
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 7>And somehow I had such clarity of focus and energy on that whole time.</v>

1649
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:20.170
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1650
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:21.030
<v Speaker 3>it will.</v>

1651
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.950
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't think we're designed to,</v>

1652
00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:25.410
<v Speaker 3>to live the way we live.</v>

1653
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.041
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1654
00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:29.700
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to adapt and I think future generations will probably have some</v>

1655
00:44:29.701 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 3>physical capabilities that we don't have.</v>

1656
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.001
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1657
00:44:33.001 --> 00:44:38.001
<v Speaker 2>because one thing about autism is that fact that we are now you had these hyper</v>

1658
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 2>hyper like autistic people who are high functioning that can take in a</v>

1659
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:43.050
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of stimulus,</v>

1660
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.690
<v Speaker 2>see a room and count like you know,</v>

1661
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.770
<v Speaker 2>everything in it that fast on one of this,</v>

1662
00:44:47.771 --> 00:44:50.340
<v Speaker 2>this guy won and requests was saying on Ted Dot Com.</v>

1663
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.550
<v Speaker 2>He's a venture capitalist scientist and he said,</v>

1664
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1665
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:56.370
<v Speaker 2>it may be that our brains,</v>

1666
00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.180
<v Speaker 2>because we're exposed in such a short period of time to 500 times a stimulus</v>

1667
00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:04.890
<v Speaker 2>that are we see more in one day than our ancestors saw on a you in a lifetime as</v>

1668
00:45:04.891 --> 00:45:06.330
<v Speaker 2>far as just the amount of stimulus,</v>

1669
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:07.560
<v Speaker 2>the amount of sounds,</v>

1670
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 2>the thoughts that are crammed into our brains just through visual stimuli and</v>

1671
00:45:12.271 --> 00:45:15.660
<v Speaker 2>auditory stimuli said our brand is very well,</v>

1672
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.720
<v Speaker 2>may already be evolving to match and coordinate with this ever changing</v>

1673
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.580
<v Speaker 2>exponentially growing environment.</v>

1674
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1675
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:25.020
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm wondering about.</v>

1676
00:45:25.021 --> 00:45:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Like with Wifi Signal,</v>

1677
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.490
<v Speaker 3>cellular signals and all the different.</v>

1678
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:32.580
<v Speaker 3>There's like I don't understand signals,</v>

1679
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1680
00:45:33.031 --> 00:45:34.770
<v Speaker 3>I kind of know that they're there.</v>

1681
00:45:34.771 --> 00:45:36.090
<v Speaker 3>I know that there's radio.</v>

1682
00:45:36.091 --> 00:45:37.350
<v Speaker 3>I know that just television.</v>

1683
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.900
<v Speaker 3>I know that there's stuff that's being sent out in somewhere.</v>

1684
00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:40.860
<v Speaker 3>Someone's receiving it,</v>

1685
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.600
<v Speaker 3>but I don't understand it.</v>

1686
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't understand like what is it doing to biology.</v>

1687
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.210
<v Speaker 3>They know that it's having an effect on bees,</v>

1688
00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:49.650
<v Speaker 3>especially cell phone signals.</v>

1689
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.630
<v Speaker 3>They think that it might be like a steady,</v>

1690
00:45:51.631 --> 00:45:54.420
<v Speaker 3>like jackhammer sort of thing that's affecting bees,</v>

1691
00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:55.950
<v Speaker 3>like just an interference,</v>

1692
00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.360
<v Speaker 2>like all member aliens is air,</v>

1693
00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:00.240
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

1694
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:00.670
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1695
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.030
<v Speaker 2>that's what the Wifi signal.</v>

1696
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.410
<v Speaker 2>We talked about it yesterday.</v>

1697
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think all this stuff is edging toward becoming one with the machines</v>

1698
00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.540
<v Speaker 2>for real and then ultimately to that effect,</v>

1699
00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:13.790
<v Speaker 2>creating this sort of universal connectedness.</v>

1700
00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.130
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it's biological for very long.</v>

1701
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if we're ever going to evolve.</v>

1702
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1703
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.420
<v Speaker 3>some ability to tune into these,</v>

1704
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:24.360
<v Speaker 3>these signals without adding something to the body Audi</v>

1705
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:25.830
<v Speaker 2>without adding like a chip.</v>

1706
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Like how fucked would it be if the healing.</v>

1707
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 2>We are going to have chips way before that question arises.</v>

1708
00:46:31.201 --> 00:46:32.910
<v Speaker 2>I think things are moving so quickly.</v>

1709
00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:33.710
<v Speaker 2>We have synthetic,</v>

1710
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:34.543
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1711
00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 2>we're working on synthetic,</v>

1712
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.953
<v Speaker 2>biological,</v>

1713
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.540
<v Speaker 2>synthetically biological computer chips,</v>

1714
00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.373
<v Speaker 2>faces.</v>

1715
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have like a google face.</v>

1716
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:45.480
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get a new face.</v>

1717
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:46.681
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

1718
00:46:46.681 --> 00:46:48.540
<v Speaker 2>I bet you could probably do that some day.</v>

1719
00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1720
00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.120
<v Speaker 2>that's what Ray Kurzweil says.</v>

1721
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1722
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:52.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're,</v>

1723
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:53.520
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be,</v>

1724
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.810
<v Speaker 2>we're going to mesh with machines.</v>

1725
00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Why in the world if you had an eye that could see a mile away and in the dark,</v>

1726
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.730
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you get an an artificial lie?</v>

1727
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.953
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you?</v>

1728
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.870
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I'm old school.</v>

1729
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't need my leg.</v>

1730
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sit here on my porch until everything stops.</v>

1731
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1732
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Why would you?</v>

1733
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:16.891
<v Speaker 2>But maybe you know,</v>

1734
00:47:16.891 --> 00:47:18.150
<v Speaker 2>maybe the next life is better.</v>

1735
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the better.</v>

1736
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if there is.</v>

1737
00:47:22.051 --> 00:47:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the afterlife is the notion that you live on is a computer as a computer</v>

1738
00:47:26.491 --> 00:47:27.324
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

1739
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:28.561
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1740
00:47:28.561 --> 00:47:28.930
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1741
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:29.201
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

1742
00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:29.411
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1743
00:47:29.411 --> 00:47:29.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not opposite.</v>

1744
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1745
00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:30.953
<v Speaker 2>if I can download,</v>

1746
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I can download your brain.</v>

1747
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Everything that goes onto your brain.</v>

1748
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.260
<v Speaker 2>I can download all the content.</v>

1749
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1750
00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>

1751
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.280
<v Speaker 2>which computer science you're talking about a matter of when?</v>

1752
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Not if like numb my brain.</v>

1753
00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe you're not here,</v>

1754
00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.830
<v Speaker 2>you're a brand new car.</v>

1755
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.330
<v Speaker 2>He's a huge mainframe.</v>

1756
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Too much going,</v>

1757
00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.660
<v Speaker 2>but then I take that brand and I put everything,</v>

1758
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.240
<v Speaker 2>all your memories and everything to think about into a computer.</v>

1759
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.550
<v Speaker 2>I can put it into a robot maybe.</v>

1760
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1761
00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.400
<v Speaker 2>what does that say about your mortality?</v>

1762
00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1763
00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:58.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1764
00:47:58.810 --> 00:47:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer.</v>

1765
00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.690
<v Speaker 2>It's we only accepted if it's,</v>

1766
00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:02.860
<v Speaker 2>if it's legit,</v>

1767
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.180
<v Speaker 2>if it's natural,</v>

1768
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.250
<v Speaker 2>that's when we accept things when they're natural,</v>

1769
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1770
00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:09.370
<v Speaker 2>if you hate it.</v>

1771
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:09.940
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1772
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.391
<v Speaker 2>we've been,</v>

1773
00:48:10.391 --> 00:48:10.931
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1774
00:48:10.931 --> 00:48:12.130
<v Speaker 2>genetically modifying</v>

1775
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:18.550
<v Speaker 2>crops like corn and things that you would never recognize what corn was 200,</v>

1776
00:48:18.551 --> 00:48:19.390
<v Speaker 2>300 years ago.</v>

1777
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a different,</v>

1778
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:20.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1779
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.191
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1780
00:48:21.191 --> 00:48:21.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1781
00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:22.870
<v Speaker 2>it's everything you eat,</v>

1782
00:48:22.871 --> 00:48:27.550
<v Speaker 2>everything including the animals you eat has been genetically fucked with to</v>

1783
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:31.930
<v Speaker 2>become more productive in their output and isn't ultimately.</v>

1784
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're calling it natural.</v>

1785
00:48:33.731 --> 00:48:37.270
<v Speaker 2>What's natural and not natural but isn't everything that human beings do natural</v>

1786
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.590
<v Speaker 2>because we're part of nature.</v>

1787
00:48:38.591 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1788
00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Just as natural as the process of making honey.</v>

1789
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.610
<v Speaker 2>But the other question,</v>

1790
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:44.200
<v Speaker 2>the other issue is that yes,</v>

1791
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:48.700
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the very idea of natural and biology is going to change when we</v>

1792
00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:49.750
<v Speaker 2>realize that this,</v>

1793
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.320
<v Speaker 2>this human being that I'm looking at is a machine like anything else.</v>

1794
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:53.891
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1795
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:58.210
<v Speaker 2>a rather rudimentary machine maybe 300 years from now or 200 years from now or</v>

1796
00:48:58.211 --> 00:48:59.044
<v Speaker 2>50 years from now.</v>

1797
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.050
<v Speaker 2>It may very well be that we,</v>

1798
00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 2>once we figured out exactly how the machine works with the genome and all these</v>

1799
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:05.530
<v Speaker 2>other ideas,</v>

1800
00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:09.640
<v Speaker 2>well I guess I could make now even a more complex machine,</v>

1801
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:11.260
<v Speaker 2>so in the end of the day,</v>

1802
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:16.480
<v Speaker 2>if that machine is just as biological but more complex than this rusty old</v>

1803
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.970
<v Speaker 2>machine that breaks down after 90 years or whatever.</v>

1804
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1805
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:20.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1806
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what biology means anymore.</v>

1807
00:49:22.331 --> 00:49:26.500
<v Speaker 2>What happens to the bacteria that exists in the biological organism because</v>

1808
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:27.334
<v Speaker 2>that's like our,</v>

1809
00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.120
<v Speaker 2>our tenants.</v>

1810
00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:28.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1811
00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:28.661
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1812
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:30.580
<v Speaker 2>we're already well,</v>

1813
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:31.930
<v Speaker 2>but already what we're doing,</v>

1814
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.520
<v Speaker 2>what science is doing is trying to learn how to harvest and,</v>

1815
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1816
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:35.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1817
00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.620
<v Speaker 2>the good bacteria versus the bad bacteria and manage the body like an ecosystem,</v>

1818
00:49:42.401 --> 00:49:44.380
<v Speaker 2>a mini ecosystem and science.</v>

1819
00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:45.880
<v Speaker 2>More and more scientists are,</v>

1820
00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:50.580
<v Speaker 2>are talking that the microbes that make up our body are,</v>

1821
00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:51.410
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1822
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.700
<v Speaker 2>are exactly why we are the way we are.</v>

1823
00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:57.320
<v Speaker 2>They control everything from the,</v>

1824
00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:01.720
<v Speaker 2>the natural moisture in our skin to the way we smell to personality.</v>

1825
00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:02.551
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the,</v>

1826
00:50:02.551 --> 00:50:02.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1827
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:04.840
<v Speaker 2>it might have an effect on intelligence.</v>

1828
00:50:04.841 --> 00:50:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Autism may be connected,</v>

1829
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:11.500
<v Speaker 2>certain types of autism spectrum disorders might be connected to having an</v>

1830
00:50:11.501 --> 00:50:14.260
<v Speaker 2>imbalanced flora.</v>

1831
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:14.900
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1832
00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating,</v>

1833
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:16.271
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1834
00:50:16.271 --> 00:50:18.760
<v Speaker 2>It's the human body's a host for life.</v>

1835
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:22.840
<v Speaker 2>There's billions and billions of organisms living inside your body.</v>

1836
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:23.703
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1837
00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:23.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1838
00:50:23.981 --> 00:50:24.191
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1839
00:50:24.191 --> 00:50:24.520
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1840
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.370
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for us to really imagine that we're not an individual.</v>

1841
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.600
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1842
00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.350
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for us to imagine that we're a walking ecosystem.</v>

1843
00:50:31.351 --> 00:50:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1844
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.420
<v Speaker 3>That's also the idea that,</v>

1845
00:50:33.421 --> 00:50:33.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1846
00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:35.400
<v Speaker 3>it's maybe hard to imagine that we are,</v>

1847
00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.920
<v Speaker 3>we are being nudged in a certain direction.</v>

1848
00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not this not chaos.</v>

1849
00:50:39.901 --> 00:50:40.170
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1850
00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:44.160
<v Speaker 3>there's a direction we're being moved in and its complexity always from,</v>

1851
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:45.540
<v Speaker 3>from the beginning of humans.</v>

1852
00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.420
<v Speaker 3>True to the moment they figured out how to roll things on logs.</v>

1853
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:52.200
<v Speaker 3>They have made it more and more and more and more complex.</v>

1854
00:50:52.201 --> 00:50:52.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1855
00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:57.330
<v Speaker 3>That's just what the only thing that's not as complex as our stone work know,</v>

1856
00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.000
<v Speaker 3>like ancient Egyptian stonework.</v>

1857
00:50:59.070 --> 00:50:59.881
<v Speaker 3>We had a guy in yesterday,</v>

1858
00:50:59.881 --> 00:51:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Philip Copans,</v>

1859
00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:01.260
<v Speaker 3>who's this,</v>

1860
00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:04.140
<v Speaker 3>wrote this great book on lost civilization,</v>

1861
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:04.800
<v Speaker 3>enigma.</v>

1862
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.361
<v Speaker 3>It's all on,</v>

1863
00:51:05.361 --> 00:51:05.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1864
00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:09.810
<v Speaker 3>like the ancient constructions of the past and that's the only thing like today</v>

1865
00:51:09.811 --> 00:51:10.800
<v Speaker 3>that we still go,</v>

1866
00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:11.390
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

1867
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:15.870
<v Speaker 3>these motherfuckers had some crazy technology and some crazy insight that the</v>

1868
00:51:15.871 --> 00:51:16.704
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians,</v>

1869
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.700
<v Speaker 3>the Egyptians,</v>

1870
00:51:17.701 --> 00:51:18.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean even the,</v>

1871
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:22.650
<v Speaker 3>the Romans and a lot of other people who have made some incredible pieces of</v>

1872
00:51:22.651 --> 00:51:23.484
<v Speaker 3>architecture.</v>

1873
00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.500
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean we couldn't do it today.</v>

1874
00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1875
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:26.850
<v Speaker 3>we are doing it today,</v>

1876
00:51:26.851 --> 00:51:27.684
<v Speaker 3>but I think on a,</v>

1877
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:30.150
<v Speaker 3>on a subatomic level or a national level,</v>

1878
00:51:30.151 --> 00:51:30.361
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1879
00:51:30.361 --> 00:51:30.571
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1880
00:51:30.571 --> 00:51:30.930
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

1881
00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:31.410
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1882
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1883
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:35.670
<v Speaker 3>now most of the innovation is going toward creating robotics and tissue</v>

1884
00:51:35.671 --> 00:51:36.331
<v Speaker 3>regeneration.</v>

1885
00:51:36.331 --> 00:51:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Growing new limbs,</v>

1886
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:40.200
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about it that we think that change that light.</v>

1887
00:51:40.201 --> 00:51:41.034
<v Speaker 3>Hold on the idea.</v>

1888
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:41.923
<v Speaker 3>Change a light.</v>

1889
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.233
<v Speaker 3>What's in your eyes?</v>

1890
00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.393
<v Speaker 3>This thing back here.</v>

1898
00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:00.560
<v Speaker 3>you look up in the hills and if you see the aim,</v>

1899
00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:00.841

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:03.771
<v Speaker 3>they called him.</v>

1904
00:52:03.771 --> 00:52:08.400
<v Speaker 3>He came by the cashmere killer because I was wearing three layers of cashmere</v>

1905
00:52:08.401 --> 00:52:11.190
<v Speaker 3>hunting deer and freezing my fucking tail off.</v>

1906
00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Still Fun.</v>

1907
00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:13.560
<v Speaker 3>It was really fun.</v>

1908
00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:14.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad you went with me,</v>

1909
00:52:14.771 --> 00:52:15.000
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1910
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:15.780
<v Speaker 3>It would have made it.</v>

1911
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:16.980
<v Speaker 3>It made it a hundred times better.</v>

1912
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:17.211
<v Speaker 3>We did.</v>

1913
00:52:17.211 --> 00:52:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Was laugh the whole time.</v>

1914
00:52:18.241 --> 00:52:19.390
<v Speaker 3>It was just great time.</v>

1915
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:20.601
<v Speaker 3>There was a time,</v>

1916
00:52:20.601 --> 00:52:23.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's such a disrespectful moment because we're actually butchering the</v>

1917
00:52:23.941 --> 00:52:24.750
<v Speaker 3>deer,</v>

1918
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:26.580
<v Speaker 3>but as we were butchering this deer,</v>

1919
00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:31.680
<v Speaker 3>we're cutting into sections and I don't know what possessed him,</v>

1920
00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:35.760
<v Speaker 3>but he got it to this thing of jerking off into the ravine.</v>

1921
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:37.950
<v Speaker 3>My character was the ravine cut,</v>

1922
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:42.060
<v Speaker 3>so he starts doing this character where he's angry about stuff with its tongue</v>

1923
00:52:42.061 --> 00:52:45.360
<v Speaker 3>sticking out side of his mouth that he's just jerked off into the ravine and it</v>

1924
00:52:45.361 --> 00:52:47.420
<v Speaker 3>was so preposterous for what was happening mean.</v>

1925
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Here we are like skinning this animal and hocking chopping it couldn't take the</v>

1926
00:52:52.651 --> 00:52:53.970
<v Speaker 3>sections off of him.</v>

1927
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:57.710
<v Speaker 3>It was really weird skinning an animal and gutting it and skinning it,</v>

1928
00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:01.140
<v Speaker 3>and so I know the problem is if you put me in a sacred place,</v>

1929
00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:03.120
<v Speaker 3>I start to freak out and do something,</v>

1930
00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:04.200
<v Speaker 3>but you should've seen me at church.</v>

1931
00:53:04.201 --> 00:53:05.610

1932
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.511

2017
00:55:04.441 --> 00:55:05.110
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2018

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2021
00:55:07.931 --> 00:55:10.620
<v Speaker 7>You think about how fucking what a numbskull I was when I was younger,</v>

2022
00:55:10.621 --> 00:55:12.780
<v Speaker 7>just I didn't understand girls were different.</v>

2023
00:55:12.781 --> 00:55:13.830
<v Speaker 7>I didn't really understand</v>

2024
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.320
<v Speaker 7>why they were just like me and then I dated a girl who'd be like looking back on</v>

2025
00:55:19.321 --> 00:55:19.381
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2026
00:55:19.381 --> 00:55:21.000
<v Speaker 7>They were all great and I'd be like,</v>

2027
00:55:21.001 --> 00:55:21.480
<v Speaker 7>why am I.</v>

2028
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:21.681
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

2029
00:55:21.681 --> 00:55:22.170
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

2030
00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:24.000
<v Speaker 7>Why is she not behaving like my friends?</v>

2031
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.080
<v Speaker 7>She's a fucking girl.</v>

2032
00:55:25.081 --> 00:55:25.914
<v Speaker 7>You idiot.</v>

2033
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:29.190
<v Speaker 7>It takes a while to understand that I was just a fucking idiot.</v>

2034
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:30.600
<v Speaker 7>Were those poor girls were like,</v>

2035
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:31.643
<v Speaker 7>what is with this,</v>

2036
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:31.921
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

2037
00:55:31.921 --> 00:55:32.900
<v Speaker 7>this caveman?</v>

2038
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.690
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2039
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:36.030
<v Speaker 7>I'm not gonna fuck you in the elevator.</v>

2040
00:55:36.031 --> 00:55:37.480
<v Speaker 7>This is whenever it was.</v>

2041
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:38.813
<v Speaker 7>I bought.</v>

2042
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:40.200
<v Speaker 7>Well you should be more into.</v>

2043
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:42.960
<v Speaker 7>I broke up with a girl because she fell asleep during raging bull.</v>

2044
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.720
<v Speaker 7>That's not fair to a girl.</v>

2045
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.690
<v Speaker 7>It's a great movie,</v>

2046
00:55:45.691 --> 00:55:47.490
<v Speaker 7>but it's a fucking movie about a boxer.</v>

2047
00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:49.050
<v Speaker 7>The guys like girls aren't supposed to.</v>

2048
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:49.610
<v Speaker 7>You know.</v>

2049
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:51.240
<v Speaker 7>It's not fair for me to be mad.</v>

2050
00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:51.691
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

2051
00:55:51.691 --> 00:55:52.351
<v Speaker 7>this is one of the great.</v>

2052
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:54.750
<v Speaker 7>This is my favorite movie of all time and you fell asleep in it.</v>

2053
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.490
<v Speaker 7>I'm afraid I have nothing in common with you.</v>

2054
00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:57.361
<v Speaker 7>I didn't say that,</v>

2055
00:55:57.361 --> 00:55:58.590
<v Speaker 7>but I made that choice in my head.</v>

2056
00:55:58.591 --> 00:55:58.980
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

2057
00:55:58.980 --> 00:55:59.111
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2058
00:55:59.111 --> 00:55:59.910
<v Speaker 7>she hot.</v>

2059
00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:00.421
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

2060
00:56:00.421 --> 00:56:01.020
<v Speaker 7>but I was like,</v>

2061
00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:01.853
<v Speaker 7>I don't know</v>

2062
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.113
<v Speaker 6>what is.</v>

2063
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:13.280
<v Speaker 6>One of the things that I pride myself in is I've never tried to make someone</v>

2064
00:56:13.321 --> 00:56:15.950
<v Speaker 6>that I've dated any different than who they are.</v>

2065
00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:18.240
<v Speaker 6>You are always good to learn.</v>

2066
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:19.530
<v Speaker 6>I was a fucking idiot.</v>

2067
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:19.981
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2068
00:56:19.981 --> 00:56:20.440
<v Speaker 6>I just know.</v>

2069
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.151
<v Speaker 6>Is it more for me,</v>

2070
00:56:21.151 --> 00:56:21.540
<v Speaker 6>it was just like,</v>

2071
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.020
<v Speaker 6>how can we bring someone,</v>

2072
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 6>tell them they have</v>

2073
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:24.963
<v Speaker 3>to read it.</v>

2074
00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:25.631
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2075
00:56:25.631 --> 00:56:26.640
<v Speaker 3>how can you not be interested in this?</v>

2076
00:56:26.641 --> 00:56:27.371
<v Speaker 3>This is amazing.</v>

2077
00:56:27.371 --> 00:56:27.501
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2078
00:56:27.501 --> 00:56:28.910
<v Speaker 3>they were fucking thing.</v>

2079
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:29.813
<v Speaker 3>They got their own thing.</v>

2080
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.100
<v Speaker 3>They were smarter than I was.</v>

2081
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.901
<v Speaker 3>I looked back on it,</v>

2082
00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:33.790
<v Speaker 3>they knew if I had listened to them I would have,</v>

2083
00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:35.260
<v Speaker 3>I would've been better off.</v>

2084
00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:40.480
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that people I like really love and I could not care less</v>

2085
00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 3>if it existed,</v>

2086
00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:45.460
<v Speaker 3>whether it's sports or certain types of music and I could love these person,</v>

2087
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:48.820
<v Speaker 3>these people to death and whatever their opinion is.</v>

2088
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:52.210
<v Speaker 3>I just like Eddie Bravo was always trying to turn me onto some new electronic</v>

2089
00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:55.690
<v Speaker 3>band and like four out of five of them are pretty decent,</v>

2090
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.980
<v Speaker 3>but every now and then there's,</v>

2091
00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:57.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2092
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:57.670
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2093
00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:01.160
<v Speaker 3>he's into some shit that I'm not into a fiery series.</v>

2094
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Those are pretty high odds.</v>

2095
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:04.330
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's less than that.</v>

2096
00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:04.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2097
00:57:04.591 --> 00:57:05.121
<v Speaker 3>you're probably right.</v>

2098
00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:05.954
<v Speaker 3>It's about three,</v>

2099
00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:06.970
<v Speaker 3>three out of five.</v>

2100
00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:09.310
<v Speaker 3>So nice being nice because I love Eddie.</v>

2101
00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Three of it,</v>

2102
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:10.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's not luck.</v>

2103
00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.010
<v Speaker 3>It's just taste in music.</v>

2104
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Like he really loves smashing pumpkins.</v>

2105
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:16.480
<v Speaker 3>He really loves Leonard Skinner Guy.</v>

2106
00:57:16.481 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm a led Zeppelin guy.</v>

2107
00:57:17.621 --> 00:57:21.230
<v Speaker 3>I love like hearing the fucking guitar scratching on the pit.</v>

2108
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:22.241
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2109
00:57:22.241 --> 00:57:22.601
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

2110
00:57:22.601 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear like the black keys,</v>

2111
00:57:24.341 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 3>like that's my cousin.</v>

2112
00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Also musicians,</v>

2113
00:57:26.321 --> 00:57:29.680
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times we're listening to something different than we are here more than</v>

2114
00:57:29.681 --> 00:57:34.360
<v Speaker 3>we do or they're just more in tune with something innovative or Eddie has a very</v>

2115
00:57:34.361 --> 00:57:37.260
<v Speaker 3>specific style that he fucking loves and you know,</v>

2116
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:38.990
<v Speaker 3>and he's very creative man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean his own music.</v>

2118
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.631
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2119
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:40.991
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

2120
00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:42.700
<v Speaker 3>if you're into that style of music,</v>

2121

<v Speaker 3>like Eddie does some really topnotch shit and now he does it with this dude</v>

2127
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:59.620
<v Speaker 3>he always loved hip hop but he didn't like the kind of music that was in the</v>

2128
00:57:59.621 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 3>background of hip hop.</v>

2129
00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:03.460
<v Speaker 3>He didn't like that whole sampling fan and thought it would be,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's really into that.</v>

2136
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:11.831
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's different.</v>

2137
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Why that is everybody's fucking different.</v>

2144
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:19.451
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

2145
00:58:19.451 --> 00:58:20.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean they just don't like it,</v>

2146
00:58:20.681 --> 00:58:23.530
<v Speaker 3>but I can have great conversations with them about other stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just thought it was so funny the minute I saw that dear and I had one shot to</v>

2151
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:29.801
<v Speaker 3>get this to you because you,</v>

2152
00:58:29.801 --> 00:58:33.340
<v Speaker 3>you go all day looking for deer and you don't see what it was so cold.</v>

2153
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.730
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2154
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:34.930
<v Speaker 3>the minute I saw that book,</v>

2155
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.820
<v Speaker 3>My hat came off everything.</v>

2156
00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel anything.</v>

2157
00:58:38.021 --> 00:58:39.070
<v Speaker 3>I was just literally like,</v>

2158
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kill that fucking book.</v>

2159
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2160
00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a hunter and I don't really necessarily want to kill.</v>

2161
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:45.280
<v Speaker 3>So we were on a mission.</v>

2162
00:58:45.281 --> 00:58:45.910
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2163
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:49.390
<v Speaker 3>We were doing something that was very unusual for two guys that are in their</v>

2164
00:58:49.391 --> 00:58:51.790
<v Speaker 3>forties with kids living in La,</v>

2165
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.530
<v Speaker 3>in the entertainment business,</v>

2166
00:58:53.531 --> 00:58:55.640
<v Speaker 3>sort of sort of still in entertainment business.</v>

2167
00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 3>I do comedy shows,</v>

2168
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:59.170
<v Speaker 3>I guess the there on my own,</v>

2169
00:58:59.171 --> 00:58:59.590
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

2170
00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:00.350
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

2171
00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:00.910
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2172

2187
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:17.860
<v Speaker 3>They were all great guys and these guys are solid as fuck man.</v>

2188
00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:18.940
<v Speaker 3>They were a great audience.</v>

2189
00:59:18.941 --> 00:59:19.361
<v Speaker 3>Loved that.</v>

2190

<v Speaker 3>He just laughed at us fucking around all the time.</v>

2191
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:22.603
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2192
00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they'd probably ever done a show like that.</v>

2193
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.633
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2194
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Brian went like,</v>

2195
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:31.610
<v Speaker 2>from the moment we got there where I was full tilt from the moment we got there,</v>

2196
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:32.180
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2197
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.260
<v Speaker 2>this is all mining.</v>

2198
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.981
<v Speaker 2>See this,</v>

2199
00:59:33.981 --> 00:59:36.140
<v Speaker 2>this is a longterm strip mining.</v>

2200
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:36.621
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

2201
00:59:36.621 --> 00:59:36.921
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2202
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:37.131
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2203
00:59:37.131 --> 00:59:38.210
<v Speaker 2>this is the Missouri River.</v>

2204
00:59:38.211 --> 00:59:39.410
<v Speaker 2>You fucked this cut through this.</v>

2205
00:59:39.411 --> 00:59:42.040
<v Speaker 2>It used to be the great western indigency no,</v>

2206
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:42.111
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2207
00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:42.231
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2208
00:59:42.231 --> 00:59:42.900
<v Speaker 2>This is mine.</v>

2209
00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to Steve Right now.</v>

2210
00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:47.040
<v Speaker 2>It's been there and I grew up there like,</v>

2211
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.541
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2212
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:48.160
<v Speaker 2>this is my,</v>

2213
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:48.620
<v Speaker 2>this is not.</v>

2214
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:49.251
<v Speaker 2>This is all natural.</v>

2215
00:59:49.251 --> 00:59:49.910
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2216
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:50.743
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong about that.</v>

2217
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.793
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

2218
00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:56.980
<v Speaker 2>right away he gets into his ridiculous character and then it gets gay or queer</v>

2219
00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:58.283
<v Speaker 2>cracking.</v>

2220
00:59:58.410 --> 00:59:59.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm cracking jokes.</v>

2221
00:59:59.331 --> 01:00:00.320
<v Speaker 2>So as long as cracking job,</v>

2222
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.640
<v Speaker 2>that's all I'm living for at that point.</v>

2223
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.271
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

2224
01:00:02.271 --> 01:00:04.130
<v Speaker 2>if I got an audience I can just see Joe's eyes.</v>

2225
01:00:04.131 --> 01:00:05.030
<v Speaker 2>They're slits and he's like,</v>

2226
01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.790
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2227
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.630
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking it.</v>

2228
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:08.463
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2229
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.040
<v Speaker 2>it was seriously no bullshit.</v>

2230
01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Like going on a five day comedy show where inbetween you took breaks to go.</v>

2231
01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.640
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot on camera.</v>

2232
01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:16.940
<v Speaker 2>We got it.</v>

2233
01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.620
<v Speaker 2>We got to steal it and put it on the fucking.</v>

2234
01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Well there's certain things like they said that they were going to give it to us</v>

2235
01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:24.230
<v Speaker 2>because they could never put it on their show,</v>

2236
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:25.560
<v Speaker 2>but he a</v>

2237
01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:27.360
<v Speaker 3>lot of control on this show.</v>

2238
01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:29.970
<v Speaker 3>I think it's on the sportsmans channel,</v>

2239
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:31.950
<v Speaker 3>one of those channels towards hunting shows,</v>

2240
01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:32.701
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

2241
01:00:32.701 --> 01:00:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I watch now and watch all these hunting shows.</v>

2242
01:00:34.561 --> 01:00:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm fucking recording them and watching hunting channels that you do it.</v>

2243
01:00:37.411 --> 01:00:38.680
<v Speaker 3>It's so fast and you know what it's like,</v>

2244
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.900
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get it.</v>

2245
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.130
<v Speaker 3>You're in the middle of nowhere.</v>

2246
01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.890
<v Speaker 3>You never going to see this topography and then you see a deer,</v>

2247
01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:45.810
<v Speaker 3>you see like something that you could actually get.</v>

2248
01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:46.610
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2249
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:47.850
<v Speaker 3>I love deer meat by the way,</v>

2250
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:48.000
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2251
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:48.320
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2252
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.070
<v Speaker 3>you see it and you're like everything.</v>

2253
01:00:50.071 --> 01:00:51.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like winning the lottery.</v>

2254
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:52.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like almost sudden you're like,</v>

2255
01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2256
01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.150
<v Speaker 3>this whole rush,</v>

2257
01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:54.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2258
01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.980
<v Speaker 3>of discovering something new.</v>

2259
01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:56.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2260
01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.050
<v Speaker 3>you're in their world.</v>

2261
01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the weirdest thing about what it is,</v>

2262
01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:03.810
<v Speaker 3>is when you do this sort of what they call immersion hunting.</v>

2263
01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:04.590
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2264
01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:07.140
<v Speaker 3>we basically went into the wild,</v>

2265
01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:09.300
<v Speaker 3>like the real legitimate wild.</v>

2266
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not a road that's untraveled.</v>

2267
01:01:11.641 --> 01:01:12.930
<v Speaker 3>People travel it every year,</v>

2268
01:01:12.931 --> 01:01:14.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that many.</v>

2269
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:16.740
<v Speaker 3>And the people that are traveling are all doing what you're doing.</v>

2270
01:01:16.741 --> 01:01:18.900
<v Speaker 3>They're all sneaking up on deers and shooting them.</v>

2271
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:20.640
<v Speaker 3>And while we were there,</v>

2272
01:01:20.641 --> 01:01:21.870
<v Speaker 3>we were there for five days.</v>

2273
01:01:21.871 --> 01:01:23.760
<v Speaker 3>We saw three other canoes.</v>

2274
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.120
<v Speaker 3>So that was it to two other campsites.</v>

2275
01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.190
<v Speaker 3>So what it is,</v>

2276
01:01:29.191 --> 01:01:33.990
<v Speaker 3>is this really inhospitable terrain that occasionally,</v>

2277
01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:34.231
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2278
01:01:34.231 --> 01:01:36.810
<v Speaker 3>every couple of days or so a new person will venture into.</v>

2279
01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:38.790
<v Speaker 3>And it's that crazy.</v>

2280
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:40.500
<v Speaker 3>It's another world.</v>

2281
01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.360
<v Speaker 3>This world doesn't have any cell phone signal.</v>

2282
01:01:42.361 --> 01:01:43.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't see a building anywhere.</v>

2283
01:01:43.681 --> 01:01:47.610
<v Speaker 3>You get on top of the mountain and you climb up for hours,</v>

2284
01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:52.620
<v Speaker 3>you get to the top and you look out and it's Kinda scary because you don't see</v>

2285
01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:55.500
<v Speaker 3>shit for anywhere to the left or to the right.</v>

2286
01:01:55.501 --> 01:01:57.660
<v Speaker 3>It's more of these hills and valleys,</v>

2287
01:01:57.661 --> 01:01:59.520
<v Speaker 3>hills and valleys and no help.</v>

2288
01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:00.570
<v Speaker 3>No stores,</v>

2289
01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:01.523
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>

2290
01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:05.340
<v Speaker 3>So you got what you brought with you and what you can kill here and cook.</v>

2291
01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:06.203
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2292
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:06.961
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

2293
01:02:06.961 --> 01:02:11.850
<v Speaker 3>And so when you creep up on a deer and wind up shooting that deer and killing</v>

2294
01:02:11.851 --> 01:02:11.971
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2295
01:02:11.971 --> 01:02:13.320
<v Speaker 3>like you like entered into a,</v>

2296
01:02:13.321 --> 01:02:15.150
<v Speaker 3>like a different reality,</v>

2297
01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.920
<v Speaker 3>you like plugged into this different reality of hunting also.</v>

2298
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 7>Like I thought the most profound part of it was butchering my own deer.</v>

2299
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:23.401
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2300
01:02:23.401 --> 01:02:25.480
<v Speaker 7>And I'll tell you why it was we,</v>

2301
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:27.600
<v Speaker 7>we have a real disconnect to the food we'd right.</v>

2302
01:02:27.601 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 7>So you go to Mcdonald's and you're eating a steer that was maybe killed,</v>

2303
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:32.970
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how many months ago,</v>

2304
01:02:32.971 --> 01:02:33.320
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2305
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:33.610
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2306
01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:33.990
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2307
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:38.200
<v Speaker 7>and then the skin by some stranger and then quartered and put together and grind</v>

2308
01:02:38.201 --> 01:02:40.650
<v Speaker 7>in process with other beef cows.</v>

2309
01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:41.610
<v Speaker 7>And it's a mixture of shit,</v>

2310
01:02:41.611 --> 01:02:42.960
<v Speaker 7>maybe some of the cows came from China,</v>

2311
01:02:42.961 --> 01:02:45.360
<v Speaker 7>so I'm guessing it's the same thing with chicken and stuff and you see there's a</v>

2312
01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Speaker 7>real disconnect with the kind of the animal protein that we don't know how it's</v>

2313
01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:49.861
<v Speaker 7>lived.</v>

2314
01:02:49.861 --> 01:02:50.790
<v Speaker 7>We don't know how it's suffered.</v>

2315
01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:51.630
<v Speaker 7>We don't know anything about it.</v>

2316
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.130
<v Speaker 7>And that's always bothered me.</v>

2317
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.190
<v Speaker 7>And one of the things I thought was there were two things I found profound</v>

2318
01:02:56.191 --> 01:02:56.640
<v Speaker 7>about,</v>

2319
01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.820
<v Speaker 7>about not only killing a deer with that rifle,</v>

2320
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:00.010
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2321
01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.500
<v Speaker 7>the force and the feeling of it,</v>

2322
01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:02.070
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2323
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:02.850
<v Speaker 7>but also,</v>

2324
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:03.210
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2325
01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:04.260
<v Speaker 7>then butchering the meat,</v>

2326
01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.400
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2327
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:05.661
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2328
01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:07.710
<v Speaker 7>the intimate process of,</v>

2329
01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:12.830
<v Speaker 7>of gutting a deer and harvesting the liver and the heart.</v>

2330
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.000
<v Speaker 7>And then,</v>

2331
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.720
<v Speaker 7>and then cutting a skinning it and cutting into that,</v>

2332
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:18.270
<v Speaker 7>that meat that you're going to eat,</v>

2333
01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.560
<v Speaker 7>the heat,</v>

2334
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:22.350
<v Speaker 7>the heat from the inside of its body because you got to get in there,</v>

2335
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.881
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>

2336
01:03:22.881 --> 01:03:23.080
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2337
01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:23.730
<v Speaker 7>I had blood,</v>

2338
01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:24.380
<v Speaker 7>we both had blood.</v>

2339
01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.340
<v Speaker 7>I had passed my wrists.</v>

2340
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.610
<v Speaker 7>And the intimate process of doing that,</v>

2341
01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.760
<v Speaker 7>the smell and the feel and the temperature,</v>

2342
01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:35.020
<v Speaker 7>you really get a sense of the,</v>

2343
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.040
<v Speaker 7>the vast discrepancy between life and death and our own biology and how fragile,</v>

2344
01:03:40.531 --> 01:03:40.890
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2345
01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:42.000
<v Speaker 7>we are like,</v>

2346
01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:43.460
<v Speaker 7>you see what a scalpel,</v>

2347
01:03:43.461 --> 01:03:47.370
<v Speaker 7>what a small knife can do to muscle and skin and sinew.</v>

2348
01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.720
<v Speaker 7>It's frightening.</v>

2349
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:51.420
<v Speaker 7>It's frightening how easy it is to gut a deer,</v>

2350
01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:53.100
<v Speaker 7>which is much stronger animal than I am.</v>

2351
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.850
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2352
01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:54.030
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

2353
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.590
<v Speaker 7>it's just frightening to think about.</v>

2354
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.370
<v Speaker 7>So it creates in your,</v>

2355
01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:02.390
<v Speaker 7>in your own sort of visceral sense of true vulnerability and more importantly,</v>

2356
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.310
<v Speaker 7>our own biology and I,</v>

2357
01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:10.200
<v Speaker 7>I then had a very strong understanding that idea of how easy it was for hunter</v>

2358
01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:14.670
<v Speaker 7>gatherer or even our very recent ancestors to kill another human being.</v>

2359
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:19.170
<v Speaker 7>Because when you kill an animal and you butcher it and you get that close to its</v>

2360
01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.710
<v Speaker 7>body and its heart and its life force and then you see it go away.</v>

2361
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:27.450
<v Speaker 7>Killing a human being would be exactly the same thing and a lot of ways because</v>

2362
01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:28.710
<v Speaker 7>it's just another animal.</v>

2363
01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:31.620
<v Speaker 7>Now obviously we have different motifs on what a human being is.</v>

2364
01:04:31.621 --> 01:04:33.000
<v Speaker 7>They have a conscience and all that and blah,</v>

2365
01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:33.151
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

2366
01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

2367
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:38.040
<v Speaker 7>but I'm just saying that I can understand how a hunter would make a very good</v>

2368
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.290
<v Speaker 7>and ready warrior.</v>

2369
01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:39.740
<v Speaker 7>There's A.</v>

2370
01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:40.573
<v Speaker 7>There's a very,</v>

2371
01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:45.650
<v Speaker 7>very thin divide and most of us as men in today's world don't ever experience</v>

2372
01:04:46.531 --> 01:04:47.364
<v Speaker 7>either one.</v>

2373
01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.880
<v Speaker 7>We don't have experienced death that that intimately.</v>

2374
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:54.210
<v Speaker 7>We don't experience even fighting that intimately.</v>

2375
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.590
<v Speaker 7>Everything has to be simulation.</v>

2376
01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:59.190
<v Speaker 7>It has to be either a fucking video game or a legitimate.</v>

2377
01:04:59.220 --> 01:04:59.820
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2378
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.840
<v Speaker 7>but not even that.</v>

2379
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.390
<v Speaker 7>You're saying a Jujitsu match.</v>

2380
01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.540
<v Speaker 7>That's the rarest of the rare.</v>

2381
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.250
<v Speaker 7>Usually it's an argument in traffic.</v>

2382
01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:05.671
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2383
01:05:05.671 --> 01:05:05.870
<v Speaker 7>I'm.</v>

2384
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:08.750
<v Speaker 7>That's virtually no testing yourself.</v>

2385
01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:09.603
<v Speaker 7>Like right.</v>

2386
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:11.850
<v Speaker 7>No connection to life and death like that.</v>

2387
01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2388
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:13.750
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's one of the grateful.</v>

2389
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:15.300
<v Speaker 7>It made me warm,</v>

2390
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 7>respectful of deer of the being</v>

2391
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 2>up being with a hunter like Ryan or Steve.</v>

2392
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>What you realize actually is at hunters to be an effective hunter,</v>

2393
01:05:24.731 --> 01:05:27.160
<v Speaker 2>the irony is you have to have a deep,</v>

2394
01:05:27.161 --> 01:05:28.030
<v Speaker 2>deep respect,</v>

2395
01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:31.360
<v Speaker 2>love and understanding of the animal.</v>

2396
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:36.280
<v Speaker 2>It's behavior and of the environment in which you are now a guest in.</v>

2397
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:36.431
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2398
01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:36.731
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2399
01:05:36.731 --> 01:05:37.564
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy.</v>

2400
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:38.471
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy.</v>

2401
01:05:38.471 --> 01:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2402
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 2>people think you're just going out there and shooting defenseless animals.</v>

2403
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:41.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2404
01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:42.100
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

2405
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:45.940
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing is you're going out and getting your own meat and it's a</v>

2406
01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.290
<v Speaker 2>difficult fucking process.</v>

2407
01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:49.810
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult and you guys were really good at it.</v>

2408
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Those guys love every aspect of it.</v>

2409
01:05:52.271 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 2>The ryans and the Steve,</v>

2410
01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Steve Rainelle and Ryan Callahan.</v>

2411
01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Those guys that took us out there.</v>

2412
01:05:56.830 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 2>They love every aspect of their conservationists.</v>

2413
01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2414
01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.510
<v Speaker 2>true conservationist.</v>

2415
01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.330
<v Speaker 2>They follow the rules to a t.</v>

2416
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.460
<v Speaker 2>They know every rule for every area of their hunting.</v>

2417
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:07.930
<v Speaker 2>The pay attention to all of it.</v>

2418
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Like where we were at,</v>

2419
01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:12.050
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't use two way communication so no one could say like,</v>

2420
01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:12.251
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2421
01:06:12.251 --> 01:06:12.971
<v Speaker 2>we saw some deer,</v>

2422
01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:13.201
<v Speaker 2>this one,</v>

2423
01:06:13.201 --> 01:06:14.890
<v Speaker 2>and you can't say that over the radio.</v>

2424
01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:15.590
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal.</v>

2425
01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what happened to me when I was hunting?</v>

2426
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.490
<v Speaker 2>It changed my political point of view a little bit.</v>

2427
01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2428
01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:19.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2429
01:06:19.361 --> 01:06:20.010
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

2430
01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2431
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2432
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:23.470
<v Speaker 2>this is weird because I was talking about being a libertarian and everything</v>

2433
01:06:23.471 --> 01:06:23.651
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

2434
01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:28.651
<v Speaker 2>but then I realized the value and the importance of having strong regulation and</v>

2435
01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:33.040
<v Speaker 2>rules for because if you talk to hunters and people are really know without</v>

2436
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 2>really strong anti poaching laws,</v>

2437
01:06:35.021 --> 01:06:35.650
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2438
01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:38.470
<v Speaker 2>are really strong regulation by the fish and game service,</v>

2439
01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:43.060
<v Speaker 2>you would have everybody that I've talked to a grace,</v>

2440
01:06:43.061 --> 01:06:45.580
<v Speaker 2>you'd have major abuses by assholes,</v>

2441
01:06:45.581 --> 01:06:50.410
<v Speaker 2>just machine gunning the whole fucking side of that Ridge when they saw rams and</v>

2442
01:06:50.411 --> 01:06:55.060
<v Speaker 2>you'd have no game left and in fact American history and history in the Middle</v>

2443
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:55.893
<v Speaker 2>East certainly that I know of,</v>

2444
01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:57.730
<v Speaker 2>but bears that out,</v>

2445
01:06:57.731 --> 01:06:58.211
<v Speaker 2>that that,</v>

2446
01:06:58.211 --> 01:07:00.220
<v Speaker 2>that people always over hunted,</v>

2447
01:07:00.221 --> 01:07:03.430
<v Speaker 2>they always overfished and they continued to do that.</v>

2448
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:05.590
<v Speaker 2>People are concerned that they wouldn't.</v>

2449
01:07:05.591 --> 01:07:05.840
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

2450
01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.070
<v Speaker 2>when our ancestors figured out that you could run woolly mammoths off a cliff,</v>

2451
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.740
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

2452
01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:10.930
<v Speaker 2>William man has disappeared.</v>

2453
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2454
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.491
<v Speaker 2>and they start.</v>

2455
01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

2456
01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:13.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

2457
01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.400
<v Speaker 2>this is what happens.</v>

2458
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:20.430
<v Speaker 2>So human beings actually can be very short sighted and can like kind of not do</v>

2459
01:07:20.891 --> 01:07:21.850
<v Speaker 2>what's in their best interest.</v>

2460
01:07:21.851 --> 01:07:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you need,</v>

2461
01:07:22.721 --> 01:07:23.081
<v Speaker 2>you need,</v>

2462
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:23.471
<v Speaker 2>you need,</v>

2463
01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:24.430
<v Speaker 2>you need some regulation.</v>

2464
01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:24.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2465
01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:25.330
<v Speaker 2>you didn't.</v>

2466
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:27.520
<v Speaker 2>You didn't think that the fishing game,</v>

2467
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:28.810
<v Speaker 2>that was a good idea,</v>

2468
01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:29.710
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know.</v>

2469
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:30.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about it.</v>

2470
01:07:30.971 --> 01:07:34.060
<v Speaker 2>I just always have a visceral reaction to any government organization and I go,</v>

2471
01:07:34.061 --> 01:07:34.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2472
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.470
<v Speaker 2>are they making it worse or better?</v>

2473
01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2474
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.810
<v Speaker 2>there are some very good and important.</v>

2475
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:40.060
<v Speaker 2>They're the probably government regulation.</v>

2476
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.710
<v Speaker 2>It's all done by hunters.</v>

2477
01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.660
<v Speaker 2>It's all done by people who will hopefully.</v>

2478
01:07:43.661 --> 01:07:46.570
<v Speaker 2>I think there was some dispute about who was going to be in charge of it.</v>

2479
01:07:46.571 --> 01:07:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like people who are more animal rights oriented.</v>

2480
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:50.081
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2481
01:07:50.081 --> 01:07:54.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust her neighbor and Ela and guys like Ryan have are huge believers in</v>

2482
01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.000
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

2483
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.530
<v Speaker 2>A huge lovers of animals.</v>

2484
01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2485
01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:57.611
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing is,</v>

2486
01:07:57.611 --> 01:07:58.444
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2487
01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:02.980
<v Speaker 2>the people can't deny that it needs to be done because there's only two options.</v>

2488
01:08:02.981 --> 01:08:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Either you hunt the animals or you reintroduce predators,</v>

2489
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.230
<v Speaker 2>and when you reintroduce predators,</v>

2490
01:08:08.231 --> 01:08:09.700
<v Speaker 2>you've got a whole new set of problems.</v>

2491
01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:10.241
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2492
01:08:10.241 --> 01:08:12.550
<v Speaker 2>you've cut down on some eat free meat.</v>

2493
01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:15.470
<v Speaker 2>So unless you're saying that people should stop eating meat.</v>

2494
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

2495
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.980
<v Speaker 3>You've cut down on the amount of meat you've,</v>

2496
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.240
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

2497
01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.080
<v Speaker 3>you've cut down on the most humane way of ever harvesting an animal,</v>

2498
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:26.960
<v Speaker 3>letting the animal live his entire life wild and normal and undisturbed until</v>

2499
01:08:26.961 --> 01:08:27.794
<v Speaker 3>you take it,</v>

2500
01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.310
<v Speaker 3>so literally as a free animal and you go and earn it and get that animal.</v>

2501
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:34.880
<v Speaker 3>It's an animal trapped in a pen that you forced into a corralled area.</v>

2502
01:08:34.881 --> 01:08:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Then it gets a piston through the brain.</v>

2503
01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:40.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's the main plot,</v>

2504
01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:43.580
<v Speaker 3>so I don't understand why you would want people to stop doing it.</v>

2505
01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Is it the idea that people are upset at the idea of someone actually taking the</v>

2506
01:08:49.221 --> 01:08:50.210
<v Speaker 3>life themselves?</v>

2507
01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:50.451
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2508
01:08:50.451 --> 01:08:51.350
<v Speaker 3>that must be.</v>

2509
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:53.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the only argument I can see.</v>

2510
01:08:53.331 --> 01:08:53.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2511
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:54.481
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's stayed.</v>

2512
01:08:54.481 --> 01:08:58.100
<v Speaker 3>They recognize that that connection between taking that animal and you,</v>

2513
01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:01.400
<v Speaker 3>that animals is very close to the connection of taking a human life.</v>

2514
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:03.110
<v Speaker 3>My issue with hunting is like I would.</v>

2515
01:09:03.150 --> 01:09:06.230
<v Speaker 3>I would not hunt a bear or a lion or something that I'm not going to eat.</v>

2516
01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.161
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in that.</v>

2517
01:09:07.161 --> 01:09:08.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't like hunting.</v>

2518
01:09:08.301 --> 01:09:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Mountain lions stays good.</v>

2519
01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Steven Ellis said that mountain lion steak is delicious.</v>

2520
01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:12.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2521
01:09:12.531 --> 01:09:13.081
<v Speaker 3>I read it.</v>

2522
01:09:13.081 --> 01:09:14.120
<v Speaker 3>He talks about it in the book.</v>

2523
01:09:14.121 --> 01:09:15.820
<v Speaker 3>He's got tasting notes on mountain lions.</v>

2524
01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.700
<v Speaker 3>Pretty funny on the media,</v>

2525
01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:17.631
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2526
01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:18.110
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2527
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2528
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.071
<v Speaker 3>it's actually,</v>

2529
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:19.291
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2530
01:09:19.291 --> 01:09:22.490
<v Speaker 3>it's hit or miss with mountain lions sometimes it's so string you can't even</v>

2531
01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.080
<v Speaker 3>literally can't even chew into it.</v>

2532
01:09:24.090 --> 01:09:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Then other times you gotta if you roast it for a long time in a stew,</v>

2533
01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:29.410
<v Speaker 3>like a slow cooker,</v>

2534
01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:30.860
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a pale meat in it.</v>

2535
01:09:30.861 --> 01:09:31.450
<v Speaker 3>It's got,</v>

2536
01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:32.360
<v Speaker 3>it's got an okay taste.</v>

2537
01:09:32.361 --> 01:09:33.410
<v Speaker 3>But in fact,</v>

2538
01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:33.870
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

2539
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:37.270
<v Speaker 3>eating predators that eat that live on animal protein is,</v>

2540
01:09:37.271 --> 01:09:40.060
<v Speaker 3>is not such a good idea except fish except for fish.</v>

2541
01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Fish are all delicious.</v>

2542
01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:42.044
<v Speaker 3>Lead fish.</v>

2543
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2544
01:09:42.351 --> 01:09:42.980
<v Speaker 3>that's a good point.</v>

2545
01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 3>That's why you catch them with lures.</v>

2546
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.870
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2547
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:46.920
<v Speaker 3>but fucks with a,</v>

2548
01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.350
<v Speaker 3>it's like throwing a robot in front of you that you think you could fuck it.</v>

2549
01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.580
<v Speaker 3>Dive on an Prong,</v>

2550
01:09:51.581 --> 01:09:54.050
<v Speaker 3>sticking your ass hole and you get dragged into another dimension.</v>

2551
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like so rude about what you say.</v>

2552
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like rude things to eat.</v>

2553
01:09:58.971 --> 01:09:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Things with their face.</v>

2554
01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:00.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2555
01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:01.640
<v Speaker 3>You catch them by the face?</v>

2556
01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2557
01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2558
01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:03.910
<v Speaker 3>the dive sites,</v>

2559
01:10:03.911 --> 01:10:04.840
<v Speaker 3>so afraid of the ocean.</v>

2560
01:10:04.841 --> 01:10:05.120
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2561
01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.350
<v Speaker 3>It's shouldn't be.</v>

2562
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the ocean at night?</v>

2563
01:10:07.611 --> 01:10:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Dark when it's dark.</v>

2564
01:10:08.481 --> 01:10:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Pitch Five.</v>

2565
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:10.040
<v Speaker 3>I've been on it in a boat before.</v>

2566
01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:10.761
<v Speaker 3>It was terrifying.</v>

2567
01:10:10.761 --> 01:10:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>

2568
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.940
<v Speaker 3>My parents lived on a sailboat for a couple of years.</v>

2569
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:14.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2570
01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:14.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2571
01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:19.000
<v Speaker 3>My parents got a wild hair across the ass and they decided to retire and kicked</v>

2572
01:10:19.001 --> 01:10:22.220
<v Speaker 3>back for Awhile and my dad just stopped working for a few years.</v>

2573
01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.110
<v Speaker 3>He went back to work afterwards,</v>

2574
01:10:24.111 --> 01:10:27.700
<v Speaker 3>but he stopped working for a few years and just sailed around the world.</v>

2575
01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.270
<v Speaker 3>They lived in the Bahamas for awhile.</v>

2576
01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.950
<v Speaker 3>They looking for and they get stuck in a hurricane.</v>

2577
01:10:30.951 --> 01:10:31.661
<v Speaker 3>Once you have it,</v>

2578
01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:33.350
<v Speaker 3>then I always worry about pirates and things.</v>

2579
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:34.243
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2580
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:35.120
<v Speaker 3>I need.</v>

2581
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I can have a turret gun and if I can,</v>

2582
01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:42.170
<v Speaker 3>50 caliber sniper rifle and a seal team following me until we address the</v>

2583
01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:43.250
<v Speaker 3>imbalance of the world.</v>

2584
01:10:43.251 --> 01:10:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Brian calendar is always going to be pirates.</v>

2585
01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:46.830
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2586
01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:47.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2587
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:48.210
<v Speaker 3>we always,</v>

2588
01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:48.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2589
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.140
<v Speaker 3>we're always concerned with fattening up our own pockets,</v>

2590
01:10:51.141 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 3>but unless we feed those poor people of Somalia,</v>

2591
01:10:53.931 --> 01:10:55.370
<v Speaker 3>they're going to keep doing what they want to do.</v>

2592
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:56.780
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2593
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.950
<v Speaker 3>How do you fix that?</v>

2594
01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 3>Like the Somalia thing,</v>

2595
01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:03.130
<v Speaker 3>so it's literally an area the size of Texas are known.</v>

2596
01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:04.011
<v Speaker 3>The Western Europe.</v>

2597
01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:04.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

2598
01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:08.060
<v Speaker 3>that area that they talk about is so vast and yes,</v>

2599
01:11:08.061 --> 01:11:10.880
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have very poor people who come in and go,</v>

2600
01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:11.180
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

2601
01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:14.180
<v Speaker 3>let's hijack that very big boat and take whatever.</v>

2602
01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:14.690
<v Speaker 3>You don't even,</v>

2603
01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:14.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2604
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:15.521
<v Speaker 3>how it started.</v>

2605
01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the Somalian thing started,</v>

2606
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:21.450
<v Speaker 3>they call themselves the volunteer coastguard of Somalia because what happened</v>

2607
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:26.451
<v Speaker 3>was the Somalian people were essentially fishermen and European started dumping</v>

2608
01:11:26.941 --> 01:11:28.860
<v Speaker 3>toxic waste off their and fishing.</v>

2609
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:29.694
<v Speaker 3>They're shorts,</v>

2610
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.661
<v Speaker 3>overfishing,</v>

2611
01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:34.100
<v Speaker 3>their shores with nets and shit and using,</v>

2612
01:11:34.101 --> 01:11:34.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2613
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.373
<v Speaker 3>did you hear that?</v>

2614
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.720
<v Speaker 3>Or was it just made you hear that pop?</v>

2615
01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:42.230
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hear you and polluting it with all sorts of toxic waste and just fucked</v>

2616
01:11:44.371 --> 01:11:45.310
<v Speaker 3>up their whole ecosystem.</v>

2617
01:11:45.311 --> 01:11:46.980
<v Speaker 3>So all of a sudden these people can't fish anymore.</v>

2618
01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:48.960
<v Speaker 3>So they started holding these people captive,</v>

2619
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:52.350
<v Speaker 3>they would catch one of these fishing boat or when these boats dumping shit off</v>

2620
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:52.771
<v Speaker 3>their coast,</v>

2621
01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:55.500
<v Speaker 3>they would kidnap them and they would demand a ransom because you guys are</v>

2622
01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:56.430
<v Speaker 3>fucked up our fishing,</v>

2623
01:11:56.431 --> 01:11:57.264
<v Speaker 3>we want some money,</v>

2624
01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:58.111
<v Speaker 3>and then they realize,</v>

2625
01:11:58.111 --> 01:11:58.411
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2626
01:11:58.411 --> 01:11:59.071
<v Speaker 3>fuck fishing,</v>

2627
01:11:59.071 --> 01:12:00.010
<v Speaker 3>let's just start jacking.</v>

2628
01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Do It's all these people are in boats.</v>

2629
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:02.060
<v Speaker 3>They all want.</v>

2630
01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's going to want them back.</v>

2631
01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.530
<v Speaker 3>And so they just started taking over boats.</v>

2632
01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.140
<v Speaker 3>So it was total chaos.</v>

2633
01:12:07.141 --> 01:12:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2634
01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.980
<v Speaker 3>I always think about that navy seal guy that actually on a boat as it was</v>

2635
01:12:10.981 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 3>bobbing up and down shot that dude with a headshot.</v>

2636
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.030
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

2637
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.620
<v Speaker 3>It's his boat was bobbing up and down.</v>

2638
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.660
<v Speaker 3>What you call good marksmanship.</v>

2639
01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:20.490
<v Speaker 3>If I used a mag 300,</v>

2640
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.710
<v Speaker 3>apparently the guy dropped that deer with it was what?</v>

2641
01:12:22.711 --> 01:12:23.430
<v Speaker 3>The seal team.</v>

2642
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Some of the seal teams and I produce.</v>

2643
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:26.070
<v Speaker 3>That was a sick gun.</v>

2644
01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.930
<v Speaker 3>The gun was pretty awesome.</v>

2645
01:12:27.931 --> 01:12:29.010
<v Speaker 3>It was really accurate.</v>

2646
01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:29.421
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2647
01:12:29.421 --> 01:12:31.680
<v Speaker 3>you shot really well till you dropped your deer at what?</v>

2648
01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred yards and then they said it was a great shot.</v>

2649
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:34.580
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

2650
01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:35.640
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to stay calm,</v>

2651
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:36.623
<v Speaker 3>but like I said,</v>

2652
01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm so used to doing things when I'm nervous.</v>

2653
01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.810
<v Speaker 3>I think it helped me to like knowing how to stay calm once I went,</v>

2654
01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:47.040
<v Speaker 3>once I remembered to just control my breathing and just focus on my trigger</v>

2655
01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:47.421
<v Speaker 3>finger.</v>

2656
01:12:47.421 --> 01:12:48.254
<v Speaker 3>It was everything stopped.</v>

2657
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:49.800
<v Speaker 3>It's so easy to say,</v>

2658
01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:51.360
<v Speaker 3>but it's so hard to get a calm,</v>

2659
01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.790
<v Speaker 3>relaxing because you're,</v>

2660
01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.170
<v Speaker 3>you're also trying to calm yourself down with a breath to begin with usually in</v>

2661
01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:00.480
<v Speaker 3>seconds because it's fucking thing is not going to stay still.</v>

2662
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:04.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not because things moving so as it's trying to be on your belly and you</v>

2663
01:13:04.531 --> 01:13:06.330
<v Speaker 3>know he had quills in your fucking leg.</v>

2664
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Steven Nyla blue,</v>

2665
01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:08.340
<v Speaker 3>a little horn that like,</v>

2666
01:13:08.341 --> 01:13:09.440
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a fun,</v>

2667
01:13:09.441 --> 01:13:09.940
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2668
01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:13.980
<v Speaker 3>like a little thing and the deer won't like this and then boom,</v>

2669
01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.360
<v Speaker 3>he just shot him.</v>

2670
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:15.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2671
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.980
<v Speaker 3>it's fucked up man.</v>

2672
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.900
<v Speaker 3>The whole process of it was fascinating.</v>

2673
01:13:18.901 --> 01:13:20.040
<v Speaker 3>Then eating it that night.</v>

2674
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2675
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.220
<v Speaker 3>you had gotten a deer and I was so worried I wasn't going to get a deer</v>

2676
01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.500
<v Speaker 3>and then I was like,</v>

2677
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:26.311
<v Speaker 3>we're going for a buck,</v>

2678
01:13:26.311 --> 01:13:29.560
<v Speaker 3>and then I found out we could actually shoot bucks her dose and and he turns out</v>

2679
01:13:29.561 --> 01:13:29.851
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>

2680
01:13:29.851 --> 01:13:30.500
<v Speaker 3>do you want to shoot a doe?</v>

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.170

2682
01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:32.040

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:32.371
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2684
01:13:32.371 --> 01:13:33.204
<v Speaker 3>I want to shoot.</v>

2685
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll shoot out a.</v>

2686
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:39.660
<v Speaker 3>that's a big issue for a lot of people are gonna shoot a girl.</v>

2687
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:39.841
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2688
01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:41.970
<v Speaker 3>you know what else is interesting about where we were hunting as they were</v>

2689
01:13:41.971 --> 01:13:43.590
<v Speaker 3>talking about the huge winter kills.</v>

2690
01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.140
<v Speaker 3>Most of those mule dealer don't make it through the winter</v>

2691
01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:49.650
<v Speaker 3>cold more than predators.</v>

2692
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Although we did find some mountain line shits.</v>

2693
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.330
<v Speaker 3>We found some big fat,</v>

2694
01:13:54.331 --> 01:13:56.400
<v Speaker 3>thick shit feeling filled with hair.</v>

2695
01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:56.851
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:57.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2698
01:13:57.631 --> 01:13:58.201

2699
01:13:58.201 --> 01:13:58.531
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2700
01:13:58.531 --> 01:14:01.170
<v Speaker 3>he goes out to either one hell of a coyote or a mountain lion.</v>

2701
01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.520
<v Speaker 3>It goes most likely amount line.</v>

2702
01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty big piece of shit.</v>

2703
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2704
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Big Fat Mountain Lion Asshole was as big as the shift that you took of me.</v>

2705
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2706
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:11.290
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2707
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Was different than your shit.</v>

2708
01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.410
<v Speaker 3>It was more like Midi.</v>

2709
01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2710
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:16.570
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any fucking vegetables or oatmeal in there.</v>

2711
01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2712
01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:17.800

2713
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.860
<v Speaker 3>I took a photo of Brian Shit and we played a flag.</v>

2714
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.840
<v Speaker 3>He made a tin foil flag,</v>

2715
01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:25.660
<v Speaker 3>posted planet it next to my shit,</v>

2716
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:26.583
<v Speaker 3>but I did this.</v>

2717
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I did a launch and presented it to him and he took a picture.</v>

2718
01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Hey Buddy.</v>

2719
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.720
<v Speaker 3>Well I was gonna say on twitter that Brian took the shit off the Missouri River</v>

2720
01:14:36.821 --> 01:14:38.010
<v Speaker 3>and we put a flag next to it.</v>

2721
01:14:38.011 --> 01:14:39.220
<v Speaker 3>If you can go find it,</v>

2722
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:40.890
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a thousand dollars.</v>

2723
01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.420
<v Speaker 3>And I was going to have a twitter contest to find brands shit.</v>

2724
01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:45.190
<v Speaker 3>But you have to use these,</v>

2725
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:46.360
<v Speaker 3>these waste bags.</v>

2726
01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:48.790
<v Speaker 3>You can't just leave your shit laying around on the Missouri River.</v>

2727
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:49.760
<v Speaker 3>It's foul.</v>

2728
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:54.590
<v Speaker 3>You have to dig it up and put it in these waste bags or shit in the bag itself.</v>

2729
01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:58.120
<v Speaker 3>And the bag has like some powdered chemical in it that kills the smell and use</v>

2730
01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.110
<v Speaker 3>zip it up and seal it.</v>

2731
01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:02.340
<v Speaker 3>So we had to essentially carry five days worth of shits with us.</v>

2732
01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:04.023
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing was,</v>

2733
01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:07.000
<v Speaker 3>is living like that was really fascinating.</v>

2734
01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:07.541
<v Speaker 3>And Man,</v>

2735
01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:10.060
<v Speaker 3>when we got back to that hotel room on the fifth day,</v>

2736
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:10.441
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2737
01:15:10.441 --> 01:15:10.840
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2738
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.201
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2739
01:15:11.201 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2740
01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:12.050
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2741
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.940
<v Speaker 3>we landed our boats.</v>

2742
01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:16.350
<v Speaker 3>We traveled like 40 something miles by canoe and you know,</v>

2743
01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.640
<v Speaker 3>everyday it was like six miles hiking.</v>

2744
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:20.830
<v Speaker 3>And when we got back stunk,</v>

2745
01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:22.030
<v Speaker 3>stunk,</v>

2746
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:22.690
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

2747
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:24.370
<v Speaker 3>But when I got in that shower,</v>

2748
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:25.151
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2749
01:15:25.151 --> 01:15:26.190
<v Speaker 3>I was so appreciative.</v>

2750
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.880
<v Speaker 3>We had a great meal with the wine.</v>

2751
01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.023
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

2752
01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:30.520
<v Speaker 3>What was the name of that place we went to?</v>

2753
01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.010

<v Speaker 3>It's just such a heartbreak,</v>

3001
01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:14.880
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3002
01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.200
<v Speaker 3>It's too bad I don't get it.</v>

3003
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:17.011
<v Speaker 3>I would have,</v>

3004
01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:18.690
<v Speaker 3>I would've thought that movie would have taken off.</v>

3005
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's just people were just like,</v>

3006
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.863
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

3007
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.690
<v Speaker 3>we got a problem.</v>

3008
01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Brian.</v>

3009
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.180
<v Speaker 3>The thing just popped.</v>

3010
01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Really launched as the headphone Jack.</v>

3011
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it is actually.</v>

3012
01:21:28.111 --> 01:21:28.944
<v Speaker 3>That's what it really.</v>

3013
01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:29.911
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

3014
01:21:29.911 --> 01:21:30.744
<v Speaker 3>how do you know?</v>

3015
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:34.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh you fuck you're moving things.</v>

3016
01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:35.970
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's popping.</v>

3017
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Ha solved the problem.</v>

3018
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Son of a bitch.</v>

3019
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:42.420
<v Speaker 3>This is a new thing actually that we got.</v>

3020
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.430
<v Speaker 3>I ordered one of those studio.</v>

3021
01:21:47.490 --> 01:21:47.791
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

3022
01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:48.624
<v Speaker 3>Where were we?</v>

3023
01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:51.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about</v>

3024
01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.070
<v Speaker 3>the movie only made $6,000,000 and it's heartbreak.</v>

3025
01:21:56.071 --> 01:21:58.620
<v Speaker 3>It's either writing anything in life and,</v>

3026
01:21:58.621 --> 01:21:59.281
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3027
01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:02.490
<v Speaker 3>doing a movie or I didn't and it takes a long time building a business.</v>

3028
01:22:02.491 --> 01:22:03.900
<v Speaker 3>It's all an act of faith man.</v>

3029
01:22:03.901 --> 01:22:04.501
<v Speaker 3>And guess what?</v>

3030
01:22:04.501 --> 01:22:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it just doesn't fucking work.</v>

3031
01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:10.530
<v Speaker 3>You just also problem is you're dealing with a giant group of people and trying</v>

3032
01:22:10.531 --> 01:22:11.790
<v Speaker 3>to everybody's vision,</v>

3033
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:16.560
<v Speaker 3>trying to funnel them into one sort of cohesive laser beam.</v>

3034
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Listen man.</v>

3035
01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like I told you I had to sit down with Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger.</v>

3036
01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Just just me,</v>

3037
01:22:21.841 --> 01:22:22.674
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

3038
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:24.083
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>

3039
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.260
<v Speaker 3>John Leguizamo.</v>

3040
01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:27.180
<v Speaker 3>You had a good time,</v>

3041
01:22:27.181 --> 01:22:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

3042
01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Well now what was the reason I bring it up as he was talking about being</v>

3043
01:22:30.601 --> 01:22:34.980
<v Speaker 3>governor for eight years and how fucking getting anything done.</v>

3044
01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.470
<v Speaker 3>It was basically impossible,</v>

3045
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:39.300
<v Speaker 3>so he'd have a really common sense measure,</v>

3046
01:22:39.301 --> 01:22:44.280
<v Speaker 3>let's say measuring the groundwater for farmers because we can use more of that</v>

3047
01:22:44.281 --> 01:22:45.480
<v Speaker 3>water to go,</v>

3048
01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:45.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3049
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:46.910
<v Speaker 3>we can use the.</v>

3050
01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.000
<v Speaker 3>We don't need all this water,</v>

3051
01:22:48.001 --> 01:22:51.390
<v Speaker 3>let's measure the ground you and we'll siphon the rest off and La and the</v>

3052
01:22:51.391 --> 01:22:52.290
<v Speaker 3>farmers look at him and go,</v>

3053
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:53.310
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3054
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:54.530
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to happen.</v>

3055
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:55.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3056
01:22:55.330 --> 01:22:55.980
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

3057
01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:58.380
<v Speaker 3>It's common sense will be right back.</v>

3058
01:22:58.650 --> 01:23:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Three hours later at seven Republican senators up in his office got Mr. Ms Dot</v>

3059
01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Gov.</v>

3060
01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.710
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell you we're not going to the ground water.</v>

3061
01:23:05.711 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 3>It's not</v>

3062
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:06.311
<v Speaker 2>going to happen,</v>

3063
01:23:06.311 --> 01:23:09.640
<v Speaker 2>but here's what we'll do you you call for a measuring of the groundwater and</v>

3064
01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 2>we'll act like a basically when and then the farmers won't let us on the land.</v>

3065
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Everybody went down and you get it.</v>

3066
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:15.461
<v Speaker 2>You get it now.</v>

3067
01:23:15.461 --> 01:23:15.841
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

3068
01:23:15.841 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Ha Ha.</v>

3069
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:17.370
<v Speaker 2>He's literally saying it's.</v>

3070
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.380
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with such powerful special interests.</v>

3071
01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:22.900
<v Speaker 2>He said the only thing I could do as a governor was Vito Shit,</v>

3072
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:23.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3073
01:23:23.441 --> 01:23:23.911
<v Speaker 2>and he.</v>

3074
01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:25.060
<v Speaker 2>So by the way,</v>

3075
01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:25.900
<v Speaker 2>talking to him,</v>

3076
01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.850
<v Speaker 2>he's so socially liberal.</v>

3077
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:28.211
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3078
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm right down the,</v>

3079
01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.330
<v Speaker 2>this guy he's talking about,</v>

3080
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:32.710
<v Speaker 2>he's just fiscally conservative.</v>

3081
01:23:32.711 --> 01:23:36.490
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about the insanity of the pull yourself up by the seat of your</v>

3082
01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Speaker 2>pants,</v>

3083
01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:38.770
<v Speaker 2>but he's also very socially liberal.</v>

3084
01:23:38.771 --> 01:23:39.521
<v Speaker 2>He believes in like,</v>

3085
01:23:39.521 --> 01:23:39.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3086
01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.541
<v Speaker 2>marriage and.</v>

3087
01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:40.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3088
01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:43.420
<v Speaker 2>And also like he believes that we should do something about global warming.</v>

3089
01:23:43.421 --> 01:23:44.470
<v Speaker 2>He's got regulations.</v>

3090
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.681
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

3091
01:23:44.681 --> 01:23:45.470
<v Speaker 2>he's a very.</v>

3092
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:46.181
<v Speaker 2>I'm right there.</v>

3093
01:23:46.181 --> 01:23:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm right with them on practically.</v>

3094
01:23:47.771 --> 01:23:50.760
<v Speaker 2>And as he was speaking he was just so fair minded and,</v>

3095
01:23:50.761 --> 01:23:53.350
<v Speaker 2>and but common sense measures,</v>

3096
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:57.340
<v Speaker 2>common sense farming policy in this country where you don't subsidize huge</v>

3097
01:23:57.341 --> 01:23:58.240
<v Speaker 2>factory farms.</v>

3098
01:23:58.630 --> 01:23:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Try doing that sometime.</v>

3099
01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Try getting elected.</v>

3100
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:01.950
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

3101
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:03.150
<v Speaker 2>this shit is the,</v>

3102
01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.020
<v Speaker 2>these people spend all day.</v>

3103
01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Do they spend all day down in Capital Hill?</v>

3104
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:08.500
<v Speaker 2>When's the last time you were petitioning?</v>

3105
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Capitalist system is stupid.</v>

3106
01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:11.500
<v Speaker 2>It's really stupid.</v>

3107
01:24:11.501 --> 01:24:11.891
<v Speaker 2>But you got,</v>

3108
01:24:11.891 --> 01:24:14.740
<v Speaker 2>you got big labor unions that can make or break your election.</v>

3109
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.300
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>

3110
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Obama's had been talking about special interest groups who's been talking about</v>

3111
01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:19.510
<v Speaker 2>getting where the lobbyists,</v>

3112
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:20.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3113
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:20.760
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3114
01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.140
<v Speaker 2>it's hard though because constitutionally you're allowed to petition your</v>

3115
01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:23.561
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

3116
01:24:23.561 --> 01:24:24.640
<v Speaker 2>So how do you get around that?</v>

3117
01:24:24.641 --> 01:24:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3118
01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:30.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is a way constitutionally the bill of rights used to also have a</v>

3119
01:24:30.761 --> 01:24:35.280
<v Speaker 2>lot of shit and it's not there anymore because of Patriot Act Nda.</v>

3120
01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.030
<v Speaker 2>You could easily fix that too.</v>

3121
01:24:37.090 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 2>You could just,</v>

3122
01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.360
<v Speaker 2>it seems like the idea of a lobbyist,</v>

3123
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:41.830
<v Speaker 2>it should be completely illegal.</v>

3124
01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.860
<v Speaker 2>It should be completely illegal that you can have something wrong with the fact</v>

3125
01:24:44.861 --> 01:24:47.800
<v Speaker 2>that all those counties around capital hill or the wealthiest counties and they</v>

3126
01:24:47.801 --> 01:24:50.230
<v Speaker 2>don't produce a goddamn thing just as lawyers and lobbyists,</v>

3127
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:51.640
<v Speaker 2>they don't produce anything.</v>

3128
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:53.020
<v Speaker 2>What they do is they go,</v>

3129
01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 2>they and holding up the various companies and they go and say,</v>

3130
01:24:56.081 --> 01:24:56.351
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3131
01:24:56.351 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Mr,</v>

3132
01:24:56.890 --> 01:24:57.661
<v Speaker 2>Mr Sen,</v>

3133
01:24:57.661 --> 01:24:58.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3134
01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:01.000
<v Speaker 2>you need to vote for this because it'll bring a lot of jobs also to your</v>

3135
01:25:01.001 --> 01:25:01.834
<v Speaker 2>constituency.</v>

3136
01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:05.710
<v Speaker 2>We need a new airplane and Boeing happens to have a plant.</v>

3137
01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:06.430
<v Speaker 2>There you will,</v>

3138
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:07.900
<v Speaker 2>you'll hire 1100 people.</v>

3139
01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Just vote for it.</v>

3140
01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3141
01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:12.370
<v Speaker 2>They don't look weak on defense system,</v>

3142
01:25:12.371 --> 01:25:13.204
<v Speaker 2>gangsters,</v>

3143
01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:17.560
<v Speaker 2>they find a system and they exploit the weaknesses in the system and that's</v>

3144
01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:18.520
<v Speaker 2>where we're at.</v>

3145
01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:21.070
<v Speaker 2>So we have to deal with all these weaknesses and he can't.</v>

3146
01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:22.240
<v Speaker 2>He can't just say,</v>

3147
01:25:22.241 --> 01:25:22.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3148
01:25:22.691 --> 01:25:23.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3149
01:25:23.141 --> 01:25:24.040
<v Speaker 2>this is fine.</v>

3150
01:25:24.041 --> 01:25:27.100
<v Speaker 2>We just need to add some more laws and the,</v>

3151
01:25:27.230 --> 01:25:27.551
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3152
01:25:27.551 --> 01:25:27.791
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3153
01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:28.001
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3154
01:25:28.001 --> 01:25:28.190
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3155
01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:30.490
<v Speaker 2>You gotta do it shouldn't be the whole thing.</v>

3156
01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.473
<v Speaker 2>Should be.</v>

3157
01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:36.620
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be parsed down to some really simple language and you need to get</v>

3158
01:25:37.511 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 2>all outside influence out of it.</v>

3159
01:25:40.181 --> 01:25:44.700
<v Speaker 2>It has to completely be the will of the people and if people choose to act like</v>

3160
01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:45.700
<v Speaker 2>in groups as far as like,</v>

3161
01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:46.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3162
01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.770
<v Speaker 2>religious groups on a boycott things or you know,</v>

3163
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:49.690
<v Speaker 2>certain people,</v>

3164
01:25:49.691 --> 01:25:53.560
<v Speaker 2>gay and lesbian people want to support things so they support gay marriage.</v>

3165
01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:54.131
<v Speaker 2>That's fine,</v>

3166
01:25:54.131 --> 01:25:55.150
<v Speaker 2>that's all good organized,</v>

3167
01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:56.200
<v Speaker 2>do whatever the fuck you want to do,</v>

3168
01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:01.440
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that you can get to the actual politicians get special favors.</v>

3169
01:26:03.531 --> 01:26:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3170
01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:04.370
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

3171
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:05.840
<v Speaker 3>database to make money.</v>

3172
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:06.231
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

3173
01:26:06.231 --> 01:26:06.831
<v Speaker 3>You make money.</v>

3174
01:26:06.831 --> 01:26:07.664
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3175
01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:08.690
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

3176
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:08.891
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3177
01:26:08.891 --> 01:26:09.724
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous.</v>

3178
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:10.580
<v Speaker 3>It should be illegal.</v>

3179
01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:11.990
<v Speaker 3>How is that not legal,</v>

3180
01:26:11.991 --> 01:26:13.790
<v Speaker 3>but yet insider trading is.</v>

3181
01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:15.170
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

3182
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:17.120
<v Speaker 3>That's not illegal,</v>

3183
01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:19.250
<v Speaker 3>but not illegal.</v>

3184
01:26:19.251 --> 01:26:19.570
<v Speaker 3>I met.</v>

3185
01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:20.020
<v Speaker 3>How is that?</v>

3186
01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Not only was I should've said,</v>

3187
01:26:21.261 --> 01:26:24.390
<v Speaker 3>how is that because you're legal and insider trading is illegal.</v>

3188
01:26:24.610 --> 01:26:25.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

3189
01:26:25.071 --> 01:26:26.370
<v Speaker 3>it's essentially you're,</v>

3190
01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.650
<v Speaker 3>it's all stealing.</v>

3191
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.600
<v Speaker 3>It's finding all these numbers and pulling them out of the system and sticking</v>

3192
01:26:32.601 --> 01:26:33.440
<v Speaker 3>them into your account.</v>

3193
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:35.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're doing some crazy shit.</v>

3194
01:26:35.451 --> 01:26:38.870
<v Speaker 3>You're influencing the way America runs.</v>

3195
01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Like literally democracy means freedom.</v>

3196
01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.800
<v Speaker 3>You're influencing personal freedom for sure,</v>

3197
01:26:42.801 --> 01:26:47.210
<v Speaker 3>but how many people are in private prisons right now due to nonviolent drug</v>

3198
01:26:47.211 --> 01:26:51.260
<v Speaker 3>offenses that are a direct result of lobbyists pushing for certain things to</v>

3199
01:26:51.261 --> 01:26:53.480
<v Speaker 3>remain illegal that is clear,</v>

3200
01:26:53.481 --> 01:26:58.481
<v Speaker 3>that is money influencing people's freedom that is literally shifting in degrees</v>

3201
01:26:59.061 --> 01:27:00.230
<v Speaker 3>left or to the right,</v>

3202
01:27:00.231 --> 01:27:00.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3203
01:27:00.501 --> 01:27:03.740
<v Speaker 3>as far as plus or minus how many people are incarcerated.</v>

3204
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:04.581
<v Speaker 7>That strikes me,</v>

3205
01:27:04.581 --> 01:27:04.911
<v Speaker 7>what you're,</v>

3206
01:27:04.911 --> 01:27:08.300
<v Speaker 7>what you're saying strikes me as the most important.</v>

3207
01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:13.540
<v Speaker 7>I believe that.</v>

3208
01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:13.811
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

3209
01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:14.201
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

3210
01:27:14.201 --> 01:27:14.480
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3211
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:14.820
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3212
01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:17.590
<v Speaker 7>I think it was James Madison said that special interest groups are,</v>

3213
01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:20.110
<v Speaker 7>have always been the threat to this form of system of government.</v>

3214
01:27:20.111 --> 01:27:20.501
<v Speaker 7>However,</v>

3215
01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:21.670
<v Speaker 7>they'll cancel each other out,</v>

3216
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:22.511
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>

3217
01:27:22.511 --> 01:27:26.350
<v Speaker 7>it's not happening in the group that has the strongest,</v>

3218
01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:27.430
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3219
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.731
<v Speaker 7>look at,</v>

3220
01:27:27.731 --> 01:27:29.080
<v Speaker 7>look at what organized labor.</v>

3221
01:27:29.081 --> 01:27:29.891
<v Speaker 7>I'm part of a union,</v>

3222
01:27:29.891 --> 01:27:31.120
<v Speaker 7>so I understand unions,</v>

3223
01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:32.500
<v Speaker 7>but some of these,</v>

3224
01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:35.110
<v Speaker 7>some of these fucking labor unions are just in.</v>

3225
01:27:35.111 --> 01:27:36.340
<v Speaker 7>I was talking to Schwarzenegger about this.</v>

3226
01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:37.360
<v Speaker 7>They're,</v>

3227
01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:37.820
<v Speaker 7>they're,</v>

3228
01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:39.440
<v Speaker 7>they're literally lobbying and they,</v>

3229
01:27:39.441 --> 01:27:40.151
<v Speaker 7>and they get it.</v>

3230
01:27:40.151 --> 01:27:42.670
<v Speaker 7>They lobby for when they retire after 15,</v>

3231
01:27:42.671 --> 01:27:43.504
<v Speaker 7>20 years.</v>

3232
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:46.570
<v Speaker 7>They get 95 percent of their salary or whatever it is for the rest of their</v>

3233
01:27:46.571 --> 01:27:47.020
<v Speaker 7>lives.</v>

3234
01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:47.710
<v Speaker 7>Now that,</v>

3235
01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:48.520
<v Speaker 7>who says,</v>

3236
01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:51.520
<v Speaker 7>we can't afford that if bankrupt the state,</v>

3237
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:53.920
<v Speaker 7>they have bankrupt the state.</v>

3238
01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:55.000
<v Speaker 7>It's not just,</v>

3239
01:27:55.001 --> 01:27:55.161
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

3240
01:27:55.161 --> 01:27:59.110
<v Speaker 7>it's all different kinds of organized groups of labor who look at the,</v>

3241
01:27:59.111 --> 01:28:01.720
<v Speaker 7>look at what the auto united auto workers union did to itself.</v>

3242
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:02.180
<v Speaker 7>You,</v>

3243
01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.530
<v Speaker 7>you could retire with 95 percent of your pension for the rest of your life and</v>

3244
01:28:05.531 --> 01:28:07.750
<v Speaker 7>your whole family had benefits for the rest of their lives.</v>

3245
01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:08.613
<v Speaker 7>What are you talking about?</v>

3246
01:28:08.770 --> 01:28:09.011
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3247
01:28:09.011 --> 01:28:09.730
<v Speaker 7>you can't afford.</v>

3248
01:28:09.730 --> 01:28:14.730
<v Speaker 7>You couldn't sell enough cars to support your pension plan states the truth.</v>

3249
01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:16.570
<v Speaker 7>That's exactly what,</v>

3250
01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:16.641
<v Speaker 7>how,</v>

3251
01:28:16.641 --> 01:28:17.120
<v Speaker 7>what happened?</v>

3252
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:17.900
<v Speaker 7>The five percent,</v>

3253
01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:19.210
<v Speaker 7>95 percent of your salary.</v>

3254
01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:19.271
<v Speaker 7>You.</v>

3255
01:28:19.271 --> 01:28:21.160
<v Speaker 7>So are you going to go out and look for another job?</v>

3256
01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.113
<v Speaker 7>Of course not.</v>

3257
01:28:22.410 --> 01:28:22.640
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

3258
01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:22.851
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

3259
01:28:22.851 --> 01:28:24.220
<v Speaker 7>and this is exactly what,</v>

3260
01:28:24.221 --> 01:28:25.054
<v Speaker 7>what happened with</v>

3261
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:27.390
<v Speaker 3>these big Dildo in their point of view,</v>

3262
01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:30.810
<v Speaker 3>they're busting their ass for 20 years making millions of dollars for Chevrolet</v>

3263
01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:31.320
<v Speaker 3>the point,</v>

3264
01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.850
<v Speaker 3>because give me my money,</v>

3265
01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:33.990
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't afford it.</v>

3266
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:35.220
<v Speaker 3>They bankrupted the company.</v>

3267
01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:37.190
<v Speaker 3>Sons of bitches should have made some better cars to what?</v>

3268
01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:38.500
<v Speaker 3>What I was talking about,</v>

3269
01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.333
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3270
01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:42.780
<v Speaker 3>They should have thrown all this other shit boxes out and everybody would have</v>

3271
01:28:42.781 --> 01:28:43.890
<v Speaker 3>had corvettes just</v>

3272
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:45.380
<v Speaker 7>more cheaper.</v>

3273
01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.500
<v Speaker 7>Even that their product was so bad and they're making really good products now</v>

3274
01:28:48.501 --> 01:28:51.770
<v Speaker 7>is that they can't afford their retirement pool.</v>

3275
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:52.550
<v Speaker 7>So it just,</v>

3276
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:53.180
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>

3277
01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.013
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>

3278
01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.430
<v Speaker 7>the same thing goes for almost every county in this fucking great state of</v>

3279
01:28:57.710 --> 01:28:58.490
<v Speaker 7>California.</v>

3280
01:28:58.490 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 7>California economically looks a lot like grease</v>

3281
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:02.611
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3282
01:29:02.611 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 3>told me that Arnold Schwarzenegger.</v>

3283
01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:04.810
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3284
01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:05.430

<v Speaker 3>I also read that.</v>

3286
01:29:06.331 --> 01:29:07.680
<v Speaker 3>I also read that Michael Lewis's book.</v>

3287
01:29:07.681 --> 01:29:09.030
<v Speaker 3>We did an exhaustive study on it,</v>

3288
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:10.290
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

3289
01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you think Michael Lewis gets any pussy?</v>

3290
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.510
<v Speaker 3>I was just a cell phone number.</v>

3291
01:29:13.570 --> 01:29:14.370
<v Speaker 3>So smart.</v>

3292
01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Just looking at kind of a cool app from what I eat.</v>

3293
01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.151
<v Speaker 3>I've seen pictures.</v>

3294
01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:18.660
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like a regular looking,</v>

3295
01:29:18.661 --> 01:29:19.660
<v Speaker 3>pretty cool looking dude.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3297
01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:20.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3298
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:21.390
<v Speaker 3>some people,</v>

3299
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 3>some people write huge books and get laid all the time.</v>

3300
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:24.750
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

3301
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:25.270
<v Speaker 3>I hate them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You hope you never know.</v>

3304
01:29:29.650 --> 01:29:31.050
<v Speaker 3>It's always good to be around people who are.</v>

3305
01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:35.040
<v Speaker 3>You're a little in awe of who just are better at supporting to be around people</v>

3306
01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:35.900
<v Speaker 3>that are good at shit too.</v>

3307
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.661
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3308
01:29:36.661 --> 01:29:36.871
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3309
01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:39.630
<v Speaker 3>I did San Francisco and Seattle this past weekend.</v>

3310
01:29:39.631 --> 01:29:41.610
<v Speaker 3>We did it with Brian and Greg Fitzsimmons.</v>

3311
01:29:41.611 --> 01:29:43.690
<v Speaker 3>Greg Fitzsimmons is fucking funny.</v>

3312
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Funny.</v>

3313
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:45.143
<v Speaker 3>He's always been.</v>

3314
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:46.111
<v Speaker 3>He's always been funny,</v>

3315
01:29:46.111 --> 01:29:48.090
<v Speaker 3>but he's got this new level of,</v>

3316
01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck that,</v>

3317
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:50.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3318
01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.900
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen from him before.</v>

3319
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:52.231
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3320
01:29:52.231 --> 01:29:54.390
<v Speaker 3>he took it to the next level this weekend.</v>

3321
01:29:54.391 --> 01:29:55.224
<v Speaker 3>He's great.</v>

3322
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:56.580
<v Speaker 3>This past weekend was awesome.</v>

3323
01:29:56.581 --> 01:30:00.540
<v Speaker 3>He was really funny in Seattle to do like a half hour.</v>

3324
01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:01.200
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

3325
01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:01.411
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

01:30:01.411 --> 01:30:02.244
<v Speaker 3>it was awesome.</v>

3327
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.821
<v Speaker 3>Killer.</v>

3328
01:30:02.821 --> 01:30:03.660
<v Speaker 3>It's just like my.</v>

3329
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:06.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like my style of comedy that I enjoy watching.</v>

3330
01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:09.480
<v Speaker 3>Just like really ridiculous of rude,</v>

3331
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:10.250
<v Speaker 3>honest,</v>

3332
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:10.760
<v Speaker 3>hilarious,</v>

3333
01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.710
<v Speaker 3>descriptive.</v>

3334
01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.560
<v Speaker 3>It was really fun.</v>

3335
01:30:13.561 --> 01:30:14.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3336
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.341
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3337
01:30:14.341 --> 01:30:17.220
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain types of music,</v>

3338
01:30:17.221 --> 01:30:17.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3339
01:30:17.461 --> 01:30:19.470
<v Speaker 3>like if you go to a club to see music,</v>

3340
01:30:19.471 --> 01:30:22.470
<v Speaker 3>it's never just live music and you take a guess is whether or not it's going to</v>

3341
01:30:22.471 --> 01:30:24.000
<v Speaker 3>be hip hop or country western,</v>

3342
01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.680
<v Speaker 3>but what standup comedy is like?</v>

3343
01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.810
<v Speaker 3>We don't really have genres,</v>

3344
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:28.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3345
01:30:28.361 --> 01:30:30.810
<v Speaker 3>you like you could call someone to shop comic,</v>

3346
01:30:30.811 --> 01:30:31.261
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

3347
01:30:31.261 --> 01:30:31.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3348
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:34.560
<v Speaker 3>derogatory really to a lot of folks.</v>

3349
01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.330
<v Speaker 3>But me,</v>

3350
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.600
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>

3351
01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.980
<v Speaker 3>my favorite comics would be classified in the shock,</v>

3352
01:30:37.981 --> 01:30:38.940
<v Speaker 3>comma category.</v>

3353
01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Like dice clay,</v>

3354
01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.970
<v Speaker 3>like you call them a shock comic.</v>

3355
01:30:41.971 --> 01:30:46.971
<v Speaker 3>I think he creates ridiculous scenarios that are disgusting and Hilarious.</v>

3356
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:48.421
<v Speaker 3>A lot of us think,</v>

3357
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:49.254
<v Speaker 3>but don't say,</v>

3358
01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:49.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3359
01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:50.220
<v Speaker 3>by the blade.</v>

3360
01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:51.840
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking work of art.</v>

3361
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:52.051
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3362
01:30:52.051 --> 01:30:53.040
<v Speaker 3>He's a character.</v>

3363
01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:54.540
<v Speaker 3>His name isn't even Andrew dice clay.</v>

3364
01:30:54.541 --> 01:30:55.650
<v Speaker 3>He's made a character.</v>

3365
01:30:55.810 --> 01:30:56.310
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

3366
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:57.150
<v Speaker 3>he does it onstage.</v>

3367
01:30:57.210 --> 01:31:01.500
<v Speaker 3>He's got giant glasses on and he says ridiculous shit like that.</v>

3368
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:05.850
<v Speaker 3>You can't just diminish that by calling it shock comedy because to me it's not,</v>

3369
01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:06.930
<v Speaker 3>it's a style of comedy.</v>

3370
01:31:06.931 --> 01:31:07.980
<v Speaker 3>It's a legit style.</v>

3371
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3372
01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.900
<v Speaker 3>But we don't have labels,</v>

3373
01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:10.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3374
01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:12.720
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's certain types of comedy where,</v>

3375
01:31:12.721 --> 01:31:13.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3376
01:31:13.090 --> 01:31:15.000
<v Speaker 3>you and I were talking also about how,</v>

3377
01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:19.290
<v Speaker 3>what a privilege it is to feel it to be a headliner and to be somebody who gets</v>

3378
01:31:19.291 --> 01:31:20.520
<v Speaker 3>to perform all over the country.</v>

3379
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:22.250
<v Speaker 3>And like sometimes I look at,</v>

3380
01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I was in Miami,</v>

3381
01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.030
<v Speaker 3>Fort Lauderdale and I just,</v>

3382
01:31:24.170 --> 01:31:24.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3383
01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:24.900
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3384
01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:26.670
<v Speaker 3>I did at one point,</v>

3385
01:31:26.671 --> 01:31:29.200
<v Speaker 3>I just had them going pretty strong and I just looked at,</v>

3386
01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:29.461
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3387
01:31:29.461 --> 01:31:31.890
<v Speaker 3>I felt like the luckiest human being in the fucking world.</v>

3388
01:31:31.891 --> 01:31:32.724
<v Speaker 3>That's why when I watch</v>

3389
01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:33.740
<v Speaker 2>at Makani,</v>

3390
01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:38.760
<v Speaker 2>he fucking magic mike and his fucking leather chest girdle and it's fucking hot</v>

3391
01:31:41.301 --> 01:31:43.700
<v Speaker 2>pants and any and he's coming off say,</v>

3392
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:47.390
<v Speaker 2>hey yoker boy,</v>

3393
01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.381
<v Speaker 2>come flocking.</v>

3394
01:31:48.381 --> 01:31:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Do 10 minutes of stand up.</v>

3395
01:31:49.731 --> 01:31:50.600
<v Speaker 2>You fucking idiot.</v>

3396
01:31:50.601 --> 01:31:54.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't jump off stage like I just did an hour and a half and crossing somebody</v>

3397
01:31:54.081 --> 01:31:55.700
<v Speaker 2>hugged me hard so I can kiss your mouth.</v>

3398
01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:56.553
<v Speaker 2>This animosity</v>

3399
01:31:58.570 --> 01:31:59.410
<v Speaker 2>attracted him.</v>

3400
01:31:59.411 --> 01:31:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

3401
01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:00.673
<v Speaker 2>Expressed.</v>

3402
01:32:00.930 --> 01:32:01.421
<v Speaker 2>I hate them.</v>

3403
01:32:01.421 --> 01:32:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean I hate him.</v>

3404
01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:02.973
<v Speaker 2>I hate him.</v>

3405
01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:04.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3406
01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:05.910
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking about how you're.</v>

3407
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:09.160
<v Speaker 2>You're an actor and you have five scenes in a movie and be like,</v>

3408
01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:09.491
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3409
01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:09.851
<v Speaker 2>You were great.</v>

3410
01:32:09.851 --> 01:32:11.170
<v Speaker 2>In that movie it,</v>

3411
01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.850
<v Speaker 2>you collectively are probably doing 10 or 15 minutes of actual activity.</v>

3412
01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when you do stand up,</v>

3413
01:32:17.141 --> 01:32:17.830
<v Speaker 2>you're out there for.</v>

3414
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:18.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3415
01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:19.240
<v Speaker 2>it's just a different.</v>

3416
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:20.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just a different thing.</v>

3417
01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Feels it feels a little.</v>

3418
01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Why would you care though that he wants to be because</v>

3419
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:28.060
<v Speaker 2>it was a matter what's going on now.</v>

3420
01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I just saw the movie and I was just.</v>

3421
01:32:29.351 --> 01:32:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I was just looking at him going,</v>

3422
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.790
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>

3423
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:33.100
<v Speaker 2>you took this movie just so you could wear those outfits.</v>

3424
01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:34.360
<v Speaker 2>He gave you the biggest boner.</v>

3425
01:32:34.361 --> 01:32:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Did he?</v>

3426
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.100
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

3427
01:32:36.101 --> 01:32:36.610
<v Speaker 2>If I was,</v>

3428
01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:37.540
<v Speaker 2>if I was gay,</v>

3429
01:32:37.541 --> 01:32:38.351
<v Speaker 2>I would definitely.</v>

3430
01:32:38.351 --> 01:32:39.880
<v Speaker 2>He's a very attractive one.</v>

3431
01:32:39.881 --> 01:32:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Would you choose I Mike channing tatum.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Best genetics.</v>

3436
01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:47.450
<v Speaker 2>He's got sick lips.</v>

3437
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:50.230
<v Speaker 2>The eyes out of the cat eyes.</v>

3438
01:32:50.290 --> 01:32:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Seems confident too.</v>

3439
01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:52.421
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>

3440
01:32:52.421 --> 01:32:54.160
<v Speaker 2>He's got a big cost sense of humor.</v>

3441
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:57.690
<v Speaker 2>We're both really something Joe Rogan a bronc allocate.</v>

3442
01:32:57.730 --> 01:32:59.730
<v Speaker 2>It gets talking about channing tatum cost.</v>

3443
01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:00.613
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

3444
01:33:01.890 --> 01:33:02.850
<v Speaker 2>that just came out of here.</v>

3445
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Here's my bet.</v>

3446
01:33:03.650 --> 01:33:05.530
<v Speaker 2>He's got a big truck.</v>

3447
01:33:07.330 --> 01:33:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch the uh,</v>

3448
01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:11.500
<v Speaker 2>the actual whole moving because I wanted to annoy myself more and more.</v>

3449
01:33:11.710 --> 01:33:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Although I thought the movie was good and I liked it.</v>

3450
01:33:13.690 --> 01:33:14.260
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>

3451
01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:15.160
<v Speaker 2>I liked channing tatum.</v>

3452
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:16.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had my hands.</v>

3453
01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:20.410
<v Speaker 2>That movie looks so gig channels.</v>

3454
01:33:20.650 --> 01:33:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I was flipping through the channels and I saw it popped up and I went whoa.</v>

3455
01:33:23.951 --> 01:33:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Change a quick like you know,</v>

3456
01:33:25.741 --> 01:33:30.430
<v Speaker 2>how you flipping through like you have previewing next preview at a hotel,</v>

3457
01:33:30.431 --> 01:33:33.150
<v Speaker 2>what was checking into a hotel and like I was like,</v>

3458
01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:33.890
<v Speaker 2>this is so gay.</v>

3459
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:34.723
<v Speaker 2>I got to get it off.</v>

3460
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Like dudes were like gyrating back and forth.</v>

3461
01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Which by the way,</v>

3462
01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.630
<v Speaker 2>I think women like that.</v>

3463
01:33:40.631 --> 01:33:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that motion is really just isolated.</v>

3464
01:33:43.151 --> 01:33:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Someone Riding Dick's.</v>

3465
01:33:44.770 --> 01:33:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that.</v>

3466
01:33:45.490 --> 01:33:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I know gyrating like the way a guy's doing it.</v>

3467
01:33:48.490 --> 01:33:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Women like the rusting they like to get fucked.</v>

3468
01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:51.500
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

3469
01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:52.333
<v Speaker 2>They want you,</v>

3470
01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:55.930
<v Speaker 2>your Dick Riding circled man.</v>

3471
01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.551
<v Speaker 2>Dick Riding,</v>

3472
01:33:57.551 --> 01:33:58.384
<v Speaker 2>sweaty circle.</v>

3473
01:33:58.760 --> 01:33:59.401
<v Speaker 2>Connie's too.</v>

3474
01:33:59.401 --> 01:34:03.940
<v Speaker 2>And he's got a fucking a leather thong and he's doing back bends and shit and,</v>

3475
01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:04.301
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3476
01:34:04.301 --> 01:34:05.530
<v Speaker 2>but the character I was watching,</v>

3477
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:06.850
<v Speaker 2>what bothered me was I was watching.</v>

3478
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3479
01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:08.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3480
01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:08.973
<v Speaker 2>as an actor,</v>

3481
01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.180
<v Speaker 2>if I took that role,</v>

3482
01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:11.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot I do with that role.</v>

3483
01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:12.131
<v Speaker 2>May Be,</v>

3484
01:34:12.131 --> 01:34:14.140
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't because there's not a lot to do.</v>

3485
01:34:14.141 --> 01:34:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Like he played it.</v>

3486
01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Just one note,</v>

3487
01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:16.520
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up bitch.</v>

3488
01:34:16.521 --> 01:34:21.521
<v Speaker 2>She would take that role at a God damn heartbeat tatum and your underwear can be</v>

3489
01:34:21.971 --> 01:34:22.481
<v Speaker 2>your boyfriend.</v>

3490
01:34:22.481 --> 01:34:26.070
<v Speaker 2>He'd be carrying them around like he was crossing the wedding nuptials.</v>

3491
01:34:26.071 --> 01:34:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I would look like I have fucking rickets next to that guy.</v>

3492
01:34:28.410 --> 01:34:30.100
<v Speaker 2>So he would do the movie with them though.</v>

3493
01:34:30.101 --> 01:34:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3494
01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.090
<v Speaker 2>you would do it.</v>

3495
01:34:31.090 --> 01:34:31.990
<v Speaker 2>So shut the fuck up.</v>

3496
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Matthew mcconaughey.</v>

3497
01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:35.470
<v Speaker 2>A hard time and you're doing the movie.</v>

3498
01:34:35.471 --> 01:34:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he just wanted to meet Jenny channel to</v>

3499
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:39.623
<v Speaker 2>Matthew.</v>

3500
01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

3501
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Rather than.</v>

01:34:40.450 --> 01:34:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to put you down enough guy.</v>

3503
01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:44.170

01:34:44.531 --> 01:34:45.460
<v Speaker 2>He's a very nice guy.</v>

3506
01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3507
01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Here's a nice car.</v>

3508
01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Testing me and he's not really vain and not an annoying.</v>

3509
01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:49.601
<v Speaker 2>Well listen man,</v>

3510
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:50.410
<v Speaker 2>he's playing a part.</v>

3511
01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:52.840
<v Speaker 2>How could you like if you judged me based on the movies?</v>

3512
01:34:52.841 --> 01:34:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Zookeeper.</v>

3513
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:57.710
<v Speaker 2>You fucking dance in Malibu.</v>

3514
01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Who Does?</v>

3515
01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3516
01:34:58.730 --> 01:34:59.563
<v Speaker 2>With the shirt off.</v>

3517
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.891
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

3518
01:35:00.891 --> 01:35:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Does.</v>

3519
01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:04.370
<v Speaker 2>If I see you and you're doing pushups in front of the pavilion in Malibu,</v>

3520
01:35:04.371 --> 01:35:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take your back.</v>

3521
01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:09.240
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take you back and I'm going to get their hooks in my French,</v>

3522
01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:10.093
<v Speaker 2>kick him in the ribs.</v>

3523
01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Just gonna.</v>

3524
01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:10.761
<v Speaker 2>Hold it.</v>

3525
01:35:10.761 --> 01:35:11.690
<v Speaker 2>He can scream all you want.</v>

3526
01:35:11.691 --> 01:35:15.170
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't have been doing pushups that a lot to do with a knapsack on,</v>

3527
01:35:15.171 --> 01:35:18.320
<v Speaker 2>with a knapsack on a Bandana was while tourists take pictures of you,</v>

3528
01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.213
<v Speaker 2>is that what he was doing?</v>

3529
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:20.690
<v Speaker 2>That annoys me.</v>

3530
01:35:20.690 --> 01:35:22.430
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to be really fit for this movie.</v>

3531
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was like something he was working on,</v>

3532
01:35:24.571 --> 01:35:28.670
<v Speaker 2>like what kind of exhibitionist could he become because he was playing a part in</v>

3533
01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:29.420
<v Speaker 2>a movie man.</v>

3534
01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Did you murder?</v>

3535
01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:31.160
<v Speaker 2>He look,</v>

3536
01:35:31.161 --> 01:35:31.551
<v Speaker 2>think about,</v>

3537
01:35:31.551 --> 01:35:31.930
<v Speaker 2>look what,</v>

3538
01:35:31.930 --> 01:35:32.090
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3539
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:33.740
<v Speaker 2>what's his name does when he does.</v>

3540
01:35:33.741 --> 01:35:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3541
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:34.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3542
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:35.151
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Day Lewis,</v>

3543
01:35:35.151 --> 01:35:36.530
<v Speaker 2>when he gets immersed in a role,</v>

3544
01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:36.881
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3545
01:35:36.881 --> 01:35:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3546
01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:38.330
<v Speaker 2>he's unbelievably immersive.</v>

3547
01:35:38.331 --> 01:35:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what Matthew mcconaughey was done.</v>

3548
01:35:39.681 --> 01:35:40.760
<v Speaker 2>It was just being a douchebag.</v>

3549
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:42.920
<v Speaker 2>He's playing a Douche bag in the movie man.</v>

3550
01:35:42.921 --> 01:35:45.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's douchebag activity at the role was in so much of a Douche bag.</v>

3551
01:35:45.651 --> 01:35:46.431
<v Speaker 2>The role was more of a,</v>

3552
01:35:46.431 --> 01:35:47.870
<v Speaker 2>just think he's supposed to be the club owner,</v>

3553
01:35:47.871 --> 01:35:48.830
<v Speaker 2>but you'll see what I mean.</v>

3554
01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Would it be okay if he did pushups in a weird place where nobody could say like</v>

3555
01:35:52.521 --> 01:35:53.810
<v Speaker 2>say if there was like his.</v>

3556
01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:57.110
<v Speaker 2>There was like some grass in front of his car and nobody could see any dropdown</v>

3557
01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:57.830
<v Speaker 2>for a quick 15.</v>

3558
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:58.663
<v Speaker 2>Here's what Bob.</v>

3559
01:35:58.840 --> 01:35:59.391
<v Speaker 2>It bothers me.</v>

3560
01:35:59.391 --> 01:35:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3561
01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:00.380
<v Speaker 2>there I am.</v>

3562
01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.213
<v Speaker 2>Here's what bothers me.</v>

3563
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:05.460
<v Speaker 2>If you work out just for the sake of vanity to and then and then it,</v>

3564
01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3565
01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:07.520
<v Speaker 2>when I see what you're doing is just,</v>

3566
01:36:07.521 --> 01:36:09.560
<v Speaker 2>you're just sculpting for,</v>

3567
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:10.700
<v Speaker 2>for it to be a peacock.</v>

3568
01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:11.021

01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:14.390
<v Speaker 2>There's something about it.</v>

3573
01:36:14.391 --> 01:36:16.160
<v Speaker 2>If it's not for something functional,</v>

3574
01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:17.750
<v Speaker 2>it was not for something like that.</v>

3580
01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

3581
01:36:25.971 --> 01:36:28.640
<v Speaker 2>What about a guy who's just doing like bench presses and curls?</v>

01:36:33.951 --> 01:36:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I've got no problem with that.</v>

3590
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:37.490
<v Speaker 2>He's doing it so he can go out and get laid on a Saturday night.</v>

3596
01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I see Matt Maconomy to want a role like that.</v>

3597
01:36:54.621 --> 01:36:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Magic Mike All.</v>

3600
01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:59.840
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to do something.</v>

3601
01:36:59.841 --> 01:37:02.570
<v Speaker 2>He's actually playing a character who's fucking conflicted about being a 30 year</v>

01:37:02.571 --> 01:37:03.950
<v Speaker 2>old stripper and it's fucking great.</v>

01:37:05.890 --> 01:37:08.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a masturbatory performance.</v>

3605
01:37:08.151 --> 01:37:09.620
<v Speaker 2>He's watching himself.</v>

3606
01:37:09.621 --> 01:37:11.210
<v Speaker 2>He's not trying to do anything.</v>

3607
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:12.620
<v Speaker 2>He's not trying to express anything.</v>

3608
01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.500
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to play.</v>

3609
01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:15.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3610

3613
01:37:22.761 --> 01:37:25.860
<v Speaker 2>but it was really good and contact the hell's going on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was all right.</v>

3615
01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:27.830
<v Speaker 2>He was good in contact.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed him.</v>

3617
01:37:28.431 --> 01:37:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was sensitive about that.</v>

3618
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Seemed like the type of guy that would fall in love with Jodie foster.</v>

3619
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:34.820
<v Speaker 2>That was a long time ago.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You get a little jealous.</v>

3713
01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.950
<v Speaker 6>You better be inside of a pussy when you watch it.</v>

3714
01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:24.813
<v Speaker 6>Really a time.</v>

3715
01:40:25.130 --> 01:40:29.220
<v Speaker 6>I don't have that kind of stamina or desire for.</v>

3716
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.770
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3717
01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:32.680
<v Speaker 6>that's why I got tricked early on in life,</v>

3718
01:40:32.681 --> 01:40:34.810
<v Speaker 6>but I figured it out now I'm fine.</v>

3719
01:40:34.811 --> 01:40:36.820
<v Speaker 6>Just beaten off and then going about my business.</v>

3720
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:39.820
<v Speaker 6>So you got to take one of these pills.</v>

3721
01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:39.931
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3722
01:40:39.931 --> 01:40:40.571
<v Speaker 6>What is this stuff?</v>

3723
01:40:40.571 --> 01:40:41.980
<v Speaker 6>He took a hot rod.</v>

3724
01:40:42.010 --> 01:40:42.843
<v Speaker 6>5,000.</v>

3725
01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:46.570
<v Speaker 6>Throw that shit over here and I took one last night when I got home.</v>

3726
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:47.261
<v Speaker 6>What's in it?</v>

3727
01:40:47.261 --> 01:40:48.094
<v Speaker 6>I can't read this.</v>

3728
01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:50.290
<v Speaker 6>It's something extracted from aunt.</v>

3729
01:40:50.291 --> 01:40:51.124
<v Speaker 6>So I guess.</v>

3730
01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:52.540
<v Speaker 6>Well I don't know.</v>

3731
01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.910
<v Speaker 6>Something aunt's maker.</v>

3732
01:40:54.911 --> 01:40:58.750
<v Speaker 6>You have hard ons and I maybe just don't know that ants have rock hard boners</v>

3733
01:40:58.751 --> 01:40:59.260
<v Speaker 6>the whole time.</v>

3734
01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:00.190
<v Speaker 6>Look at this label.</v>

3735
01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:00.880
<v Speaker 6>Look at this.</v>

3736
01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:01.391
<v Speaker 6>What it is.</v>

3737
01:41:01.391 --> 01:41:05.140
<v Speaker 6>I guarantee you there's probably some fucking prescription drugs.</v>

3738
01:41:05.170 --> 01:41:06.300
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say just my.</v>

3739
01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:09.040
<v Speaker 6>It's marketed towards the gay community.</v>

3740
01:41:09.041 --> 01:41:09.550
<v Speaker 6>I heard that.</v>

3741
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:10.383
<v Speaker 6>I bet you could give.</v>

3742
01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:11.380
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying it is,</v>

3743
01:41:11.381 --> 01:41:11.641
<v Speaker 6>but if.</v>

3744
01:41:11.641 --> 01:41:12.490
<v Speaker 6>What if it was.</v>

3745
01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:16.120
<v Speaker 6>Is it possible that you could get viagara like bulk Viagra,</v>

3746
01:41:16.121 --> 01:41:19.480
<v Speaker 6>like because they have generic or whatever it's called,</v>

3747
01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.640
<v Speaker 6>would it modafinil or whatever the fuck.</v>

3748
01:41:21.641 --> 01:41:25.780
<v Speaker 6>The actual chemicals that the label is so tiny that you can't even read it.</v>

3749
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:26.980
<v Speaker 6>You can read what the fuck's in there.</v>

3750
01:41:27.570 --> 01:41:29.280
<v Speaker 6>There's some kind of prescription thing in their life</v>

3751
01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:36.260
<v Speaker 6>that they definitely found that with a athletic supplements that there's been a</v>

3752
01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:40.120
<v Speaker 6>lot of athletic tainting where you take some shit and then actually have</v>

3753
01:41:40.121 --> 01:41:40.954
<v Speaker 6>steroids in it.</v>

3754
01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:44.170
<v Speaker 6>There was some stuff that they used to sell that's illegal now.</v>

3755
01:41:44.171 --> 01:41:45.400
<v Speaker 6>That essentially is.</v>

3756
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:46.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3757
01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:49.600
<v Speaker 6>well there was a thing called Mag 10 that I took and holy shit,</v>

3758
01:41:49.601 --> 01:41:52.780
<v Speaker 6>it was unbelievably strong and you could get it at GNC.</v>

3759
01:41:52.781 --> 01:41:54.940
<v Speaker 6>I was fucking soul strong when I was taking that stuff.</v>

3760
01:41:54.941 --> 01:41:55.600
<v Speaker 6>It was amazing.</v>

3761
01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:58.750
<v Speaker 6>It was just deck animal or something or I don't know what the fuck it was,</v>

3762
01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.270
<v Speaker 6>but it was essentially it was an oral steroid.</v>

3763
01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:06.280
<v Speaker 6>I mean it had an effect of a steroid and you can get a GNC for a little while.</v>

3764
01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:08.470
<v Speaker 6>These have ghb it at GNC.</v>

3765
01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:10.810
<v Speaker 6>I remember seeing that shit.</v>

3766
01:42:10.811 --> 01:42:12.400
<v Speaker 6>It was in a fridge refrigerator.</v>

3767
01:42:12.850 --> 01:42:13.750
<v Speaker 6>That's Hilarious,</v>

3768
01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:14.650
<v Speaker 6>but it was the biggest.</v>

3769
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:16.330
<v Speaker 6>I mean it just wouldn't go away.</v>

3770
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:20.000
<v Speaker 6>Like I would mess up and then just to be another boner that had been</v>

3771
01:42:20.001 --> 01:42:20.834
<v Speaker 6>masturbating again.</v>

3772
01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.750
<v Speaker 6>It was just crazy.</v>

3773
01:42:22.810 --> 01:42:26.020
<v Speaker 6>That sounds like it's just as good as Viagra watching magic.</v>

3774
01:42:26.190 --> 01:42:27.023
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3775
01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:30.790
<v Speaker 6>it was just a coincidence.</v>

3776
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:31.440
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>

3777
01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.920
<v Speaker 6>it was odd that a boner.</v>

3778
01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:33.481
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3779
01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:34.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3780
01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:35.880
<v Speaker 6>the only thing that they could be doing is,</v>

3781
01:42:35.881 --> 01:42:35.951
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3782
01:42:35.951 --> 01:42:38.980
<v Speaker 6>maybe maybe it has some nitric oxide effect.</v>

3783
01:42:39.010 --> 01:42:39.191
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3784
01:42:39.191 --> 01:42:40.740
<v Speaker 6>that's the idea behind a.</v>

3785
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:43.840
<v Speaker 6>like those opens up your m and o two pills.</v>

3786
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:44.833
<v Speaker 6>Capillaries.</v>

3787
01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.690
<v Speaker 6>He said that gave him crazy boners.</v>

3788
01:42:46.890 --> 01:42:49.750
<v Speaker 6>It gives you a bonus that has a very viagra like effect.</v>

3789
01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:50.330
<v Speaker 6>What's that?</v>

3790
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:50.751
<v Speaker 6>Those,</v>

3791
01:42:50.751 --> 01:42:52.990
<v Speaker 6>a nitric oxide drinks.</v>

3792
01:42:52.991 --> 01:42:53.201
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3793
01:42:53.201 --> 01:42:55.380
<v Speaker 6>those drinks like eno to explode and shit,</v>

3794
01:42:55.690 --> 01:42:57.610
<v Speaker 6>which might be illegal now explode.</v>

3795
01:42:59.410 --> 01:43:00.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3796
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.650
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's it loads.</v>

3797
01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:05.170
<v Speaker 6>There was some other stuff called Jack Three Day.</v>

3798
01:43:05.171 --> 01:43:06.520
<v Speaker 6>One of those is off the market now.</v>

3799
01:43:06.521 --> 01:43:06.911
<v Speaker 6>One of them,</v>

3800
01:43:06.911 --> 01:43:09.150

3803
01:43:14.501 --> 01:43:15.101
<v Speaker 6>sweating.</v>

3804
01:43:15.101 --> 01:43:17.410
<v Speaker 6>Like immediately your heart's pounding,</v>

3805
01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.840
<v Speaker 6>sweating or I'm waiting for them to.</v>

3808
01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:23.200
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to do that,</v>

3809
01:43:23.201 --> 01:43:23.411
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3810
01:43:23.411 --> 01:43:23.670
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

<v Speaker 6>we can't look.</v>

3817
01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:38.741
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

3818
01:43:38.741 --> 01:43:39.420
<v Speaker 6>Look at your head.</v>

3819
01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:42.610
<v Speaker 6>Exactly how the framework for this narrow head.</v>

3820
01:43:42.850 --> 01:43:46.060
<v Speaker 6>It's weird when you see people that have like big parts of their bodies and then</v>

3821
01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.170
<v Speaker 6>everything else was normal.</v>

3822
01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:49.210
<v Speaker 6>Brennan shops a little bit like that.</v>

3823
01:43:49.211 --> 01:43:50.440
<v Speaker 6>Like Brendan's got a small,</v>

3824
01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:51.080
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3825
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.170
<v Speaker 6>like he's got a headline</v>

3826
01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:55.970
<v Speaker 2>for that fits on me and he's 65 to 50 and I was looking at his head.</v>

3827
01:43:55.971 --> 01:43:56.121
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3828

3830
01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.390
<v Speaker 2>His hands and his head are not very big.</v>

3831
01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:00.313
<v Speaker 2>What did he say?</v>

3832
01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:01.011
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3833
01:44:01.011 --> 01:44:01.401
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3834
01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:01.821
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

3835
01:44:01.821 --> 01:44:02.031
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3836

3838
01:44:03.981 --> 01:44:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I've got small hands.</v>

3839
01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3840
01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.040
<v Speaker 2>because the rest of his body is retarded.</v>

3841
01:44:07.041 --> 01:44:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Like he's so fucking strong.</v>

3842
01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:11.840
<v Speaker 2>It's weird when people get looked at the worst,</v>

3843
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:14.070
<v Speaker 2>the biggest head when you have a big head and a little bond.</v>

3844
01:44:14.071 --> 01:44:14.904
<v Speaker 2>He said the worst.</v>

3845
01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:16.240
<v Speaker 2>A lot of starters.</v>

3846
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:18.400
<v Speaker 2>A lot of stars have that big of little bottles.</v>

3847
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3848
01:44:18.690 --> 01:44:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Mick Jagger and shit.</v>

3849
01:44:19.761 --> 01:44:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3850
01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:20.853
<v Speaker 2>He had a big,</v>

3851
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.883
<v Speaker 2>huge head,</v>

3852
01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.070
<v Speaker 2>giant head.</v>

3853
01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:24.130
<v Speaker 2>He's 130 pounds,</v>

3854
01:44:24.131 --> 01:44:25.160
<v Speaker 2>but your head keeps growing.</v>

3855
01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Keeps growing,</v>

3856
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:27.201
<v Speaker 2>keeps growing.</v>

3857
01:44:27.201 --> 01:44:30.170
<v Speaker 2>That's the weirdest thing that you see old people when they have gigantic ears.</v>

3858
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:31.250
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

3859
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.791
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3860
01:44:31.791 --> 01:44:33.020
<v Speaker 2>what is going on with your ears?</v>

3861
01:44:33.021 --> 01:44:38.021
<v Speaker 2>Man knows a large nose though for some reason is not as disturbing because some</v>

3862
01:44:38.331 --> 01:44:39.620
<v Speaker 2>people like from the get go,</v>

3863
01:44:39.621 --> 01:44:40.540
<v Speaker 2>they have a large nose.</v>

3864
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.941
<v Speaker 2>It's just to.</v>

3865
01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:41.211
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3866
01:44:41.211 --> 01:44:43.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a masculine trait to the ears though.</v>

3867
01:44:43.221 --> 01:44:43.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3868
01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:45.260
<v Speaker 2>what is happening to your ears?</v>

3869
01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Can you.</v>

3870
01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Can you stop those with your guards?</v>

3871
01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Because that shit is worse.</v>

3872
01:44:49.041 --> 01:44:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Can you bind your ears?</v>

3873
01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:52.760
<v Speaker 2>What if you're an old dude with cauliflower ear?</v>

3874
01:44:52.761 --> 01:44:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3875
01:44:53.410 --> 01:44:54.950
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a Jean labelle.</v>

3876
01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:55.620
<v Speaker 2>He ever seen.</v>

3877
01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Both sides are so big at the sun.</v>

3878
01:44:57.681 --> 01:44:58.461
<v Speaker 2>Never hits his face.</v>

3879
01:44:58.461 --> 01:44:59.031
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3880
01:44:59.031 --> 01:45:00.320
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is with those ears?</v>

3881
01:45:00.650 --> 01:45:01.780
<v Speaker 2>He's got a giant.</v>

3882
01:45:01.810 --> 01:45:02.810
<v Speaker 2>He's got a giant head.</v>

3883
01:45:02.811 --> 01:45:03.644
<v Speaker 2>He's 80.</v>

3884
01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:04.610
<v Speaker 2>He's an older gentleman.</v>

3885
01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.980
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want him to get me in a fucking double risk law.</v>

3886
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3887

01:45:09.051 --> 01:45:10.040
<v Speaker 2>He'll break your fucking.</v>

3889
01:45:10.130 --> 01:45:13.420
<v Speaker 2>There was a story with some kids breaking into a car in this neighborhood just</v>

3890
01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:18.290
<v Speaker 2>fucking 10 years ago or whatever when he's 70 years old and he went out to stop</v>

3891

<v Speaker 2>He's worked with a lot of those.</v>

3937
01:46:34.530 --> 01:46:37.040

3943
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

3944
01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Strong.</v>

3945
01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Karl Pribram was back when,</v>

3946
01:46:47.301 --> 01:46:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a blue belt or a purple belt and just ragdolled</v>

<v Speaker 3>He throwed me around.</v>

3952
01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:53.220
<v Speaker 3>He throwed me around.</v>

3953
01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:54.660
<v Speaker 3>He's strongly shit.</v>

3954
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:54.911
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3955
01:46:54.911 --> 01:46:55.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3956
01:46:55.290 --> 01:46:56.190
<v Speaker 3>Caro beat,</v>

3957
01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:59.130
<v Speaker 3>so could you in a fucking judo match when he was a kid,</v>

3958
01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:00.031
<v Speaker 3>so could you.</v>

3959
01:47:00.031 --> 01:47:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Is so much bigger than Carl.</v>

3960
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:02.670
<v Speaker 3>And they had an open way.</v>

3961
01:47:02.671 --> 01:47:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Judo match and Carl beat up.</v>

3962
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.771
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

3963
01:47:04.771 --> 01:47:05.580
<v Speaker 3>Strong that way.</v>

3964
01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Carl was a super talented a judo too.</v>

3965
01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:09.660
<v Speaker 3>He had a real bad injury though when he was training for the Matt.</v>

3966
01:47:09.661 --> 01:47:10.220
<v Speaker 3>He fine,</v>

3967
01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:10.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3968
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:11.483
<v Speaker 3>Carl was a.</v>

3969
01:47:11.850 --> 01:47:12.683
<v Speaker 3>had a bunch of.</v>

3970
01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:15.540
<v Speaker 3>He's another dude that had not budget per prescription pill problems.</v>

3971
01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:20.541
<v Speaker 3>And what happened was he tore his leg when he was training for a title shot back</v>

3972
01:47:20.761 --> 01:47:23.400
<v Speaker 3>when Matt Hughes was champion and he tore it bad.</v>

3973
01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:25.020
<v Speaker 3>He flexes it when he flexes it.</v>

3974
01:47:25.021 --> 01:47:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Now it looks like a shark.</v>

3975
01:47:26.251 --> 01:47:28.650
<v Speaker 3>Took a bite out of his leg and I'm not exaggerating,</v>

3976
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:30.600
<v Speaker 3>his hamstring just disappeared.</v>

3977
01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.291
<v Speaker 3>Exploded.</v>

3978
01:47:31.291 --> 01:47:32.790
<v Speaker 3>And he never got it surgically repaired.</v>

3979
01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:37.250
<v Speaker 3>So he's got this big concave area and his leg and it took most of the power out</v>

3980
01:47:37.251 --> 01:47:39.840
<v Speaker 3>of his leg and he got him on pain pills.</v>

3981
01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:41.770
<v Speaker 3>So I that,</v>

3982
01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:43.860
<v Speaker 3>that guy health insurance.</v>

3983
01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:44.871
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3984
01:47:44.871 --> 01:47:47.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know what it was and I'm sure that's.</v>

3985
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:48.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3986
01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:51.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he didn't have health insurance or maybe tried to like rehab it.</v>

3987
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:52.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure he didn't have insurance.</v>

3988
01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:53.800
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

3989
01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.710
<v Speaker 3>now I don't know if there's anything they can do about it.</v>

3990
01:47:55.711 --> 01:47:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I think once the muscle like slides back and rolls up,</v>

3991
01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:01.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really hard to reattach it.</v>

3992
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:03.720
<v Speaker 3>I think they have to do it right after the injury.</v>

3993
01:48:03.721 --> 01:48:05.130
<v Speaker 3>I know that's the case with biceps.</v>

3994
01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.211
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of dudes,</v>

3995
01:48:06.211 --> 01:48:09.690
<v Speaker 3>they blow their bicep out and then they have like no bicep if you seen that</v>

3996
01:48:09.691 --> 01:48:10.070
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

3997
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3998
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.010
<v Speaker 3>A lot of fighters have that where it curls up and it's like the top of their</v>

3999
01:48:14.011 --> 01:48:17.310
<v Speaker 3>bicep was like a little knot and then below it there's nothing left.</v>

4000
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:18.031
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4001
01:48:18.031 --> 01:48:19.280
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's like with his leg.</v>

4002
01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:21.300
<v Speaker 3>So it kind of fucked his career up.</v>

4003
01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:24.240
<v Speaker 3>You know when you're making your living off your body.</v>

4004
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Well then the other thing about training,</v>

4005
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:26.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4006
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:31.310
<v Speaker 3>as you get older and a lot of guys were training a long time that you want to go</v>

4007
01:48:31.321 --> 01:48:33.030
<v Speaker 3>in and blow yourself to bits in the gym.</v>

4008
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:36.180
<v Speaker 3>Actually what happens is by the time you're 40,</v>

4009
01:48:36.181 --> 01:48:37.310
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times you're,</v>

4010
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:41.220
<v Speaker 3>you're having major problems with your hips or your knees and stuff like that.</v>

4011
01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:45.570
<v Speaker 3>So a huge part of exercise is knowing when to stop and doing just enough a body.</v>

4012
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:47.820
<v Speaker 3>If you look at people's bodies like athletes and stuff,</v>

4013
01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:49.650
<v Speaker 3>you realize no matter how strong they are,</v>

4014
01:48:49.651 --> 01:48:51.180
<v Speaker 3>we are fucking fragile man.</v>

4015
01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.180
<v Speaker 3>Bone and cartilage doesn't really do well under duress.</v>

4016
01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:54.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4017
01:48:54.991 --> 01:48:57.750
<v Speaker 3>well there's certain parts of your body that break,</v>

4018
01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:58.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4019
01:48:58.130 --> 01:48:59.340
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing he could do about it.</v>

4020
01:48:59.341 --> 01:48:59.971
<v Speaker 3>And they hips,</v>

4021
01:48:59.971 --> 01:49:00.271
<v Speaker 3>hips,</v>

4022
01:49:00.271 --> 01:49:01.104
<v Speaker 3>ankles,</v>

4023
01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:01.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4024
01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:02.910
<v Speaker 3>certain shit that just breaks down.</v>

4025
01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

4026
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:05.130
<v Speaker 3>I see a lot of people with hip surgery.</v>

4027
01:49:05.131 --> 01:49:05.401
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

4028
01:49:05.401 --> 01:49:05.941
<v Speaker 3>that's scary.</v>

4029
01:49:05.941 --> 01:49:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Fucking shit.</v>

4030
01:49:06.841 --> 01:49:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Hip Surgery Sucks because when you get a fake hip,</v>

4031
01:49:09.331 --> 01:49:10.440
<v Speaker 3>it's good for 10 years.</v>

4032
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:12.050
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

4033
01:49:12.051 --> 01:49:13.410
<v Speaker 3>And you're not doing sports anymore.</v>

4034
01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:14.393
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

4035
01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:17.730
<v Speaker 3>if they come out with some shit that grows you a better hip joint,</v>

4036
01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.240
<v Speaker 3>now you can't do it anymore because you've hacked your shit off and put an</v>

4037
01:49:21.241 --> 01:49:22.230
<v Speaker 3>artificial one in there.</v>

4038
01:49:22.710 --> 01:49:22.861
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4039
01:49:22.861 --> 01:49:24.360
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have artificial bones.</v>

4040
01:49:24.361 --> 01:49:24.970
<v Speaker 3>Artificial ever.</v>

4041
01:49:24.970 --> 01:49:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4042
01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:27.960
<v Speaker 3>haven't they already replaced like femurs and stuff or.</v>

4043
01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was a Femur,</v>

4044
01:49:28.981 --> 01:49:29.810
<v Speaker 3>but I believe they,</v>

4045
01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:31.020
<v Speaker 3>they've replaced part.</v>

4046
01:49:31.021 --> 01:49:31.854
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it.</v>

4047
01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:32.770
<v Speaker 3>What's the Big One?</v>

4048
01:49:32.771 --> 01:49:36.550
<v Speaker 3>There's a fibia and that there are a number of people who have,</v>

4049
01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:39.680
<v Speaker 3>who have rebuilt.</v>

4050
01:49:40.230 --> 01:49:43.170
<v Speaker 3>Literally they trachea's and bladders.</v>

4051
01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 3>They take the cartilage from a cadaver and then they sponsor</v>

4052
01:49:48.810 --> 01:49:49.643
<v Speaker 7>cricket.</v>

4053
01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:51.480
<v Speaker 7>Cricket,</v>

4054
01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:51.890
<v Speaker 7>cricket.</v>

4055
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:52.450
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4056
01:49:52.450 --> 01:49:53.010
<v Speaker 7>That's funny.</v>

4057
01:49:53.010 --> 01:49:53.101
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

4058
01:49:53.101 --> 01:49:53.934
<v Speaker 7>that's hilarious.</v>

4059
01:49:54.170 --> 01:49:55.003
<v Speaker 7>Let me to try find.</v>

4060
01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:55.893
<v Speaker 7>I'll try.</v>

4061
01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:57.090
<v Speaker 7>I won't find it.</v>

4062
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:58.331
<v Speaker 7>Bridal tell you.</v>

4063
01:49:58.331 --> 01:49:58.730
<v Speaker 7>Well it was.</v>

4064
01:49:58.730 --> 01:50:00.040
<v Speaker 7>I was in the desert.</v>

4065
01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:01.540
<v Speaker 7>As soon as you get up,</v>

4066
01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:04.240
<v Speaker 7>you stopped some real hamburger and let it go rank.</v>

4067
01:50:04.810 --> 01:50:05.643
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4068
01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:06.993
<v Speaker 7>but uh,</v>

4069
01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:07.953
<v Speaker 7>what was I talking about?</v>

4070
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.910
<v Speaker 7>Something really important.</v>

4071
01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.350
<v Speaker 7>What were you talking about?</v>

4072
01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.140
<v Speaker 7>Like it now you're looking for it and it shot 20 cricket</v>

4073
01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:17.913
<v Speaker 7>injuries.</v>

4074
01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 7>The body they take,</v>

4075
01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:23.170
<v Speaker 7>they took a trachea as women had a tricky.</v>

4076
01:50:23.171 --> 01:50:24.910
<v Speaker 7>I had to be removed because of tuberculosis,</v>

4077
01:50:24.911 --> 01:50:28.000
<v Speaker 7>and then they took a trachea from a cadaver and they sprayed it with her stem</v>

4078
01:50:28.001 --> 01:50:32.050
<v Speaker 7>cells and she grew a trachea and now she has it in her body.</v>

4079
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.041
<v Speaker 7>What happens is,</v>

4080
01:50:33.041 --> 01:50:37.180
<v Speaker 7>I believe that the cartilage then is taken over by the stem cells and they grow</v>

4081
01:50:37.181 --> 01:50:37.750
<v Speaker 7>their own cartilage.</v>

4082
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:38.090
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>

4083
01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:39.360
<v Speaker 7>she grew her own tracheas.</v>

4084
01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:40.120
<v Speaker 7>That's incredible.</v>

4085
01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.370
<v Speaker 7>And they did the same thing with the bladders.</v>

4086
01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:42.781
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4087
01:50:42.781 --> 01:50:43.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4088
01:50:43.021 --> 01:50:43.854
<v Speaker 3>when you grow,</v>

4089
01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:47.700
<v Speaker 3>when you have an acl surgery and you use a cadaver acl graft,</v>

4090
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.240
<v Speaker 3>it basically just acts as a scaffold and right.</v>

4091
01:50:50.490 --> 01:50:52.960
<v Speaker 3>And then your body develops to build over it,</v>

4092
01:50:53.210 --> 01:50:54.690
<v Speaker 3>a real acl over it.</v>

4093
01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:57.620
<v Speaker 3>So as you do your rehab and your exercises,</v>

4094
01:50:57.630 --> 01:50:59.770
<v Speaker 3>your body is assimilating that,</v>

4095
01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:02.370
<v Speaker 3>that tissue and taking over with its own.</v>

4096
01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4097
01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:03.721
<v Speaker 3>So in the first,</v>

4098
01:51:03.721 --> 01:51:04.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4099
01:51:04.111 --> 01:51:05.130
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning it's just like,</v>

4100
01:51:05.131 --> 01:51:07.270
<v Speaker 3>it's not really wanting to grow new scaffolding stuff,</v>

4101
01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:09.940
<v Speaker 3>new fucking legs for people that lose their fucking land.</v>

4102
01:51:10.110 --> 01:51:11.490
<v Speaker 3>People think that it was replaced.</v>

4103
01:51:11.491 --> 01:51:11.791
<v Speaker 3>They think,</v>

4104
01:51:11.791 --> 01:51:11.911
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4105
01:51:11.911 --> 01:51:13.410
<v Speaker 3>now I got this new ligament,</v>

4106
01:51:13.411 --> 01:51:14.430
<v Speaker 3>it's in place.</v>

4107
01:51:14.670 --> 01:51:15.370
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4108
01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:15.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4109
01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:16.860
<v Speaker 3>I just got to strengthen it like,</v>

4110
01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:17.091
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4111
01:51:17.091 --> 01:51:17.280
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4112
01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:17.451
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4113
01:51:17.451 --> 01:51:17.671
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4114
01:51:17.671 --> 01:51:18.091
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4115
01:51:18.091 --> 01:51:18.811
<v Speaker 3>it's got to grow.</v>

4116
01:51:18.811 --> 01:51:21.680
<v Speaker 3>There will have to talk about his acl,</v>

4117
01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:21.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4118
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.310
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4119
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:23.520
<v Speaker 3>you feel 100 percent.</v>

4120
01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:23.910
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

4121
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:24.840
<v Speaker 3>he didn't do it that way.</v>

4122
01:51:24.841 --> 01:51:25.860
<v Speaker 3>He did a different thing.</v>

4123
01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:27.120
<v Speaker 3>He did a different thing.</v>

4124
01:51:27.150 --> 01:51:31.800
<v Speaker 3>He did what's called a Patella tendon graft and that I did on my left leg.</v>

4125
01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:32.873
<v Speaker 3>And what that is,</v>

4126
01:51:32.910 --> 01:51:34.770
<v Speaker 3>you know that tendon in the front of your knee,</v>

4127
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:36.570
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the arguments for doing this.</v>

4128
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:38.700
<v Speaker 3>The tenant in front of your knee is really big.</v>

4129
01:51:38.701 --> 01:51:39.331
<v Speaker 3>It's really fat.</v>

4130
01:51:39.331 --> 01:51:40.111
<v Speaker 3>You don't need all of it.</v>

4131
01:51:40.111 --> 01:51:44.040
<v Speaker 3>So they take like a third of it and they have a piece of bone from your Shin</v>

4132
01:51:44.041 --> 01:51:47.370
<v Speaker 3>where it attaches and a piece of bone from your knee cap where it attaches</v>

4133
01:51:47.371 --> 01:51:47.820
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

4134
01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:52.380
<v Speaker 3>And then they open you up like a fish and then they screw it into the bottom of</v>

4135
01:51:52.381 --> 01:51:53.214
<v Speaker 3>your leg.</v>

4136
01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:55.620
<v Speaker 3>They screwed into the top,</v>

4137
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:57.383
<v Speaker 3>scrolling,</v>

4138
01:51:57.690 --> 01:52:00.480
<v Speaker 3>scrolling through the bone into your.</v>

4139
01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:04.950
<v Speaker 3>They drill a hole in your leg and then they screw the bone into place.</v>

4140
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:08.640
<v Speaker 3>I have screws in the bottom of my knee and in the top of my knee and the left</v>

4141
01:52:08.641 --> 01:52:10.710
<v Speaker 3>side that show up and x rays to amazing.</v>

4142
01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:11.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4143
01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.840
<v Speaker 3>And then it's just a matter of getting circulation to that tissue and letting</v>

4144
01:52:15.841 --> 01:52:16.860
<v Speaker 3>that tissue heal up.</v>

4145
01:52:16.861 --> 01:52:17.780
<v Speaker 3>And he was talking about,</v>

4146
01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:21.180
<v Speaker 3>he said he had to wait for a circulation of capital or is it,</v>

4147
01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:22.680
<v Speaker 3>it's a use a long process.</v>

4148
01:52:22.681 --> 01:52:26.400
<v Speaker 3>And you also have to make sure that during that process you don't reinjury</v>

4149
01:52:26.401 --> 01:52:28.740
<v Speaker 3>yourself because you still essentially have no acl on that side.</v>

4150
01:52:28.741 --> 01:52:30.360
<v Speaker 3>This is wobbly piece of flesh.</v>

4151
01:52:30.650 --> 01:52:32.460
<v Speaker 3>When was the last time he fought George?</v>

4152
01:52:32.461 --> 01:52:33.294
<v Speaker 3>It's been awhile.</v>

4153
01:52:33.330 --> 01:52:33.661
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

4154
01:52:33.661 --> 01:52:34.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4155
01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:36.390
<v Speaker 3>he injured his leg at least nine months ago.</v>

4156
01:52:36.570 --> 01:52:36.960
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4157
01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:37.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4158
01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:37.590
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

4159
01:52:37.590 --> 01:52:39.380
<v Speaker 3>he's ready for November and</v>

4160
01:52:40.890 --> 01:52:41.723
<v Speaker 3>know</v>

4161
01:52:42.710 --> 01:52:45.530
<v Speaker 3>a performance enhancing drug.</v>

4162
01:52:45.531 --> 01:52:47.090
<v Speaker 3>I know it's an important test.</v>

4163
01:52:47.091 --> 01:52:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Positive for weed man.</v>

4164
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:49.830
<v Speaker 3>He tested po man.</v>

4165
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:51.081
<v Speaker 3>He didn't listen,</v>

4166
01:52:51.081 --> 01:52:51.914
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4167
01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 3>Fucking Po,</v>

4168
01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Po is on his ass.</v>

4169
01:52:56.930 --> 01:53:00.020
<v Speaker 3>He tested positive for a marijuana metabolite,</v>

4170
01:53:00.021 --> 01:53:01.580
<v Speaker 3>which is non psychoactive.</v>

4171
01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:04.100
<v Speaker 3>So what he had in his system,</v>

4172
01:53:04.101 --> 01:53:06.440
<v Speaker 3>like say if he only took this marijuana metabolite,</v>

4173
01:53:06.441 --> 01:53:07.640
<v Speaker 3>like took it into pill form,</v>

4174
01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:09.170
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't do anything.</v>

4175
01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:09.920
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

4176
01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:11.870
<v Speaker 3>It literally is non psychoactive.</v>

4177
01:53:11.871 --> 01:53:12.800
<v Speaker 3>You can't get high from it.</v>

4178
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:16.510
<v Speaker 3>So the idea of marijuana as a performance enhancing drug with this non</v>

4179
01:53:16.511 --> 01:53:19.160
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive trace element inside your body,</v>

4180
01:53:19.161 --> 01:53:20.630
<v Speaker 3>it's just silly because he wasn't in.</v>

4181
01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:24.230
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing is if he tested that he was tested,</v>

4182
01:53:24.231 --> 01:53:25.670
<v Speaker 3>that he was high when he was fighting.</v>

4183
01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:26.181
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4184
01:53:26.181 --> 01:53:26.871
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

4185
01:53:26.871 --> 01:53:28.880
<v Speaker 3>that has happened when he fought Gomi,</v>

4186
01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:29.901
<v Speaker 3>they did a test.</v>

4187
01:53:29.901 --> 01:53:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he was actually high when he fought gummy,</v>

4188
01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:33.710
<v Speaker 3>but he probably got high of the day before.</v>

4189
01:53:34.610 --> 01:53:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

4190
01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:36.193
<v Speaker 3>Fucking great.</v>

4191
01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:39.550
<v Speaker 3>That was a great fight to going in that Gogo blog.</v>

4192
01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4193
01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:41.030
<v Speaker 3>that was so sweet.</v>

4194
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:42.351
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

4195
01:53:42.351 --> 01:53:44.000
<v Speaker 3>he's so calm under fire,</v>

4196
01:53:44.001 --> 01:53:44.470
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4197
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.940
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

4198
01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:47.490
<v Speaker 3>he sets that shit up and slapped it on me.</v>

4199
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.960
<v Speaker 3>That was a.</v>

4200
01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:48.561
<v Speaker 3>That was a big,</v>

4201
01:53:48.561 --> 01:53:49.240
<v Speaker 3>big victory.</v>

4202
01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:50.420
<v Speaker 3>That was some anger.</v>

4203
01:53:50.421 --> 01:53:51.650
<v Speaker 3>But that controlled anger,</v>

4204
01:53:51.651 --> 01:53:53.570
<v Speaker 3>like somehow he can keep it.</v>

4205
01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:54.890
<v Speaker 3>The thing is about is pace.</v>

4206
01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Nick Diaz has this crazy pace that he can keep going,</v>

4207
01:53:57.530 --> 01:54:00.440
<v Speaker 3>so other dudes like as you were in this wild dog fight with him,</v>

4208
01:54:00.441 --> 01:54:02.720
<v Speaker 3>they were out and he just keeps going.</v>

4209
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Well that's kind of why I'd like to see it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Cane definitely had a knee injury.</v>

4225
01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:28.670
<v Speaker 3>They fall on Fox and know cain stood up with them a little bit too long and</v>

4226
01:54:28.671 --> 01:54:30.560
<v Speaker 3>junior just winged the bomb.</v>

4227
01:54:30.570 --> 01:54:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Adam and caught him right in the town wearing gloves and those guys.</v>

4228
01:54:34.041 --> 01:54:35.570
<v Speaker 3>When you guys guys who hit that hard,</v>

4229
01:54:35.610 --> 01:54:37.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what your head looks like.</v>

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:37.873
<v Speaker 3>You're going out.</v>

4231
01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:38.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4233
01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:40.160
<v Speaker 3>junior punches fucking hard.</v>

4234
01:54:40.210 --> 01:54:40.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4235
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:42.800
<v Speaker 3>he punches hard and he swung that one.</v>

4236
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:43.701
<v Speaker 3>They're fighting again.</v>

4237
01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:47.360
<v Speaker 3>January the January first weekend.</v>

4238
01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:48.590
<v Speaker 3>I think it's December 29th.</v>

4239
01:54:48.650 --> 01:54:50.360
<v Speaker 3>The big event in Vegas.</v>

4240
01:54:50.361 --> 01:54:51.380
<v Speaker 3>It should be fucking crazy.</v>

4241
01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:54.530
<v Speaker 3>And that's the rematch because everybody thought before that fight,</v>

4242
01:54:54.531 --> 01:54:56.120
<v Speaker 3>the junior dos Santos was going to be,</v>

4243
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:57.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4244
01:54:57.130 --> 01:54:58.400
<v Speaker 3>a top fighter,</v>

4245
01:54:58.620 --> 01:54:59.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4246
01:54:59.020 --> 01:54:59.140
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4247
01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:02.240
<v Speaker 3>they definitely thought that he had a chance of winning that fight.</v>

4248
01:55:02.241 --> 01:55:03.740
<v Speaker 3>But king was the favorite,</v>

4249
01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:04.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4250
01:55:04.190 --> 01:55:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Cain was the guy that everybody felt like after he destroyed brock Lesnar,</v>

4251
01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:09.320
<v Speaker 3>every Goddamn Cain Velasquez might be the best ever.</v>

4252
01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.150
<v Speaker 3>What a fucking heavyweight destroyer.</v>

4253
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:15.530
<v Speaker 3>But junior just changed the whole course of the heavyweight title picture with</v>

4254
01:55:15.531 --> 01:55:16.364
<v Speaker 3>one punch,</v>

4255
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.881
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

4256
01:55:16.881 --> 01:55:19.340
<v Speaker 3>And now everybody's scared of junior.</v>

4257
01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:20.690
<v Speaker 3>He's so hard to take down.</v>

4258
01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:21.860
<v Speaker 3>He's so hard to take down.</v>

4259
01:55:21.861 --> 01:55:22.880
<v Speaker 3>His hands are so good.</v>

4260
01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:23.301
<v Speaker 3>Didn't he?</v>

4261
01:55:23.301 --> 01:55:23.511
<v Speaker 3>Didn't,</v>

4262

4285
01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:55.680
<v Speaker 8>We tried to arm wrestle.</v>

4286
01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:56.490
<v Speaker 8>He picks me up,</v>

4287
01:55:56.490 --> 01:56:00.240
<v Speaker 8>he starts squeezing me and I started immediately tapping and he goes,</v>

4288
01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:02.220
<v Speaker 8>that's 40 percent bro.</v>

4289
01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:04.560
<v Speaker 8>And I look at nate markers right there.</v>

4290
01:56:04.561 --> 01:56:05.190
<v Speaker 8>And I go,</v>

4291
01:56:05.190 --> 01:56:06.150
<v Speaker 8>could he do that to you?</v>

4292
01:56:06.151 --> 01:56:06.750
<v Speaker 8>And it goes,</v>

4293
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:07.501
<v Speaker 8>if I let him,</v>

4294
01:56:07.501 --> 01:56:07.771
<v Speaker 8>yes.</v>

4295
01:56:07.771 --> 01:56:08.604
<v Speaker 8>He goes,</v>

4296
01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:08.971
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

4297
01:56:08.971 --> 01:56:09.840
<v Speaker 8>he's a spooky dude.</v>

4298
01:56:09.841 --> 01:56:10.980
<v Speaker 8>He's got some serious strength.</v>

4299
01:56:11.190 --> 01:56:15.330
<v Speaker 8>He had a long series of injuries that he got from football.</v>

4300
01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.400
<v Speaker 8>Quite a few.</v>

4301
01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:18.990
<v Speaker 8>And he's had some surgeries to sort of clear up some of the issues,</v>

4302
01:56:18.991 --> 01:56:21.270
<v Speaker 8>but when that stuff starts fucking with you,</v>

4303
01:56:21.271 --> 01:56:21.630
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>

4304
01:56:21.630 --> 01:56:21.870
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4305
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:23.460
<v Speaker 8>especially back in nerve issues.</v>

4306
01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:24.293
<v Speaker 8>He's had a lot of that.</v>

4307
01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:25.950
<v Speaker 8>That yeah.</v>

4308
01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:29.880
<v Speaker 8>Well I think he's probably smart to keep that full time job,</v>

4309
01:56:29.881 --> 01:56:30.150
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>

4310
01:56:30.150 --> 01:56:32.910
<v Speaker 8>I mean he likes working till he says it separates.</v>

4311
01:56:32.911 --> 01:56:37.110
<v Speaker 8>His family likes work and he says it's the work sort of separates him from the</v>

4312
01:56:37.111 --> 01:56:40.470
<v Speaker 8>gym time and let them to completely relax and get into his work.</v>

4313
01:56:40.471 --> 01:56:42.780
<v Speaker 8>And he allows him not to dwell on it,</v>

4314
01:56:42.850 --> 01:56:45.660
<v Speaker 8>like some fighters just have the whole data themselves.</v>

4315
01:56:45.661 --> 01:56:47.070
<v Speaker 8>You said he's got such a good sense of humor.</v>

4316
01:56:47.071 --> 01:56:52.071
<v Speaker 8>I did little guest spot on on the ultimate fighter and I came in at one point I</v>

4317
01:56:52.291 --> 01:56:52.380
<v Speaker 8>had,</v>

4318
01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.131
<v Speaker 8>when I first met him,</v>

4319
01:56:53.131 --> 01:56:53.341
<v Speaker 8>I go,</v>

4322
01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:55.050
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what I do.</v>

4323
01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:58.350
<v Speaker 8>Like what would I do with you if you were my roommate in prison?</v>

4324
01:56:58.351 --> 01:56:59.070

4325
01:56:59.070 --> 01:57:00.120
<v Speaker 8>What would I do against you?</v>

4326
01:57:00.121 --> 01:57:00.900
<v Speaker 8>And he goes,</v>

4327
01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:03.850
<v Speaker 8>you'd suck my cock with those eyes.</v>

4328

4394
01:58:33.331 --> 01:58:35.010
<v Speaker 8>he went with Rinella and they shot a Caribou,</v>

4395
01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:39.090
<v Speaker 8>but apparently they had a chase grizzly bears out of camp because the care.</v>

4396
01:58:39.110 --> 01:58:39.390
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4397
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:41.100
<v Speaker 8>because what was happening was the Caribou,</v>

4398
01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:41.651
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

4399
01:58:41.651 --> 01:58:43.870
<v Speaker 8>you find them when they run in these big herds.</v>

4400
01:58:43.871 --> 01:58:44.171
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4401
01:58:44.171 --> 01:58:45.520
<v Speaker 8>You go out and stock when you find them.</v>

4402
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:45.761
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

4403
01:58:45.761 --> 01:58:50.320
<v Speaker 8>there's camp grounds and some of the Caribou had gone through the places where</v>

4404
01:58:50.321 --> 01:58:51.154
<v Speaker 8>people were camping.</v>

4405
01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:56.290
<v Speaker 8>So the folks that were there before them had shot Caribou in that camp grounds</v>

4406
01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:59.500
<v Speaker 8>in the campground smelled like butchered flesh.</v>

4407
01:58:59.530 --> 01:59:00.040
<v Speaker 8>Fuck.</v>

4408
01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:01.330
<v Speaker 8>They had gut piles.</v>

4409
01:59:01.331 --> 01:59:03.610
<v Speaker 8>They had animals hanging from me.</v>

4410
01:59:03.611 --> 01:59:05.380
<v Speaker 8>So when they got there that night,</v>

4411
01:59:05.410 --> 01:59:06.640
<v Speaker 8>the grizzly bears came.</v>

4412
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:07.990
<v Speaker 8>So they had a scare him off.</v>

4413
01:59:07.991 --> 01:59:09.340
<v Speaker 8>They had a run at them and shoot at him.</v>

4414
01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:10.383

4418
01:59:13.090 --> 01:59:15.040

<v Speaker 8>Worried about bears?</v>

4422
01:59:21.221 --> 01:59:21.760
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>

<v Speaker 8>he was,</v>

4425
01:59:22.461 --> 01:59:26.110
<v Speaker 8>I was just fucking thinking about bears because as it got down to like the last</v>

4426
01:59:26.111 --> 01:59:27.490
<v Speaker 8>couple of weeks we were like,</v>

4427
01:59:27.491 --> 01:59:30.010
<v Speaker 8>we're really going to go camping with these crazy animals and the middle of</v>

4428
01:59:30.011 --> 01:59:30.500
<v Speaker 8>nowhere.</v>

4429
01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:31.333
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

4430
01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:36.130
<v Speaker 8>you're in a tent and you can't protect yourself.</v>

4431
01:59:36.131 --> 01:59:37.030
<v Speaker 8>You can't see a common.</v>

4432
01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:38.890
<v Speaker 8>Especially for the first night was freezing rain.</v>

4433
01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:42.300
<v Speaker 8>The first night was 35 degrees outside and we were sleeping in.</v>

4434
01:59:42.301 --> 01:59:47.301
<v Speaker 8>It's pouring rain and twelfth grades on that boat on a canoe for four hours.</v>

4435
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.661
<v Speaker 8>I had,</v>

4436
01:59:49.661 --> 01:59:51.310
<v Speaker 8>I was literally wearing a sleeping bag.</v>

4437
01:59:51.311 --> 01:59:52.150
<v Speaker 8>I was fucking cold.</v>

4438
01:59:52.330 --> 01:59:53.200
<v Speaker 8>It was cold as shit.</v>

4439
01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:54.030
<v Speaker 8>But uh,</v>

4440
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.280
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

4441
01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:55.690
<v Speaker 8>I'll use it as an exercise.</v>

4442
01:59:56.170 --> 01:59:57.280
<v Speaker 8>The rowing part,</v>

4443
01:59:57.281 --> 01:59:59.920
<v Speaker 8>I just rode as hard as I could use it as a workout.</v>

4444
01:59:59.921 --> 02:00:00.731
<v Speaker 8>And then the hiking,</v>

4445
02:00:00.731 --> 02:00:01.470
<v Speaker 8>I just thought of,</v>

4446
02:00:01.470 --> 02:00:01.870
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4447
02:00:01.870 --> 02:00:05.200
<v Speaker 8>control my breathing and use the hiking is just moving up.</v>

4448
02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:07.210
<v Speaker 8>There's no promise promise when you weren't moving,</v>

4449
02:00:07.211 --> 02:00:07.720
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4450
02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:11.410
<v Speaker 8>I almost did a workout the day before we left.</v>

4451
02:00:11.530 --> 02:00:12.850
<v Speaker 8>I was sitting around the house.</v>

4452
02:00:12.851 --> 02:00:13.800
<v Speaker 8>I was packing up all my shit.</v>

4453
02:00:13.801 --> 02:00:14.021
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

4454
02:00:14.021 --> 02:00:17.290
<v Speaker 8>maybe I should just go lift to do a crazy kettlebell workout or something.</v>

4455
02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:18.191
<v Speaker 8>If I did that,</v>

4456
02:00:18.191 --> 02:00:19.660
<v Speaker 8>I would have been so fucked.</v>

4457
02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:22.440
<v Speaker 8>I had no idea it was going to be so physically demanding.</v>

4458
02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:24.010
<v Speaker 8>Those guys have.</v>

4459
02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:27.970
<v Speaker 8>You have to be in serious shit canoeing and then you're hiking and you got to</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what makes the fucking.</v>

4563
02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:18.430
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes the plot sounds better.</v>

4564
02:03:18.850 --> 02:03:20.380
<v Speaker 3>It makes the give it more drama.</v>

4565
02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:22.190
<v Speaker 3>Even while they're both working for the same people.</v>

4566
02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Actually there's a lot more romney than I thought.</v>

4567
02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:24.671
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4568
02:03:24.671 --> 02:03:25.510
<v Speaker 3>white people are mad.</v>

4569
02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:26.520
<v Speaker 3>When we were in Montana,</v>

4570
02:03:26.530 --> 02:03:28.660
<v Speaker 3>we actually encountered a douchebag at a restaurant.</v>

4571
02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:31.090
<v Speaker 3>There was a like berating us,</v>

4572
02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:35.080
<v Speaker 3>you know about Obama as if he knew we were voting for Obama.</v>

4573
02:03:35.081 --> 02:03:37.120
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just that he wanted us to vote for Romney.</v>

4574
02:03:37.121 --> 02:03:38.470
<v Speaker 3>He was going to intimidate us.</v>

4575
02:03:38.850 --> 02:03:41.020
<v Speaker 3>He was such a fucking yogurt.</v>

4576
02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4577
02:03:41.410 --> 02:03:42.243
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

4578
02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:43.870
<v Speaker 3>it was really funny when you go.</v>

4579
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:45.100
<v Speaker 3>It was a cool little diner.</v>

4580
02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:46.090
<v Speaker 3>It was too bad.</v>

4581
02:03:46.091 --> 02:03:50.590
<v Speaker 3>This guy ruined the experience by being the owner because the waitress was real</v>

4582
02:03:50.591 --> 02:03:51.190
<v Speaker 3>nice.</v>

4583
02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:53.310
<v Speaker 3>The food was great and we're sitting there.</v>

4584
02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:54.580
<v Speaker 3>God put him in his place though.</v>

4585
02:03:54.670 --> 02:03:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4586
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4587
02:03:55.491 --> 02:03:55.731
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

4588
02:03:55.731 --> 02:03:56.411
<v Speaker 3>It was interesting.</v>

4589
02:03:56.411 --> 02:03:58.180
<v Speaker 3>We were still dirty from the road.</v>

4590
02:03:58.181 --> 02:03:58.481
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4591
02:03:58.481 --> 02:03:59.950
<v Speaker 3>We had hadn't shaved.</v>

4592
02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:01.000
<v Speaker 3>We hadn't washed.</v>

4593
02:04:01.001 --> 02:04:05.590
<v Speaker 3>We hadn't bathed in five days and we were driving from the river to billings,</v>

4594
02:04:05.591 --> 02:04:08.890
<v Speaker 3>which is about two and a half hours and we stopped and got some food at this</v>

4595
02:04:08.891 --> 02:04:10.690
<v Speaker 3>diner in the middle of fucking nowhere and</v>

4596
02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:12.241
<v Speaker 8>walks up and goes,</v>

4597
02:04:12.241 --> 02:04:13.660
<v Speaker 8>you ain't voting for Obama?</v>

4598
02:04:13.710 --> 02:04:14.130
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4599
02:04:14.130 --> 02:04:15.750
<v Speaker 8>he killed two of my boys.</v>

4600
02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:16.081
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

4601
02:04:16.081 --> 02:04:17.630
<v Speaker 8>now I am yet two of my boys that we.</v>

4602
02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:22.320
<v Speaker 8>They got to have a to of mine seal team and he had a marine hat on,</v>

4603
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:23.700
<v Speaker 8>had a shrine in the marines.</v>

4604
02:04:23.701 --> 02:04:24.900
<v Speaker 8>He never did a day in combat.</v>

4605
02:04:24.901 --> 02:04:25.651
<v Speaker 8>You can see those guys.</v>

4606
02:04:25.651 --> 02:04:25.921
<v Speaker 8>You're like,</v>

4607
02:04:25.921 --> 02:04:26.401
<v Speaker 8>oh you.</v>

4608
02:04:26.401 --> 02:04:30.570
<v Speaker 8>You were the guy who who fucking fake an injury when all the other guys were</v>

4609
02:04:30.571 --> 02:04:31.980
<v Speaker 8>going out and that's what I think.</v>

4610
02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:34.240
<v Speaker 8>Who knows what he did that might've been a smart move.</v>

4611
02:04:34.330 --> 02:04:36.480
<v Speaker 8>Faking injuries given that much.</v>

4612
02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:39.900
<v Speaker 8>My fucking put a desk.</v>

4613
02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:42.030
<v Speaker 8>Romney's that projected winner in Georgia.</v>

4614
02:04:42.031 --> 02:04:42.870
<v Speaker 8>That's shocking,</v>

4615
02:04:43.050 --> 02:04:44.530
<v Speaker 8>is a really hot land.</v>

4616
02:04:45.110 --> 02:04:46.290
<v Speaker 8>A lot of white people in Georgia,</v>

4617
02:04:46.291 --> 02:04:46.471
<v Speaker 8>dude,</v>

4618
02:04:46.471 --> 02:04:47.161
<v Speaker 8>don't kill yourself,</v>

4619
02:04:47.161 --> 02:04:47.994
<v Speaker 8>don't kid yourself.</v>

4620
02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:51.270
<v Speaker 8>George has got some money to Atlanta specialist.</v>

4621
02:04:51.290 --> 02:04:54.510
<v Speaker 8>It's kind of calmed down there now and there are a lot of black professionals in</v>

4622
02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:55.081
<v Speaker 8>Atlanta,</v>

4623
02:04:55.081 --> 02:04:57.700
<v Speaker 8>like it's really interesting to kind of a cool thing to see.</v>

4624
02:04:57.700 --> 02:04:59.790
<v Speaker 8>Like the hotel I'm staying at his,</v>

4625
02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:00.361
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4626
02:05:00.361 --> 02:05:00.681
<v Speaker 8>all,</v>

4627
02:05:00.681 --> 02:05:01.001
<v Speaker 8>all,</v>

4628
02:05:01.001 --> 02:05:04.090
<v Speaker 8>like just kind of mostly professional black people and,</v>

4629
02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:04.490
<v Speaker 8>and uh,</v>

4630
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:04.630
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

4631
02:05:04.630 --> 02:05:04.831
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

4632
02:05:04.831 --> 02:05:05.030
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

4633
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.241
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

4634
02:05:05.241 --> 02:05:05.530
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

4635
02:05:05.530 --> 02:05:05.610
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4636
02:05:05.610 --> 02:05:06.443
<v Speaker 8>there was a lot of,</v>

4637
02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:07.681
<v Speaker 8>I think a lot of middle class,</v>

4638
02:05:07.681 --> 02:05:10.070
<v Speaker 8>upper class black people went down to it and let Atlanta because there was,</v>

4639
02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:12.420
<v Speaker 8>the economy was there and stuff for them at the time.</v>

4640
02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:13.830
<v Speaker 8>And it's pretty cool,</v>

4641
02:05:13.831 --> 02:05:14.041
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

4642
02:05:14.041 --> 02:05:14.301
<v Speaker 8>It's a,</v>

4643
02:05:14.301 --> 02:05:14.760
<v Speaker 8>it's a,</v>

4644
02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:16.200
<v Speaker 8>it looks like a town primarily.</v>

4645
02:05:16.201 --> 02:05:18.900
<v Speaker 8>You see a lot of black people in positions of authority and,</v>

4646
02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:20.093
<v Speaker 8>and uh,</v>

4647
02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:23.310
<v Speaker 8>and the movie I'm doing right now is all that and it's really refreshing,</v>

4648
02:05:23.311 --> 02:05:23.491
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

4649
02:05:23.491 --> 02:05:24.310
<v Speaker 8>It's kind of a cool idea.</v>

4650
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.990
<v Speaker 8>I haven't seen it.</v>

4651
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:26.580
<v Speaker 8>You see that more in Atlanta than anywhere.</v>

4652
02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:29.730
<v Speaker 8>Atlanta is a very fascinating in that way.</v>

4653
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:30.730
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

4654
02:05:30.730 --> 02:05:31.210
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4655
02:05:31.210 --> 02:05:31.440
<v Speaker 8>to,</v>

4656
02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:34.230
<v Speaker 8>to be a young black person in this country.</v>

4657
02:05:34.231 --> 02:05:35.310
<v Speaker 8>And look for role models,</v>

4658
02:05:35.610 --> 02:05:38.010
<v Speaker 8>it's got to be unbelievably hard,</v>

4659
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:39.090
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4660
02:05:39.090 --> 02:05:44.090
<v Speaker 8>and to see like a guy like Obama get into office and have everybody's so fucking</v>

4661
02:05:44.581 --> 02:05:45.930
<v Speaker 8>mad at them and everybody,</v>

4662
02:05:45.931 --> 02:05:49.070
<v Speaker 8>like all these white people just having said that though,</v>

4663
02:05:49.071 --> 02:05:50.270
<v Speaker 8>the people that did elect him,</v>

4664
02:05:50.271 --> 02:05:51.300
<v Speaker 8>we're at where white people.</v>

4665
02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:51.581
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>

4666
02:05:51.581 --> 02:05:51.900
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

4667
02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:52.900
<v Speaker 8>I mean I voted for him.</v>

4668
02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:53.551
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4669
02:05:53.551 --> 02:05:55.770
<v Speaker 8>like right people read books.</v>

4670
02:05:55.890 --> 02:05:57.480
<v Speaker 8>But the white people don't read books.</v>

4671
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:58.860
<v Speaker 8>Those white people hate him.</v>

4672
02:05:59.310 --> 02:06:01.470
<v Speaker 8>It's interesting when they listened to like,</v>

4673
02:06:01.471 --> 02:06:04.260
<v Speaker 8>I'm not saying that Obama was a saint and I'm not saying that I'm a supporter</v>

4674
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:06.930
<v Speaker 8>because I certainly wasn't supportive before he got into office.</v>

4675
02:06:06.931 --> 02:06:09.120
<v Speaker 8>But then I think I liked them as a human being.</v>

4676
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:10.800
<v Speaker 8>Like when I listened to him talk,</v>

4677
02:06:10.801 --> 02:06:12.850
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't sound good Dick Guy.</v>

4678
02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:15.390
<v Speaker 8>I liked him because he strikes me as eminently sensible.</v>

4679
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:17.220
<v Speaker 8>I don't think the socialist,</v>

4680
02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:18.240
<v Speaker 8>the one thing he said,</v>

4681
02:06:18.241 --> 02:06:18.660
<v Speaker 8>he said,</v>

4682
02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:19.090
<v Speaker 8>he said,</v>

4683
02:06:19.090 --> 02:06:20.760
<v Speaker 8>what is the one thing we don't know about you?</v>

4684
02:06:20.761 --> 02:06:21.540
<v Speaker 8>And he said,</v>

4685
02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:24.810
<v Speaker 8>I believe the free enterprise system is the most important,</v>

4686
02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:25.980
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4687
02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:26.430
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4688
02:06:26.430 --> 02:06:29.560
<v Speaker 8>something to the effect of it's the most important thing for a high standard</v>

4689
02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:30.130
<v Speaker 8>you're living.</v>

4690
02:06:30.130 --> 02:06:30.851
<v Speaker 2>He said there's but,</v>

4691
02:06:30.851 --> 02:06:31.061
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4692
02:06:31.061 --> 02:06:31.300
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4693
02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:32.140
<v Speaker 2>but with,</v>

4694
02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:33.890
<v Speaker 2>with checks and balances.</v>

4695
02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:34.910
<v Speaker 2>And so I think he's,</v>

4696
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:38.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he is this far left guy.</v>

4697
02:06:38.601 --> 02:06:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I actually think he's very much in the middle in a very sensible guy.</v>

4698
02:06:41.661 --> 02:06:43.640
<v Speaker 2>And I think the more I read about his policies,</v>

4699
02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I happen to agree with his foreign policy,</v>

4700
02:06:45.771 --> 02:06:48.350
<v Speaker 2>visa vi Iran and other places more than I do with Rami.</v>

4701
02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I just think he's more reasonable.</v>

4702
02:06:50.121 --> 02:06:50.954
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

4703
02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:52.010
<v Speaker 2>He's a very smart guy.</v>

4704
02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:54.020
<v Speaker 2>But the issue is that I can't really,</v>

4705
02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:58.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't really see him being able to do what anybody.</v>

4706
02:06:58.970 --> 02:07:02.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any one person that has any real say,</v>

4707
02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:02.700
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4708
02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:04.190
<v Speaker 2>there never has been in our government.</v>

4709
02:07:04.191 --> 02:07:04.851
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to,</v>

4710
02:07:04.851 --> 02:07:05.960
<v Speaker 2>but I know what you're saying.</v>

4711
02:07:05.961 --> 02:07:08.810
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying it's like all the different things that he wanted to do before he</v>

4712
02:07:08.811 --> 02:07:09.441
<v Speaker 2>got into office,</v>

4713
02:07:09.441 --> 02:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>closed Guantanamo Bay,</v>

4714
02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.820
<v Speaker 2>you know when he said he would veto the NDA,</v>

4715
02:07:13.821 --> 02:07:15.170
<v Speaker 2>the all the different things.</v>

4716
02:07:15.171 --> 02:07:19.730
<v Speaker 2>It's so blatantly obvious that the position is not what we envisioned.</v>

4717
02:07:19.731 --> 02:07:21.020
<v Speaker 2>That was when we were kids.</v>

4718
02:07:21.021 --> 02:07:23.540
<v Speaker 2>We thought of being the president and this is one guy who was going to figure it</v>

4719
02:07:23.541 --> 02:07:24.050
<v Speaker 2>all out.</v>

4720
02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Everybody get in line,</v>

4721
02:07:25.281 --> 02:07:26.510
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do this the right way,</v>

4722
02:07:26.511 --> 02:07:28.520
<v Speaker 2>and he leads us to victory like this.</v>

4723
02:07:28.521 --> 02:07:30.920
<v Speaker 2>This system is a fucking complicated.</v>

4724
02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Just know maybe what you said.</v>

4725
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:36.250
<v Speaker 2>What you said is that the biggest thing is most people don't feel represented.</v>

4726
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:37.170
<v Speaker 7>It's like you know,</v>

4727
02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:37.341
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

4728
02:07:37.341 --> 02:07:37.631
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

4729
02:07:37.631 --> 02:07:37.901
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

4730
02:07:37.901 --> 02:07:41.530
<v Speaker 7>you feel like if you vote for Romney or you vote for Obama is not going to make</v>

4731
02:07:41.590 --> 02:07:44.440
<v Speaker 7>that much of a difference because you're kind of voting for the same guy in some</v>

4732
02:07:44.441 --> 02:07:44.660
<v Speaker 7>way.</v>

4733
02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:44.940
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4734
02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:49.940
<v Speaker 8>The that moved into the position of power that is clearly stronger and more</v>

4735
02:07:50.241 --> 02:07:53.000
<v Speaker 8>influential than the people can have a big,</v>

4736
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:57.610
<v Speaker 8>big effect on who gets elected to the supreme court and socially they have</v>

4737
02:07:57.660 --> 02:07:59.370
<v Speaker 7>an impact on an agenda.</v>

4738
02:07:59.400 --> 02:07:59.731
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4739
02:07:59.731 --> 02:08:00.091
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

4740
02:08:00.091 --> 02:08:00.810
<v Speaker 7>and I have,</v>

4741
02:08:00.810 --> 02:08:05.490
<v Speaker 7>I actually think that Romney in Obama's foreign policy or different enough,</v>

4742
02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:08.790
<v Speaker 7>I think that romney is rattling his sword in Iran.</v>

4743
02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:09.510
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

4744
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:10.181
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

4745
02:08:10.181 --> 02:08:11.580
<v Speaker 7>I just don't agree with.</v>

4746
02:08:12.090 --> 02:08:15.430
<v Speaker 8>I don't think anybody who's a governor could ever possibly know what it's like</v>

4747
02:08:15.431 --> 02:08:18.850
<v Speaker 8>to be a president at the same way when Obama was running for office and he said</v>

4748
02:08:18.851 --> 02:08:21.400
<v Speaker 8>he would do this about Afghanistan and mccain went,</v>

4749
02:08:21.401 --> 02:08:21.611
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

4750
02:08:21.611 --> 02:08:21.821
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

4751
02:08:21.821 --> 02:08:22.470
<v Speaker 8>whoa.</v>

4752
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:23.530
<v Speaker 8>Like you don't you know,</v>

4753
02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:23.770
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

4754
02:08:23.770 --> 02:08:25.300
<v Speaker 8>you can't say this is some shit.</v>

4755
02:08:25.301 --> 02:08:29.530
<v Speaker 8>When Mccain and Romney and Obama were campaigning where it was clearly</v>

4756
02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:31.240
<v Speaker 8>campaigning talk,</v>

4757
02:08:31.241 --> 02:08:32.830
<v Speaker 8>it was clearly like speeches,</v>

4758
02:08:33.010 --> 02:08:36.760
<v Speaker 8>but there was a moment when Obama was talking about Afghanistan and Mccain went</v>

4759
02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:37.210
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

4760
02:08:37.210 --> 02:08:39.160
<v Speaker 8>you don't even know what you're talking about.</v>

4761
02:08:39.190 --> 02:08:43.510
<v Speaker 8>Like you're describing an area that hasn't changed much since the time of</v>

4762
02:08:43.511 --> 02:08:44.820
<v Speaker 8>Alexander the Great,</v>

4763
02:08:45.090 --> 02:08:48.070
<v Speaker 8>like this idea that you're going to go in there and just take over the land.</v>

4764
02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:48.913
<v Speaker 8>Like you're,</v>

4765
02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:49.751
<v Speaker 8>that's crazy.</v>

4766
02:08:49.751 --> 02:08:50.530
<v Speaker 8>Talk like,</v>

4767
02:08:50.530 --> 02:08:50.861
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4768
02:08:50.861 --> 02:08:51.401
<v Speaker 8>and Mccain,</v>

4769
02:08:51.401 --> 02:08:52.234
<v Speaker 8>the way he did it,</v>

4770
02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:52.721
<v Speaker 8>it was like,</v>

4771
02:08:52.721 --> 02:08:52.991
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

4772
02:08:52.991 --> 02:08:53.231
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

4773
02:08:53.231 --> 02:08:53.500
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

4774
02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:54.010
<v Speaker 8>son.</v>

4775
02:08:54.010 --> 02:08:54.520
<v Speaker 8>It was like,</v>

4776
02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:55.840
<v Speaker 8>this was a serious topic.</v>

4777
02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:58.660
<v Speaker 8>All that fucking campaign and bullshit aside.</v>

4778
02:08:58.661 --> 02:08:58.811
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

4779
02:08:58.811 --> 02:08:59.070
<v Speaker 8>you're,</v>

4780
02:08:59.070 --> 02:08:59.380
<v Speaker 8>you're,</v>

4781
02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:01.020
<v Speaker 8>you're talking about what I did for a living.</v>

4782
02:09:01.450 --> 02:09:02.410
<v Speaker 8>You're talking crazy.</v>

4783
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:05.500
<v Speaker 8>Like you don't know what the with it's what happens to presidents</v>

4784
02:09:05.730 --> 02:09:06.340
<v Speaker 7>realizing it.</v>

4785
02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:07.910
<v Speaker 7>Certainly I got that impression from,</v>

4786
02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:09.680
<v Speaker 7>from our scenario where,</v>

4787
02:09:09.810 --> 02:09:10.643
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4788
02:09:10.830 --> 02:09:11.820
<v Speaker 7>the impression I got from him,</v>

4789
02:09:11.821 --> 02:09:13.320
<v Speaker 7>what he's saying is that you don't have any power.</v>

4790
02:09:13.380 --> 02:09:13.561
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

4791
02:09:13.561 --> 02:09:13.681
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

4792
02:09:13.681 --> 02:09:13.861
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

4793
02:09:13.861 --> 02:09:16.080
<v Speaker 7>you can set an agenda and you can veto things,</v>

4794
02:09:16.081 --> 02:09:16.980
<v Speaker 7>but at the end of the day,</v>

4795
02:09:16.981 --> 02:09:19.710
<v Speaker 7>you're not doing much without congress.</v>

4796
02:09:19.950 --> 02:09:20.783
<v Speaker 7>If anything.</v>

4797
02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:21.120
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4798
02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:21.390
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

4799
02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:22.021
<v Speaker 7>and by the way,</v>

4800
02:09:22.021 --> 02:09:23.220
<v Speaker 7>you're dealing with a lot of different,</v>

4801
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.710
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4802
02:09:23.710 --> 02:09:24.750
<v Speaker 7>a vested interest</v>

4803
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.110
<v Speaker 8>in the congressional choices coming up this,</v>

4804
02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:27.961
<v Speaker 8>this election,</v>

4805
02:09:27.961 --> 02:09:31.770
<v Speaker 8>it might be more important even than what's going on with residents because</v>

4806
02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:37.100
<v Speaker 8>there's so much fucking waste and so many dumb people that have gotten into</v>

4807
02:09:37.681 --> 02:09:38.670
<v Speaker 8>elected offices.</v>

4808
02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:42.690
<v Speaker 8>There's so much bullshit there and slowly but surely it gets exposed,</v>

4809
02:09:42.691 --> 02:09:46.250
<v Speaker 8>but it's still the key problem never gets addressed.</v>

4810
02:09:46.251 --> 02:09:49.800
<v Speaker 8>The key problem of special interest groups and funny money there that none of</v>

4811
02:09:49.801 --> 02:09:50.760
<v Speaker 8>that stuff gets addressed.</v>

4812
02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:52.020
<v Speaker 8>So it all stays.</v>

4813
02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:53.640
<v Speaker 8>Question also becomes this</v>

4814
02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:53.940
<v Speaker 7>though,</v>

4815
02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:54.410
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4816
02:09:54.410 --> 02:09:54.801
<v Speaker 7>if,</v>

4817
02:09:54.801 --> 02:09:55.040
<v Speaker 7>if,</v>

4818
02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:55.400
<v Speaker 7>if,</v>

4819
02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:57.720
<v Speaker 7>if indeed you have special interest in,</v>

4820
02:09:57.721 --> 02:10:00.080
<v Speaker 7>you're always going to have smart people that figure out a way to manipulate the</v>

4821
02:10:00.081 --> 02:10:00.441
<v Speaker 7>machine.</v>

4822
02:10:00.441 --> 02:10:00.920
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4823
02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:04.370
<v Speaker 7>Then then then is the answer to make the machine less influential?</v>

4824
02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:06.650
<v Speaker 7>Meaning do you make the machine smaller?</v>

4825
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:08.570
<v Speaker 7>That may be the only way to do it.</v>

4826
02:10:08.571 --> 02:10:10.880
<v Speaker 7>I think that's kind of the conservative argument,</v>

4827
02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:14.470
<v Speaker 8>but that's the real conservative argument.</v>

4828
02:10:15.050 --> 02:10:16.070
<v Speaker 8>Real conservative.</v>

4829
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:18.410
<v Speaker 8>But when you say the word conserve you though,</v>

4830
02:10:18.411 --> 02:10:18.621
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

4831
02:10:18.621 --> 02:10:20.210
<v Speaker 8>I don't want queers getting married.</v>

4832
02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:21.760
<v Speaker 8>That's the first thing that people think.</v>

4833
02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:22.660
<v Speaker 8>I think</v>

4834
02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:23.180
<v Speaker 7>I'm not,</v>

4835
02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:24.013
<v Speaker 7>I'm not a,</v>

4836
02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:24.461
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4837
02:10:24.461 --> 02:10:24.850
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4838
02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:25.683
<v Speaker 7>I am.</v>

4839
02:10:25.710 --> 02:10:27.020
<v Speaker 7>When I say conservative,</v>

4840
02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:31.550
<v Speaker 7>I just believe that the state shouldn't be involved in who I choose to marry,</v>

4841
02:10:31.551 --> 02:10:32.600
<v Speaker 7>whether it's channing tatum,</v>

4842
02:10:32.601 --> 02:10:33.434
<v Speaker 7>matthew,</v>

4843
02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:33.990
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>

4844
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.280
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4845
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:35.090
<v Speaker 7>a girl.</v>

4846
02:10:35.090 --> 02:10:35.421
<v Speaker 7>Sorry,</v>

4847
02:10:35.421 --> 02:10:35.930
<v Speaker 7>I use those.</v>

4848
02:10:35.930 --> 02:10:36.700
<v Speaker 7>Sorry.</v>

4849
02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:36.890
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4850
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:37.221
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4851
02:10:37.221 --> 02:10:37.491
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>

4852
02:10:37.491 --> 02:10:37.731
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>

4853
02:10:37.731 --> 02:10:38.930
<v Speaker 7>or the fact that I can't get,</v>

4854
02:10:38.931 --> 02:10:40.340
<v Speaker 7>I can't smoke cannabis.</v>

4855
02:10:40.590 --> 02:10:43.340
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying I'm going to get into a car and drive to tons of fast moving</v>

4856
02:10:43.341 --> 02:10:44.121
<v Speaker 7>steel if I get caught.</v>

4857
02:10:44.121 --> 02:10:45.290
<v Speaker 7>There are laws for that but,</v>

4858
02:10:45.610 --> 02:10:48.470
<v Speaker 7>but let me make my own choices and my own mistakes,</v>

4859
02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:49.770
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

4860
02:10:49.770 --> 02:10:51.320
<v Speaker 7>And then when I say conservative,</v>

4861
02:10:51.321 --> 02:10:54.200
<v Speaker 7>I mean I think I'm just talking about being fiscally conservative.</v>

4862
02:10:54.201 --> 02:10:56.390
<v Speaker 7>I think I'm talking about not spending what we don't make.</v>

4863
02:10:56.630 --> 02:10:58.070
<v Speaker 7>I lived that way myself.</v>

4864
02:10:58.071 --> 02:10:59.170
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why the government can't.</v>

4865
02:10:59.570 --> 02:10:59.940
<v Speaker 7>It,</v>

4866
02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:00.590
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

4867
02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:01.251
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why.</v>

4868
02:11:01.251 --> 02:11:02.810
<v Speaker 7>I always have to get why.</v>

4869
02:11:02.810 --> 02:11:06.380
<v Speaker 7>The minute I'm at a dinner party in Los Angeles and I started talking about</v>

4870
02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:07.760
<v Speaker 7>small government or,</v>

4871
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.580
<v Speaker 7>or a conservative idea,</v>

4872
02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:15.820
<v Speaker 7>I get labeled immediately as somebody who is against gay marriage against</v>

4873
02:11:15.831 --> 02:11:16.520
<v Speaker 7>abortion.</v>

4874
02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:16.971
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

4875
02:11:16.971 --> 02:11:18.110
<v Speaker 7>well you're racist.</v>

4876
02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:18.381
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4877
02:11:18.381 --> 02:11:19.071
<v Speaker 7>I reject.</v>

4878
02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:22.640
<v Speaker 7>I reject a lot of the republican platform in that sense because it's just as</v>

4879
02:11:22.641 --> 02:11:24.740
<v Speaker 7>controlling as the other side.</v>

4880
02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:26.210
<v Speaker 7>What about a woman's right to choose Brian?</v>

4881
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:27.163
<v Speaker 7>I believe in it.</v>

4882
02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:29.120
<v Speaker 7>What if you called it killing babies?</v>

4883
02:11:29.121 --> 02:11:30.320
<v Speaker 7>This is the killing babycenter.</v>

4884
02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:30.951
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4885
02:11:30.951 --> 02:11:31.401
<v Speaker 7>that's fine,</v>

4886
02:11:31.401 --> 02:11:33.770
<v Speaker 7>but the problem is we put a price on human life all the time.</v>

4887
02:11:33.771 --> 02:11:34.670
<v Speaker 7>If you want to save lives,</v>

4888
02:11:34.671 --> 02:11:36.710
<v Speaker 7>how come you're not out petitioning to make the speed limit on the,</v>

4889
02:11:36.711 --> 02:11:38.240
<v Speaker 7>on the highway 30 miles an hour.</v>

4890
02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:38.660
<v Speaker 7>It'll,</v>

4891
02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:39.740
<v Speaker 7>it'll fucking save lives.</v>

4892
02:11:39.741 --> 02:11:44.210
<v Speaker 7>You know why we don't do that because it would be grossly inconvenient and it</v>

4893
02:11:44.211 --> 02:11:46.550
<v Speaker 7>would stall the economy and our standard of living.</v>

4894
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:47.181
<v Speaker 7>So guess what?</v>

4895
02:11:47.181 --> 02:11:48.890
<v Speaker 7>We do put a price on human life all the time.</v>

4896
02:11:48.891 --> 02:11:51.440
<v Speaker 7>And I happen to believe that if a woman's for harboring a life,</v>

4897
02:11:51.650 --> 02:11:55.130
<v Speaker 7>you can biologically make the case that it is murder because it's a life.</v>

4898
02:11:55.131 --> 02:11:56.810
<v Speaker 7>It just happens to be on life support.</v>

4899
02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:57.651
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4900
02:11:57.651 --> 02:11:58.300
<v Speaker 7>that's fine.</v>

4901
02:11:58.300 --> 02:11:58.400
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4902
02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:58.680
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4903
02:11:58.680 --> 02:11:59.060
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4904
02:11:59.060 --> 02:11:59.720
<v Speaker 7>I still,</v>

4905
02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:02.180
<v Speaker 7>I still think a woman's choice to make,</v>

4906
02:12:02.210 --> 02:12:04.970
<v Speaker 7>to do with her body what she chooses is paramount over that.</v>

4907
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.070
<v Speaker 7>It's not consistent with the Judaeo Christian ethic,</v>

4908
02:12:07.071 --> 02:12:07.820
<v Speaker 7>but that's.</v>

4909
02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:08.720
<v Speaker 7>I don't go to church.</v>

4910
02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:09.261
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4911
02:12:09.261 --> 02:12:09.590
<v Speaker 7>But what,</v>

4912
02:12:09.590 --> 02:12:10.640
<v Speaker 7>do you have those times?</v>

4913
02:12:10.670 --> 02:12:13.700
<v Speaker 7>Do you have a timeline where you think it's a very good question?</v>

4914
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:14.130
<v Speaker 7>I've,</v>

4915
02:12:14.130 --> 02:12:16.610
<v Speaker 7>I've kind of tried to avoid this very,</v>

4916
02:12:16.611 --> 02:12:17.960
<v Speaker 7>very complicated question,</v>

4917
02:12:17.961 --> 02:12:19.040
<v Speaker 7>but we do have timelines.</v>

4918
02:12:19.041 --> 02:12:19.521
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>

4919
02:12:19.521 --> 02:12:20.000
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4920
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:20.661
<v Speaker 7>For the most part,</v>

4921
02:12:20.661 --> 02:12:21.620
<v Speaker 7>after the third trimester,</v>

4922
02:12:21.621 --> 02:12:25.100
<v Speaker 7>it becomes very dangerous for the woman and 48 days in this one,</v>

4923
02:12:25.101 --> 02:12:27.380
<v Speaker 7>the whatever religion thought the,</v>

4924
02:12:27.381 --> 02:12:27.650
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4925
02:12:27.650 --> 02:12:28.940
<v Speaker 7>the soul entered the body.</v>

4926
02:12:29.930 --> 02:12:30.450
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4927
02:12:30.450 --> 02:12:31.070
<v Speaker 7>the Hindus,</v>

4928
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:31.550
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

4929
02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:32.071
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>

4930
02:12:32.071 --> 02:12:32.360
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>

4931
02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:32.781
<v Speaker 7>let's take,</v>

4932
02:12:32.781 --> 02:12:35.060
<v Speaker 7>let's take a couple of ethical arguments about it.</v>

4933
02:12:35.061 --> 02:12:36.410
<v Speaker 7>So let's take up severely,</v>

4934
02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:38.510
<v Speaker 7>severely retarded human being.</v>

4935
02:12:38.511 --> 02:12:39.920
<v Speaker 7>Somebody who can't feed themselves,</v>

4936
02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:41.810
<v Speaker 7>somebody who can't even breathe on their own.</v>

4937
02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:42.740
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4938
02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:45.050
<v Speaker 7>and if you were to kill that person,</v>

4939
02:12:45.051 --> 02:12:45.771
<v Speaker 7>if I were to go into some other,</v>

4940
02:12:45.771 --> 02:12:46.580
<v Speaker 7>that person with a pillow,</v>

4941
02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:50.270
<v Speaker 7>even though they don't have any feeling and parts they can't communicate,</v>

4942
02:12:50.690 --> 02:12:53.180
<v Speaker 7>then then what would happen is I'd go to jail for murder.</v>

4943
02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:58.840
<v Speaker 7>You take a fetus that is not yet even developed with its hands ahead,</v>

4944
02:12:58.850 --> 02:13:00.320
<v Speaker 7>however reacts to pain.</v>

4945
02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:04.430
<v Speaker 7>We know it is on its way to becoming a human being and in a lot of aspects of</v>

4946
02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:05.001
<v Speaker 7>the human being,</v>

4947
02:13:05.001 --> 02:13:07.190
<v Speaker 7>just a severely underdeveloped human being.</v>

4948
02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:07.420
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

4949
02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:09.350
<v Speaker 7>it's a very similar thing to kill that.</v>

4950
02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:12.200
<v Speaker 7>That very small creature that is living,</v>

4951
02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:14.180
<v Speaker 7>that does respond to stimuli does it,</v>

4952
02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:18.020
<v Speaker 7>does respond to pain and continues to do so and more and more of a what we would</v>

4953
02:13:18.021 --> 02:13:20.030
<v Speaker 7>consider independent human fashion.</v>

4954
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:23.080
<v Speaker 7>That is that not why is that not murder?</v>

4955
02:13:23.081 --> 02:13:24.500
<v Speaker 7>That would be where the argument is.</v>

4956
02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:26.900
<v Speaker 7>It's very hard to actually get out of that argument.</v>

4957
02:13:27.170 --> 02:13:27.841
<v Speaker 7>It's very hard.</v>

4958
02:13:27.841 --> 02:13:31.410
<v Speaker 7>It's why I have a lot of respect for the notion that people who say religiously,</v>

4959
02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:32.580
<v Speaker 7>I believe it's murder.</v>

4960
02:13:32.730 --> 02:13:33.511
<v Speaker 7>I have to,</v>

4961
02:13:33.511 --> 02:13:35.100
<v Speaker 7>I have to be pro pro life.</v>

4962
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.480
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4963
02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:40.080
<v Speaker 7>I do respect that because you could make a very strong biological argument that,</v>

4964
02:13:40.081 --> 02:13:43.020
<v Speaker 7>that human being is just as human as you are in a lot of ways.</v>

4965
02:13:43.050 --> 02:13:45.030
<v Speaker 7>You just have to be independent,</v>

4966
02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:46.650
<v Speaker 7>more independent.</v>

4967
02:13:47.070 --> 02:13:47.521
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4968
02:13:47.521 --> 02:13:50.100
<v Speaker 7>you're not relying on a human being to keep you alive.</v>

4969
02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:50.390
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4970
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:55.110
<v Speaker 7>we're never going to figure out how to fix that until we figured out how to fix</v>

4971
02:13:55.111 --> 02:14:00.111
<v Speaker 7>the dirty trick of fucking equals making people that is a dirty God damn trick</v>

4972
02:14:00.571 --> 02:14:01.590
<v Speaker 7>that we need to address.</v>

4973
02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:02.010
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4974
02:14:02.010 --> 02:14:02.843
<v Speaker 7>because it's so.</v>

4975
02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:03.360
<v Speaker 7>I have this</v>

4976
02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:07.200
<v Speaker 8>unbelievable desire to fuck but yet fucking makes people.</v>

4977
02:14:07.201 --> 02:14:08.850
<v Speaker 8>And you can fuck when you're like 13,</v>

4978
02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:12.300
<v Speaker 8>but we don't have to run from Jaguars everyday when we know we're not getting</v>

4979
02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:13.860
<v Speaker 8>chased down by crocodiles.</v>

4980
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:15.540
<v Speaker 8>We don't need this many people.</v>

4981
02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:15.721
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

4982
02:14:15.721 --> 02:14:17.110
<v Speaker 8>not only do you not need this many people,</v>

4983
02:14:17.111 --> 02:14:19.750
<v Speaker 8>as my other argument for being pro choice and is,</v>

4984
02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:21.960
<v Speaker 8>is that you're going to take care of that kid.</v>

4985
02:14:22.050 --> 02:14:24.180
<v Speaker 8>You're going to take care of that child who just got pregnant by,</v>

4986
02:14:24.181 --> 02:14:24.480
<v Speaker 8>by,</v>

4987
02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:25.590
<v Speaker 8>by a woman who has no money.</v>

4988
02:14:25.591 --> 02:14:26.610
<v Speaker 8>Who doesn't want that baby?</v>

4989
02:14:26.670 --> 02:14:27.720
<v Speaker 8>She can't take care of it.</v>

4990
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:30.840
<v Speaker 8>Are you going to or you can have another ward of the state or somebody who</v>

4991
02:14:30.841 --> 02:14:32.940
<v Speaker 8>doesn't get any attention or somebody doesn't have any resources.</v>

4992
02:14:32.970 --> 02:14:34.890
<v Speaker 8>We've got to separate the fact that fucking makes a.</v>

4993
02:14:35.070 --> 02:14:35.881
<v Speaker 8>makes a person.</v>

4994
02:14:35.881 --> 02:14:36.780
<v Speaker 8>You're getting crazy.</v>

4995
02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:38.100
<v Speaker 8>We've got to get to the heart of this.</v>

4996
02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:40.080
<v Speaker 8>We gotta we gotta figure out a way.</v>

4997
02:14:40.190 --> 02:14:43.420
<v Speaker 8>So you make a person through a very complicated process.</v>

4998
02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:44.580
<v Speaker 8>What about birth control?</v>

4999
02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:45.481
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5000
02:14:45.481 --> 02:14:46.680
<v Speaker 8>that could fuck up your body.</v>

5001
02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:47.461
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

5002
02:14:47.461 --> 02:14:48.001
<v Speaker 8>for women,</v>

5003
02:14:48.001 --> 02:14:51.150
<v Speaker 8>they take pills that essentially trick their body and thinking they're pregnant</v>

5004
02:14:51.151 --> 02:14:51.511
<v Speaker 8>all the time.</v>

5005
02:14:51.511 --> 02:14:52.151
<v Speaker 8>That can't be good.</v>

5006
02:14:52.151 --> 02:14:52.800
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5007
02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:54.630
<v Speaker 8>That condoms also real real and everything.</v>

5008
02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:55.381
<v Speaker 8>Gross,</v>

5009
02:14:55.381 --> 02:14:58.050
<v Speaker 8>disgusting things such stupid thing.</v>

5010
02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.960
<v Speaker 8>Tomorrow I'm having that Peter Duesberg guy on the podcast.</v>

5011
02:15:00.961 --> 02:15:03.660
<v Speaker 8>He's the guy that believes that a HIV doesn't cause aids.</v>

5012
02:15:04.770 --> 02:15:06.420
<v Speaker 8>It's all people that are doing drugs.</v>

5013
02:15:06.910 --> 02:15:07.743
<v Speaker 8>He said this,</v>

5014
02:15:07.890 --> 02:15:10.200
<v Speaker 8>it's really almost untenable.</v>

5015
02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:12.500
<v Speaker 8>Science would be like,</v>

5016
02:15:12.501 --> 02:15:12.880
<v Speaker 8>wow.</v>

5017
02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:13.080
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5018
02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:14.850
<v Speaker 8>well that's why I'm interested to see how he,</v>

5019
02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:15.580
<v Speaker 8>how you,</v>

5020
02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:16.413
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5021
02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.330
<v Speaker 8>figures that end to.</v>

5022
02:15:18.331 --> 02:15:21.630
<v Speaker 8>The problem is that they're not doing drugs and there wasting away of HIV.</v>

5023
02:15:21.631 --> 02:15:23.460
<v Speaker 8>So I think the Africa thing though,</v>

5024
02:15:23.461 --> 02:15:25.590
<v Speaker 8>apparently they're not even getting tested for HIV,</v>

5025
02:15:25.610 --> 02:15:26.070
<v Speaker 8>they're there,</v>

5026
02:15:26.070 --> 02:15:30.150
<v Speaker 8>they have aids and that could be a variety of things including poor nutrition.</v>

5027
02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:34.560
<v Speaker 8>I think that's the argument there is that the actual testing and this guy is</v>

5028
02:15:34.590 --> 02:15:36.360
<v Speaker 8>ignoring a lot of the data on that.</v>

5029
02:15:36.370 --> 02:15:37.051
<v Speaker 8>We're gonna find out,</v>

5030
02:15:37.051 --> 02:15:37.620
<v Speaker 8>I don't know,</v>

5031
02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:40.560
<v Speaker 8>like you want to do it with me going to do it when really tomorrow,</v>

<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>

5043
02:15:52.261 --> 02:15:52.771
<v Speaker 8>I mean who knows,</v>

5044
02:15:52.771 --> 02:15:53.604
<v Speaker 8>cause my,</v>

5045
02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:54.493
<v Speaker 8>this is just uh,</v>

5046
02:15:54.570 --> 02:15:54.781
<v Speaker 8>look,</v>

5047
02:15:54.781 --> 02:15:55.091
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

5048
02:15:55.091 --> 02:15:59.100
<v Speaker 8>I read about this guy's position a long time ago and I thought it was</v>

5049
02:15:59.101 --> 02:15:59.551
<v Speaker 8>fascinating.</v>

5050
02:15:59.551 --> 02:16:00.750
<v Speaker 8>I've read a bunch of articles,</v>

5051
02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:04.050
<v Speaker 8>but what bothers me about a guy like this is very simple and I'll bring it up to</v>

5052
02:16:04.060 --> 02:16:04.893
<v Speaker 8>them.</v>

5053
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:06.900
<v Speaker 8>I watched a lot of people die in New York.</v>

5054
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:09.630
<v Speaker 8>I watched them have it with my own eyes without medication.</v>

5055
02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:12.190
<v Speaker 8>This is before they had magic medication.</v>

5056
02:16:12.191 --> 02:16:12.860
<v Speaker 8>This is one where they had,</v>

5057
02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:14.670
<v Speaker 8>they had act and I watched them all dot.</v>

5058
02:16:14.671 --> 02:16:14.881
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5059
02:16:14.881 --> 02:16:18.270
<v Speaker 8>that was one of the main and I watched him die in a very humiliating and a very</v>

5060
02:16:18.271 --> 02:16:19.104
<v Speaker 8>terrible way.</v>

5061
02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:22.500
<v Speaker 8>Do you know that act is a cancer medication that they stopped giving the chemo</v>

5062
02:16:22.501 --> 02:16:24.780
<v Speaker 8>patients because it was killing them quicker than not having.</v>

5063
02:16:24.781 --> 02:16:25.020
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5064
02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:25.651
<v Speaker 8>I don't know,</v>

5065
02:16:25.651 --> 02:16:28.980
<v Speaker 8>but I do know that a lot of these people went the alternative route and</v>

5066
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.561
<v Speaker 8>everything else.</v>

5067
02:16:29.561 --> 02:16:34.090
<v Speaker 8>I know a couple of people that stopped doing it and then along came a guy I</v>

5068
02:16:34.091 --> 02:16:38.200
<v Speaker 8>believe by the name of David Ho who was a scientist who was man of the year Time</v>

5069
02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:40.660
<v Speaker 8>Magazine's man of the year who invented a little something called protease</v>

5070
02:16:40.690 --> 02:16:41.523
<v Speaker 8>inhibitors.</v>

5071
02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:45.910
<v Speaker 8>Protease inhibitors make the cell wall the the I guess the helper t cell,</v>

5072
02:16:45.911 --> 02:16:46.690
<v Speaker 8>very slick.</v>

5073
02:16:46.690 --> 02:16:51.690
<v Speaker 8>They covered coated with a teflon so that the virus cannot latch onto that sail.</v>

5074
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:57.730
<v Speaker 8>It's gooey and so what happens is with protease inhibitors now you have people</v>

5075
02:16:57.731 --> 02:17:00.040
<v Speaker 8>who are HIV positive and used to be a death sentence.</v>

5076
02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:00.933
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

5077
02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:04.840
<v Speaker 8>I can remember it like it was yesterday and I watched it happen and now you get</v>

5078
02:17:04.841 --> 02:17:06.100
<v Speaker 8>people who are HIV positive.</v>

5079
02:17:06.101 --> 02:17:11.101
<v Speaker 8>I know several who treat it like it's diabetes and in fact now when you get HIV,</v>

5080
02:17:11.441 --> 02:17:12.490
<v Speaker 8>a lot of doctors will say,</v>

5081
02:17:12.491 --> 02:17:12.701
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

5082
02:17:12.701 --> 02:17:13.534
<v Speaker 8>good news.</v>

5083
02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:14.980
<v Speaker 8>This could be diabetes,</v>

5084
02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:18.250
<v Speaker 8>will keep you alive for the next 30 years on protease inhibitors.</v>

5085
02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:19.540
<v Speaker 8>That's a miracle.</v>

5086
02:17:20.050 --> 02:17:22.360
<v Speaker 8>These people that got HIV,</v>

5087
02:17:22.390 --> 02:17:25.270
<v Speaker 8>do any of them engage in illicit drug use?</v>

5088
02:17:25.390 --> 02:17:26.223
<v Speaker 8>Some of them do.</v>

5089
02:17:26.350 --> 02:17:26.830
<v Speaker 8>Some of them.</v>

5090
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:27.663
<v Speaker 8>Some of them do.</v>

5091
02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:28.661
<v Speaker 8>I believe.</v>

5092
02:17:28.661 --> 02:17:33.370
<v Speaker 8>What duesberg point is that the only reason why the HIV wasn't fought off by</v>

5093
02:17:33.371 --> 02:17:37.780
<v Speaker 8>their immune system was that their immune system was destroyed by the use of</v>

5094
02:17:37.870 --> 02:17:38.703
<v Speaker 8>drugs,</v>

5095
02:17:38.770 --> 02:17:39.370
<v Speaker 8>meth,</v>

5096
02:17:39.370 --> 02:17:40.240
<v Speaker 8>emile nitrates,</v>

5097
02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:40.910
<v Speaker 8>bunch of different things.</v>

5098
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:44.860
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to ask him about why wanting rica is talks about and the bulk of the</v>

5099
02:17:44.861 --> 02:17:49.510
<v Speaker 8>science is that the reason that it never became a white European disease.</v>

5100
02:17:49.511 --> 02:17:49.811
<v Speaker 8>Why?</v>

5101
02:17:49.811 --> 02:17:51.550
<v Speaker 8>Why didn't white men,</v>

5102
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.050
<v Speaker 8>straight men get it,</v>

5103
02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:54.940
<v Speaker 8>but a lot of them got in Africa.</v>

5104
02:17:54.941 --> 02:17:57.400
<v Speaker 8>Why was it a heterosexual disease in Africa?</v>

5105
02:17:57.401 --> 02:18:01.810
<v Speaker 8>Why was it not a heterosexual disease in the Middle East and in Europe and in</v>

5106
02:18:01.811 --> 02:18:02.261
<v Speaker 8>America?</v>

5107
02:18:02.261 --> 02:18:03.094
<v Speaker 8>Why?</v>

5108
02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:03.760
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5109
02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:07.090
<v Speaker 8>they just isolated a gene that you,</v>

5110
02:18:07.091 --> 02:18:08.650
<v Speaker 8>if you are of northern European,</v>

5111
02:18:08.651 --> 02:18:09.484
<v Speaker 8>Middle Eastern,</v>

5112
02:18:10.630 --> 02:18:12.550
<v Speaker 8>north African heritage,</v>

5113
02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:18.060
<v Speaker 8>you have a gene that saved you from the black plagues of that hit Europe enroll</v>

5114
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.670
<v Speaker 8>to all,</v>

5115
02:18:19.670 --> 02:18:20.680
<v Speaker 8>all the Fertile Crescent.</v>

5116
02:18:21.130 --> 02:18:22.240
<v Speaker 8>You have a gene.</v>

5117
02:18:22.241 --> 02:18:23.500
<v Speaker 8>I can't remember the name of the gene.</v>

5118
02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:28.740
<v Speaker 8>That gene makes you very resistant to the HIV virus to contracting it through</v>

5119
02:18:30.431 --> 02:18:31.510
<v Speaker 8>regular sex.</v>

5120
02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:33.850
<v Speaker 8>The only straight men for the most part,</v>

5121
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:35.560
<v Speaker 8>if you look at the army statistics and stuff,</v>

5122
02:18:35.561 --> 02:18:40.510
<v Speaker 8>who ca who got HIV were guys who were intravenous drug users using infected</v>

5123
02:18:40.511 --> 02:18:43.210
<v Speaker 8>needles and they were putting it into directly into their bloodstream.</v>

5124
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:46.930
<v Speaker 8>The gay men that survived the epidemic.</v>

5125
02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:49.600
<v Speaker 8>We're men who are doing the fucking not getting fucked.</v>

5126
02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:52.860
<v Speaker 8>Those were the men that survived the epidemic because it was a.</v>

5127
02:18:53.590 --> 02:18:54.161
<v Speaker 8>let me tell you,</v>

5128
02:18:54.161 --> 02:18:58.180
<v Speaker 8>it aids in the eighties and the early nineties devastated the gay community,</v>

5129
02:18:58.300 --> 02:18:59.330
<v Speaker 8>devastated it.</v>

5130
02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:00.280
<v Speaker 8>It was a war zone.</v>

5131
02:19:00.281 --> 02:19:02.200
<v Speaker 8>I walked those men walk around.</v>

5132
02:19:02.410 --> 02:19:03.240
<v Speaker 8>I've watched listening.</v>

5133
02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:03.761
<v Speaker 8>What you're saying,</v>

5134
02:19:03.761 --> 02:19:05.680
<v Speaker 8>you're essentially supporting this guy's theory.</v>

5135
02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:05.981
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5136
02:19:05.981 --> 02:19:08.980
<v Speaker 8>I'm not saying that the people that got at world intravenous drug users.</v>

5137
02:19:09.010 --> 02:19:09.340
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5138
02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:10.173
<v Speaker 8>I'm not saying that.</v>

5139
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:13.420
<v Speaker 8>I'm saying that to get to get to get you.</v>

5140
02:19:13.460 --> 02:19:17.650
<v Speaker 8>You ain't mainly intruded with the people that were very.</v>

5141
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:20.830
<v Speaker 8>They're very resilient physically because they had excellent genes that they've</v>

5142
02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:23.470
<v Speaker 8>gotten from surviving from the black plague.</v>

5143
02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:24.100
<v Speaker 8>The black plague.</v>

5144
02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:24.431
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>

5145
02:19:24.431 --> 02:19:26.950
<v Speaker 8>but it would be very strong unless.</v>

5146
02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:27.890
<v Speaker 8>Unless you were getting.</v>

5147
02:19:28.330 --> 02:19:32.070
<v Speaker 8>You were getting injected into your body directly through the semen,</v>

5148
02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:35.400
<v Speaker 8>through your anus or or through.</v>

5149
02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:37.320
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>

5150
02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:41.000
<v Speaker 8>I did because I just think it's funny that I'm saying I sound like a scientist,</v>

5151
02:19:41.001 --> 02:19:42.030
<v Speaker 8>so I'm so,</v>

5152
02:19:42.210 --> 02:19:46.490
<v Speaker 8>so about this guy who was the University of California biologist,</v>

5153
02:19:46.491 --> 02:19:47.490
<v Speaker 8>a tenured professor.</v>

5154
02:19:47.550 --> 02:19:51.070
<v Speaker 8>Why would he he not know this that you're telling what your title.</v>

5155
02:19:51.090 --> 02:19:52.070
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if he knows it,</v>

5156
02:19:52.071 --> 02:19:54.260
<v Speaker 8>but I'm going to bring it up to him and the other thing that I'm going to ask</v>

5157
02:19:54.261 --> 02:19:55.190
<v Speaker 8>Duesberg as this,</v>

5158
02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:55.610
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

5159
02:19:55.610 --> 02:20:00.610
<v Speaker 8>how come the majority of scientists all over the world and all the money that</v>

5160
02:20:00.801 --> 02:20:02.750
<v Speaker 8>goes into these protease inhibitors,</v>

5161
02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:03.981
<v Speaker 8>protease inhibitors,</v>

5162
02:20:03.981 --> 02:20:04.790
<v Speaker 8>work,</v>

5163
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:08.840
<v Speaker 8>they seem to work and why are people staying alive when I remember them dying?</v>

5164
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:09.061
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5165
02:20:09.061 --> 02:20:09.970
<v Speaker 8>what's in that tool?</v>

5166
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:11.630
<v Speaker 8>Let's let him let him answer.</v>

5167
02:20:11.631 --> 02:20:15.950
<v Speaker 8>Those were fucking proposing seems every time I meet with these guys,</v>

5168
02:20:15.951 --> 02:20:18.410
<v Speaker 8>they're the only guy I've every other scientists must be,</v>

5169
02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:19.010
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5170
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:19.550
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

5171
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:23.570
<v Speaker 8>Have you ever looked up like how many scientists don't believe HIV causes AIDS?</v>

5172
02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:24.610
<v Speaker 8>Because.</v>

5173

5178
02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:32.540
<v Speaker 8>I just know that the credible,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Will you go to a aids and how many scientists don't believe HIV causes aids and</v>

5190
02:20:57.831 --> 02:21:00.320
<v Speaker 8>it's Duesberg on aids article in spin.</v>

5191
02:21:00.321 --> 02:21:02.270
<v Speaker 8>That's the first fucking thing that comes up.</v>

<v Speaker 8>My Endo an HIV and aids,</v>

5197
02:21:08.570 --> 02:21:10.460
<v Speaker 8>I have a feeling my room would be a lot fuller.</v>

5198
02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:11.840
<v Speaker 8>Kary Mullis</v>

5199
02:21:13.230 --> 02:21:13.900
<v Speaker 5>hm.</v>

5200
02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:14.733
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

5201
02:21:16.030 --> 02:21:16.863
<v Speaker 5>Hm.</v>

5202
02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:21.290
<v Speaker 8>Either way if you get HIV,</v>

5203
02:21:21.291 --> 02:21:23.090
<v Speaker 8>it's a very serious diagnosis.</v>

5204
02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:23.721
<v Speaker 8>This is what Carrie.</v>

5205
02:21:23.721 --> 02:21:24.560
<v Speaker 8>Carrie Moss is a,</v>

5206
02:21:24.561 --> 02:21:27.240
<v Speaker 8>a Nobel prize winning scientist and uh,</v>

5207
02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:28.130
<v Speaker 8>he's um,</v>

5208
02:21:28.850 --> 02:21:30.620
<v Speaker 8>he's also always an Lsd user.</v>

5209
02:21:30.621 --> 02:21:31.580
<v Speaker 8>He created a,</v>

5210
02:21:31.610 --> 02:21:33.350
<v Speaker 8>the invention of PCR test.</v>

5211
02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:34.453
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

5212
02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:40.250
<v Speaker 8>he won the prize for chemistry and a crazy smart people out there.</v>

5213
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:41.463
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5214
02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:42.470
<v Speaker 8>absolutely.</v>

5215
02:21:42.470 --> 02:21:45.650
<v Speaker 8>But what he says is everyone in the field knows that there's at least some</v>

5216
02:21:45.651 --> 02:21:50.090
<v Speaker 8>dissension over whether there's evidence that HIV is the probable cause of aids.</v>

5217
02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.140
<v Speaker 8>There somewhere in the literature that there scientific evidence presented that</v>

5218
02:21:54.141 --> 02:21:55.700
<v Speaker 8>HIV is the probable cause of aids.</v>

5219
02:21:55.701 --> 02:21:56.750
<v Speaker 8>And if there is,</v>

5220
02:21:56.751 --> 02:21:57.584
<v Speaker 8>where is it?</v>

5221
02:21:58.130 --> 02:22:02.240
<v Speaker 8>Who should be attributed with the scientific evidence supporting that statement.</v>

5222
02:22:02.270 --> 02:22:04.610
<v Speaker 8>HIV is a probable cause of a tasting.</v>

5223
02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:05.420
<v Speaker 8>This guy,</v>

5224
02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:06.770
<v Speaker 8>the fact that he just said that,</v>

5225
02:22:06.771 --> 02:22:07.604
<v Speaker 8>if that's,</v>

5226
02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:08.750
<v Speaker 8>if that's what you did,</v>

5227
02:22:08.770 --> 02:22:08.990
<v Speaker 8>say.</v>

5228

<v Speaker 8>Thank you.</v>

5240
02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:14.270
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

5241
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:15.590
<v Speaker 8>I had to scroll up to the top.</v>

5242
02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:18.590
<v Speaker 8>We're going to shit all over the guy looking at it like I already figured it,</v>

5243
02:22:18.591 --> 02:22:19.424
<v Speaker 8>but meanwhile he's dead.</v>

5244
02:22:19.470 --> 02:22:19.950
<v Speaker 8>He's like,</v>

5245
02:22:19.950 --> 02:22:21.170
<v Speaker 8>he can't even defend himself.</v>

5246
02:22:21.530 --> 02:22:23.600
<v Speaker 8>Does HIV really cause aids if you just.</v>

5247
02:22:23.601 --> 02:22:24.650
<v Speaker 8>Google does HIV.</v>

5248
02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:29.100
<v Speaker 8>Really it and most people think that argument's been put to put to rest in 2012.</v>

5249
02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:29.401
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5250

<v Speaker 8>This is 1994.</v>

5252
02:22:30.991 --> 02:22:34.080
<v Speaker 8>It seems like a lot of people had some questions about it.</v>

5253
02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:35.443
<v Speaker 8>I'll make their names.</v>

5254
02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:39.450
<v Speaker 8>I remember somebody they thought age was in mosquitoes.</v>

5255
02:22:39.451 --> 02:22:42.010
<v Speaker 8>It was about the same time period isn't somebody will make their name by</v>

5256
02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:44.260
<v Speaker 8>basically being controversial.</v>

5257
02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:44.820
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5258

<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>

5259
02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:45.751
<v Speaker 8>I'm curious,</v>

5260
02:22:45.751 --> 02:22:46.071
<v Speaker 8>cynical,</v>

5261
02:22:46.071 --> 02:22:48.390
<v Speaker 8>but I'm curious if there's any,</v>

5262
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:52.470
<v Speaker 8>anything that he's going to say that's gonna Rattle that opinion of yours.</v>

5263
02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:53.090
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

5264
02:22:53.090 --> 02:22:54.390
<v Speaker 8>obviously this guy has,</v>

5265
02:22:55.140 --> 02:22:57.390
<v Speaker 8>he's been pushing this for a long,</v>

5266
02:22:57.391 --> 02:22:58.224
<v Speaker 8>long time.</v>

5267
02:22:59.310 --> 02:23:01.290
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if he's the only one we'll find out from him,</v>

5268
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:05.280
<v Speaker 8>but in 1993 he had an article in Spin magazine.</v>

5269
02:23:05.281 --> 02:23:08.880
<v Speaker 8>That was the first one that I read that addressed the whole age thing and that</v>

5270
02:23:08.881 --> 02:23:10.070
<v Speaker 8>was right after my first aids.</v>

5271
02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:12.840
<v Speaker 8>You get anybody on the entire science on the other side,</v>

5272
02:23:12.841 --> 02:23:13.674
<v Speaker 8>on the phone?</v>

5273
02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:14.490
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5274
02:23:14.490 --> 02:23:15.241
<v Speaker 8>but you know what,</v>

5275
02:23:15.241 --> 02:23:15.511
<v Speaker 8>we'll,</v>

5276
02:23:15.511 --> 02:23:15.811
<v Speaker 8>we'll,</v>

5277
02:23:15.811 --> 02:23:16.644
<v Speaker 8>we'll eventually.</v>

5278
02:23:16.730 --> 02:23:18.690
<v Speaker 8>It was hard getting him in here in the first place.</v>

5279
02:23:18.691 --> 02:23:20.190
<v Speaker 8>I didn't bring him in here for a debate,</v>

5280
02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:20.581
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5281
02:23:20.581 --> 02:23:24.200
<v Speaker 8>so we kind of to the tricky thing when people said,</v>

5282
02:23:24.201 --> 02:23:27.090
<v Speaker 8>why don't you go after people when they were to show you something stupid first</v>

5283
02:23:27.091 --> 02:23:27.211
<v Speaker 8>of all,</v>

5284
02:23:27.211 --> 02:23:28.290
<v Speaker 8>because I don't want to be mean.</v>

5285
02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:29.041
<v Speaker 8>And second of all,</v>

5286
02:23:29.041 --> 02:23:32.550
<v Speaker 8>I want them to express themselves to the fullest extent of their possibilities.</v>

5287
02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:33.211
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>

5288
02:23:33.211 --> 02:23:34.480
<v Speaker 8>I don't want to suppress.</v>

5289
02:23:34.770 --> 02:23:35.180
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>

5290
02:23:35.180 --> 02:23:35.730
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5291
02:23:35.730 --> 02:23:39.870
<v Speaker 8>I may disagree with someone on some things and we may disagree and argue about</v>

5292
02:23:39.871 --> 02:23:41.130
<v Speaker 8>stuff on the podcast,</v>

5293
02:23:41.131 --> 02:23:45.030
<v Speaker 8>but in order to find out what someone really believes about something,</v>

5294
02:23:45.031 --> 02:23:48.990
<v Speaker 8>sometimes you have to not question it so much as just sort of probe and,</v>

5295
02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:51.000
<v Speaker 8>and let them keep going and people are like,</v>

5296
02:23:51.001 --> 02:23:51.990
<v Speaker 8>why don't you call them out on that?</v>

5297
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.350
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

5298
02:23:52.350 --> 02:23:52.801
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5299
02:23:52.801 --> 02:23:53.281
<v Speaker 8>that's bullshit.</v>

5300
02:23:53.281 --> 02:23:55.410
<v Speaker 8>And like I want to hear what their logic is.</v>

5301
02:23:55.411 --> 02:23:59.310
<v Speaker 8>I want to hear what their thought process when I have such strong political.</v>

5302
02:23:59.311 --> 02:23:59.820
<v Speaker 8>Like I'll get,</v>

5303
02:23:59.820 --> 02:24:02.520
<v Speaker 8>I'll get heated if you start talking about how,</v>

5304
02:24:02.550 --> 02:24:02.730
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5305
02:24:02.730 --> 02:24:05.970
<v Speaker 8>you can start giving me left wing solutions to like economic solutions to</v>

5306
02:24:05.971 --> 02:24:06.240
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>

5307
02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:07.620
<v Speaker 8>I get overheated and bunched up,</v>

5308
02:24:07.621 --> 02:24:09.650
<v Speaker 8>but if we had socialism but,</v>

5309
02:24:09.651 --> 02:24:11.310
<v Speaker 8>but at the same time it just helped everybody.</v>

5310
02:24:11.890 --> 02:24:13.800
<v Speaker 8>I went hunting and going hunting.</v>

5311
02:24:13.801 --> 02:24:17.490
<v Speaker 8>I had no idea that hunting with have a political effect on me politically.</v>

5312
02:24:17.491 --> 02:24:18.360
<v Speaker 8>Like it was very interesting.</v>

5313
02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:19.880
<v Speaker 8>What were you go if you,</v>

5314
02:24:19.881 --> 02:24:20.310
<v Speaker 8>if you.</v>

5315
02:24:20.310 --> 02:24:21.810
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes I have to check myself and go,</v>

5316
02:24:21.811 --> 02:24:26.811
<v Speaker 8>how much of this is attitude and how I've been raised to actually really</v>

5317
02:24:27.690 --> 02:24:29.310
<v Speaker 8>stopping and looking at fat.</v>

5318
02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:31.770
<v Speaker 8>You have to always check yourself because you know,</v>

5319
02:24:31.771 --> 02:24:32.730
<v Speaker 8>if you're a change,</v>

5320
02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:34.320
<v Speaker 8>what's the hunting thing that changed?</v>

5321
02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:35.071
<v Speaker 8>Like I just,</v>

5322
02:24:35.071 --> 02:24:35.940
<v Speaker 8>I just have,</v>

5323
02:24:35.941 --> 02:24:36.660
<v Speaker 8>I have,</v>

5324
02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:38.490
<v Speaker 8>I have a new found respect for,</v>

5325
02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:43.520
<v Speaker 8>for that aspect of regulation and strong laws that make it very clear that you</v>

5326
02:24:44.131 --> 02:24:45.690
<v Speaker 8>can't and not you.</v>

5327
02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:50.010
<v Speaker 8>You can't trust hunters to be libertarian about their hunting practices</v>

5328
02:24:50.011 --> 02:24:53.610
<v Speaker 8>necessarily because you get a lot of people out there in this world that a lot</v>

5329
02:24:53.611 --> 02:24:54.870
<v Speaker 8>of hunters are vastly.</v>

5330
02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:55.530
<v Speaker 8>Vast.</v>

5331
02:24:55.530 --> 02:24:57.480
<v Speaker 8>Majority of real hunters are very responsible,</v>

5332
02:24:57.481 --> 02:25:00.400
<v Speaker 8>but you get a lot of jerk offs who go out there and just want a machine gun.</v>

5333
02:25:00.401 --> 02:25:02.190
<v Speaker 8>And I think that the hunters,</v>

5334
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.730
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

5335
02:25:02.730 --> 02:25:06.660
<v Speaker 8>I think the anti hunting people ultimately the sentiment,</v>

5336
02:25:06.661 --> 02:25:09.180
<v Speaker 8>the idea behind what they're saying,</v>

5337
02:25:09.450 --> 02:25:11.640
<v Speaker 8>what offends them about hunting is noble.</v>

5338
02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:15.300
<v Speaker 8>Cause I think what they're trying to do is protect animals from ruthless people.</v>

5339
02:25:15.301 --> 02:25:19.830
<v Speaker 8>And I think that there are of the mind that we can get along in harmony with</v>

5340
02:25:19.831 --> 02:25:20.610
<v Speaker 8>nature.</v>

5341
02:25:20.610 --> 02:25:23.010
<v Speaker 8>And that they know that in their own personal experiences,</v>

5342
02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:25.780
<v Speaker 8>they've had beautiful moments that they've seen wildlife and they didn't have to</v>

5343
02:25:25.781 --> 02:25:26.614
<v Speaker 8>kill it.</v>

5344
02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:28.830
<v Speaker 8>So I think ultimately know,</v>

5345
02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:33.690
<v Speaker 8>like when you trap an animal and you're making a fur coat and that animal</v>

5346
02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:34.390
<v Speaker 8>writhing in a,</v>

5347
02:25:34.390 --> 02:25:35.223
<v Speaker 8>in a trap,</v>

5348
02:25:35.290 --> 02:25:36.580
<v Speaker 8>I wouldn't want to fucking see that.</v>

5349
02:25:36.581 --> 02:25:38.500
<v Speaker 8>I went to Portugal and walks to both fight.</v>

5350
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:39.430
<v Speaker 8>I was,</v>

5351
02:25:39.430 --> 02:25:42.160
<v Speaker 8>I've never rooted for a fucking human being to die so,</v>

5352
02:25:42.350 --> 02:25:43.181
<v Speaker 8>so hard in my life.</v>

5353
02:25:43.181 --> 02:25:43.601
<v Speaker 8>They were like,</v>

5354
02:25:43.601 --> 02:25:44.650
<v Speaker 8>spearing this bull.</v>

5355
02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:45.730
<v Speaker 8>He was in pain.</v>

5356
02:25:45.731 --> 02:25:48.640
<v Speaker 8>They rub its eyes with a hot peppers so it can't see.</v>

5357
02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.650
<v Speaker 8>And every time they had to pick a piccadilly would stick those fucking spirits</v>

5358
02:25:51.651 --> 02:25:52.330
<v Speaker 8>and it's back.</v>

5359
02:25:52.330 --> 02:25:54.430
<v Speaker 8>The thing would jump and ride and pain.</v>

5360
02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:55.473
<v Speaker 8>And I was like,</v>

5361
02:25:55.630 --> 02:25:56.291
<v Speaker 8>can some.</v>

5362
02:25:56.291 --> 02:25:58.480
<v Speaker 8>I hope one of these humans fucking dies.</v>

5363
02:25:58.481 --> 02:25:59.920
<v Speaker 8>And this ring that I had done,</v>

5364
02:25:59.921 --> 02:26:01.320
<v Speaker 8>I watched these guys fucking like,</v>

5365
02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:02.490
<v Speaker 8>let themselves get Gordon.</v>

5366
02:26:02.490 --> 02:26:06.740
<v Speaker 8>There were the toughest motherfuckers on the planet that's not gone to the bull.</v>

5367
02:26:06.741 --> 02:26:08.440
<v Speaker 8>Didn't have a sharp horns.</v>

5368
02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:11.170
<v Speaker 8>And they'd let these bullets just fucking hit them and throw them over their</v>

5369
02:26:11.171 --> 02:26:11.561
<v Speaker 8>backs.</v>

5370
02:26:11.561 --> 02:26:12.550
<v Speaker 8>And they do flips in there.</v>

5371
02:26:12.551 --> 02:26:13.660
<v Speaker 8>There were a total bad asses,</v>

5372
02:26:13.661 --> 02:26:14.430
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>

5373
02:26:14.430 --> 02:26:15.041
<v Speaker 8>but either way,</v>

5374
02:26:15.041 --> 02:26:18.970
<v Speaker 8>I just didn't want to see an animal suffering aspect of human nature.</v>

5375
02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:23.230
<v Speaker 8>I didn't want to see a fucking a fucking a defenseless animal rive in pain.</v>

5376
02:26:23.231 --> 02:26:24.160
<v Speaker 8>I didn't like that shit.</v>

5377
02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:24.521
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5378
02:26:24.521 --> 02:26:25.290
<v Speaker 8>it's disgusting.</v>

5379
02:26:25.290 --> 02:26:26.630
<v Speaker 8>But you know,</v>

5380
02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:27.880
<v Speaker 8>so we have to then.</v>

5381
02:26:27.881 --> 02:26:29.290
<v Speaker 8>Then the argument is like,</v>

5382
02:26:29.291 --> 02:26:29.561
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

5383
02:26:29.561 --> 02:26:32.920
<v Speaker 8>well then you gotta look at the vegetarian or Vegan argument,</v>

5384
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.431
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5385
02:26:33.431 --> 02:26:34.011
<v Speaker 8>will there,</v>

5386
02:26:34.011 --> 02:26:38.670
<v Speaker 8>they're trying to be as free of this negative Karma of murdering.</v>

5387
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:41.560
<v Speaker 8>Shouldn't say murder because he gets murdered was only prism as a form of</v>

5388
02:26:41.561 --> 02:26:42.520
<v Speaker 8>religion in some ways.</v>

5389
02:26:42.521 --> 02:26:42.701
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

5390
02:26:42.701 --> 02:26:43.960
<v Speaker 8>I mean it seems to be sort of.</v>

5391
02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:45.280
<v Speaker 8>I mean it's a philosophy,</v>

5392
02:26:45.610 --> 02:26:47.080
<v Speaker 8>but the,</v>

5393
02:26:47.290 --> 02:26:49.180
<v Speaker 8>my point is like how does,</v>

5394
02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:50.920
<v Speaker 8>how does one manage the animals done?</v>

5395
02:26:51.730 --> 02:26:54.740
<v Speaker 8>If we get to that point where no one's eating any animals,</v>

5396
02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:56.170
<v Speaker 8>what are you going to do?</v>

5397
02:26:56.170 --> 02:26:57.070
<v Speaker 8>You're going to castrate them.</v>

5398
02:26:57.100 --> 02:26:58.660
<v Speaker 8>What are you going to do about the deer and the wild,</v>

5399
02:26:58.690 --> 02:26:59.410
<v Speaker 8>what are you going to do?</v>

5400
02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:03.370
<v Speaker 8>We're going to have a real issue and that's something that no one needs to mean.</v>

5401
02:27:03.550 --> 02:27:06.460
<v Speaker 8>We have to grow as much animal protein first of all,</v>

5402
02:27:06.461 --> 02:27:06.731
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

5403
02:27:06.731 --> 02:27:06.910
<v Speaker 8>You,</v>

5404
02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:07.481
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't matter.</v>

5405
02:27:07.481 --> 02:27:09.330
<v Speaker 8>What are you going to do with the feed?</v>

5406
02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:11.020
<v Speaker 8>I don't think you'd be able to feed as many people.</v>

5407
02:27:11.021 --> 02:27:14.260
<v Speaker 8>So would you just let the cows starve to death and cows go extinct?</v>

5408
02:27:14.261 --> 02:27:17.740
<v Speaker 8>Or would you manage a population of them that you never bred?</v>

5409
02:27:17.741 --> 02:27:20.830
<v Speaker 8>Are you suppose you'd stopped breathing when she let them go wild.</v>

5410
02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:21.431
<v Speaker 8>And if you did,</v>

5411
02:27:21.431 --> 02:27:22.810
<v Speaker 8>they wouldn't have any natural predators.</v>

5412
02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:24.530
<v Speaker 8>They did the big question that like,</v>

5413
02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:25.930
<v Speaker 8>like fucking awesome.</v>

5414
02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:26.793
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

5415
02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:27.850
<v Speaker 8>Ray Kurzweil says,</v>

5416
02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:28.570
<v Speaker 8>listen,</v>

5417
02:27:28.570 --> 02:27:29.381
<v Speaker 8>we're very,</v>

5418
02:27:29.381 --> 02:27:30.730
<v Speaker 8>very soon you're going to be,</v>

5419
02:27:30.731 --> 02:27:34.030
<v Speaker 8>we're going to be cloning a meat that has no animal suffering.</v>

5420
02:27:34.330 --> 02:27:35.260
<v Speaker 8>We're going to be cloning,</v>

5421
02:27:35.261 --> 02:27:36.580
<v Speaker 8>meet with no central nervous system.</v>

5422
02:27:36.581 --> 02:27:37.570
<v Speaker 8>Kind of taste like shit.</v>

5423
02:27:37.630 --> 02:27:37.871
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5424
02:27:37.871 --> 02:27:38.201
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

5425
02:27:38.201 --> 02:27:41.680
<v Speaker 8>because we can clone the best tasting meat in the world if you've got in a</v>

5426
02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:42.341
<v Speaker 8>factory.</v>

5427
02:27:42.341 --> 02:27:46.210
<v Speaker 8>So I'm just saying the future is going to be a far a meat farm.</v>

5428
02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:50.230
<v Speaker 8>You ever see like salmon that you buy that hasn't been dyed pink.</v>

5429
02:27:50.450 --> 02:27:50.860
<v Speaker 8>Really?</v>

5430
02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:51.770
<v Speaker 8>See what those.</v>

5431
02:27:51.771 --> 02:27:52.050
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

5432
02:27:52.050 --> 02:27:54.070
<v Speaker 8>Weak ass prison bitch salmon.</v>

5433
02:27:54.100 --> 02:27:54.401
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5434
02:27:54.401 --> 02:27:56.500
<v Speaker 8>But what what I'm saying is that at the end of the day,</v>

5435
02:27:56.501 --> 02:27:59.170
<v Speaker 8>I think technology is going to give you the greatest tasting,</v>

5436
02:27:59.171 --> 02:28:02.680
<v Speaker 8>everything without animal suffering and meat's going to be just like anything</v>

5437
02:28:02.681 --> 02:28:03.010
<v Speaker 8>else.</v>

5438
02:28:03.010 --> 02:28:06.220
<v Speaker 8>It's going to be you're gonna buy a meat ball that was grown in some fucking</v>

5439
02:28:06.221 --> 02:28:07.054
<v Speaker 8>farm.</v>

5440
02:28:07.430 --> 02:28:11.260
<v Speaker 8>Wonder if it's possible to get the subtle nuances of legere good grass fed</v>

5441
02:28:11.261 --> 02:28:12.010
<v Speaker 8>steak.</v>

5442
02:28:12.010 --> 02:28:12.341
<v Speaker 8>I one,</v>

5443
02:28:12.341 --> 02:28:15.940
<v Speaker 8>if you can get that or for wonder if it's going to be like sorta like grape gum</v>

5444
02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:17.860
<v Speaker 8>where it's not really grape gum,</v>

5445
02:28:17.861 --> 02:28:19.850
<v Speaker 8>but you call it grape gum flavors.</v>

5446
02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:20.250
<v Speaker 8>Grape.</v>

5447
02:28:20.250 --> 02:28:20.451
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

5448
02:28:20.451 --> 02:28:21.090
<v Speaker 8>I love group.</v>

5449
02:28:21.090 --> 02:28:21.923
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't say anything.</v>

5450
02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:24.230
<v Speaker 8>That's why I like game meat so much.</v>

5451
02:28:24.231 --> 02:28:26.690
<v Speaker 8>You can't compete with that fucking game.</v>

5452
02:28:26.830 --> 02:28:27.610
<v Speaker 8>Not Game Me.</v>

5453
02:28:27.610 --> 02:28:28.980
<v Speaker 8>Brian Endgame.</v>

5454
02:28:29.610 --> 02:28:30.620
<v Speaker 8>I'm like grape soda?</v>

5455
02:28:30.621 --> 02:28:31.251
<v Speaker 8>There's grape soda.</v>

5456
02:28:31.251 --> 02:28:32.540
<v Speaker 8>Taste anything like a grape?</v>

5457
02:28:32.660 --> 02:28:32.990
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5458
02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.640
<v Speaker 8>not at all.</v>

5459
02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:34.520
<v Speaker 8>It's like the color,</v>

5460
02:28:34.750 --> 02:28:36.290
<v Speaker 8>maybe Welch's grape juice.</v>

5461
02:28:36.291 --> 02:28:36.720
<v Speaker 8>It's about us.</v>

5462
02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:37.940
<v Speaker 8>That's real grape juice.</v>

5463
02:28:38.670 --> 02:28:40.820
<v Speaker 8>They're like sweet.</v>

5464
02:28:40.821 --> 02:28:41.570
<v Speaker 8>But yeah,</v>

5465
02:28:41.570 --> 02:28:42.740
<v Speaker 8>but like think about like,</v>

5466
02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:44.480
<v Speaker 8>what's the difference between like grape Hubba,</v>

5467
02:28:44.481 --> 02:28:46.640
<v Speaker 8>bubba bubble gum and like an actual great.</v>

5468
02:28:46.641 --> 02:28:48.200
<v Speaker 8>But how do you even know that that's a great.</v>

5469
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:48.981
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

5470
02:28:48.981 --> 02:28:52.580
<v Speaker 8>it's a great because you've accepted this as the substitute grape flavor,</v>

5471
02:28:52.581 --> 02:28:54.950
<v Speaker 8>even though it's not nothing great blank about it.</v>

5472
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.790
<v Speaker 8>You call it.</v>

5473
02:28:55.790 --> 02:28:56.930
<v Speaker 3>That's great flavor.</v>

5474
02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:57.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5475
02:28:57.610 --> 02:28:58.940
<v Speaker 3>that's what stakes going to be like.</v>

5476
02:28:58.941 --> 02:29:00.020
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get used to that.</v>

5477
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:02.570
<v Speaker 3>We're going to use this artificial non,</v>

5478
02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:03.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5479
02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:07.220
<v Speaker 3>non biological or they'll be able to figure out a way to put all those nuances</v>

5480
02:29:07.221 --> 02:29:09.810
<v Speaker 3>and when they do the first people that either they're going to get cancer the</v>

5481
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:11.090
<v Speaker 3>like immediately</v>

5482
02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:13.610
<v Speaker 3>I wonder.</v>

5483
02:29:13.610 --> 02:29:16.730
<v Speaker 3>It seems like how long can you keep tricking the system?</v>

5484
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.911
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5485
02:29:16.911 --> 02:29:20.150
<v Speaker 3>the only way we're going to feed as many people as we do with as we,</v>

5486
02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:20.990
<v Speaker 3>as we get into nine,</v>

5487
02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:25.370
<v Speaker 3>10 billion people in the century is with genetically modified foods.</v>

5488
02:29:25.371 --> 02:29:27.070
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing any other 10 billion.</v>

5489
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:29.330
<v Speaker 3>You have to figure out a way to make rice more nutritious.</v>

5490
02:29:29.331 --> 02:29:30.420
<v Speaker 3>That's what golden rice product,</v>

5491
02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:32.090
<v Speaker 3>that golden rice project is all about.</v>

5492
02:29:32.330 --> 02:29:34.500
<v Speaker 3>I guess getting more vitamin a into rice and,</v>

5493
02:29:34.810 --> 02:29:35.110
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

5494
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:38.690
<v Speaker 3>and making it way more nutritious to make sure that more people breed.</v>

5495
02:29:38.691 --> 02:29:39.920
<v Speaker 3>So we have even more people.</v>

5496
02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5497
02:29:40.890 --> 02:29:41.840
<v Speaker 3>that's very important,</v>

5498
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:46.990
<v Speaker 3>isn't the most important thing to figure out how to make these places less poor,</v>

5499
02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:48.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5500
02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:52.100
<v Speaker 3>like when you look at all the poverty in the world and all of these people that</v>

5501
02:29:52.101 --> 02:29:57.101
<v Speaker 3>are in these incredibly over populated areas like how does one ever managed the</v>

5502
02:29:57.741 --> 02:29:59.840
<v Speaker 3>human animal,</v>

5503
02:29:59.841 --> 02:30:01.760
<v Speaker 3>the human race from the ground up,</v>

5504
02:30:01.970 --> 02:30:06.680
<v Speaker 8>the lowest form growing far more food per hectare than we ever have,</v>

5505
02:30:06.681 --> 02:30:06.891
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

5506
02:30:06.891 --> 02:30:09.470
<v Speaker 8>With technology and making it more nutrient dense.</v>

5507
02:30:09.650 --> 02:30:14.090
<v Speaker 8>So the idea is like if you create staples of crops like rice,</v>

5508
02:30:14.091 --> 02:30:14.690
<v Speaker 8>that is,</v>

5509
02:30:14.690 --> 02:30:16.760
<v Speaker 8>that is as nutritious as a root vegetable,</v>

5510
02:30:16.761 --> 02:30:17.660
<v Speaker 8>like a sweet potato.</v>

5511
02:30:17.810 --> 02:30:18.290
<v Speaker 8>So your,</v>

5512
02:30:18.290 --> 02:30:20.900
<v Speaker 8>your thing is to take these people that live in these poor places and make them</v>

5513
02:30:20.901 --> 02:30:21.734
<v Speaker 8>farmers.</v>

5514
02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:22.360
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5515
02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:25.550
<v Speaker 8>actually you'll need less farmers and you'll need less pesticides because what</v>

5516
02:30:25.551 --> 02:30:28.310
<v Speaker 8>you'll do is you're genetically modified these foods too and they're already</v>

5517
02:30:28.311 --> 02:30:30.930
<v Speaker 8>doing this to resist a,</v>

5518
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:34.910
<v Speaker 8>the need for artificial pesticides because they have built in resistance to the</v>

5519
02:30:34.911 --> 02:30:36.710
<v Speaker 8>pests that are indigenous to that area.</v>

5520
02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:37.671
<v Speaker 8>And that's what.</v>

5521
02:30:37.671 --> 02:30:39.020
<v Speaker 8>That's what this is all about.</v>

5522
02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:42.170
<v Speaker 8>Genetically modified foods gets such a bad rap,</v>

5523
02:30:42.171 --> 02:30:43.220
<v Speaker 8>but that's the future.</v>

5524
02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:45.470
<v Speaker 8>We're not gonna feed people without it really.</v>

5525
02:30:45.490 --> 02:30:47.370
<v Speaker 8>Do you think that the thing with a,</v>

5526
02:30:47.960 --> 02:30:52.190
<v Speaker 8>with taking these genetically modified foods and copywriting them and making</v>

5527
02:30:52.191 --> 02:30:54.920
<v Speaker 8>sure that people have that,</v>

5528
02:30:55.010 --> 02:30:55.820
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5529
02:30:55.820 --> 02:30:59.630
<v Speaker 8>making sure the seeds can't grow suicide's not the answer to that.</v>

5530
02:30:59.690 --> 02:31:01.580
<v Speaker 8>When it starts becoming a commodity,</v>

5531
02:31:01.581 --> 02:31:02.650
<v Speaker 8>it gets a little weird.</v>

5532
02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:03.870
<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>

5533
02:31:03.870 --> 02:31:04.281
<v Speaker 8>It has been.</v>

5534
02:31:04.281 --> 02:31:05.750
<v Speaker 8>I think it's just becoming more complicated.</v>

5535
02:31:05.751 --> 02:31:06.650
<v Speaker 8>Trademark life.</v>

5536
02:31:06.670 --> 02:31:09.200
<v Speaker 8>It's a really interesting question though because like you're right if you,</v>

5537
02:31:09.210 --> 02:31:09.561
<v Speaker 8>if you.</v>

5538
02:31:09.561 --> 02:31:11.990
<v Speaker 8>But if you spend a lot of time in a laboratory and you create a,</v>

5539
02:31:12.310 --> 02:31:16.250
<v Speaker 8>the most nutritious rice kernel in the world that people can live on just rice.</v>

5540
02:31:16.670 --> 02:31:19.590
<v Speaker 8>Well then if that was all your hard work,</v>

5541
02:31:19.770 --> 02:31:21.630
<v Speaker 8>I guess you should own the rights to the seed.</v>

5542
02:31:21.631 --> 02:31:22.170
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

5543
02:31:22.170 --> 02:31:24.600
<v Speaker 8>Well maybe you should just get a cut forever.</v>

5544
02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:24.790
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5545
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:27.900
<v Speaker 8>because because otherwise people wouldn't be the incentive to develop that is</v>

5546
02:31:27.901 --> 02:31:29.190
<v Speaker 8>not only just a humanitarian one,</v>

5547
02:31:29.191 --> 02:31:30.510
<v Speaker 8>but it's also a profit motive.</v>

5548
02:31:30.520 --> 02:31:31.950
<v Speaker 8>Senator Incentive.</v>

5549
02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:34.650
<v Speaker 8>That's why you've put billions of dollars into research to recoup it.</v>

5550
02:31:34.850 --> 02:31:36.870
<v Speaker 8>Cross pollination and shit like that,</v>

5551
02:31:36.871 --> 02:31:41.430
<v Speaker 8>like the issues that they deal with with farmers living in nearby communities</v>

5552
02:31:41.431 --> 02:31:42.980
<v Speaker 8>that don't have to.</v>

5553
02:31:43.250 --> 02:31:44.083
<v Speaker 8>I them.</v>

5554
02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:46.110
<v Speaker 8>I'd say it's an issue becoming.</v>

5555
02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:49.050
<v Speaker 8>I don't know how you fight the inevitable rise of technology though.</v>

5556
02:31:49.051 --> 02:31:50.310
<v Speaker 8>You and I talk about it all the time.</v>

5557
02:31:50.610 --> 02:31:51.000
<v Speaker 8>You can.</v>

5558
02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:51.151
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

5559
02:31:51.151 --> 02:31:53.640
<v Speaker 8>I just don't think that we're going to,</v>

5560
02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:54.721
<v Speaker 8>like I said,</v>

5561
02:31:54.721 --> 02:31:57.840
<v Speaker 8>I think that the crops have continued.</v>

5562
02:31:57.870 --> 02:32:01.350
<v Speaker 8>Farmers from the beginning of time have done everything they can to make their</v>

5563
02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:03.710
<v Speaker 8>particular crop more nutritious,</v>

5564
02:32:03.740 --> 02:32:04.740
<v Speaker 8>more calorie rich,</v>

5565
02:32:04.741 --> 02:32:05.371
<v Speaker 8>more dense,</v>

5566
02:32:05.371 --> 02:32:09.600
<v Speaker 8>more energy efficient and also lasts longer last longer and need less water.</v>

5567
02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:11.820
<v Speaker 8>Need less taste the sides all that.</v>

5568
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:12.180
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5569
02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:12.451
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

5570
02:32:12.451 --> 02:32:13.290
<v Speaker 8>I mean whatever we can,</v>

5571
02:32:13.291 --> 02:32:13.681
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

5572
02:32:13.681 --> 02:32:14.191
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't matter.</v>

5573
02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:18.460
<v Speaker 8>They just trying to engineer and durability and who knows like as far as like</v>

5574
02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:22.000
<v Speaker 8>the vitamin content of one of those payless tomatoes at the marketplace.</v>

5575
02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:22.630
<v Speaker 8>So like you,</v>

5576
02:32:22.630 --> 02:32:22.931
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5577
02:32:22.931 --> 02:32:25.830
<v Speaker 8>the are people in the marketplace that want a tomato that's going to taste good</v>

5578
02:32:25.831 --> 02:32:26.190
<v Speaker 8>as well.</v>

5579
02:32:26.190 --> 02:32:28.410
<v Speaker 8>So there's an incentive to create a good tasting tomato.</v>

5580
02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:29.273
<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>

5581
02:32:29.610 --> 02:32:31.050
<v Speaker 8>Have you ever really had a real tomato though?</v>

5582
02:32:31.051 --> 02:32:31.591
<v Speaker 8>Like a jersey.</v>

5583
02:32:31.591 --> 02:32:32.850
<v Speaker 8>They so good.</v>

5584
02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:34.500
<v Speaker 8>That's why it's a fruit.</v>

5585
02:32:34.610 --> 02:32:38.040
<v Speaker 8>Like when you went to La and you see the fruits that are grown in manure than</v>

5586
02:32:38.041 --> 02:32:38.640
<v Speaker 8>tomatoes.</v>

5587
02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:39.600
<v Speaker 8>Forget it.</v>

5588
02:32:39.900 --> 02:32:42.860
<v Speaker 8>That's why I eat organically because I'm such a great.</v>

5589
02:32:43.410 --> 02:32:44.250
<v Speaker 8>Even organically.</v>

5590
02:32:44.251 --> 02:32:45.630
<v Speaker 8>I mean the only thing that comes closest,</v>

5591
02:32:45.650 --> 02:32:46.680
<v Speaker 8>like heirloom tomatoes,</v>

5592

<v Speaker 8>you know what they say the best lamb is,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Most people,</v>

5691
02:35:05.381 --> 02:35:06.450
<v Speaker 8>men suppression,</v>

5692
02:35:06.490 --> 02:35:09.310
<v Speaker 8>daily suppression all day having to fit a mold,</v>

5693
02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:13.890
<v Speaker 8>work in some fucking stupid office somewhere that's got to be life sapping.</v>

5694
02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:15.460
<v Speaker 8>I would agree.</v>

5695
02:35:15.790 --> 02:35:19.690
<v Speaker 8>The idea that one of the problems with government is that there's no passion in</v>

5696
02:35:19.790 --> 02:35:20.950
<v Speaker 8>most levels of government.</v>

5697
02:35:21.130 --> 02:35:22.180
<v Speaker 8>They're just jobs,</v>

5698
02:35:22.330 --> 02:35:22.780
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5699
02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:25.480
<v Speaker 8>and the real problem with jobs as people want to get them and they want that</v>

5700
02:35:25.481 --> 02:35:27.100
<v Speaker 8>money and they want to keep them and they never say,</v>

5701
02:35:27.101 --> 02:35:27.491
<v Speaker 8>you know what?</v>

5702
02:35:27.491 --> 02:35:31.120
<v Speaker 8>This job is just not really necessary and that the way to best serve the</v>

5703
02:35:31.121 --> 02:35:34.390
<v Speaker 8>American people would be to fucking get rid of this job,</v>

5704
02:35:34.391 --> 02:35:35.320
<v Speaker 8>but this is what I need.</v>

5705
02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:40.800
<v Speaker 8>It becomes a personal issue that sort of gets in the way of the greater good of</v>

5706
02:35:40.841 --> 02:35:41.621
<v Speaker 8>what you're trying to achieve.</v>

5707
02:35:41.621 --> 02:35:43.130
<v Speaker 8>You're not getting rid of a foot when you.</v>

5708
02:35:43.150 --> 02:35:44.830
<v Speaker 8>That's the problem with passing a law.</v>

5709
02:35:45.130 --> 02:35:47.110
<v Speaker 8>You're going to get a lot of vested interests around that law.</v>

5710
02:35:47.111 --> 02:35:49.690
<v Speaker 8>You're not getting rid of that law because then people lose their jobs.</v>

5711
02:35:49.691 --> 02:35:50.320
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

5712
02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:51.640
<v Speaker 8>so that's the other thing.</v>

5713
02:35:51.641 --> 02:35:52.710
<v Speaker 8>Remember when you pass a law,</v>

5714
02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:54.280
<v Speaker 8>cottage industry grows up around it.</v>

5715
02:35:54.281 --> 02:35:55.010
<v Speaker 8>That's why.</v>

5716
02:35:55.010 --> 02:35:56.870
<v Speaker 8>That's why Washington never gets rid of.</v>

5717
02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:57.820
<v Speaker 8>Once they pass a law,</v>

5718
02:35:57.821 --> 02:35:58.580
<v Speaker 8>like the,</v>

5719
02:35:58.580 --> 02:36:02.910
<v Speaker 8>the anti marijuana laws you get,</v>

5720
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:06.220
<v Speaker 8>you make illegal and you're going to have a lot of people out of a job.</v>

5721
02:36:06.221 --> 02:36:07.950
<v Speaker 8>So yeah,</v>

5722
02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:12.960
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of money behind trying to marijuana illegal and there was</v>

5723
02:36:14.110 --> 02:36:15.350
<v Speaker 8>something that I retweeted,</v>

5724
02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:20.720
<v Speaker 8>I think yesterday that was listing all the different people that are involved in</v>

5725
02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:24.940
<v Speaker 8>working hard to keep marijuana illegal.</v>

5726
02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:26.470
<v Speaker 8>It's so annoying.</v>

5727
02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:27.701
<v Speaker 8>Read that Shit.</v>

5728
02:36:27.701 --> 02:36:29.320
<v Speaker 8>It just just makes you nuts.</v>

5729
02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:29.620
<v Speaker 8>God.</v>

5730
02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:30.131
<v Speaker 8>Check this out.</v>

5731
02:36:30.131 --> 02:36:33.310
<v Speaker 8>There's already been a voter machines going crazy.</v>

5732
02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:34.330
<v Speaker 8>Look at this video.</v>

5733
02:36:34.331 --> 02:36:39.331
<v Speaker 8>It's switching people's votes from Obama to seeing that switches it.</v>

5734
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:43.060
<v Speaker 8>I'm not surprised that they,</v>

5735
02:36:43.061 --> 02:36:43.300
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5736
02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:44.440
<v Speaker 8>they never fixed that shit.</v>

5737
02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:47.710
<v Speaker 8>These fucking Republicans on all these voting machines,</v>

5738
02:36:47.970 --> 02:36:48.430
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

5739
02:36:48.430 --> 02:36:52.870
<v Speaker 8>they showed in that hacking democracy documentary that you could fix them so</v>

5740
02:36:52.871 --> 02:36:54.130
<v Speaker 8>that they could change the vote.</v>

5741
02:36:54.250 --> 02:36:55.950
<v Speaker 8>That's where it's ridiculous.</v>

5742
02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:56.950
<v Speaker 8>Fucking scan.</v>

5743
02:36:56.951 --> 02:36:58.300
<v Speaker 8>This isn't a real life we're living.</v>

5744
02:36:58.301 --> 02:36:59.170
<v Speaker 8>It's all fake.</v>

5745
02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:03.100
<v Speaker 8>We're living in a goddamn simulation.</v>

5746
02:37:03.101 --> 02:37:05.170
<v Speaker 8>Problem is you've got to kind of care and you got to be informed.</v>

5747
02:37:05.171 --> 02:37:07.780
<v Speaker 8>Otherwise sources will take your freedom away from it.</v>

5748
02:37:07.950 --> 02:37:09.890
<v Speaker 8>If they're already taking it with differences them.</v>

5749
02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:11.560
<v Speaker 8>You got to figure out a way to fight back,</v>

5750
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:12.250
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>

5751
02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:13.780
<v Speaker 8>Have you seen these this way?</v>

5752

<v Speaker 8>Have you seen the,</v>

5753
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:20.360
<v Speaker 8>the Chinese practice of eating eggs boiled in the urine of young boys?</v>

5758
02:37:26.990 --> 02:37:30.950
<v Speaker 8>Chinese people eat eggs boiled in the urine of Virgin Boys.</v>

5759
02:37:30.951 --> 02:37:31.091

<v Speaker 8>he didn't look at this yesterday.</v>

5761
02:37:33.290 --> 02:37:34.970
<v Speaker 8>I found that someone tweeted this out,</v>

5762
02:37:35.070 --> 02:37:36.050
<v Speaker 8>my twitter timeline,</v>

02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:38.480
<v Speaker 8>If you look at my twitter timeline,</v>

5765
02:37:38.780 --> 02:37:39.081
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

5766
02:37:39.081 --> 02:37:39.261
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

02:37:39.650 --> 02:37:41.060
<v Speaker 8>they have young boys,</v>

02:37:41.061 --> 02:37:45.840
<v Speaker 8>they have them pee and then they boil eggs in this young boy p and a.</v>

5770
02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:46.611
<v Speaker 8>They eat it all day.</v>

5771
02:37:46.611 --> 02:37:49.610
<v Speaker 8>They say it keeps them healthy and it's great for the skin.</v>

5772
02:37:49.970 --> 02:37:51.080
<v Speaker 8>It's like a super,</v>

5773
02:37:51.081 --> 02:37:51.891
<v Speaker 8>like common,</v>

5774
02:37:51.891 --> 02:37:52.701
<v Speaker 8>delicate shrink.</v>

02:37:52.701 --> 02:37:53.534
<v Speaker 8>The actual urine.</v>

5776

<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5777
02:37:53.691 --> 02:37:56.630
<v Speaker 8>they eat the eggs after it's been boiled and little kid pis,</v>

5778
02:37:56.840 --> 02:38:00.680
<v Speaker 8>but it has to be like virgin boys I guess once to start fucking becomes</v>

5779
02:38:00.681 --> 02:38:01.514
<v Speaker 8>problematic.</v>

5780
02:38:01.550 --> 02:38:02.840
<v Speaker 8>Do they boiled their hard,</v>

5781
02:38:02.841 --> 02:38:06.290
<v Speaker 8>boil it and they actually crack the egg shell.</v>

5782
02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:09.020
<v Speaker 8>So the urine seeps into the egg itself.</v>

5783
02:38:09.260 --> 02:38:11.060
<v Speaker 8>Not just heats it up from the outside,</v>

5832
02:39:27.980 --> 02:39:28.550
<v Speaker 8>So what we're saying,</v>

5833

5837
02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:34.640
<v Speaker 8>you've done nothing but take care of your friends and people around you and</v>

5838
02:39:34.641 --> 02:39:35.810
<v Speaker 8>trying to make the world a better place.</v>

5839
02:39:35.930 --> 02:39:36.171
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5840
02:39:36.171 --> 02:39:37.004
<v Speaker 8>you know what?</v>

5841
02:39:37.250 --> 02:39:40.340
<v Speaker 8>That world a better place thing I'd done or know about that.</v>

5842
02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:40.821
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5843
02:39:40.821 --> 02:39:41.080
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

5844
02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:44.030
<v Speaker 8>you try to look at that.</v>

5845
02:39:44.060 --> 02:39:44.241
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

5846
02:39:44.241 --> 02:39:46.130
<v Speaker 8>there we go and boil</v>

5847
02:39:47.650 --> 02:39:49.700
<v Speaker 8>urine of young boys.</v>

5848
02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:51.890
<v Speaker 8>Preferably those below the age of 10.</v>

5849
02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:55.180
<v Speaker 8>Hence the name virgin boy eggs,</v>

5850
02:39:56.130 --> 02:40:00.560
<v Speaker 8>popular springtime snacking touted for its health benefits.</v>

5851
02:40:02.510 --> 02:40:04.790
<v Speaker 8>We have to be very careful about going to war with these people.</v>

5852
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:08.890
<v Speaker 8>It's like somebody came up with a gimmick to sell eggs and,</v>

5853
02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:09.913
<v Speaker 8>and uh,</v>

5854
02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:11.720
<v Speaker 8>it's just a smart entrepreneur.</v>

5855
02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 8>Some guy in the corner 100,000 years ago,</v>

5856
02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:16.670
<v Speaker 9>teaching them what's.</v>

5857
02:40:16.690 --> 02:40:19.520
<v Speaker 9>It takes a full day to prepare the snacks,</v>

5858
02:40:19.550 --> 02:40:22.670
<v Speaker 9>starting off with collecting urine from boys' toilets.</v>

5859
02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:27.500
<v Speaker 9>Then the extra soaked and boiled in pots of urine after which the shells are</v>

5860
02:40:27.501 --> 02:40:31.400
<v Speaker 9>cracked and the extra simmered in the same urine for hours.</v>

5861
02:40:32.300 --> 02:40:34.050
<v Speaker 9>Those who snack on the exit,</v>

5862
02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:37.880
<v Speaker 9>they helped decrease body heat and promote better blood circulation.</v>

5863
02:40:38.090 --> 02:40:40.340
<v Speaker 9>That can make one feel reinvigorated.</v>

5864
02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:41.510
<v Speaker 9>No.</v>

5865
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:42.630
<v Speaker 9>Well my God,</v>

5866

<v Speaker 9>These eggs will not have any pain or waist legs and joints.</v>

5868
02:40:52.340 --> 02:40:57.340
<v Speaker 9>Also you'll have more energy when you do work on what is the folks in Don young</v>

5875
02:41:12.110 --> 02:41:12.943
<v Speaker 9>I don't eat.</v>

5876
02:41:14.140 --> 02:41:18.730
<v Speaker 10>Medical experts have mixed reviews about the health benefits and some worn of</v>

5877
02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:21.280
<v Speaker 10>sanitary issues in this unique delicacy</v>

<v Speaker 10>in the doctor world.</v>

5879
02:41:24.290 --> 02:41:29.230
<v Speaker 10>Declaring the virgin boy x as an intangible cultural heritage.</v>

<v Speaker 7>but they were like a real delicacy in Chinese.</v>

5911
02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:30.120
<v Speaker 7>When I was 14 years old,</v>

5912
02:42:30.121 --> 02:42:31.260
<v Speaker 7>back when China was comments,</v>

5913
02:42:31.261 --> 02:42:32.100
<v Speaker 7>I went to the mainland,</v>

02:42:32.101 --> 02:42:33.330

<v Speaker 7>all you saw,</v>

5918
02:42:38.551 --> 02:42:38.851

5919
02:42:38.851 --> 02:42:39.320
<v Speaker 7>turned around.</v>

5920
02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:43.740
<v Speaker 7>I saw back then most people in blue uniforms on bicycles,</v>

5921
02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:46.400
<v Speaker 7>Beijing was just one ballou.</v>

5922
02:42:46.410 --> 02:42:47.243
<v Speaker 7>See,</v>

5923
02:42:48.370 --> 02:42:48.540
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

5924
02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:49.680
<v Speaker 7>it was just a communist country.</v>

5925
02:42:49.681 --> 02:42:51.360
<v Speaker 7>Everybody wore the exact same blue outfit.</v>

5926
02:42:51.970 --> 02:42:53.730
<v Speaker 7>I wore a rode bicycles.</v>

5927
02:42:53.770 --> 02:42:54.450
<v Speaker 7>Was it freaky?</v>

5928
02:42:54.450 --> 02:42:56.070
<v Speaker 7>It was the freakiest thing I've ever seen in my life.</v>

5929
02:42:56.071 --> 02:42:56.904
<v Speaker 7>No advertisements.</v>

5930
02:42:56.910 --> 02:42:57.630
<v Speaker 7>Think about that.</v>

5931
02:42:57.630 --> 02:42:58.141
<v Speaker 7>No advertising,</v>

5932
02:42:58.141 --> 02:42:58.681
<v Speaker 7>no billboards,</v>

5933
02:42:58.681 --> 02:42:59.520
<v Speaker 7>no advertisements.</v>

5934
02:42:59.610 --> 02:43:00.540
<v Speaker 7>And Russia was the same way.</v>

5935
02:43:00.541 --> 02:43:01.620
<v Speaker 7>I went to Russia when it was communist.</v>

5936
02:43:01.621 --> 02:43:02.210
<v Speaker 7>There was no,</v>

5937
02:43:02.210 --> 02:43:03.043
<v Speaker 7>no advertising.</v>

5938
02:43:03.270 --> 02:43:04.320
<v Speaker 7>So you go and you go,</v>

5939
02:43:04.321 --> 02:43:05.670
<v Speaker 7>why is everything so gray?</v>

5940
02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:06.181
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

5941
02:43:06.181 --> 02:43:07.110
<v Speaker 7>there's no advertising.</v>

5942
02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:08.041
<v Speaker 7>There is no,</v>

5943
02:43:08.041 --> 02:43:09.350
<v Speaker 7>there is no color.</v>

5944
02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:12.220
<v Speaker 7>So you don't have people saying by this that you weren't allowed to do that.</v>

5945
02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:13.690
<v Speaker 7>Everything was run by the state.</v>

5946
02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:14.860
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>sort of a huge communal affairs.</v>

5949
02:43:19.180 --> 02:43:20.260
<v Speaker 7>So when you go to a restaurant,</v>

5950
02:43:20.261 --> 02:43:21.340

<v Speaker 7>I was in Russia in 1985</v>

5974
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.990
<v Speaker 7>in China.</v>

5975
02:43:48.990 --> 02:43:51.490
<v Speaker 7>China has more billionaires than anywhere else in the world.</v>

5976
02:43:51.550 --> 02:43:52.530
<v Speaker 7>They buy buicks.</v>

5977
02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:53.110
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5978
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:56.170
<v Speaker 7>They really liked buicks and yet they still have a very various oppressive</v>

5979
02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:56.681
<v Speaker 7>government,</v>

5980
02:43:56.681 --> 02:43:57.200
<v Speaker 7>but they,</v>

5981
02:43:57.200 --> 02:43:58.300
<v Speaker 7>the Chinese have always.</v>

5982
02:43:58.660 --> 02:44:03.460
<v Speaker 7>The one thing that's that really is really unique to China is that a huge area</v>

5983
02:44:03.461 --> 02:44:04.600
<v Speaker 7>of land speaks one language,</v>

5984
02:44:04.601 --> 02:44:05.051
<v Speaker 7>mandarin,</v>

5985
02:44:05.051 --> 02:44:07.930
<v Speaker 7>Chinese and that there's almost no other example like that in the world.</v>

5986
02:44:07.931 --> 02:44:08.764
<v Speaker 7>However,</v>

5987
02:44:08.890 --> 02:44:11.800
<v Speaker 7>that's because the Yangtze and the Yellow River,</v>

5988
02:44:12.100 --> 02:44:17.100
<v Speaker 7>we're able to bring ideas and commerce and language to all different parts of</v>

5989
02:44:17.231 --> 02:44:21.380
<v Speaker 7>China and so China became this uniform powerhouses result of that.</v>

5990
02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:24.280
<v Speaker 7>What's more fascinating to me is how they all look Chinese.</v>

5991
02:44:24.940 --> 02:44:25.920
<v Speaker 7>That's the credit.</v>

5992
02:44:26.020 --> 02:44:27.820
<v Speaker 7>That's the other thing that you want to talk about,</v>

5993
02:44:27.821 --> 02:44:29.440
<v Speaker 7>like a really fast area,</v>

5994
02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:31.510
<v Speaker 7>a credible size place,</v>

5995
02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:34.990
<v Speaker 7>and they all share a very similar gene pool.</v>

5996
02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:38.290
<v Speaker 7>I mean at least visually cause of the anxiety and Yellow River,</v>

5997
02:44:38.590 --> 02:44:41.320
<v Speaker 7>there was so much trade knew you were able to get in.</v>

5998
02:44:41.410 --> 02:44:42.243
<v Speaker 7>We were able to.</v>

5999
02:44:42.460 --> 02:44:43.300
<v Speaker 7>Food production,</v>

6000
02:44:43.301 --> 02:44:48.301
<v Speaker 7>domestication of animals created huge city centers and it concentrated a great</v>

6001
02:44:48.551 --> 02:44:49.720
<v Speaker 7>deal of people in one area.</v>

6002
02:44:49.810 --> 02:44:52.840
<v Speaker 7>I love how when you see northern Russia and Siberia,</v>

6003
02:44:52.841 --> 02:44:54.400
<v Speaker 7>it gets really Chinese looking.</v>

6004
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:55.061
<v Speaker 7>While I was in.</v>

6005
02:44:55.061 --> 02:45:00.010
<v Speaker 7>I was focused on and if you talk to people from Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan,</v>

6006
02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:01.660
<v Speaker 7>which are the areas that kind of like,</v>

6007
02:45:01.661 --> 02:45:01.920
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

6008
02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:03.190
<v Speaker 7>We're part of Russia used to be.</v>

6009
02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:03.810
<v Speaker 7>They're all,</v>

6010
02:45:03.810 --> 02:45:04.170
<v Speaker 7>they're all,</v>

6011
02:45:04.170 --> 02:45:04.961
<v Speaker 7>they look very,</v>

6012
02:45:04.961 --> 02:45:05.840
<v Speaker 7>very high cheekbones,</v>

6013
02:45:05.890 --> 02:45:06.730
<v Speaker 7>very Asian.</v>

6014
02:45:06.990 --> 02:45:08.170
<v Speaker 7>They look more Mongol.</v>

6015
02:45:08.410 --> 02:45:09.370
<v Speaker 7>They're tall,</v>

6016
02:45:09.550 --> 02:45:11.080
<v Speaker 7>usually strong looking,</v>

6017
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:11.860
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

6018
02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:14.000
<v Speaker 7>broad people with these high cheekbones.</v>

6019
02:45:14.110 --> 02:45:15.370
<v Speaker 7>If you see something like that,</v>

6020
02:45:15.371 --> 02:45:17.800
<v Speaker 7>doesn't it kind of like put you in touch with history?</v>

6021
02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:19.870
<v Speaker 7>Like you start thinking about like the gang is gone,</v>

6022
02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:21.070
<v Speaker 7>Eric yourself out.</v>

6023
02:45:21.071 --> 02:45:24.790
<v Speaker 7>If you really want to freak out and you want to see specimens of human beings,</v>

6024
02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:26.710
<v Speaker 7>go to the fucking Sudan,</v>

6025
02:45:27.250 --> 02:45:30.220
<v Speaker 7>go to Kenya and go take a look at the Maasai warriors.</v>

6026
02:45:30.310 --> 02:45:31.390
<v Speaker 7>Just go take a look.</v>

6027
02:45:31.660 --> 02:45:35.230
<v Speaker 7>If you want to know where the fuck guys like Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan</v>

6028
02:45:35.231 --> 02:45:36.064
<v Speaker 7>come from,</v>

6029
02:45:36.220 --> 02:45:36.611
<v Speaker 7>I don't care.</v>

6030
02:45:36.611 --> 02:45:37.770
<v Speaker 7>To me it says they are the,</v>

6031
02:45:37.790 --> 02:45:39.010
<v Speaker 7>they are these beautiful,</v>

6032
02:45:39.011 --> 02:45:41.170
<v Speaker 7>these fucking six foot seven,</v>

6033
02:45:41.260 --> 02:45:43.240
<v Speaker 7>seven foot people in the span.</v>

6034
02:45:43.241 --> 02:45:43.481
<v Speaker 7>These,</v>

6035
02:45:43.481 --> 02:45:43.720
<v Speaker 7>these,</v>

6036
02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:44.050
<v Speaker 7>these,</v>

6037
02:45:44.050 --> 02:45:44.410
<v Speaker 7>these,</v>

6038
02:45:44.410 --> 02:45:45.820
<v Speaker 7>they live a nomadic lifestyle.</v>

6039
02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:46.713
<v Speaker 7>Seven feet,</v>

6040
02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:47.553
<v Speaker 7>no problem.</v>

6041
02:45:48.310 --> 02:45:53.310
<v Speaker 7>Athletic is all fucking get out wide and big head's the size of basketballs.</v>

6042
02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:55.001
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>

6043
02:45:55.001 --> 02:45:56.410
<v Speaker 7>where the fuck did you come from?</v>

6044
02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:58.450
<v Speaker 7>It is a different gene pool.</v>

6045
02:45:58.510 --> 02:46:00.610
<v Speaker 7>And how did that one gene pool rise?</v>

6046
02:46:00.670 --> 02:46:01.420
<v Speaker 7>How did the,</v>

6047
02:46:01.420 --> 02:46:03.670
<v Speaker 7>how did the pygmies in the Congo arise?</v>

6048
02:46:03.780 --> 02:46:04.300
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

6049
02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:04.540
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>

6050
02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:05.170
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>

6051
02:46:05.170 --> 02:46:08.050
<v Speaker 7>there are a lot of theories on the biology of why people do it,</v>

6052
02:46:08.260 --> 02:46:10.830
<v Speaker 7>but a lot of it had to do with um,</v>

6053
02:46:11.050 --> 02:46:13.930
<v Speaker 7>like how isolated that gene pool was at.</v>

6054
02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:14.391
<v Speaker 7>For example,</v>

6055
02:46:14.391 --> 02:46:15.410
<v Speaker 7>Paul Pan Asian people,</v>

6056
02:46:15.420 --> 02:46:17.840
<v Speaker 7>very isolated for a long period of time.</v>

6057
02:46:18.370 --> 02:46:19.030
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

6058
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.820
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

6059
02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:20.501
<v Speaker 7>Hawaii and,</v>

6060
02:46:20.501 --> 02:46:20.701
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

6061
02:46:20.701 --> 02:46:22.610
<v Speaker 7>and especially Tonga and Samoa,</v>

6062
02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:23.570
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

6063
02:46:23.570 --> 02:46:26.420
<v Speaker 7>up until I think it was the late 17,</v>

6064
02:46:26.480 --> 02:46:27.590
<v Speaker 7>early 18 hundreds,</v>

6065
02:46:27.740 --> 02:46:29.570
<v Speaker 7>they'd never been contacted by white people.</v>

6066
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:34.310
<v Speaker 3>You know what's interesting about islands is that animals tend to dwarf on</v>

6067
02:46:34.311 --> 02:46:35.060
<v Speaker 3>islands,</v>

6068
02:46:35.060 --> 02:46:37.940
<v Speaker 3>but lizards tend to grow towards giant.</v>

6069
02:46:37.941 --> 02:46:38.990
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

6070
02:46:38.991 --> 02:46:42.230
<v Speaker 3>that's why the Komodo dragons became like enormous lizard.</v>

6071
02:46:42.231 --> 02:46:43.820
<v Speaker 3>They were isolated to the Komodo islands,</v>

6072
02:46:44.060 --> 02:46:46.220
<v Speaker 3>but like pygmy elephants and shit like that,</v>

6073
02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:46.880
<v Speaker 3>or they.</v>

6074
02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6075
02:46:47.370 --> 02:46:48.400
<v Speaker 3>in the sense that,</v>

6076
02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:48.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6077
02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:49.820
<v Speaker 3>the I'm not enough.</v>

6078
02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:50.990
<v Speaker 3>The hobbit people,</v>

6079
02:46:50.991 --> 02:46:51.351
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

6080
02:46:51.351 --> 02:46:52.790
<v Speaker 3>a Homo Floresiensis,</v>

6081
02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:55.730
<v Speaker 3>those little tiny human beings that lived alongside people.</v>

6082
02:46:55.731 --> 02:46:58.670
<v Speaker 3>That's also like an episode of like an island.</v>

6083
02:46:58.671 --> 02:46:59.420
<v Speaker 3>Dwarfism.</v>

6084
02:46:59.420 --> 02:46:59.991
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

6085
02:46:59.991 --> 02:47:00.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6086
02:47:00.291 --> 02:47:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I wonder though why,</v>

6087
02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:05.210
<v Speaker 3>why was it a form of natural selection where they grow so tall?</v>

6088
02:47:05.211 --> 02:47:09.290
<v Speaker 3>People like me because Sudans ridiculous fight off lines and shit and the big</v>

6089
02:47:09.291 --> 02:47:10.124
<v Speaker 3>ones survived.</v>

6090
02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:15.520
<v Speaker 3>And the Masai Mara are fucking tall athletic that the Masa just broke the</v>

6091
02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:18.030
<v Speaker 3>fucking half mile record in the Olympics this year.</v>

6092
02:47:18.050 --> 02:47:20.660
<v Speaker 3>World record ran like fucking destroyed.</v>

6093
02:47:20.661 --> 02:47:21.230
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>

6094
02:47:21.230 --> 02:47:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Well that guy,</v>

6095
02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:22.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6096
02:47:22.371 --> 02:47:22.920
<v Speaker 3>comparing them.</v>

6097
02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:26.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the conversation we were having earlier with like some fucking fat Doughy</v>

6098
02:47:26.481 --> 02:47:27.314
<v Speaker 3>Guy,</v>

6099
02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Gabriel Iglesias guy and you know,</v>

6100
02:47:29.870 --> 02:47:31.940
<v Speaker 3>like physically if they're going to get an MMA fight,</v>

6101
02:47:31.941 --> 02:47:33.120
<v Speaker 3>one of them is cheating already.</v>

6102
02:47:33.150 --> 02:47:33.960
<v Speaker 3>I got a shitty.</v>

6103
02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:34.640
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

6104
02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:38.000
<v Speaker 3>I didn't win the genetic lottery and I'm okay to fail.</v>

6105
02:47:38.030 --> 02:47:38.930
<v Speaker 3>I didn't fail either.</v>

6106
02:47:39.050 --> 02:47:39.651
<v Speaker 3>I'm all right,</v>

6107
02:47:39.651 --> 02:47:40.940
<v Speaker 3>but when I look at fucking.</v>

6108
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6109
02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:43.093
<v Speaker 3>I got to 70.</v>

6110
02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:46.400
<v Speaker 3>You look at these fucking Simone's with their back of their arms,</v>

6111
02:47:46.401 --> 02:47:48.640
<v Speaker 3>those big elbows and their knees.</v>

6112
02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:50.271
<v Speaker 3>Mark Hunt,</v>

6113
02:47:50.271 --> 02:47:51.104
<v Speaker 3>looking legs,</v>

6114
02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:51.953
<v Speaker 3>command</v>

6115
02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:54.380
<v Speaker 3>five minutes the.</v>

6116

02:47:55.900 --> 02:47:56.320
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

6118
02:47:56.320 --> 02:47:59.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a documentary on this one area of Africa.</v>

6119
02:47:59.391 --> 02:48:00.380
<v Speaker 3>We're a 100 years,</v>

6121
02:48:04.730 --> 02:48:05.630
<v Speaker 3>the giant lines.</v>

6122
02:48:05.900 --> 02:48:10.900
<v Speaker 3>There's an area where the river changed course 100 years ago and it's stranded</v>

6123
02:48:11.451 --> 02:48:15.320
<v Speaker 3>all these lions and water buffalo in this one area,</v>

6124
02:48:15.500 --> 02:48:19.550
<v Speaker 3>and because the lines don't have any other way other than water buffalo,</v>

02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:25.550
<v Speaker 3>They become hoke sized lines.</v>

6129
02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:28.140
<v Speaker 3>The female lions are as large as regular mail,</v>

6130
02:48:28.260 --> 02:48:28.930
<v Speaker 3>500 pound.</v>

6131
02:48:28.930 --> 02:48:31.970
<v Speaker 3>They're enormous muscular,</v>

6132
02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:35.480
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably muscular because all they eat is water buffalo.</v>

6133
02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:39.740
<v Speaker 3>These giant fucking buffaloes that they need like seven or eight of them to take</v>

6134
02:48:39.741 --> 02:48:40.280
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

6135
02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:43.820
<v Speaker 3>so they jump on their back and one of them goes underneath and they try to drag</v>
