00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

2
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.080
<v Speaker 1>freak bitches.</v>

3
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.520
<v Speaker 1>What's the turtle thing?</v>

4
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>

5
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.551
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

6
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:06.384
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

7
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 2>a jocular expression I guess from a Stephen Hawking book.</v>

8
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.811
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

9
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

10
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

11
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.560
<v Speaker 2>it's like an old comedic reference to the infinite regress problem in cosmology,</v>

12
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:17.521
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

13
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

14
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.953
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

15
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 2>based on all the shit we were talking about earlier and there's a story,</v>

16
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I guess there was some professor at Oxford or somewhere were given a speech and</v>

17
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 2>explaining how the universe works and,</v>

18
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 2>and everything else in some little lady stood up and said,</v>

19
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:34.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 2>it's really clever.</v>

21
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I know you think you're smart but you're wrong.</v>

22
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.121
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

23
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:39.391
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

24
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:39.841
<v Speaker 2>well what's,</v>

25
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>

26
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.981
<v Speaker 2>what's the truth?</v>

27
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:41.341
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

28
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:41.461
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

29
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 2>the earth sits on the back of this giant cosmic turtle and carries it through</v>

30
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:46.554
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

31
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.641
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

32
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:47.821
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

33
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 2>what's carrying the turtle?</v>

34
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:49.231
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

35
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:49.381
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

36
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:50.161
<v Speaker 2>that's very clever,</v>

37
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 2>but it's another turtle.</v>

38
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.921
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

39
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:53.071
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

40
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:53.680
<v Speaker 2>what's under that?</v>

41
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

42
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 2>you might as well you're wasting your time.</v>

43
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 2>It's turtles all the way down.</v>

44
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 2>And so hocking referenced this in brief history of time.</v>

45
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 2>And it's weird because you can look back,</v>

46
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm Hindu cosmology and a lot of,</v>

47
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:07.764
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 2>some native American tribes,</v>

49
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:14.091
<v Speaker 2>they all held these earthly turtles and high reverence and the symbology of it</v>

50
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 2>all and they find that story in different cultures throughout,</v>

51
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

52
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 2>space but thousands of years.</v>

53
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 2>But there's this weird weird referenced to this cosmic turtle and the Indians or</v>

54
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 2>the Hindu thought there were these four elephant standing on the back of the</v>

55
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 2>turtle and the earth was a flat disk rest on its back and it just cruised</v>

56
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.941
<v Speaker 2>through space.</v>

57
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of artwork you can find associated to this.</v>

58
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:38.480
<v Speaker 2>And I just thought that it was really the law,</v>

59
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 2>the record at its core is about love.</v>

60
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

61
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 2>being like this one universal truth and you get a lot of people look to</v>

62
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:45.511
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

63
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:47.210
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people look to drugs.</v>

64
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you can't get really spiritual experiences from all those things,</v>

65
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:56.571
<v Speaker 2>but I think love at the end of the day is the one thing that really I've ever</v>

66
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 2>found forced me to want to wake up and really try to be a better human being.</v>

67
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Every day,</v>

68
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

69
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 2>so that was the main point of the album and the turtles thing was just kind of,</v>

70
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

71
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a way of saying if you get into an argument with somebody and you realize</v>

72
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 2>it's just pointless,</v>

73
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 2>you're going back and forth.</v>

74
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 2>It's turtles all the way down because nobody really knows shit,</v>

75
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:14.994
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

76
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 2>and we're all just trying to not kill each other.</v>

77
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

78
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I decided it would make a good country song.</v>

79
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just need to talk to Kirk Cameron.</v>

80
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

81
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.910
<v Speaker 1>you're talking a lot of shit,</v>

82
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.180
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really know until you sit down with Kirk Cameron.</v>

83
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen his buddy that shows that banana is proof of evolution?</v>

84
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 1>That was the ray comfort.</v>

85
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.401
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

86
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:35.091
<v Speaker 1>This dumb fuck.</v>

87
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't even understand that we changed the way bananas look like this guy.</v>

88
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 1>He caused the banana and the atheist nightmare.</v>

89
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that video?</v>

90
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.400
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful,</v>

91
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:43.850
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

92
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

94
00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:45.790
<v Speaker 1>That video's beautiful.</v>

95
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

96
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.450
<v Speaker 1>it's and him and Duane Gish and the gish gallop where you're just like throwing</v>

97
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:51.830
<v Speaker 1>a word salad at somebody.</v>

98
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:52.101
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

99
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:52.281
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

100
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:52.581
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

101
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>evolution isn't true because it's like,</v>

102
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.450
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

103
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>

104
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.900
<v Speaker 1>They're all just gay.</v>

105
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.793
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

106
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

107
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

108
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

109
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with being gay,</v>

110
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>but I really believe that that's what's going on with most of those guys.</v>

111
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.370
<v Speaker 1>They're the reason why they're so hog.</v>

112
00:03:07.371 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Wild for Jesus.</v>

113
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Like Kirk Cameron.</v>

114
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a gay man.</v>

115
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a gay man,</v>

116
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty good at spotting some things in this life.</v>

117
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I know what a gay man it looks like.</v>

118
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I know know it all.</v>

119
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Gay Men look like I've been fooled before,</v>

120
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

121
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like you put a fucking lizard outfit on dog.</v>

122
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go,</v>

123
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.441
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

124
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Something's up with that lizard.</v>

125
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

126
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>That same with the banana.</v>

127
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.891
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

128
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:30.131
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

129
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:30.671
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

130
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:30.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Peeling it and.</v>

132
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.681
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

133
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

134
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.843
<v Speaker 1>Goof bag.</v>

135
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.361
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't eat,</v>

136
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>but he never even bothered doing the work to understand that.</v>

137
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>We used to have different looking fucking bananas within the,</v>

138
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.030
<v Speaker 1>within the written human record like that ain't that long ago.</v>

139
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

140
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

141
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:47.180
<v Speaker 1>it's and,</v>

142
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.330
<v Speaker 1>and somebody brought,</v>

143
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I think once somebody brought him an actual,</v>

144
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>a non,</v>

145
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 1>like an original natural banana and he was like,</v>

146
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

147
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.813
<v Speaker 1>It's a banana.</v>

148
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.301
<v Speaker 1>You dumb.</v>

149
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.134
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

150
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

151
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Because he started,</v>

152
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>he knew that part of his brain is all just for fighting off cock,</v>

153
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>fighting off the love of the COC.</v>

154
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>So he puts that just,</v>

155
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any room for that.</v>

156
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that kind of research and busy fighting off the gay.</v>

157
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.680
<v Speaker 1>So I'll just sit here with this banana.</v>

158
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>It's pontificate.</v>

159
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean he could,</v>

160
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

161
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.943
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

162
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>if as any way shape or form a hypothesis were true,</v>

163
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>it's my thesis.</v>

164
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.173
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

165
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Why are you such a phallic symbol?</v>

166
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.483
<v Speaker 1>Why did he,</v>

167
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>for all the same reasons,</v>

168
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't understand what he's doing,</v>

169
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 1>what's drawn to it,</v>

170
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>the transference,</v>

171
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:35.051
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

173
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:35.831
<v Speaker 1>into the symbol.</v>

174
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually giving them power.</v>

175
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>It makes them feel comfortable,</v>

176
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's such a ridiculous proposition that God made a food that we could hold</v>

177
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:44.810
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well.</v>

178
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

179
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Tomatoes are no good,</v>

180
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.811
<v Speaker 1>like why,</v>

181
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:47.561
<v Speaker 1>why can't you.</v>

182
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean a fucking tomatoes pretty easily held to like,</v>

183
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 1>that's really stupid.</v>

184
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't banana shaped which tomato?</v>

185
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>

186
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.751
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

187
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:54.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 1>You've got cherry tomatoes carries,</v>

189
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.101
<v Speaker 1>hothouse.</v>

190
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

191
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

192
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:03.031
<v Speaker 1>all these different ones because we've modified them and we modified them.</v>

193
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 1>We got involved.</v>

194
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Your light is.</v>

195
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you find it really rewarding to be out in this incredibly wild environment?</v>

196
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Like when you come to a city like you go from that to New York City.</v>

197
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Is New York City just like a cool little vacation for you and then do you do,</v>

198
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>do you appreciate the wild or do you appreciate New York because of the wild or</v>

199
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:25.894
<v Speaker 1>both?</v>

200
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.023
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

201
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

202
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 3>my lifestyle,</v>

203
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 3>the challenges I face and overcoming that,</v>

204
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.243
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

205
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.490
<v Speaker 3>there is such pride in yourself that,</v>

206
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.151
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh,</v>

207
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:38.984
<v Speaker 3>I did that.</v>

208
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.890
<v Speaker 3>How cool is that</v>

209
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 3>in being really little.</v>

210
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:43.451
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

211
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:43.601
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

212
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 3>I terrified of the dark,</v>

213
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.630
<v Speaker 3>but now I live in a place that's dark for nine months out of the year.</v>

214
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

215
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are always challenges.</v>

216
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Know yourself better yourself,</v>

217
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.990
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

218
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

219
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 3>when I go to a city</v>

220
00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.401
<v Speaker 3>a bear,</v>

221
00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:01.020
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what he wants from me,</v>

222
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

223
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 3>pretty much he's either going to eat you or he wants something here I was just</v>

224
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:06.021
<v Speaker 3>passing through,</v>

225
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's a pretty honest relationship.</v>

226
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:08.061
<v Speaker 3>He wants to eat me.</v>

227
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:08.894
<v Speaker 3>I don't want them to.</v>

228
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 3>You go to a big city and I'm used to seeing my horizon.</v>

229
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm always checking things.</v>

230
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:14.511
<v Speaker 3>There's no trees,</v>

231
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:15.261
<v Speaker 3>there's no buildings.</v>

232
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:16.200
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing tomorrow.</v>

233
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.053
<v Speaker 3>My horizon,</v>

234
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I go to New York and you can't go eight feet and you've got a 60 story building.</v>

235
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 3>How the hell do you check your horizon?</v>

236
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 3>How do you know what's coming at you?</v>

237
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 3>You see people,</v>

238
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 3>but you cannot be guaranteed.</v>

239
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 3>When I see a bear and he's charging,</v>

240
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 3>I know he wants to attack me.</v>

241
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 3>You see a person walking down the street,</v>

242
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 3>you don't know whether he's going to pull a gun out of his pocket.</v>

243
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 3>Shake your hand,</v>

244
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 3>pinch your ass or wave goodbye.</v>

245
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

246
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 3>So that's a Predator that I'm pretty impressed people want to be around.</v>

247
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 5>When I got here,</v>

248
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.120
<v Speaker 3>look at all these lights and all these people.</v>

249
00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

250
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.171
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

251
00:06:50.171 --> 00:06:51.004
<v Speaker 3>and they're here on purpose.</v>

252
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.530
<v Speaker 5>What's weird?</v>

253
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.410
<v Speaker 5>And so I always wrestling with this whole time because when I go to these</v>

254
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:57.244
<v Speaker 5>places,</v>

255
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.960
<v Speaker 5>I love the culture.</v>

256
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.220
<v Speaker 5>I love the people.</v>

257
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.373
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

258
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 5>even there I was trying to learn Swahili with some of the,</v>

259
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

260
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.200
<v Speaker 5>the trackers that we're working with me.</v>

261
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.430
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

262
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 5>Rashidi awesome guy speaks only swahili but so I really invest myself into the</v>

263
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:18.130
<v Speaker 5>culture and I just want to learn.</v>

264
00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:20.140
<v Speaker 5>I want to sort of get,</v>

265
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.790
<v Speaker 5>I want to see things through their eyes.</v>

266
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.403
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

267
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 5>I saw these grass shacks and all these people in,</v>

268
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.441
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

269
00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:29.950
<v Speaker 5>every grass shack had six little kids running around it.</v>

270
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.700
<v Speaker 5>And it was just like,</v>

271
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking this is awful.</v>

272
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

273
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.600
<v Speaker 5>it's no hope for six kids at every grass shack that seems.</v>

274
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.561
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

275
00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:40.150
<v Speaker 5>it just seemed very sad to me,</v>

276
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.400
<v Speaker 5>but we're,</v>

277
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.550
<v Speaker 5>we're there getting ready to cross this river in the truck and the river was</v>

278
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:45.850
<v Speaker 5>high.</v>

279
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.720
<v Speaker 5>So we're kind of out a Ryan Shalom is the,</v>

280
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.823
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

281
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 5>he owns Greenleaf,</v>

282
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.923
<v Speaker 5>Tanzania.</v>

283
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.781
<v Speaker 5>And so we're,</v>

284
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:56.350
<v Speaker 5>we're there and we're kind of seeing what's going on.</v>

285
00:07:56.351 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 5>And there was a village about a quarter mile away and uh,</v>

286
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.550
<v Speaker 5>as we're looking at the river and trying to make a game plan,</v>

287
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.440
<v Speaker 5>there was music and just people singing and I'm like,</v>

288
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.630
<v Speaker 5>is it happy hour over here?</v>

289
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.710
<v Speaker 5>What is going on?</v>

290
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:12.730
<v Speaker 5>And it just,</v>

291
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.230
<v Speaker 5>that really just hit home.</v>

292
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:14.950
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

293
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:15.161
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

294
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.460
<v Speaker 5>I see him and I think there's no hope and they must be miserable.</v>

295
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.040
<v Speaker 5>But they're laughing and singing and dancing</v>

296
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:23.590
<v Speaker 5>maybe.</v>

297
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.610
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're okay.</v>

298
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.661
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

299
00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:26.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

300
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.100
<v Speaker 5>are they happy?</v>

301
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.030
<v Speaker 5>They seemed happy to me so I don't really care.</v>

302
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.360
<v Speaker 5>So it's weird.</v>

303
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:31.930
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

304
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:32.763
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

305
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:33.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

306
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.790
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

307
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.740
<v Speaker 5>I can look at it from outside and judge and say,</v>

308
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.843
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

309
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.730
<v Speaker 5>you must be so depressed.</v>

310
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:41.973
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're not.</v>

311
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:42.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
