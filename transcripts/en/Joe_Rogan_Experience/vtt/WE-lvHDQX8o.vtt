WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.500
We're live guys.
Oh,
is it live?
Yeah.
Oh,
cool.
And we're live.

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.150
Ladies and gentlemen wanted a picture quick.

3
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:11.730
We're here with the great and powerful Jimmy Smith.
Welcome to the UFC.

4
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:15.420
Jimmy Smith,
thank you so much for,
she'll be here officially official.

5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:18.000
We wanted to talk about it last time we'll do on the podcast,

6
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:22.410
but we have dance around it.
You,
it's so many people wrote me were like,

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.360
Joe,
really?
Here I'll go,
hey man,
Joseph pro.
But he uh,

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.800
you hinted well we danced around it quite a bit.

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.580
Nobody know what he totally knew and of course the great and powerful 80 Bravo.

10
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.790
Yo Yo yo.
Brian counts on the way,
but he's bringing wine and cheese.

11
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:37.080
He insists on wine and cheese.

12
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.480
He thinks he's had some sucking fucking cocktail party.

13
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:43.140
We're going to compare scripts.
That's Brian.
He's gotta have his wine and cheese.

14
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.670
Uh,
do Ho choice versus a Jeremy Stevens is the main event.

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.980
If you've never heard of one of these podcasts before,

16
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:53.520
this is a fight companion podcast,
which means we're going to watch the fights.

17
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.510
Most likely we'll talk about the fights,
but we might not,

18
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.060
we can talk about whatever the fuck.
Like Eddie and I have,

19
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:01.470
we've gotten through the entire podcast.

20
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:05.550
We never talked about the fight until like the last round of the main event,

21
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.670
but Missouri,
Missouri Division of perfect.
Oh,

22
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:13.160
there in Missouri was the Saint Louis.
That's what it is,
right?
Yeah.
The,

23
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.790
and they haven't adopted the AVC rules.

24
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.310
That's important for the judging at least.
Damn sure.

25
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:20.070
They haven't adopted those in Nevada,
which is real weird.
Crazy.

26
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.970
Look how good Michael Johnson looks at 45 Eddie was saying that it's racist to

27
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:27.660
say that,
but I don't think it is like got shredded.
He is fantastic.

28
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.840
Yeah.
That's a good weight class for him.
Yeah.
I think,
you know,
it's just,

29
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.910
there was a beep number.
Go Madoff's,

30
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.520
those giant 50 fives they could just grapple fuck you and beat your brains.

31
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:41.790
And he had enough of that monsters.
Yeah.
It's like that's,

32
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:45.240
that's about enough of this way class when people remember how much the other

33
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:50.190
guy talked to Dana white while he was beating my assets.
That's bad.
That's bad.

34
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:52.440
And he's a great fighter and that's what's so funny about it is,

35
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.060
well this was supposed to be the main event on the prelims,

36
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.600
but Uriah hall and Vito Belfort fell out really unfortunately,

37
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:03.990
which is a fucking bummer.

38
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.350
Apparently Uriah hall was like on death's door trying to make weight,

39
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.360
but he had like gotten sick.

40
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:12.540
I had heard during training he was having some real issues.

41
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.300
He said his body shut down about three weeks out.

42
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.150
A lot of people out here dealing with that fucking flew and then Robert Falls

43
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.060
just coach died.
Who's a great guy by the way,
if you ever met Robert,

44
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.940
he was fantastic,
but you don't meant it was just going through a lot of stress.

45
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:30.840
Yeah.
And that'll,
that'll kill your cut to yeah.
Robert,
um,
killed themselves.
Yeah.

46
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.820
So did his brother.
It's such a,
such a pump.
That guy's a nice fucking,

47
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:40.110
God loved us.
Such a good dude.
It's such a bummer man.
Yeah.

48
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.610
I'm so instead this fight,
which was going to be on the prelims.

49
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:48.210
I'm excited about this fight though because Darren Elkins is some sort of a

50
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.680
different kind of human.
That guy takes fucking punishment.
Like nobody,

51
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.340
Eddie probably looking for marijuana.
No,
no,
it's okay.

52
00:02:56.341 --> 00:03:00.070
We don't know we can this,
this is a free,
we live

53
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.540
<v 1>in California.
I don't drink anymore and at all.
Nope.
No more drinking.
Wow.</v>

54
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.460
And no more caffeine.
I'm on intermittent fasting.
Dan.
You look good dude.

55
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:13.390
Your face looks good.
Split.
I'm not giving this away.
Yeah,
I don't give that away.

56
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.660
Oh,
I made a giving it up.
Sorry.
Giving it up.
Who still don't give it up.

57
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:20.080
Don't give it away.
So,
uh,
how long has it been since the booze?

58
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.680
I,

59
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.300
I decided initially that I would only allow myself to drink like a by data set

60
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.860
somewhere or if I did,
um,
you know,
I,
my,

61
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.450
at the 10th Planet Holiday Party,
I allowed myself to drink,

62
00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:37.350
but that was the last time.

63
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.670
It's been about a month and a half since I'm in a drink.

64
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.260
Interesting.
How you feel?
I feel great.
Like it.
I don't need alcohol.
No,

65
00:03:46.261 --> 00:03:48.630
you don't need alcohol.
It just gets you in trouble.

66
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.710
It makes you say shit no more Indian.
Oh,
India.

67
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.760
The Indians out now he's smoking the peace pipe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No more Indians.

68
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.760
Jimmy Smith,
you spoke the reefer every now and then.

69
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.470
Every puff just to celebrate.
Yeah.
But the thing to me is,

70
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.130
is uh,
little known personal fact.

71
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:12.020
I've never had a drink in my life ever,
ever mine.
Wow.
That's incredible.
Yeah.

72
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.440
That's amazing.
So what the fuck do you blame your Mc fuck ups on?

73
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.790
Nothing.
I have no excuses for my behavior.
That's terrible.
None.
Well,
you know,

74
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:23.470
you've been hitting the head of gang.
I have been hit in the head.
Yeah.
That,

75
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.810
that's more than once.
Yeah.
Speak,
speaking to hit in the head.

76
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.530
The world title,
Steve Bay and Francis,

77
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:34.980
they're showing the preview for it right now.
Good fucking me.
Fantastical,
Glee.

78
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:39.210
Mooglie I've never been more excited for a heavyweight title fight ever.

79
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.230
That's a freak.
Oh,
he's a freaking stir.
The freakiest.

80
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.270
He's a one in a million athlete.

81
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.690
Like if you think there's 320 million people in this country,

82
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.310
how many in Ganas are there?

83
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.870
If there's 300 I'd be fucking stunned.
I don't even think he's,

84
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.470
I think it's more than one in a million.
Like the guy who's built like that,

85
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.180
Susan,
it's been training three years or something.
There's probably a whole shot.

86
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.380
Five years.
Five years total.
I was homeless five years ago.
Yeah,
it's crazy.
Yeah.

87
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.920
Crazy dude worked in a sand mine as a kid,

88
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.710
like goddamn character and to Robert E.
Howard comic book,

89
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.280
like digging sand as it can already.
That's a hero cone and by the way guys did.

90
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.250
You're not a comic book Dork.

91
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.860
Just growing and with his anger is pushing that thing right?

92
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.930
Schwartzenegger pushing the,
the,
we log the wheel forever.
The grinder.
I mean,

93
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:30.760
what better workout is there for?

94
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:35.350
A young guy wants a beat the fuck out of people than digging sand all day.

95
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:39.370
Just carrying sand all back and legs and arms.
I mean,

96
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.840
think about how much strength is required.
Just fucking dig sand all the time.

97
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.820
There's places that are,
they're called sandbox workouts or something like that.

98
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:52.670
Have you heard about those?
Maybe they start Doug on that,
but he hadn't gone.

99
00:05:52.671 --> 00:05:55.690
Who opens up a chain of Sam training or something like that.

100
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.250
But we were just talking about before,
before we got on headset.
Um,

101
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.600
<v 0>guys who are comfortable,
who have money,
who have another crew,
have a fallback.</v>

102
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.320
It's hard to be 100% committed.
This dude was digging sand homeless.

103
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.100
You're never more committed to winning.
If I don't win,
I don't eat man.

104
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.250
And that motivation so strong,

105
00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:14.750
as powerful as most powerful thing in the world when it comes to fighting.

106
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.510
The crazy thing about that dude is he has so much to learn.

107
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:20.990
Still five years of MMA training.
I mean,

108
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:25.550
his ground game is very rudimentary.
He's just trying to stuff take downs.

109
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.450
He's freakish strong,
he's got real good training.

110
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:31.370
He's at the UFC performance institute,

111
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:35.360
so he's training with real good guys on a daily basis.
But man,

112
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.230
I mean a lot to lot to grow.
He's there all the time.
Yeah,
he lives there.

113
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:42.050
Practically.
Look out shredded Michael Johnson as Jesus Christ.

114
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.970
He's fucking shredded at 45 and gone fought Fabi sword though.
No,
no,

115
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.930
no.
He fought our Lawsky and then he knocked out Overeem and then they said,

116
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:54.290
you got it,
you got the title shot.
When he put over him in orbit,

117
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.710
everybody was like,
okay,
the this is the only fight to get what he wants to say.

118
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.700
That's awesome.
I mean,

119
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:02.150
who the fuck is and what a story and Steve Bay's run has cleared out a lot of

120
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:05.180
guys.
It's just that he,
you know,
you need that fresh face,

121
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:07.280
you need that knockout guy and then steep based chasing history.

122
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.010
Those things come together.
Some of the crazy thing,

123
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:14.330
the history is only two title defenses and the entire history of the UFC

124
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.640
heavyweight division.
It's only been defended twice.

125
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.820
No one's ever done it three times.
And then nuts.
And that's the first title.

126
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.080
First title was heavyweight.
Yeah.
Think about that.
That's crazy.
That is crazy.

127
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.890
Yeah.
Michael Johnson shred it.
He's going to fuck a 36 pack.

128
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.240
There's a lot of jealousy in your face.
Can you see?
Can they see?

129
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.240
Well,
admiration and maybe a bit of want.

130
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.670
I want to have abs like that,
but I wouldn't say jealousy.
I'm happy.

131
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.140
I'm happy to drop cause I was felt he was a little soft at 55 I always felt like

132
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:50.030
he should have looked like this,
you know?

133
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.500
I mean this dude's lean is fuck and he hits so hard and he's so fast.

134
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:57.800
I think at 45 it's going to be a monster.
I think this is a big move for him.

135
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.120
I'm a big fan of this guy,
man.

136
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.010
He hurting her MCHA Madoff in that fight too and he's the first guy to put

137
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:08.360
neuroma comin off in trouble.
People Forget.
He Starts Justin Pour,
Yay k owed him.

138
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.700
Michael Johnson's a bad motherfucker.

139
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.260
The problem when you get in there with a guy like Norma Madoff and he beats your

140
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:20.890
ass that bad,
you're like,
well how the fuck am I ever going to beat this guy?

141
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.790
Yeah.
You know like this doesn't move you.
Yeah.
Every,
every major move,

142
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.650
most major moves in MMA or due to a beat down there due to usually getting

143
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:32.890
manhandled by somebody who's naturally without weight class or big for that way.

144
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.100
Because if it's not a move that way,
it's a move to a do camp.

145
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.810
It's like I got to train for Asa Hobby or go to Matt Hume or go to one of the

146
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:43.750
wizards.
Someone was going to revamp my shit.

147
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.360
You see a lot of that,
you know,
but it's often times too late.

148
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.850
It's such a crazy fucking sport because while you're training for a,

149
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.330
you kind of have to be trained in for the fight.

150
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:00.780
You can't really take too many chances and learn too much new shit that's,

151
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:03.150
you don't,
when you talk to trainers,
oh,
the old school guys,

152
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.240
that's one of the things they say about Mike Tyson is he fought so much,

153
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.180
he didn't develop enough.
He just wasn't in the gym that much.

154
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.150
He was fighting every,
you know,
twice a month in his prime when he was younger.

155
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.240
So here we go for (525) 145-0440 nine of the first round for trying to sync it

156
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:21.270
up.
Michael Johnson and Darren Elkins and Darren Elkins there.

157
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:23.910
Here's a guy who made a big move when he went to Alpha male.

158
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.440
It's made a huge impact on him and he looks way more polished,
way,
way smoother.

159
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:33.420
The way he moves.
He really saw that in the Bursa,
Beck Dick Fight.

160
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.190
That was a crazy fight because that was a fight where he was way underdog,

161
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.310
like a by a big margin for a good reason.
And you,

162
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.290
he's heard already getting hurt.
Yeah,
he's getting tagged.

163
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.600
We'll see Michael Johnson goes after him before he stays patient.

164
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.370
I always think whenever I see a guy at 35 45 from Alpha Male,
I always think,

165
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.950
Ooh.
When they called them and go,
well,

166
00:09:57.951 --> 00:09:59.660
we need to get a 45 for you to get that call.

167
00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:02.270
You gotta be Beasley because they have a lot of those guys.
I mean,

168
00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:05.270
that's their whole team.
Oh,
Michael Johnson.
Just tapping him again.

169
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.340
He's fast man at 45 very fast and he's range.

170
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:12.350
He's getting good extension on his punches.
Yeah.

171
00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:15.230
And at 45 is going to be enjoying that even more.

172
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.740
Good height reach of Ed.
She just looks perfectly built for the way class.

173
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.940
Any as a speed.
A lot of people don't realize when you drop a weight class,

174
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.450
those guys are a hell of a lot faster and he has the speed to keep up with those

175
00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:29.770
guys.
A lot of them don't.
Yeah.

176
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:31.530
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

177
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.050
<v 0>And I think he's probably going to be even faster at 45</v>

178
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.610
although he dang,
I serve 10 leg went out on him.

179
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.383
<v 2>Oh,</v>

180
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.640
<v 0>this is a good fight already.
Oh,
we tagged them again.</v>

181
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.740
The Elkins hasn't really figured it out.
He's waiting on him.
Well,

182
00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:55.270
he's just a step slower for sure.
And just not,
not nearly as smooth as Stryker.

183
00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.370
Elkins relies on his ability to take tremendous punishment and his heart and his

184
00:11:00.371 --> 00:11:05.310
endurance,
or it just never stops at this pace.
And if you start to slip,
Ooh,

185
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:10.270
sweet.
Left to prom is,
that's a tough thing to rely on in this business.

186
00:11:10.271 --> 00:11:13.750
The Way MMA isn't it?
Oh,
I'm a tough guy.
Well,
welcome to the club.

187
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.310
It's like 500 tough guys in the UFC.
Tough
Shit.

188
00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:24.050
We got tough girls.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
Fucking Holly Holm.
How about that fight?

189
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.670
Wow.
Amount of punishment that she took against Cyborg.
Crazy.
She give cracked.

190
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.820
So Eddie Bravo.
That's it for now.
For,
for,
for alcohol.
That's it.
That's it.

191
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.260
That's it.
That's it.
I think that's a good move,
man.
I'm happy for you.

192
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.620
Thank you.
It was doing nothing for him.
Then what prompted you,

193
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.140
if you don't mind me asking,
was there something that prompted,
it was just like,

194
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.820
oh no explaining.
Just found myself going every night.

195
00:11:52.821 --> 00:11:53.980
The same thing.
I get home

196
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v 4>after training and I'll have a glass of wine and watch some Netflix and there's</v>

197
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:01.600
been a lot of great shows lately,

198
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.330
so I've been finding myself drinking like three,
four times a week.
And um,

199
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.490
then,
you know,
I go to the airport and I'm bored.

200
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:13.390
I'll have a couple of glasses of wine and then it just,
just one day I thought,

201
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.040
man,
I'm turning into an alcoholic over here.
What's going on?
I was,

202
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.440
I was drinking because I was bored,

203
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.600
so I thought too old for that shit man.
You know what I mean?

204
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.020
It's just bad for your body man.
It's just,
yeah,
there's no need for it.

205
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.980
<v 0>I like a glass of wine with a meal,</v>

206
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.130
but every time I've gotten drunk,

207
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.540
the next day I've just been disappointed with myself.
Oh Shit.

208
00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:41.720
Brian counts your ladies and gentlemen with wine and cheese,

209
00:12:41.721 --> 00:12:44.150
like some sort of a party.
How you doing man?
I know Jimmy.

210
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.360
Jimmy Smith just met.
Very nice to meet first time La la La.

211
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.090
Do we need a wine bottle opener here?

212
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.580
Oh eight he doesn't drink anymore and I don't drink any.

213
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.130
This only half done this side of the table doesn't drink.

214
00:12:58.131 --> 00:13:01.100
We just got to watch you get hammered drunk.
Ever handle red wine anymore?

215
00:13:01.101 --> 00:13:03.740
I'm getting older,
but I got some good red wine.
Jesus Christ.

216
00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:06.350
Everybody's complaining about getting older,
not being able to handle boots.

217
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.200
We're watching Darren Elkins and Michael Johnson here.

218
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.120
It's in the first round and so far Michael Johnson's looks smooth as butter.

219
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.720
255 pounds.
Bam.
That left hand's finding a home.
Oh look,

220
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.380
it's taken on the chin though.
Elkins still in it now once again,

221
00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:26.330
this is one of those may be ABC.
It's ten eight non ABC probably go ten nine.

222
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.450
They haven't adopted new rules.
Do you think that would be ten eight though?

223
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.140
It could be.
I'm thinking,
I'm not saying it is.

224
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.470
I'm saying with the new rules that they're just a lot more common man.
It's,

225
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.170
I think the actual rule in please someone out there.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Uh,

226
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:39.801
if someone,

227
00:13:39.801 --> 00:13:44.000
clearly if they went to aspects of the fight who he just hit him with another

228
00:13:44.001 --> 00:13:48.260
left him and he's certainly landing the significant strikes and he's the

229
00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:49.041
aggressor.
Yeah.

230
00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:52.970
So you could certainly has a clear advantage and I would like to see rounds like

231
00:13:52.971 --> 00:13:55.880
that.
But Jimmy,
I think we need a better score system.

232
00:13:55.881 --> 00:14:00.590
I think the 10 point system from boxing is goofy.
I just don't think we need it.

233
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.830
I think we need like a hundred point score system that takes into account

234
00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:07.940
submission attempts,
take down attempts,
defense takes that into account,

235
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:12.380
leg kicks,
knees,
elbows,
punches,
all those things quantified.

236
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.490
The impact of those techniques,
how hard they're hitting,
how close to choke is,

237
00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:19.280
how close the arm bar is,
how good the defense is.

238
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.270
You know like all those things should be taken into consideration and I think we

239
00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:24.590
should have more than three judges.

240
00:14:24.591 --> 00:14:28.220
I think you have a three judges is fucking foolishness.
Why three people?

241
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.300
I think there you have way more of a likelihood of having some bullshit decision

242
00:14:32.301 --> 00:14:33.380
if there's only three people.

243
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.150
I think if you have 20 experts like or people online little cheese,

244
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.630
what cheese buddy?
Got to keep talking.
I'm listening.
20 experts.

245
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.830
Maybe you know how many,

246
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:47.450
maybe even open up to people online like have a select few people wisdom of the

247
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:50.710
crowd.
How about a problem that you really respect?
How bout knockout

248
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.830
<v 5>only MMA,
right?
A lot of people die.</v>

249
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.790
There's no points,
no points,
no judges.

250
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.500
And if it goes the distance and there's still not a knock out,
they get each,

251
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.150
they get a cold,
cocky,
try the back and forth until someone gets mad.

252
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:11.010
Rabo wants us to go back to ancient Rome,
basically cold cock,
like a slack,

253
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.880
a soccer match.
I always felt like he's crazy.
That free kick at the end of it.

254
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.250
It's hard to get.
How cool would that be?
Knock out,

255
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.220
only come on and be so ridiculous.
Watch it,
wouldn't you?
Yeah.

256
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:27.221
I would watch to see in that game in Afghanistan where they hold back on teams

257
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.690
and they've essentially have a goat,

258
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.310
a dead goat and the this side and they played with whips and the side that can

259
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:38.870
get the goat into the goal is the winner.
Wins,
gets to take down.

260
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.620
The horses die in that game.
Oh,
and goats.
I'm sure.

261
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.420
Plenty of goats as well.
Dead.
Wow.
Elkins.
With the take down here,

262
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.910
this changes things.
We're going back to this goat thing way we're going,

263
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.150
I know this is the exciting part,
but I want it was Darren till it first.

264
00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.440
Oh,
Hammer fist by Elkins here.
Yeah.
He goes,
come on quick.
Dylan.

265
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.660
Who Elkins does all right.
First,

266
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.070
how can I watch fight in the UFC forever and you get to compare him to till till

267
00:16:06.071 --> 00:16:10.120
I got here.
I'm saying it's fake.
It's like Brian.
Yeah.
How dare you?
I don't know

268
00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:16.040
Darren till Tila fucking fight.
Jesus Christ.
He's scary.

269
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.290
He is geared was just walking a cowboy fan.
I was just watching it.

270
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:25.160
Do you know Vinny shoreman a lot this week.
Oh,
I'm sure he like,
you know,

271
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:27.650
I watch UFC all the time,
but there's a huge,

272
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:30.590
and you're watching fights and studying fights and I had been studying.

273
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.980
That's what I'm supposed to do basically all night tonight I'm here.

274
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.620
I was thinking when I knew that you got the Gig,
I was like,

275
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.650
like if I had a call bell tour I'd be fucked.
Yeah.
Like I,
I just,

276
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.380
there's too many people.
I don't know who the fuck.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jimmy,

277
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:47.730
you want a little manchego cheese?
I would love some cheeses.

278
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.510
That's fantastically cheese when he won't drink your fucking,
I'll have cheese.

279
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.930
It looks like he's in shape.
I'll tell you that much.
Which one?
Elkins or no,

280
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.710
I'm talking about Jimmy Hill.
His shape.
Kids got some arms on him.

281
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:03.150
He's a Jujitsu black person has a plan for real black belch.
Poor,
Huh?
Yeah.

282
00:17:03.151 --> 00:17:05.910
I went back to training this week.
Really?
For the first time.
Crucifix.

283
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.290
Look at this mounted crucifix for Elkins.
Oh,
okay.

284
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.940
<v 6>Look at this.
Elkins gets the back.
Three minutes to go.</v>

285
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.840
<v 5>Oh Shit.
Oh Shit.</v>

286
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.960
Magic Elkins spoils the big hundred 45 pound party from Michael Johnson would

287
00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:24.280
not be the first time.
It would not be the first time.

288
00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:27.100
You can't fucking sleep on this guy's such an animal.

289
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.270
He has a better body though,
so,
oh dammit.

290
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:36.260
<v 6>Oh Shit.
Huh?
How'd that happen?
Oh Shit.</v>

291
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.370
Go to sleep.
Oh Wow.

292
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.270
Fucking savage.
God Damn.
That dude's a savage.
Took the punches and came back,

293
00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:50.700
man.
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.

294
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.860
<v 7>Daren.
Darrin Elkins is fucking savage.</v>

295
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.680
Whew.
He got teed off on in the first one.
I didn't want to come back.

296
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:07.410
Yeah.
Bryan,
you,
you missed the the teen off part.
This finish so extraordinary.

297
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.850
It's area can't count this guy out.

298
00:18:11.851 --> 00:18:16.680
He's just such a fucking mutant.
He's such an animal.

299
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.510
Look at this.
Takes the back.
How I was like,
oh I didn't want to get too excited.

300
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.170
I was like,
yeah he got his back but I don't want to get too excited here.

301
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.450
Is this going to get crazy?

302
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.500
That was a high level move cause some people would have jumped on the back and

303
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.020
kind of just volunteer to it.
Like a be a backpack.
Yeah.

304
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.570
But he pulled them back.
That's it.
That's a high level move right there.

305
00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:44.040
What do you mean?
Oh he didn't jump on him.
He pulled you into his hips.
Wow.

306
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.490
Yeah.
Cause you just to get too high because people,

307
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.110
sometimes people when they jump on the back,

308
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.370
they want to be on the back but on top and they're trying to force being on the

309
00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:57.570
back on top.

310
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.710
But it's way easier just to pull them back and you're on their back.

311
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:03.570
But you're on your back as well.

312
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.170
Some people feel uncomfortable there cause if they spin now they're on your

313
00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:10.110
guard.
But if you have a high level rear naked choke,

314
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.720
you just take the easy route,

315
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.340
pull them back and just finish him off your back finishing.

316
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.870
Very hard thing to defend against.

317
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:18.990
Cause I see a lot of guys who would defend for a long time look at the hips if

318
00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.990
they show it again when he had his hips all the way in and when I was,

319
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.110
that stretches your core out.
And so it's interesting.

320
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.090
You also can't,

321
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.700
you can't curl up and protect your neck and you had the bottom triangle on the

322
00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:31.530
wrong side.
He had the body triangle on the bottom.

323
00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:33.420
He's still schools she could hold.
Can he keep it?

324
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.610
It works for some people don't need a switch it.
Yeah.

325
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.100
Some people can really hold that thing.

326
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.180
Well I think for him it was just like he had it,
he's arching his back.

327
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:46.170
He had it locked in.
He wasn't going to give up that spot and try to switch legs.

328
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.640
Fuck,
that's amazing.

329
00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:51.920
Guys are getting really good at spinning inside of body triangles.
There's,

330
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.070
there's,
there's technique to that really.
Yup.
Yup.
What do you do?

331
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.523
Um,

332
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.150
if you can get there choking arm on the other side,
like in a baseball grip,

333
00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.290
like I got your left arm on the right side and which side is the body triangle

334
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:08.220
on?
It doesn't matter.

335
00:20:08.221 --> 00:20:11.910
Now you just got to really focus on putting your shoulders on the mat and you're

336
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:16.640
controlling his arm.
Okay.
And then you slowly inch by inch you turn your hips and

337
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.520
he's still as the body triangle on,

338
00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:24.000
but inch by inch you're holding the wrist and you're turning around boom.

339
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:29.010
And then one big explosion and you're in the guard to holding the two on one on

340
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:33.360
the arm,
the choking arms big.
Yes.
That's huge.

341
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.680
That's huge.
And otherwise he's going to be all over your neck.
When you do that,

342
00:20:37.681 --> 00:20:41.220
you freeze them to somebody who was going to come up with a technique to beat

343
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:43.860
that or to try to mitigate that.
Well,

344
00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:47.950
the technique really and not letting it happen in the first place

345
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.850
<v 4>because in the very beginning,
in the very beginning of 10th planet,</v>

346
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.880
like right away I was so into body triangles and doing dsfs I wouldn't,

347
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.360
it's,
it's uh,
just a neck crank.
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah.

348
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.400
But uh,
but calm,
deep south.
But when,

349
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.590
anytime I would put on a body triangle,

350
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.440
I wouldn't even think about a rear naked choke anymore.
I was like,

351
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.440
that's too hard.
I'm just going to get on my side,

352
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:19.150
puts you on your side and just connect my hands around your head somehow anyway.

353
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.740
And then I fall forward and I crush it.
The [inaudible] old move on.

354
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.450
Remember beast.
Yes.
Peace.
Never rear naked choke anybody.

355
00:21:28.451 --> 00:21:31.990
He'd always get to the back,
put a body triangle on and go d sab on him.

356
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.120
He didn't even know how to do a rear naked choke.
He had,

357
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.860
he had gaping holes in his game anyways.
Anyways.
Um,

358
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.120
what ended up happening was we were all about by triangles in the beginning and

359
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.080
there were so dangerous.
Like if someone put a body trying on me,
I know I'm done.

360
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:55.150
If,
what if all you think about as a neck crank instead of the rear naked choke,

361
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:59.650
you just focus on the DSM.
You don't need a rear naked choke.
It's,
it's Dunsky.

362
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.870
So in the very beginning,

363
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.120
the first defensive move when someone takes your back is,

364
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.030
oh it was always,
don't let them put the Goddamn body triangle on.

365
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.390
That was the first move.
That's everybody's first move.

366
00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:15.820
Don't let it get if he's got one,
if he's got your back,

367
00:22:15.821 --> 00:22:18.790
don't let him get the hook.
So he has one hook.
Don't let them get two hooks.

368
00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.060
That'd be puts both hooks.
You Bet.
And I let them put a body triangle in

369
00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.120
your nest.
Of course,
of course.
But there's things you do.
Like what?
What,

370
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.730
which ended up doing is as soon as someone takes your back,

371
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.550
you put him in like a reverse quarter guard,
you,

372
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.000
you trap one of his legs and you'd escape from that.

373
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.620
That way there's no body triangle ever going to happen.
So if that is the,

374
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.130
your first move,

375
00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.400
it's in your DNA where someone takes you back and you take his leg out the mix.

376
00:22:46.401 --> 00:22:48.910
Cause you're already worried about that body triangle.

377
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.440
Then the body trying was become very hard to get really,
really hard.

378
00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:55.870
So when the guy who's back has been taken,

379
00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.340
if that is his focus on stopping that,
it's very hard to put it in.

380
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:04.420
So what ended up happening for 10 planet is we went away from the body triangles

381
00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:09.390
cause I saw the damn,
I'm not going to focus all this time on the dsfs when um,

382
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.070
there's going to,
most of the time we're not even getting the body triangle.

383
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.580
So we got to focus on a rear naked chokes with just the leg hooks and just like

384
00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:16.450
Marcella Garcia.

385
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:21.190
So we shifted away from the body triangle and I wanted everyone to focus on just

386
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:25.000
good old fashioned traditional rear naked choke with both hooks in and get re

387
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.840
really good from there.
And the body trying on the [inaudible] that's like extra,

388
00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:29.800
don't rely on it.

389
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:34.810
But what ended up happening is everyone's defensive first defensive move.

390
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.860
Um,
didn't,
it wasn't attack,

391
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.820
put up a tack one of uh,
his legs and put it in reverse quarter garden.

392
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.980
We went away from that because that was the,
wasn't

393
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.380
<v 1>there anymore.
Do you follow me on my losing?
You know,</v>

394
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:49.520
I understand what you're saying.
So niche,

395
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:52.700
that just shows how complex Jujitsu is and you're constantly having to make

396
00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:57.701
these adjustments and [inaudible] we're going way back because of Ebi overtime,

397
00:23:58.191 --> 00:24:01.310
but we start guys on their back and are shootout over time round.

398
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:06.440
The game has grown so much just from getting good at those rounds.

399
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.640
Just spending a lot of time at dissecting the authentic,

400
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.330
the arm bar position and the rear naked choke the,

401
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.310
did you considered any other positions that you would allow people to do other

402
00:24:16.311 --> 00:24:20.540
than those two?
Those two are good enough.
That event people would,
will suggest,

403
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:22.370
why don't you go have a Mt.

404
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:26.250
One or just nice and super crazy basic.

405
00:24:26.251 --> 00:24:27.770
Something that everyone could agree on.

406
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.030
If you're going to have a shootout in Jujitsu,
it's gotta be naked Choker Armbar.

407
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.480
That's it.
Yeah.
In other words,
you can't start there.

408
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.430
You start there so much back and over time and over time.

409
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.770
You know what spider web is like.
You get a guy in [inaudible] position,

410
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.920
you hook one of the arms and he's defending.
Okay guys defending it.

411
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.710
But you have the arm bar and he's going to start from there.

412
00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.000
You got rid of him hooked and the back is,

413
00:24:56.001 --> 00:24:59.390
we start with a seatbelt in with two leg hooks and you're sitting on your
button.

414
00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:04.010
We start right there and go,
ready,
go.
Have you seen combat Jujitsu?
No.
Dude,

415
00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:07.280
Eddie Bravo came up with the greatest idea of all time combat Jujitsu.

416
00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:10.310
It's regular Jujitsu,
but you get to smack the shit out of each other.

417
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.570
So they're open palm start like it's similar,
but it's only on the ground.

418
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.240
It's only when it goes to the ground.
So on the ground,

419
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.560
well a Wagner roadshow,
right?
Was that neurogenesis?

420
00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.470
The first guy to stop a guy that way?

421
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:28.510
Tkl and Jujitsu and he's using his palms like boss route and use doing pancreas.

422
00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:33.770
Just fucking dropping them down,
slamming him home.
Wow.
Yeah.
And it opens up,

423
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.670
it makes Jujitsu more realistic because there's certain positions that you are

424
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:40.130
so exposed and if the guy smacks you in the head,

425
00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:41.930
it smacks you in the nose and smacks you in the eyes.

426
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:43.720
You're just not going to stay in that spot or you can.

427
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.100
There's got to be guys that are training smacks.

428
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.540
They're going to get really good at it.

429
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.520
Guys are going to be able to take guys out.
What smart.

430
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:54.070
<v 4>Yeah.
Most of them,
99.9% of the guys that are down for combat.
You did.</v>

431
00:25:54.071 --> 00:25:57.570
So I got a long list of people wanted to,
all of them have MMA experience.

432
00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:03.870
Only one guy.
Only one Guy Bennati one of my brown belts.

433
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.610
He,
he's the only dude who never even thought of MMA.

434
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.630
Never even thought of it.

435
00:26:09.631 --> 00:26:14.340
And he wanted to do because his guard is probably top three in the world.

436
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:15.203
I've never seen anything.

437
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:19.740
We talked about him last podcast with the Hindu Lo tiene Benetti,
you know,
so,

438
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.290
um,
he's the only one and he got,

439
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.790
he went against Wilson Hayes who had in combat Jujitsu.

440
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.640
He's automatically rank number one.
Right.
You know what I mean?
Legit black belt

441
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:37.220
<v 1>fought Demetrius Johnson,
possibly the greatest fighter ever.</v>

442
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.330
You know what I mean?
Now he's,

443
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.530
he was in combat Jiu Jitsu and he went against Ben ended though because I

444
00:26:42.531 --> 00:26:44.010
watched the,
in

445
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.880
<v 5>Austin,
I was one of the color guys,
you know,</v>

446
00:26:45.881 --> 00:26:48.290
it was fun and I didn't know what I was looking at it as much,
but you know,

447
00:26:48.291 --> 00:26:50.940
obviously because I don't know enough about it,
it was on it invitation.

448
00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:54.960
It was so incredible because I watch those guys and I'm telling you from my

449
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.800
untrained eye,

450
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.560
I couldn't even see when they were tapping the dude's like they were doing

451
00:26:58.561 --> 00:27:01.700
things.
It didn't,
it looked like he was doing nothing.
And I was like,

452
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.630
what happened?
What do you get them on?
I didn't know what a tap modern,

453
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.600
I couldn't figure it out and then,
but,

454
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.690
but the one thing I noticed that pure Jujitsu practitioners,

455
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:13.080
those competition guys who are amazing,
they can do things there.

456
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:17.730
They there because there's zero striking.
It's true that you get an,

457
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.220
you get in very bad habits.
Have you ever tried to get into an MMA fight?
Well,

458
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.380
you see that a lot of times you used to see that more often with leg locks,

459
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:25.710
right?

460
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.460
Guys go for leg locks and they'd be in a weird position and they'd get smashed

461
00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:33.300
go,
uh,
old school,
Ian Freeman and Frank Mir.
Remember that?

462
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.520
That was like one of the first times that happened.
Tim Silvia Cafe Dante was,

463
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.553
there was another one

464
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:46.230
whose deeper,
which one was,
which one is deeper there.
They might be the same,

465
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.080
same historical,
same historical genre,
but it was,

466
00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:52.500
it was a less popular fight much Les Paul,
I love capital.
Why aren't,

467
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.300
why aren't so,
so,
um,
leg locks are not used as much because you are,

468
00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:58.750
you can get punched in the face.
No,

469
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.530
it's almost always giving up position to get a leg lock are almost always

470
00:28:01.531 --> 00:28:02.630
sitting back.
Okay.

471
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.310
To get a leg so I can sit up and punch your head through the ground.
It's also,

472
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:11.280
you're always,
you're committing your legs and two arms usually to elect,

473
00:28:11.281 --> 00:28:14.460
defend yourself.
Guys are just punching you in the face while you're doing that.

474
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.600
And then Ian Freeman fight.
Ian Freeman,
uh,

475
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.570
was locked up in a heel hook and frank mir was cranking on his heel and Ian just

476
00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:25.010
steps in and just starts crying,
get him off his job.

477
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.910
Hanson Romina Sato is a great one too.

478
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:34.650
Yeah,
that was an amazing one.
Holy Shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's been a gang of,

479
00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:39.510
those were guys we're over committed.
Yeah.
And we had to learn,
I mean,
the risky,

480
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.350
risky,
yeah.

481
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.880
<v 4>But the,</v>

482
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:47.330
the state of the leg lock game these days is way different than those guys that

483
00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:52.650
were trying to pull off leg locks back then.
Even Romina Sato even that level,

484
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.170
he was considered one of the best leg lockers back then.

485
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.940
But the level today and leg locks is way beyond that.
It's,
yeah,

486
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:04.710
it's way beyond what the guys at a DDS have done.
I mean,

487
00:29:04.711 --> 00:29:08.190
they've taken the leg lock game.
I mean it's,
it's beyond sambo

488
00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:12.740
<v 5>DDS be catch wrestling.
Donna,
her death squad,
Don John,</v>

489
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:17.550
John Danaher.
He'll be here.
John will be here tomorrow at 8:00 AM.
Oh,
he will?

490
00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:20.010
Yeah.
We're doing a podcast early.
Did you have you?

491
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.240
I was talking to chill about the last Abu Dhabi and he told me a story.

492
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:28.410
I was laughing my ass off.
He said they did the rules meeting and they said,

493
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.510
well we're not from anybody,
so no controversies.

494
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:35.190
You want three distinct taps and every goes,

495
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.990
I need to walk out of here.
You don't like what we're talking about.

496
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:42.070
You don't have time to do this.
That is,
he'll

497
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:47.030
<v 7>hook.
Even even three of these,
your ACL,</v>

498
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.250
everybody looked at each other like we're all agreeing to not do that.

499
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:55.600
Like all the people were like,
okay,
if I tap,
let me go dude,
fuck this rule.
Shit.

500
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:56.560
Let me go.

501
00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.860
And Yeah and Charles like I got caught and I just went and the guy let me go.

502
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.360
But like he goes,

503
00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:04.180
cause it can just destroy your need for why everything in your knee will go

504
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:09.560
everything cause just,
Ooh,
it's so bad,
so bad.

505
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.400
I've seen a horrible shit.

506
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.290
I've seen dudes get their shoulders wrecked with Camorra's.
Yeah,
that's true too.

507
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.550
Yeah.
No,
it's all true.
It's all true.
True.

508
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.500
But I'm saying I know where you're coming from with the leg lock thing.

509
00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:27.370
People have gotten
lots of wow man,

510
00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:29.860
he was not as common as you barely whoa.

511
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:35.260
Well you know though,
it's good to see him out of the wheelchair is recovering.

512
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.970
I don't,
ah,
he,
he got hit by a train man,
which is crazy.

513
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:44.080
I mean most people would be dead.
It makes me want to cry.
Fuck,

514
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.180
fuck.
Wow.

515
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.620
It's great that he's him going,
fuck,

516
00:30:50.621 --> 00:30:52.420
look at a walking that's just going to come back

517
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.670
<v 0>warrior together.
And the last thing he said to me,</v>

518
00:30:55.671 --> 00:31:00.170
we had a scene together and uh,
it was this,
a week later he got hit.
He said,
um,

519
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.490
he goes,
I hope I can put my shoes on when I'm older.
I fucking waste.

520
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.400
Oh yeah man,

521
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.600
it's good to see him and Dana hugging it out.
A lot of guys,

522
00:31:11.601 --> 00:31:13.490
a lot of guys think that was,
he was worried about,

523
00:31:13.491 --> 00:31:16.160
he was talking about head trauma.
He said he worries about it,
you know,

524
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:18.620
and then he gets hit by a train of,
Oh,
you should man,

525
00:31:18.621 --> 00:31:20.030
everybody should fucking worry about it.

526
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.910
I mean it's something that has to be taken in consideration.

527
00:31:22.911 --> 00:31:26.630
I mean it is what it is.
Yeah.
But fuck yeah,

528
00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.470
he's a good guy.
He is good.

529
00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.670
He's a very good guy and a one the most important figures in the history of

530
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.350
sport.
When you break down what he was,

531
00:31:36.351 --> 00:31:40.250
he represented like a powerful wrestler that embrace submissions whenever we

532
00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:44.180
call it that far side arm bar and George St Pierre,
he was one of the first guys.

533
00:31:44.181 --> 00:31:48.080
It was like a real strong wrestler that had very high level submission skills.

534
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.940
He was a huge leap in the sport.
Yeah.

535
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:53.690
<v 7>Yeah.
I mean he beat hoists.
Gracie on the ground.
I took this dash.</v>

536
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:54.563
He was one of the first

537
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:59.450
<v 0>like,
like top level athletes,
you know what I mean?
Like a stud athlete.
Yeah.</v>

538
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.300
I had,
there were a lot of the guys for it that way.
Well,

539
00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.850
I'm glad he's okay and it's nice to see him walking around getting man.

540
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.740
All right,
so we're going to go to [inaudible] in a meal Mech.

541
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.780
I love this fight too.
Nobody wants to fight Huseman nobody.
He said,

542
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.690
everybody's running from that dude.
That guy is a smashing machine.

543
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.360
I mean he is a fucking tank of a human being.

544
00:32:19.361 --> 00:32:22.600
But this a meal met guy talk about um,
leg locks.

545
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.620
He got his way into the UFC by knocking out Tokyo.
He uh,

546
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.670
he smashed him and some other organization.
He fighting the fall holiday.
Yeah,

547
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:34.420
that's a mailman.
Amil Mac is a,
the the crazy viking guy.

548
00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.840
He's a star fucking animal.
His,
he's so shredded.
It's stupid.

549
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:42.320
But Kamara Uzman top of the food chain wrestler,
Super Athlete,

550
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.130
just a tank of a man who everybody's running from just running from,

551
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.790
nobody wants a piece of him.
When you talk about like top 10 guys,

552
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.570
he's the guy that nobody's mentioning.
There's,

553
00:32:51.571 --> 00:32:55.430
there's a special thing I think in MMA combat sports period is there are guys

554
00:32:55.431 --> 00:33:00.130
who are great and then there are guys who are frightening when we're nobody in.

555
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.130
Another good example is,

556
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:04.430
is Tokyo yours rather than when he was a fringe top 10 guy or you know,

557
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:06.920
eight people were like,
I don't want anything to do with that dude.

558
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.740
I don't want to be anywhere near like I'd rather have,

559
00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.250
I'd rather have a GSP who's better but won't hurt me,

560
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:16.040
like to Kenya will rip your leg in half and just have no idea what he's doing.

561
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.700
Man,
I feel like scary dude.
He did some bad things in the EOC,

562
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:20.780
definitely held on submissions,

563
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.000
but I feel like he got a bad deal when he got fired.

564
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.970
When he got kicked out of the UFC.
The submission that he held,

565
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.200
I watched it and I say that was not egregious and that was a normal thing for

566
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:34.050
anybody else.
Yeah,
it certainly wasn't,
certainly wasn't his worst.
It's just,

567
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.620
it was like the fourth time that they had said,
hey,
don't,

568
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.440
the other ones were horrible.
Other ones were worse,
but it was just,

569
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:40.274
it was a straw.

570
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.530
To me it was scheels fight was like fucking crazy and I thought the refereeing

571
00:33:44.531 --> 00:33:46.520
and that was terrible.
Crazy.

572
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.280
That was in world series of fighting out in his eyes.

573
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:54.770
He was literally in his eyes and show respect for him.
When Yan shields look,

574
00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.480
the wrapping was like duty keeps gouging.
Mine is I afterwards,

575
00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:01.220
I think I would've been a crazy amount of what you have to then he held onto the

576
00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:04.670
Camorra.
It's tough.
It's tough to under.
Yeah.
And then Jake,

577
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:07.880
Jake hit him after he went to Kamora cause he wouldn't let go of the Camorra.

578
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:11.510
But if you go back,
and I mean I'm not giving the guy in excuse,

579
00:34:11.511 --> 00:34:15.140
but you want to find out about his childhood.
His childhood was horrific.

580
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.360
He was working on a farm when he was like a little boy.

581
00:34:18.361 --> 00:34:22.460
He has a giant scar in his chest because he got slashed open and they just tried

582
00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:26.180
to like tape it up on,
glue it together.
They never brought him to the hospital.

583
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.781
I mean,

584
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:31.781
he would literally would eat pig slop like you had no food and just worked on a

585
00:34:31.911 --> 00:34:34.550
farm.
It was,
you know,
and then as he got older,

586
00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.870
made his way into Rio and then found Minataro school and started learning

587
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:43.871
Jujitsu and just a tank from far more from being a boy having to work.

588
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.190
And he's a fighter and God,
no,
he's this,
he's scared as well as scary.

589
00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:49.820
You know what I'm saying?

590
00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.180
I mean a kid that's grown up in that horrific environment like that,

591
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.910
who knows what kind of,
who knows who you see suffered and all that stuff,

592
00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:02.550
but definitely was in danger and fearful from the time he was very young and it

593
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.480
was in a position where he was struggling for his life,

594
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:09.500
like for survival in a way that week because we don't understand.

595
00:35:09.501 --> 00:35:12.310
We don't understand what's so soft.
He might have,
no,

596
00:35:12.311 --> 00:35:15.080
he obviously probably as impulse control,
all kinds of issues.

597
00:35:15.081 --> 00:35:16.580
It's an animal and a lot of ways,

598
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.130
but like if you look at the Avalon fight that he had it and Abu Dhabi where

599
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:21.620
they're rolling out and he's holding on to a heal hook.
Oh,
it was horrible.

600
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:26.150
Like the ref stop,
stop,
stop,
and he won't stop.
Yeah.
And Avalanche freaking out.

601
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.340
But then there's also that terrible situation when they restarted them with heal

602
00:35:29.341 --> 00:35:33.440
him and it was done.
But you never can do,
you can't,

603
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.130
particularly with heel hooks.
No,
you cannot say ready,
set,
go.

604
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.190
Because you got to assume

605
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.980
<v 7>that the guy's securing that in the middle of a scramble.
You gotta be in motion.</v>

606
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.550
There's also,
you can't just start him because he's going to rip it.

607
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:48.540
But the thing was about the,
the mental state is,
you know,

608
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:53.630
they stop and Evelyn is furious because he wouldn't let go of this heel hook and

609
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:58.110
like Tokyo is trying to like hug it out and they're trying to explain to him,
no,

610
00:35:58.111 --> 00:35:59.550
no,
you were supposed to let go.

611
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:02.730
And it was almost like he didn't quite get what was going,
I took a lot.

612
00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:06.150
If you watch that took a while for them to explain it to him,
like,
you know,

613
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:09.870
you can send to the frenzy of,
it may be,
I don't know.
I don't know dude.

614
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:13.590
You could also make the argument that he's playing dumb.
I don't know.

615
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.220
I don't know the guy.
I don't mean,
but if I,
if that was my student that was,

616
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:18.780
he was tearing apart like that,
I would,

617
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.790
I would say this guy's fucking playing dumb.

618
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.480
He knows he's not supposed to rip your leg apart like that.
That,
that ref though.

619
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.890
What's his name?
Uh,
with the Jake Shell's pipe.
You see him,
you're watching him.

620
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.690
It was a Steve Mazzagatti fight if I don't remember.

621
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.480
I don't think it was mom's got it.

622
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.290
Like you don't see him taking into his eyes like that.

623
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.670
You're a raft and you'd host of his eyes were all red and it was crazy.

624
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.820
Oh that was awful.
I'm never critical but that,
that,

625
00:36:41.821 --> 00:36:44.540
that there's just no excuse for that.
That was awful.
That was awful.

626
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:48.810
He did a seminar cause he's top team and I was top team in long beach from

627
00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:52.060
Carlson,
Gracie and everything.
And my coach calls me and he says,
um,

628
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.020
I wasn't in town at the time.
He goes,
oh it's all keeners doing a seminar.

629
00:36:55.021 --> 00:36:56.910
It should come back for this leg lock seminar or whatever.

630
00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:00.780
And I remember thinking I'd want to learn the leg locks.

631
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.390
I don't know if I get on the mat with that dude.

632
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.020
Like I want him to show me stuff.
But if he's like I'm a demonstrate come here,

633
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:07.380
I'd be like,

634
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:12.090
I don't know if I'm bringing with them old school Gracie bubba dummies.

635
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.030
Yeah.
He would bring gummy and go show me on that guy.

636
00:37:15.031 --> 00:37:19.380
Cause it's different though when it,
when it's just a straight grappling match.

637
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.460
Yeah.
Come on.
You're not trying to,
no one's trying to break anybody's bones here,

638
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.480
but it's a little bit different.
And then the May,

639
00:37:27.481 --> 00:37:29.790
when your opponent has no problem,

640
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:33.600
tried to put his fist through your stove or your skull fight.

641
00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.040
He w he would love it if he kicked you right in the head and broke your fucking

642
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:41.730
orbital.
Yeah,
she would love it and no one would ever talk shit on him.

643
00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.710
But at the crank,
a heal hook and you'd tear,
they're tending a little bit,

644
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:50.070
you know,
then you're the fucking bad guy.
But it's also,

645
00:37:50.071 --> 00:37:53.660
he doesn't stop when you're,
when,
when the guy's tapping,

646
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:54.680
you know what I'm saying?
They stopped.

647
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.290
They have to respect the time you're trying to break my skull.

648
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.920
I'm trying to break your tongue or what's the difference?
But the guys,
but,

649
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.840
but once again,
the guys who hit the ground,

650
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:06.660
the refs to stop and they're still trying to hit her to that guy,
that guy.

651
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:07.470
It's the same thing.

652
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.020
You got to stop punching with the referee gets in your what period.
Yeah.

653
00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:14.500
But what about,
what about in situations like Dan Henderson and bill and a

654
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.800
fighter's know when a guy's fucking done?
Yep.

655
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:24.690
He hit Bisbing so hard for sure.
Dan Henderson knew he was done,

656
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:29.190
but the rep was like 10 yards away.
So Dan innocent.
He was like,
damn,

657
00:38:29.191 --> 00:38:34.170
I got a free shot.
Check this out.
Boom.
It makes highlight reels.
That's okay.

658
00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.140
It's okay.
It all like

659
00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.260
<v 5>I put them in the same category.
Exactly.</v>

660
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:40.870
If you don't get no respect that the stop of the fight,
it's bad.

661
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.410
Just a little tendon

662
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:47.930
as much as you get seven.

663
00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.710
Does this make you feel uncomfortable about your own body when you watch these

664
00:38:50.711 --> 00:38:51.260
guys?

665
00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.800
Cause they basically weigh what you weigh or they wait in no way.

666
00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.810
What you want to reason.
I'll never ultimately be happy.
That's,

667
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.310
that's cause you're not built like that.
That's exactly right.

668
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.950
And I would never wear clothes.
I would always be in shorts.

669
00:39:06.951 --> 00:39:09.960
Like that would have like a hoodie opened up all the way.
Right.

670
00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.340
Walked on the beach with no shirt.

671
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:16.350
Ain't be that guy 100% you'd have a book in his back pocket that was all dog

672
00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:19.600
yeared but he really never read it.
That's true.
I that was,

673
00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.900
that's what was my round.
Jack went to help you know what to help you.

674
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:27.220
You don't want to help you in these moments and you'll appreciate this.

675
00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.910
Cause we were talking about Bobby Fischer last time.
That same documentary.
Yes.

676
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.470
Bobby Fischer against the world.
You'd have to watch.

677
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:35.020
But remember when the guy says,

678
00:39:35.021 --> 00:39:38.560
imagine a whole of the things you did as a kid after school and before school

679
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.410
and imagine all of that is filled up with cest study and that's all you did.

680
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.990
So you can complain.
You're not that guy,

681
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.600
but you're sitting here drinking wine and cheese.
That dude's in the gym.

682
00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:47.071
You are correct.

683
00:39:47.071 --> 00:39:51.550
Like all the stuff I do that doesn't have anything to do with getting yoked.

684
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:54.910
I get to do all that stuff.
That's the,
I mean that's all.

685
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.130
And why aren't I as good at grappling six and Gracie,

686
00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:02.140
think of all you did while Hixon Gracie was on a mat and just training.

687
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.460
You were doing other stuff.

688
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:08.050
That's what I like about [inaudible] is one of my all time favorite grappling

689
00:40:08.051 --> 00:40:11.590
characters.
Not just cause he's the all time greatest legacy but also because he

690
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:14.920
incorporated yoga.
He was so outside the box.

691
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:19.180
He is doing what a lot of Jujitsu guys are doing now.
Incorporating Yoga,

692
00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:22.840
MMA guys incorporate nutrition to every night when I want to choke together.

693
00:40:22.841 --> 00:40:25.510
I think,
yeah,
the first time tough aren't going way back.

694
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:28.960
We wanted to do push ups.
Look at this,
jump around,
look at this,

695
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:33.100
looking at each other.
These guys are these guys.
Who's the last guy?

696
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:38.410
Meek fought.
Uh,
that's a good question.
That guy,
I think you pronounce it Mac.

697
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:43.030
I think it's a meal.
Yeah,
he's a,
he is hanging straight up viking.

698
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.650
100% and you've got a west African warrior over here.
Ooh,

699
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.300
from Nigeria.
You got.

700
00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:53.520
What's going to be interesting is if mek can stuff that takedown.
Ken,

701
00:40:53.521 --> 00:40:55.990
he stuff to take down.
Came out drunken monkey for a second.

702
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.640
It came out nice and low.
Now

703
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:06.310
got the neck.
Oh Shit.
Handful dark and full guard.
Oh Shit.
Oh.

704
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.920
Comoro.
Well,
that's not good is it guys?

705
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:11.320
Well now just the crush on his right side.
How much,

706
00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:13.090
how much does he burned himself out here?

707
00:41:13.091 --> 00:41:18.091
Does he go for it or does he let it go and this beast is on top of him dropping

708
00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:22.750
elbows.
Not Okay here.
Well,
the harder to finish.

709
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:26.380
That's how his arm into [inaudible] and it's a lot hard to finish it right now.

710
00:41:26.381 --> 00:41:28.390
I would say he's fine.
He doesn't have it by now.
Yeah.

711
00:41:28.391 --> 00:41:31.140
It's trying to put all his weight on his right side.
Okay.
It all depends on his,

712
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.220
his left side.
I

713
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.690
<v 0>don't know how good it squeezes.
Oh,</v>

714
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:39.680
he's tightened down because he's got the wrong card.
This is a great position.

715
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.860
This is it.
Yes,
it's great.
You know how to finish it.
He's deep.

716
00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:46.070
He's under that Chin,
man.
I don't look good.
That's not good.
Oh,

717
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:50.360
he's way lighter now.
Way Lighter.
Look at all that air.
See all that air.
Yeah.

718
00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:51.880
And just keeps going.
It gets given up on it.

719
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.550
He's popping out right now and a meal's going to try to step up.
Oh,

720
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.930
he's trying to get that Comoros going to hold him down and now,
oh,
oh,

721
00:41:59.931 --> 00:42:04.040
I don't like that.
Interesting.
Tomorrow taking him to the cage.
Interesting.

722
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.960
He's got a pass to get the hidden our homework from garden.
Okay.
Yeah.

723
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.820
Maybe with that fence there's something there.
You know what I mean?

724
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:14.470
It may be puts enough energy into it,
but it just happened the first time.

725
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.730
But he could just pass one leg and hold this position being get to half guard

726
00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:22.480
and just keep this upper body.
Yeah,
you can do it.
Yeah.

727
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.070
It's a good question.
Um,
Jamie,
see if you could pull up.
Ooh.

728
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:31.880
Spawns wrestling pedigree.
I'm pretty sure he's NCAA.
All American.
Yikes.

729
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:36.500
And more than that,
I think maybe two years,
I'd have to remember,

730
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:37.850
go over my notes.

731
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.960
Look at daddy wants to back stepping back up or stepping up though Nigeria had

732
00:42:41.961 --> 00:42:44.240
an Olympian and Daniel Lee,
golly,

733
00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.360
who went to Canon and then one gold medal in 2000 and he's trying to take the

734
00:42:47.361 --> 00:42:48.151
back.
As far as I know,

735
00:42:48.151 --> 00:42:51.680
it was not a lot of great wrestling out of their three year old American d two.

736
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:56.090
Yeah,
three year.
All American division too.
All right,
cool.
And what uh,

737
00:42:56.091 --> 00:42:59.900
what university?
University of Nebraska at Kearney.

738
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:04.040
Same as Ellenberger.
That's a real number one for the Camorra.
I'll look at this.

739
00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.900
Look at this.
Oh boy.
Interesting.
Interesting,
interesting.

740
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.400
Interesting.
Ooh,
he's got it in low.
He's got a nice and low,

741
00:43:13.401 --> 00:43:16.340
I don't really turn his hips though and the fence is getting in the way a little

742
00:43:16.341 --> 00:43:19.980
bit.
Okay.
He's defended it.
Nice.
Still called controlling that risk though.

743
00:43:19.981 --> 00:43:21.560
It doesn't want to let it go.
Interesting.

744
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.400
Can't get that arm over going basket and go.
But yeah,

745
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.190
it's a lot of muscle feels.
It goes later.
Well,
it's a lot of,

746
00:43:33.191 --> 00:43:35.500
it's a lot of,
it's a lot of whole lot of tension on the muscles,

747
00:43:35.501 --> 00:43:37.530
but we've been wrestling for a long time.
He used to it.

748
00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:42.370
We're talking about Camaro and Nigerian wrestlers.
I mean,
where is,
uh,

749
00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.330
is a meal from Iceland?
What's,
what's Viking Norway?
What does the ice

750
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:52.540
was Norway.
The flag was normal.
Denmark.
Norway,
I think Sweden.
Where,

751
00:43:52.541 --> 00:43:56.380
where is he from though?
Is He,
he's from,
uh,
find out.
Jamie said,
look at this.

752
00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:00.600
This is a battle baby.
This is a battle.
You got a couple of Camaros.

753
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.350
Oh.

754
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:08.260
Stablish established that dominate from Norway,
Norway,

755
00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:09.843
Norway.

756
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:15.910
Bunch of fucking tough people in Norway.
He's guys nails painted.

757
00:44:15.911 --> 00:44:19.910
I liked those toenails I painted.
I appreciate it very much.
Frank Trigg,

758
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.650
they're painted chocolate down.
Worships the devil.
Oh,
sure.

759
00:44:23.651 --> 00:44:26.980
He's probably the druid and it's ruined what?
It's a male,

760
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:32.250
which I thought that was a warlock.
They're experts at Po.
Do you imagine this?

761
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.700
I love the how,
the what is like,
I don't know what to drew it is.

762
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:38.250
It's more that you're calling him a druid.
Druids

763
00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:43.980
leaves somebody who was into magic and Amil Mech back up.
Oh hold on.

764
00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:48.230
Meal Mex standing up.
But here's the thing,
he can't keep Guzman off them.

765
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.310
The question is whether or not loose mark can continue like this pace and keep

766
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:56.310
doing this close.
She's be breathing pretty,
but how's,

767
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.590
how's mech going to feel once he gets free?

768
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:03.000
Cause you're holding your weight and the other guys was burnt out here.

769
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.590
Who's going to be more burnt out?
I mean we're,

770
00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:09.810
we're likely looking at the end of the first round where Comoro controls him and

771
00:45:09.811 --> 00:45:14.040
does,
you know most of the control but really didn't get much off.

772
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.790
Oh that's an interesting,

773
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.320
they had the dog don't push.
Okay,
well keep them square.

774
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.680
Wanna keep getting in front of you.
Who's a meal met training with?

775
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:29.430
I was just going to ask that.
I like to see his Joji.
It's with Thor

776
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.690
in Valhalla.
Oh Nice.
Right.
I watched star wars today.

777
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.110
How was it?
I'm senior.
It was like a Disney star wars movie.
It's like the,

778
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:44.460
everything's super diversified.

779
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:49.260
The characters are all black and Asian women and women that are generals.

780
00:45:49.261 --> 00:45:52.960
The women are running things.
It's like,
yeah,
that's a loss.
Yeah,

781
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.230
a game of Thrones.
It.
No,
no,
no.
Ooh.

782
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.700
Little after the bell action there.
It was.
Okay.
I was like,

783
00:45:59.701 --> 00:46:02.610
get off as a fun movie.
It was fun,
but it was just like,

784
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:08.310
it's like Disney got dignified.
It's like they just boiled all the bacteria off

785
00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:14.580
Marxist Markson file.
It's just,
it's just,
you know,
it's,
I don't,

786
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.740
I like a strong female character,

787
00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:21.741
but I don't want to think that this is like a calculated move for you to create

788
00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:24.750
a strong female character is the cat because you want,

789
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:27.690
but I don't want this to notice that.
I know.
Do you know what I'm saying?

790
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.800
Somebody told me that about the black mirror somebody could play.
They said,
oh,

791
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:34.710
all the fucking heroes and this season's black mirror.
All women.

792
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.130
Like if you watch the black mirror and that's what you're concentrating on

793
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:43.230
Europe asshole does.
That fucking shows amazing.
It's astonishing.

794
00:46:43.231 --> 00:46:47.190
Nobody gives a fuck.
It's because women,
the lead or men who lead,

795
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:48.990
it's just a phenomenal show.

796
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:56.190
I want to turn it off halfway through.
I haven't seen this with me anymore.

797
00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:01.280
I haven't seen the season dimes,
this seasons,
the greatest ever.
It's amazing.

798
00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:06.240
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
Battle dogs.
Crazy.
Right?
Here we go.
Why don't you,

799
00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:09.810
I don't be getting out.
Let's see if Matt,
who he's going right to the head kicks,

800
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.730
but here's the thing.
Does Ou smog get tired?

801
00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:14.340
Does he get tired after all that grapple?
Fuck doesn't look tired.

802
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.860
It doesn't look tired.
It doesn't look tired.
Is Mech tired?

803
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.410
The OE front kick to the body Mack?

804
00:47:19.411 --> 00:47:21.330
I liked the fact that he's still throwing kicks.

805
00:47:21.331 --> 00:47:23.610
Even though he got taken down at dominated on the ground.

806
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:28.320
He's tried to set something.
Oh,
and another hard kick to the arms.
Not Fun.

807
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.210
Not Fun to take those.
If you're holding tie pads,

808
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:34.420
don't you have to be careful about catching the top of your foot on those
elbows.

809
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:37.780
Ooh,
when I was not thinking about that.
Yeah,
that can't stop.
Once again,

810
00:47:37.781 --> 00:47:38.614
if you're thinking about it,

811
00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:42.250
he's thinking about slamming that Shin into those fucking forearms and making

812
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:46.090
them useless.
Ooh,
those are,
oh,
oh,
we heard them.
He heard them with that.

813
00:47:46.091 --> 00:47:49.260
Spin it back test.
Damn.
He heard her elbow.

814
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:55.320
That was at herring.
Nice.
Spinning back fist.
Very.
Unless they're ow.
Ow.
Oh,
oh.

815
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:59.440
Ow.
Ducked under that hand.
Get out of their son.
Go.
Here we go.
All right.

816
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:04.500
Somebody's gonna.
Oh,
it's reachable now.
I'm a little bit,
oh,
there.
He gets there.

817
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:07.690
He gets it.
Let it go,
son.
Get out of there.

818
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:12.170
Get it out of their Mac.
Interesting though.
Ooh.

819
00:48:12.171 --> 00:48:15.130
Someone does not want no part of that.
Fucking stand on.
I don't think so.

820
00:48:15.131 --> 00:48:19.000
Not enjoying it.
Nope.
It doesn't want to be throwing bones with a viking.

821
00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:20.670
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

822
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:25.200
<v 0>That's a long history of fucking people up.
Where did he,</v>

823
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:29.970
Nebraska.
Kearney,
wizard.

824
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:36.350
It's got that wizard.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Oh,
it was mine.
Oh Mom.

825
00:48:36.351 --> 00:48:39.500
I'm going over the head almost at the back.
Should have kept that wizard right.

826
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:40.343
Should have kept it

827
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:47.300
damn.
Interesting.
How to score this.
Right,
because loose bomb,

828
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:50.620
when he gets it to the ground,
he's been not able to do anything.
Yeah.

829
00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:51.690
And trolls him,

830
00:48:51.691 --> 00:48:54.750
but he's not getting anything off and it's Mecca went for the submissions in the

831
00:48:54.751 --> 00:48:56.590
first round.
He's the one we tried to finish by then.

832
00:48:56.790 --> 00:49:00.120
Clearly Uzman does not want to stand with them.
He's trying to,

833
00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.420
trying to bring this into hands around.
Well,

834
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.090
stand up without giving up your back.
Yeah,
he doesn't want it.

835
00:49:06.091 --> 00:49:08.480
He doesn't want me to stand up too high and get hooks in.
Okay.
So it's,

836
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.410
it's about guarding your hips and standing up the same time.

837
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.860
That's also why you see he's got his right hip press.
Nice and square.
Yeah.
Yeah.

838
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.860
He's trying to keep that left hook or the right hook rather from getting in.

839
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:18.280
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

840
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.950
<v 0>And use it back up again.
Interesting.
Trying to separate those arms.</v>

841
00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.740
A lot of battle in here.
A lot of fucking physical war.

842
00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:27.520
This is going to be in a lot of ways like who's going to be a the fitter
fighter.

843
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.493
Yeah,
it is.

844
00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:33.310
But a bad man keeps standing up and again going for that tomorrow.
Come on,

845
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.310
got to wash it.
And that's the commitment to the hips.

846
00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:40.210
He's going to it going to work,
but it's too close to that.
Yeah.

847
00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:43.720
Too close to the fence and it doesn't really have anything going on with his

848
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:48.240
legs.
He likes it though.

849
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:53.220
He's holding it.
That's his shit.
He's a muscle dude.
That's a real muscle move.

850
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.460
Yeah.
It's funny,
you know,

851
00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.560
Marcello Garcia doesn't use cameras

852
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.880
to do anything with that.
Kamora if he gets that or I find that amazing.

853
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.500
But he does take,
it does take a lot of commitment with the hubs to get them,

854
00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:12.540
get it.
C'Mon generally speak to me or you blacked out.
Yeah.
You fought too,
right?

855
00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:16.410
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
We're going to say Kamora is,

856
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:20.650
I think with Marcello means by that.
And um,
is that,
uh,

857
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:25.760
Camorra's definitely work.
Yeah,
they certainly do.
There's no,

858
00:50:25.761 --> 00:50:27.950
there's an elaborate systems around more

859
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.780
<v 7>as cores a fucking huge,
oh yeah.
But I see what he says.
Cause when you're,</v>

860
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.070
if you're going to go with someone who has 2030 pounds on,

861
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:36.580
you Kamora knock an war from the bottom.

862
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:40.970
That's a guy who was saying with all the options I have,
I would just say,
I mean,

863
00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:44.050
he's got a lot of other options not sitting there thinking just about the
Kimora.

864
00:50:44.051 --> 00:50:47.270
It's a lot of options.
Every time he attacks he goes from risks a lot,

865
00:50:47.271 --> 00:50:50.360
so I think it's just the harder way to go with all the options he has.

866
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.160
He said that makes sense though.

867
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:57.161
He says he wants to spend time working on submissions and only time.

868
00:50:57.290 --> 00:51:01.680
I like all this time that work on big guys jokes,
jokes.

869
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.490
He wouldn't open division at North Cobb,
Adobe all the time.

870
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.800
He just wants to get good at stuff that works on bigger guys.

871
00:51:06.801 --> 00:51:08.150
If it doesn't work on bigger guys,

872
00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:13.400
he doesn't want to spend time and he had leg lock game too.
He's fantastic.

873
00:51:13.401 --> 00:51:17.830
Like Rodriguez.
Yeah,
I remember that after he slammed him.
Yeah,

874
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:22.730
that was 10 was dark dirty.
If you wanted to be a juggler,
he did to him.

875
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.750
He got garden anymore because I'm bigger.
I'm stronger.
Lock them down,

876
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:30.020
get rid of his mobility and go for the camera.
I remember that quick.

877
00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:31.030
That was the last,

878
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:35.770
<v 0>yeah.
Okay.
Mac on the bottom here,
man.
Starting to get cut up to,</v>

879
00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:36.701
well,

880
00:51:36.701 --> 00:51:41.650
he got some good elbows off of from the bottom and then Comoros started smashing

881
00:51:41.651 --> 00:51:45.850
on him.
He was angry when you're on top of somebody for this long though,

882
00:51:45.851 --> 00:51:50.010
is that scored at yeah,
sure.
Control.

883
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.470
You're in the dominant position and also your strikes count for more.

884
00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:55.090
So when it comes to significant strikes,

885
00:51:55.091 --> 00:51:57.400
your stretching more significant basically.
Yeah.

886
00:51:57.401 --> 00:52:00.950
And clearly wants to keep the fight to ground.

887
00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:04.840
Clearly mech wants to get up and he can't.
So it shows dominance,
a position.

888
00:52:04.841 --> 00:52:08.530
It shows the ability to execute your data in and around.

889
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.900
Told Best.
Yeah.

890
00:52:13.901 --> 00:52:16.510
I've been looking forward to somebody challenging loose mine,

891
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.930
but so you see some vulnerabilities in the standup?
Yeah.

892
00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:24.640
See you a little bit of that.
You know,
and Mac being a strong dangerous guy,

893
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.980
but you also see moose months strengths,

894
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:30.730
his ability to keep fights going down now.
What kind of cheeses do you get?

895
00:52:30.731 --> 00:52:34.510
Raw Cheese.
Do you one of those fellows is a beautiful,
that is good cheeses.

896
00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:39.190
Manchego cheese.
Is it be stanchions this Rochez I don't know.

897
00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:40.990
You don't know?
That's it.
It's a beautiful,

898
00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:44.530
do you get it at whole foods that's and check I've ever had.
Thank you my man.

899
00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.200
Ooh,
that's really good to see what it is.

900
00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.840
I don't play around when it comes to champ.
You do not there.

901
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.710
I'll play around in Carol.
Mm.
Awesome.

902
00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.890
Good God damn choose you ever have a good vegan cheese?
No.

903
00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:00.490
Do they exist?
Yeah,
they're cashew cheese.
You can kiss my ass with that stuff.

904
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.290
Really?
It's not cheesy.
Stop reinventing the wheel.
What is it?
That was me crazy.

905
00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:08.810
They made out of cashews and stuff.
But is it a like a,

906
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:13.180
a valid substitution?
Dramatic.
Actually,
I'm kidding,
but you aren't.
I don't know.

907
00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:17.100
You're a serious,
my wife eats it.
Here we go.
Round three don.
Don,
Tom.

908
00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.680
Do you say get the fuck out of my face with that shit when you see you're eating

909
00:53:20.681 --> 00:53:23.340
it.
So

910
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:25.980
I'm just curious.

911
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.680
<v 5>Take that communist stuff out of my fucking house.
Interesting.</v>

912
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:31.710
Both guys look pretty good in this third round.
Eddie,

913
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:34.320
you're a Vegan now I my mouth.
I'm like,
oh no.

914
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.950
Well I mean you look good either way.
That's all I know.
And he looks,

915
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.220
Eddie doesn't age well.
He especially now off the booze.

916
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.140
He does not meet your face.
Your face is 85 years old.
How old are you?

917
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.120
47 damn,
man.
You look young.
You really do.

918
00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:54.670
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

919
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:58.450
<v 5>Oh,
not shot toes caught it kind.
No,
not that bad,</v>

920
00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:02.890
but like that.
Ooh.
All right.

921
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.870
Well it just doing that weird drop thing that never works.

922
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:09.440
You know what's funny is a lot of people like complain online,
you know,
whatever.

923
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.300
You know fans are like,
oh,
that wasn't a bad shot.

924
00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:15.170
A lot of times the ones that don't look bad slammed the cup right into your nuts

925
00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.380
and they're the worst.
The grading shots lessons,
the worst ones,

926
00:54:18.381 --> 00:54:22.680
they shift the cup.
Nice.
That kind of square.
One more problem.
Yeah,

927
00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:26.030
it's got to get those goddamn compression cups like diamond MMA,

928
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.660
they have that compression short with a cup that keeps everything locked in and

929
00:54:29.661 --> 00:54:33.020
tight.
That's what you want.
Oh wait,
I boys scoring with,

930
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:36.350
I hit him with a hard shot to the body and a good right hand behind it.

931
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:41.420
It's interesting because if you look at like who did damage clearly,
Ooh,

932
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:43.460
smog got off some of the damage in that first round,

933
00:54:43.461 --> 00:54:48.260
but you can't discount all this.
You cannot,
don't,

934
00:54:48.261 --> 00:54:51.080
don't go back to the ground.
I want to come on and let me see this slug fest.

935
00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.570
Hammer hammering with those elbows.

936
00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:56.600
Travis Browne is going down.

937
00:54:56.601 --> 00:55:00.500
Son Jesus probably,
but not going to be able to get up.

938
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:05.150
Damn it.
Here we go again.
He's just working for that head and arm choke again.

939
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:10.850
But again he's stuck in full guard.
Seems rudimentary.

940
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:17.420
Yes and he hasn't been there.
Yeah,
I was getting no path.

941
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:21.620
It seems like he's just kind of trying to hold that spot with that left arm

942
00:55:21.621 --> 00:55:25.610
trapped,
but he doesn't really have a,
a real option.
Mix An animal though.

943
00:55:25.611 --> 00:55:30.140
He is an animal but animal,
but he's fucked here.
Oh Nice.

944
00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:34.590
Nice.
Back to it.
Oh,
can spot them right back on them.
That's it.

945
00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:37.200
That's as much happy place.
Boy,
he'll,
he'll just that pressure.

946
00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:39.080
She didn't want anyone that didn't want none of that.

947
00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:41.380
Do want to be staring at your old school switch.

948
00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:44.320
The old school rustling switch ma'am.
Good luck.
Yeah,
for sure.

949
00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:46.850
I don't get that at all.
You got to get that like right away.

950
00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.270
It was someone's just got such a better work once a fiberglass ones.

951
00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:57.490
Interesting.
Very interesting.
Ouch.
That's got to hurt.
So you see,

952
00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:02.200
you see how strong it was,
smiles wrestling is but you also see vulnerability.

953
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:04.090
Yeah definitely see vulnerability in standup.

954
00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:06.880
I don't think it's going to be as hard for him to get fights now tell you that

955
00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:12.280
he'll be able to get a few guys that will step in and he's fighting a strong guy

956
00:56:12.281 --> 00:56:14.110
but he's been fighting a tricky,

957
00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:19.030
you know a guy that's going to throw weird stuff at him cause he's reached a few

958
00:56:19.031 --> 00:56:21.940
times so those take downs and the guy hasn't had me cats and had the speed to

959
00:56:21.941 --> 00:56:24.060
really make him pay for it.
Somebody else

960
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:29.020
<v 0>will.
Him versus Mike Perry would be very interesting.
Him versus my Darren till.</v>

961
00:56:29.021 --> 00:56:32.950
It'd be interesting.
That would be horrific.
In other words,

962
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.840
it hurt.
Manage for the standup for till.
Big,
big advantage.

963
00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:41.510
Darren till is a wizard.
He's going to be,
I think if,

964
00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.170
I don't know what his wrestling's like against a guy like Tyron or something,

965
00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:46.800
but I don't know how he stops that.
But um,

966
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:51.100
if he does have great takedown defense,
I think he's gonna.

967
00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.700
He's gonna,
he's gonna walk through that division,
not walk through.
Well,

968
00:56:54.701 --> 00:56:57.430
you saw it almost immediately in the cowboy fight.

969
00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:02.460
He was on so many levels higher than cowboy when it came to stand up distance

970
00:57:03.071 --> 00:57:07.900
control and then consequences for his actions.
I hit so fucking hard.

971
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:11.500
That's what I'm looking at.
Two Oh one.
He's a huge guy.
He's a huge guy.

972
00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:13.640
He's able to get down to one 70.
Oh my.

973
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:18.370
He's 24 years old and she's super technical too.
It's not,
it's not just big.

974
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.540
He's big and real technical.
And he stepped into a big fight,

975
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.690
late notice and acted like this is my,
this is my moment.

976
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:29.140
A lot of guys mentally fold.
And he did not very confident.

977
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.460
There's no folded in that guy.
You know,
Vinny shoreman.
Vinnie does,
um,

978
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:37.980
Moitai commentary for a bunch of organizations and he's also a,
um,

979
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:41.320
a fight hypnotists.
Really interesting guy.
And uh,
you know,

980
00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:45.070
he knows a lot about the tie world and Thai fighting and he's always talking to

981
00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:48.340
me about dudes.
And when he found out that till was fighting cowboy,

982
00:57:48.341 --> 00:57:49.540
he was very excited.

983
00:57:49.541 --> 00:57:52.840
He called me up or sent me text messages about and we went back and forth quite

984
00:57:52.841 --> 00:57:55.840
a bit.
He was like,
this guy is something special,
he's something special.

985
00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.750
So it really prompted me to go watch some tils fights and I was like,
Holy Shit.

986
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:05.520
And he's monsters,
you know,
in cowboy was like,
I ain't watch tape on him or her.

987
00:58:05.521 --> 00:58:09.430
He lacks a strike.
Good.
I love striking.
I was like,
I was like,

988
00:58:09.431 --> 00:58:13.120
this fight is going to be fucking crazy.
How tall is till he's tall.

989
00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:17.890
He's like six [inaudible] two,
I think.
Yeah,
he's,
he's a big fucking guy.

990
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:24.430
He goes,
I'm,
I'm a light heavyweight.
Kick him away.
Still up,
standing up now.

991
00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.373
Oh

992
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:30.610
so dominant performance by Guzman in the fact that he got in the second and the

993
00:58:30.611 --> 00:58:33.250
third round to do really basically what he wanted.

994
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:37.600
Took some punishment on the feet,
but here we go.
Oh,

995
00:58:37.601 --> 00:58:41.290
the full amount now.
And he stepped right back into half guard.
Yup.
Yeah.

996
00:58:41.291 --> 00:58:44.440
You see the weaknesses?
You see where he needs some improvement?
Well,

997
00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:48.790
the big one to me is the standup.
His staff,
he's,
he looks like he's thinking,

998
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:51.220
you know what I'm saying?
Like when things are going down,

999
00:58:51.221 --> 00:58:54.480
he's thinking and it's instinct is to reach,
just go.
Okay.

1000
00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:57.370
Reaching their guys at the other really make you pay for that.
Yeah.

1001
00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:00.190
I want to see him versus a guy who can really fucking bang.

1002
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:04.360
That's why I think that,
uh,
he's bummed out.
Amil Max bummed out.

1003
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:08.913
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1004
00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.960
<v 0>But,
uh,
I feel like I'm seeing,</v>

1005
00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:15.560
oops Mont against a guy who might be able to stuff those takedowns and maybe

1006
00:59:15.561 --> 00:59:19.460
have a little bit faster hands and Mac Meccas Tophen is standup as good,

1007
00:59:19.461 --> 00:59:22.640
but this is a real dude that doesn't,

1008
00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:27.080
doesn't have like any one overwhelming feature to his game.

1009
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.650
Whereas a guy like Mike Perry can blow your fucking brains through the back of

1010
00:59:30.651 --> 00:59:34.850
your head.
You know?
I mean that like I hit so goddamn hard.
He's so ferocious.

1011
00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:37.040
I'd like to see him,
but I don't think you'd be,

1012
00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:39.050
it's gotta be able to stop that take down.

1013
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:43.550
This guy's got some fucking wicked wrestling.
Interesting though.

1014
00:59:43.551 --> 00:59:44.690
He learned a lot tonight.

1015
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:48.650
Tell you that that's a fight like that is good for a guy like him and we got to

1016
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:52.940
see him in vulnerable positions.
Did not like the stand up.

1017
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.400
Wow.
Interesting.

1018
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:59.540
And he was in trouble a couple of guns a couple of times and he's a guy who's

1019
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:03.850
not super duper slick on the ground and he was still like,
oh,
Kimora teen.

1020
01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:07.550
So yeah,
especially the good team,
like right away.
I mean,

1021
01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:10.340
what if he had gotten locked up like that with a guy who was like a wicked

1022
01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:12.320
finisher?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1023
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:17.350
Christian Bale is the best actor in Hollywood is as long as Daniel stays making

1024
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:21.920
shoes is my favorite.
But I got this from the,
they'll right there with him.

1025
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:25.640
He's right there where the love,
I love Daniel Day Lewis,
but Christian Bale,

1026
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:28.430
he ne here's the,
here's the trivia question.

1027
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:32.330
What was the one movie he was in when he was younger?
Uh,

1028
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.590
while he was in two movies.

1029
01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:38.180
He's been acting since he was six and part of the sun.
Thank you sir.
Thank you.

1030
01:00:38.181 --> 01:00:43.160
So don't even throw your star,
Bro.
You hear me talk it out across the site.

1031
01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:48.790
There's one more.
Henry the fifth with Canada.
Toronto.
He has a little bit,
but,

1032
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.420
but I love that you got that.
I love you.

1033
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:54.790
I'm already impressed with your degree in history.
Dog had said,
why don't

1034
01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.170
you go to school,
university,
Ucla.
All right,
you're off a degree in history.

1035
01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:03.260
I was already a fan when I listened to you.
I'm broken.
I went,

1036
01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:05.690
this fucking guy is,
but you didn't know.
Dude.

1037
01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:09.390
Dude love you for that history trivia.
Jimmy's like,
thank you sir.
God,

1038
01:01:09.391 --> 01:01:13.690
I love that dude.
I'm so happy that you're with the UFC know and happy to be.

1039
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:18.170
He's happy to be here.
We tried to get you for years.
For years.

1040
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:23.300
Yeah,
man.
He's as knowledgeable,
but there's some guys doing commentary right now.

1041
01:01:23.301 --> 01:01:26.150
We're just saying there's a guy who was doing on this fight that we don't know

1042
01:01:26.151 --> 01:01:30.900
who he is.
Who is this guy?
What is his name is Paul Felder's.
Paul felter.

1043
01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:38.210
But again,
a major Paul felter get back.
Yes.
He was great guy.
I,

1044
01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:42.440
I,
I,
um,
I,
when I saw,
I watched him fight a lot,

1045
01:01:42.441 --> 01:01:47.120
including life and I,
he just looks like such an animal.
So I,
and when I met him,

1046
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:51.680
I expected this kind of real kind of antisocial or our rough guy and he's the

1047
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:55.910
exact opposite theater major.
Very intelligent.
Just a,

1048
01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:59.780
just a good soap or dude,
you know,
Super Nice Guy,
great guy.

1049
01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:03.080
And just as tough as it gets,
come on.

1050
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:07.790
What was mom clearly nanos decision.
I'm very impressed with both those guys.

1051
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:11.930
Yeah.
Fuck
yeah.
Interesting fight though.

1052
01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:15.170
I'm glad that fight happened.
Got to see it and you're right.
Ooh,

1053
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:17.540
someone's going to get more people in.
Oh yeah.
I can meet that guy,

1054
01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.450
which can be good for you.
Yes,
can we do,
you don't want people to run from it.

1055
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:22.800
He's going to get guys that are going to be willing to fight him now because

1056
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:27.801
he's got a strong presence in the top 10 I mean he's number 10 now.

1057
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:32.340
Winning this fight probably keeps them in that area because Mac is probably not

1058
01:02:32.341 --> 01:02:34.540
ranked because that hook is,
I haven't left.

1059
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:39.940
Where is he?
Am I looking at it and to the left of anyone?

1060
01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.290
They just shut them up perhaps.
I Dunno.
It was mine.
I know it's right there.

1061
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.330
You guys are saying people are going to want to find him now.
Yeah,
I think so.

1062
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:53.100
More people before.
Yeah,
look,
he's no,
he's no picnic

1063
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:59.180
African could be.
No.
He could be the loud guy.
No doubt about it.
No,
I,

1064
01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.320
well there was some vulnerabilities in there.
It could be all.
It can be.

1065
01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:04.380
I think he's very good.
Don't get me wrong,

1066
01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:08.850
but I think that a meals without real fast hands showed some real

1067
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:12.750
vulnerabilities.
Yeah.
Like you know,
if he was,
here's a PR like okay,

1068
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:16.800
let's put it this way.
If Calvin gasoline could really make 170 to be healthy,

1069
01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:19.920
like if he,
if he got it,
Mike Dolce on speed dial and said,
Mike,

1070
01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:23.970
let's work this out.
Let's just make this work out.
Maybe come on,

1071
01:03:23.971 --> 01:03:27.300
I don't know,
70 unit.
We both though seventies where it's at.

1072
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:31.200
And if they actually did figure out a way to get a good meal plan,

1073
01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:34.140
drop them down the way.
Like Michael Johnson looked,
you know,

1074
01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:39.420
Calvin's got way better hands.
I mean wait and Kelvins tough to take down.

1075
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:42.360
He's a real good wrestler.
He never gets fucking tired.

1076
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.620
His endurance is phenomenal and he packed hard to get underneath and tasted

1077
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:49.860
nasty southpaw and that fucking right jab,
straight left behind.

1078
01:03:49.861 --> 01:03:51.450
It is surprising.

1079
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.320
It's got snapped to it when he cracked Bisbing with that shit.
Yeah.

1080
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:58.830
And when it was like,
and you see Bisping's head snapped back,
you were like,

1081
01:03:58.831 --> 01:04:03.420
there's some pop to that dude's punches.
He stopped v toward that way.
Same Way.

1082
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.800
He's a motherfucker that Kelvin Gaslamp.
You see,
I would love to see that.
I mean,

1083
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:11.070
obviously Kelvin's campaigning at one 85 now and maybe he's going to stay there

1084
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:14.760
now.
He wants to go back down one seven.
I would love to see that fight.
Yeah,

1085
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:18.000
that's,
that's what I want to say.
I want to see Calvin versus Huseman.

1086
01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.130
I think that's a real good fight because I don't think Calvin's ranked at one 70

1087
01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:27.090
right,
because he's been fighting at 85 right.
Right now he's not.
Right.

1088
01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.490
So he goes down to 70 and [inaudible] top 10 immediately he's ranked,

1089
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.960
you know,
if he can beat who spawn.

1090
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:37.500
And it's a big f because it was mom's a hell of a fucking wrestler.

1091
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:41.930
And one day he five hosts a monsters.
Monsters,
monsters.
Dude.

1092
01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:46.640
Fucking soap bombed out or they canceled this fight that Whitaker Whitaker.

1093
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.180
Yeah.
What happened?

1094
01:04:48.181 --> 01:04:52.140
Got Injured Hero Romero Yoel Romero was going to fight for the interim title

1095
01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:54.810
against Luke Rockhold,
which is a lovely,
that's lovely.

1096
01:04:56.010 --> 01:05:00.780
But not a lot of time.
That's February,
right?
No.
When is that?
Uh,
no,

1097
01:05:00.781 --> 01:05:03.810
it's February when,
what I'm saying,
but he was already on the car.

1098
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:07.560
He was supposed to fight well with Berendsen.
Oh,
okay.
So he was,

1099
01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:10.970
he was our least in camp for that date,
which is he has,

1100
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.710
what's wrong with Whitaker?
What injury did they announce it?

1101
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:16.890
I don't think they announced it.
I don't remember.
Yes,
I would bet it's his knee.

1102
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:22.170
His knee got fucked up in that fight with EOL Yo side kicked his knee and hyper

1103
01:05:22.471 --> 01:05:26.770
extended it and he came back and he said my knees fucked in between rounds and

1104
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:30.570
still stuff to take downs and still beat him standing.
He's as tough as he,

1105
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.820
he's got,
he's Mallory,
right?
It's Kinda,
yeah,
but he's got extra,

1106
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:37.240
he's got a lot of terror.
There's a lot of tears going on in that knee,

1107
01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.670
so he's going to have to figure out what the fuck to do about all that.
It needs.

1108
01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:44.680
New head are not made for sport,
for Combat Sport,
that's for sure.
Not at all.

1109
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.900
Yeah man.
It's a real bummer.
When guys started having knee injuries,

1110
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:52.810
repeated knee injuries,
like until they get that ironed out and settled in,

1111
01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.141
it's like,

1112
01:05:53.141 --> 01:05:56.440
it's always suspect that shit's always given out and then you're training

1113
01:05:56.441 --> 01:06:01.330
changes.
So then your ability inside the octagon changes.
So many things change.

1114
01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:02.550
And me Ma,
Eddie Bravo is over here.

1115
01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:05.170
Hope and dudes get their legs were up to party.
He was like,
fuck,

1116
01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:09.860
he's all quiet and really,
no,
I just want you to talk.
He'll be quiet.

1117
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.793
But um,

1118
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.650
how have your baskets was the guy who was right about to break through and that

1119
01:06:14.651 --> 01:06:17.710
happened.
Well,
hobbies needs,
we're fucked.
God.
I know,
I know.

1120
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.490
His knees are real brutal crane fight.
He couldn't stand up.

1121
01:06:21.491 --> 01:06:23.640
Can you the cage remember that?
Well,
he had a blown ACL.

1122
01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:27.820
I commented thought did you,
I remember that.
That was my last one.

1123
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.660
I remember her sitting down.
He blew it.
You were drunk.

1124
01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:36.910
Took shots.
And it was my last show.
Oh Man.

1125
01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:41.740
We went off.
Me and Eric Apple did it.
Eric,

1126
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:45.610
I got to see that apple.
Damn,
it's Alberto crank.
Great Jujitsu Guy.

1127
01:06:45.611 --> 01:06:47.540
And however your basket is great.
You just guiding them for the kingdom.

1128
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.590
The cage title.
Yeah.
Well,
and hobby was like about to break that.

1129
01:06:50.591 --> 01:06:54.700
I was supposed to be like,
it just stopped.
Sorry,
from the injury.

1130
01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:58.810
If he just let go and just say,
look,
I'm injured,
I got to stop this fight.

1131
01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:01.870
His career would have taken a completely different path and it's his mental

1132
01:07:01.871 --> 01:07:02.351
toughness,

1133
01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:06.160
his ability to endure and fight with that ACL and it kept blowing out during the

1134
01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:07.480
fight.
It just kept giving out.

1135
01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:10.810
So he must've chewed up the whole inside of his fucking leg,

1136
01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.610
his meniscus and all that shit,

1137
01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:17.320
but still went on to be like a really good fighter in MMA and a really good

1138
01:07:17.321 --> 01:07:19.240
fucking sub Matt submission grappling,

1139
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.450
find Ebi a bunch of times with those knees.

1140
01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:26.980
Didn't he run into some health issues recently?
Cancer,

1141
01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:31.840
I believe he beats you got on the Gerson method.
Who is,

1142
01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.450
what's the Gerson method?

1143
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:40.660
A lot of juicing like coffee enemas.
Does that make sense?

1144
01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:43.870
Okay.
Choosing a lot of animal,
the animals.
Something like,
I don't know,

1145
01:07:43.871 --> 01:07:46.780
something like that.
What kind of cancer was it?
Worked?
It worked in the cancer.

1146
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:50.090
He had a um,

1147
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:57.070
colon,
colon cancer.
Okay.
So that makes sense with the enemas.
So joke.
Fuck man.

1148
01:07:57.071 --> 01:08:00.610
So he beat it.
That's beautiful.
God,
it's at 50.

1149
01:08:00.611 --> 01:08:04.150
You should all have like I had to get my fucking call them the finger up your

1150
01:08:04.151 --> 01:08:05.800
butt hole.
I got to clean but huh?

1151
01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.570
I was willing to stick a tube up there at the camp.

1152
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:12.790
Did you like wrap your legs around your arms?
Like this year there was a private,

1153
01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:15.380
I'm not too proud to come there.
That's a private,
that's a private question.

1154
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:16.214
Did you like get up?

1155
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:17.351
<v 5>He smelled like how long?</v>

1156
01:08:17.351 --> 01:08:20.720
He's right now showing you my doctor smelling Cologne and he was a really nice

1157
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:25.130
guy and he didn't wear gloves.
Yeah,
you're showing us how it's done Joe.

1158
01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:29.890
Like check this out.
That's how you do it bro.
As breast milk.
Pineapple.
Yeah,

1159
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.863
that's all I'm gonna say.

1160
01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:37.880
I was talking to a guy the other day that had mint breath over shit breath.

1161
01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:43.800
It was so confused at Terrell told him that his breath smelled like shit.

1162
01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.520
And so he was eating mince,
but it wasn't good enough.
The meds.

1163
01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:52.460
So it was like I was,
it was,
you know what it was like,
man.
It was like,

1164
01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.470
like it was confusing.

1165
01:08:54.471 --> 01:08:56.720
It was like just two signals that were clashing with each other.

1166
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.860
What's awful for folks listening at home that aren't broadcasters,

1167
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.270
I'm not naming names,

1168
01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:04.940
we're not going to name any names to broadcasts with somebody who's

1169
01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:08.450
breastfeeding because they turned to you and you have to stay close to them to

1170
01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:13.070
stay in the two shot a problem.
You can't go,
you can't react to it all.

1171
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.270
It's a problem.
And it is.

1172
01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.680
I brushed my teeth like religiously when I'm doing camera stuff because I'm in

1173
01:09:18.681 --> 01:09:22.070
someone's face talking to them and I've been on the receiving end of that and

1174
01:09:22.071 --> 01:09:25.510
been like this.
And you can't make show face.
You can't do it.
Yeah.

1175
01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:29.490
After shows when you take pictures.
Yeah.
Ooh,
that's got to be girls and guys.

1176
01:09:29.491 --> 01:09:32.120
So Nice.
You're just like,
God damn it.
I don't know what's going on.

1177
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:36.740
They say when people don't eat a lot,
like if you,
uh,
yeah.
Is that real?

1178
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:41.270
Like if you a fancy things.
I know with a chronic halitosis,

1179
01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.630
apparently it's the sulfates on your tongue.
Whoa.
There's a,
there's a so,

1180
01:09:45.631 --> 01:09:49.610
so typically I guess the,
so,
so the chemicals,

1181
01:09:49.611 --> 01:09:53.300
I guess the sulfur that everybody has different compounds in their mouth and for

1182
01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:56.370
whatever reason,
I don't know.
But you,
they're,

1183
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.800
they're essentially what you're smelling is sulfur is,

1184
01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:03.140
is a derivative of software or some kind of assault and it's because there's a

1185
01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:08.120
chemical problem in your mouth and they can actually address it with things.
Hmm.

1186
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.130
Yeah.
And also I was like,
tell him to tell us,

1187
01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:14.840
this can also be from bad from liver disease.
So if you have a liver disease,

1188
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:18.380
you um,
yeah.
Liver disease,

1189
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:23.390
make sure they check his diabetes,
heart disease,
stuff like about the breath.
Wow.

1190
01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:28.220
Wow.
That's interesting.
Yeah.
That's one of the ways they check.
Yeah.
Whoa.

1191
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:32.320
And then of course it can be,
uh,
an abscess behind your tooth and all that.
Yeah,

1192
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:36.200
that's a big one,
man.
That's what I mean.
Everyone sees and diabetes,
diabetics,

1193
01:10:36.201 --> 01:10:39.880
dude,
I had a cracked filling and they took the filling out.
Oh.

1194
01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.550
And the fucking smell that came out of my mouth,
I was like,

1195
01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:46.160
Holy Shit.
Cause the,

1196
01:10:46.161 --> 01:10:50.210
the filling had cracked and there was an infection and I had a wound up getting

1197
01:10:50.211 --> 01:10:54.500
a root canal.
And so as I'm getting this list thing like opened up,

1198
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:59.480
they break through this pocket.
We're all this puss and rot is,
yeah.

1199
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.570
Oh Dude,
it was so nasty.
Sounds awful.

1200
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:07.550
Like you could hear it like pop through and then just this fucking shit breath.

1201
01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.270
They caught my thighs.
My father is fine.
He was sleeping,

1202
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:13.800
his wife said you have to go to dentist.

1203
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.160
<v 7>So why does your breath is so out of control and they've been married for 25</v>

1204
01:11:19.831 --> 01:11:23.220
years.
So because Jesus,
all right,
so,
so,
so check this out.

1205
01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:27.540
This is so apparently he had an abscess,

1206
01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:32.490
a sack of bacteria in the back of his mouth.
Well when they,
when they,

1207
01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:36.840
I guess took the tooth out of the filling out and they popped by accident,

1208
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:40.780
the sac,
the nurse through,

1209
01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:41.763
<v 8>well</v>

1210
01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.270
fucking dentist walked into the room at that moment

1211
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:54.100
and through the [inaudible] a double vomit fest.

1212
01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:57.243
Ooh.

1213
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:07.450
She didn't be better if she just puked when Buddha statue

1214
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:15.070
and when he had his mask on,
he went got just barely diamond

1215
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:18.160
<v 7>like that.
Oh,
Ms. Dot.
Oh,</v>

1216
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.400
that's so cool.
I never had the balls to tell someone their breaths.

1217
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:29.850
If you work with them,
you have to tell friends.

1218
01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:32.520
Where would want them to tell me like your breath stinks.

1219
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:34.830
I'm going to tell you test and I would want you to tell me.

1220
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:37.320
It's one cool thing about black people.
They'll tell you

1221
01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.160
<v 8>no problem with that.</v>

1222
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.610
<v 7>Have no block or some shit.
Fucking pussy.
I once got head from a girl.</v>

1223
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:51.810
She was,
she would come over and give me a massage.
She wasn't very good looking,

1224
01:12:51.811 --> 01:12:54.870
but she was down to give them a song.
By the time you're done with the massage,

1225
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:55.830
she knows she's going to get to,

1226
01:12:56.130 --> 01:13:01.080
she wanted to give me oral pleasure long time ago,
but she used her teeth.

1227
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:05.100
Oh boy.
I didn't have the fucking courage to tell her that.
I'm like,

1228
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.930
you're shouting.
I was enjoying it.

1229
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.273
<v 8>Oh,</v>

1230
01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:12.450
she's looking at me.

1231
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:17.630
[inaudible] every time she came over right.

1232
01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:21.513
Here we go.

1233
01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:27.020
[inaudible]

1234
01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:37.050
a girl's pussy can reek and I'm not going to tell him.

1235
01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:39.970
That's a tough

1236
01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:43.570
<v 7>one.
I'm not telling me,
Oh shit,
I gotta be a gentleman,
but okay.</v>

1237
01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.220
But if you're a girl and you have a problem,

1238
01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:49.160
you have a yeast infection and if someone doesn't let you know,

1239
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:52.190
you're not going to get it treated.
There's a problem.
Like it's true.

1240
01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.390
It's delicate.
It's a delicate,

1241
01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.760
you're not always going to get a rational reaction.
Thank you.

1242
01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:02.400
Medically I feel much better.
That's not going to be
mad at you.

1243
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:05.180
Isn't that weird?
They'll get mad at you if their pussy stank.
Well,

1244
01:14:05.181 --> 01:14:07.340
there was a girl that,
I was in New York.

1245
01:14:07.341 --> 01:14:11.380
I was a young man and she was very sexy and uh,

1246
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.740
I feel like the incredible hulk music should be playing right now.

1247
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:17.530
She met me with a hat on.
I remember this weird thing.
She met with a hat on.

1248
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.980
I picked her up and she goes,
good.
Thank God.
I thought you were going to be bald.

1249
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:25.840
I was like,
it was like 20 thanks.
Thanks.
Whatever.
To ballgames.
And she and I,

1250
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:30.580
we got to business and then she began to give me oral pleasure after she was,

1251
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:34.330
I had gotten her kind of naked and she had a Harry,

1252
01:14:34.331 --> 01:14:37.150
but she had a hairy back.
Like you know,

1253
01:14:37.151 --> 01:14:40.030
some people can be super dark hair and it was,

1254
01:14:40.031 --> 01:14:44.210
first was that it was fine for a girl it was girl for,

1255
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.340
but it's still a problem bro,
because they,
the hair fanned out.

1256
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:52.360
It started with the back and it was on the old rumper still skins and that was

1257
01:14:52.361 --> 01:14:55.780
very hard for me to keep it.
I couldn't,
I had to avert my eyes.

1258
01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:00.840
The only black girl know what was the instinct to laugh when she hears what the

1259
01:15:01.091 --> 01:15:03.640
instinct was.
He had a big Dick,
but

1260
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.080
I'm kidding.
But I'm,
no,
no,
it wasn't.
I just kind of,

1261
01:15:08.190 --> 01:15:09.970
there's no way I was going to,
what do I say?

1262
01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:14.470
No To area on your back and your rump.
I mean,
you know,
I,
I just,
I,

1263
01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.800
I just dealt with it.
I didn't pull out a medical book on one girl though.

1264
01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:20.770
I liked her a lot side.
How does she ended up being my girlfriend,

1265
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.910
I showed her that she had a B vitamin deficiency.
Wow.

1266
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.700
And that's why it was a really,
it was problems down there.
Oh Wow.

1267
01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:31.090
She got all into vitamins.
She was vitamin freak from that point on.

1268
01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:32.410
And you know what,
she me,

1269
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.850
I went on a date with a girl that's the worst threat in the world.
And I had,

1270
01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:40.830
and she was from,
I knew her in college and I said to her friend,
I said,
shit,

1271
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.320
what happened with her uncle?
You want me to be honest?

1272
01:15:42.321 --> 01:15:45.250
So I said her breath was so bad I could smell it when we're standing at the

1273
01:15:45.251 --> 01:15:49.330
elevator.
And she screamed.
She went,
Oh my God,
we've always felt that way.

1274
01:15:49.331 --> 01:15:53.350
And they were friends with her and I said,
none of you told her her life is,

1275
01:15:53.410 --> 01:15:57.090
she'll never find somebody if you don't tell her.
I couldn't tell her.

1276
01:15:57.091 --> 01:15:59.680
You guys will tell you quick like a group of guys and I be like,
Joe,

1277
01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:01.120
you got to take care of this now.

1278
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:05.950
But I couldn't say it to the girl cause I just felt,
you know I would thank you.

1279
01:16:05.951 --> 01:16:08.710
I think it's important you page fans that loves that jump in switch.

1280
01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:11.620
Kick jumping roundhouse kick to the fighting.

Ooh,

Is that it?

1283
01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:26.310
You just make that up?
No
Way.
He said it was like it was a 10 stick.

1284
01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:28.220
10th of a joke to it.
Ooh.
Wow.

1285
01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:33.430
Paige vanzant is throwing along for wild a leaping in shit.
Casey Halston,

1286
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:34.661
head instructor,

1287
01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:39.600
10 Planet Las Vegas is working with her with Clark page.

1288
01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:42.430
Click hard in the funny how I feel bad about telling that story about the girl

1289
01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:45.910
with the hair on her back and I didn't know it was,
it was 25 years ago.
I mean,

1290
01:16:45.911 --> 01:16:48.280
you know,
no hates Trish.
She's not listening to this.

1291
01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:52.210
Gonna say jerk page.
Loves that jumping roundhouse.

1292
01:16:52.211 --> 01:16:56.280
Kick pages.
Busy here man.
Yeah,
but she's a,

1293
01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.960
she got tagged like several click there.

1294
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:03.880
This girl Clark has some clean striking good counters.
Yeah.
Now.

1295
01:17:03.881 --> 01:17:05.950
See that was a problem when we're talking about the trip,

1296
01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.300
the Cyborg Holly Holm fight,

1297
01:17:07.301 --> 01:17:10.310
she would get in quick and the that counter every time.

1298
01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.870
<v 5>Paige is in trouble on her back side control.
No,
I'm good.</v>

1299
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.130
What do you want to do here?
Stand up right away.

1300
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:19.400
Or what if you're filling the bottom car?
Either get Gar to get up.

1301
01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.830
What was your knew generally,
what do you want to do here?

1302
01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:25.280
When we want to do here?
Who want to drive your fist in her face?

1303
01:17:25.281 --> 01:17:29.730
Who would kick her ass
edge?
Bravo.

1304
01:17:29.731 --> 01:17:33.980
I needed you brought there.
Ooh.
Standing arms triangle.
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh page.

1305
01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:39.470
Full guard right there.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Right.
Oh,
come on.
What's her name?

1306
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:43.390
Clark Clark.
She has an arm triangle,
but it's hard to understand.

1307
01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:48.800
Much more serious as long as she needs is in trouble.
Three minutes to go.

1308
01:17:48.801 --> 01:17:52.100
She's in trouble and she doesn't have the best guard now you want to be on the

1309
01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:55.700
phone or don't you?
Oh yeah,
she wanted to be on the phone goes off.
She's off.

1310
01:17:55.701 --> 01:17:59.030
She's off the phone now and she's still,
she's still in trouble,

1311
01:17:59.031 --> 01:18:00.830
but not nearly as bad.

1312
01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:05.450
Plenty of space because her elbow to elbow from going across your neck.

1313
01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:09.740
If you're like,
extend your arm here,
you want to be here,
here's not as good.

1314
01:18:09.741 --> 01:18:12.320
You want to be on the phone.
But even that,
if someone's real strong,

1315
01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:13.050
it's not going to sit here.

1316
01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:17.730
<v 4>She wants her right arm to under hook her neck or ha ha,</v>

1317
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:20.480
<v 5>that didn't happen.
Brian.
Dan,
when he got choked out by a chill,</v>

1318
01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:23.680
he was on the phone there and you can still,
it can still,

1319
01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:26.140
but here's the thing,

1320
01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:29.230
she's got to get out of this half guard and she wants to be on the same side as

1321
01:18:29.231 --> 01:18:33.670
the choke.
He had his leg in the escape and Dante has put them out.

1322
01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:39.420
It could especially who did you to do the impaler?
Do you know?
Uh,
Eddie,

1323
01:18:39.421 --> 01:18:40.254
you still use that?

1324
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:45.270
That a knee to the chest wall separating that tailors the legit like that need

1325
01:18:46.001 --> 01:18:48.370
that,
um,
that escape where you're holding onto your own name.
Yeah,

1326
01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:49.540
it's not good enough.

1327
01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.050
But the guy knows that and Paler move and he gets that knee to your chest and

1328
01:18:53.051 --> 01:18:55.690
puts that crashed down.
I like that all day.

1329
01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:59.650
I think the time you spend defending that you're getting your ribs crushed,

1330
01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:01.600
it's so much pressure on you.

1331
01:19:01.601 --> 01:19:05.440
And if you make the decision to try to defend that and push that away,

1332
01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:06.850
you're going to give up more of the Cho.

1333
01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:10.690
And how do you get Tony Ferguson like prepared?

1334
01:19:10.691 --> 01:19:12.820
I mean it's kind of a weird question,

1335
01:19:12.821 --> 01:19:15.760
but with that kind of wrestling and that with the same kind of pressure,

1336
01:19:15.761 --> 01:19:16.650
how do you deal with that kind of

1337
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:21.050
<v 4>sure with,
cause I know we've been working on that since day one,
right?</v>

1338
01:19:21.051 --> 01:19:22.700
You mean like getting prepared for Habib?

1339
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.890
How did you get a pair for a dude who really necessarily fighting Khabib yet?

1340
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:30.020
We don't,
there's no schedule,
but that's my prediction.

1341
01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:34.910
You gotta at least be that they get a map.
I think that's going to happen.

1342
01:19:34.911 --> 01:19:39.380
So we've prepared for that.
You know,
when we were working on um,

1343
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:44.320
the Rafael does Anjos fight,
we were still thinking wrestling and you know,

1344
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:45.710
Khabib is in the mix.

1345
01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:50.530
We have to be working on counter back.
Hey,

1346
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.430
it's not going to be,
it's not going to be easy.

1347
01:19:53.410 --> 01:19:58.160
Well it paid off big and the Kevin Leafy right out triangle,
same camp.

1348
01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:01.850
Kevin Lee's wrestler.
Good passer loves to take the back.

1349
01:20:01.851 --> 01:20:04.640
Has a good rear naked choke.
Yeah,
same thing.

1350
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.130
<v 0>Yeah.
So Paige is in a lot of trouble here.</v>

1351
01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:14.280
She's just defending and fighting for her life here off the bottom.

1352
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:19.680
And the Clark has not really advanced any further than this one position where

1353
01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:23.010
she keeps trying to get this head and arm choke.
Just can't quite get it.

1354
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:25.950
Would you Eddie,

1355
01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:28.740
would you like to see her like in a situation like this which keeps going to it

1356
01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:29.574
over and over and go,

1357
01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:32.910
would you like to see or just try to get out of that half guard first?
Exactly,

1358
01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:36.930
yeah.
Keep the position,
you know,
keep that head on the ground,
keep her arm trap,

1359
01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.450
but you got to pass the guard.
She's slant at Nice Elbow.

1360
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.890
Got To get to the chopping block.
Okay.
She's slicing through now now because,

1361
01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:48.390
because Paige went after it.
Okay.
That right level left legs and play.
Oh,

1362
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:52.170
back to Africa.
Yeah.
But almost out.
Oh No,

1363
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:58.410
she's just gonna try smash now.
Ooh,
whoa.
That's it.

1364
01:20:58.730 --> 01:20:59.870
It's just saying whether you're,
whether you're,

1365
01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.680
whether you're trying to pass it or whether you're trying to use it.
There are,

1366
01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:05.590
there are submissions from half card and our submissions where you're passing up

1367
01:21:05.591 --> 01:21:08.880
or they're just hard to pull off.
It's always easier to get around dark.

1368
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.940
Do you remember,
he goes easy to get around guard first.
Eddie,
do you remember,

1369
01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:15.360
was he getting Machado's version of the twister?
He had a different

1370
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:19.120
<v 4>version of the tourists.
He asked me to show it to him one day and I was like,</v>

1371
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:22.280
I was a purple belt and I couldn't believe a black belt allege.

1372
01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:23.770
And like Kagan Machado wanted,

1373
01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:28.290
he called me over and wanted to basically a private on the twister.
Yeah.
And um,

1374
01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.190
he remembered it wrong and came up with a whole different version.

1375
01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:37.180
So he called it the Higgins twister.
And only like three people can do it.

1376
01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.900
And it's amazing.
Now.
It's amazing,
man.
Um,
Ryan,

1377
01:21:40.901 --> 01:21:44.430
Greg is one of his black belt.
He remember,
I remember Ron.

1378
01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:49.270
He's the best at it.
That's so crazy to,
I wouldn't know how to show it.

1379
01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:53.080
I wouldn't know how to do it right now.
Oh,
interesting.
It's weird.
Very strange.

1380
01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.600
<v 0>What would you say that only a few people can do it?</v>

1381
01:21:55.601 --> 01:21:58.140
Like what's the separating thing?
Like what,

1382
01:21:58.141 --> 01:21:59.530
what keeps them from being able to do it?

1383
01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:04.590
<v 4>It's just so unorthodox and so crazy.
It's like a,</v>

1384
01:22:04.890 --> 01:22:07.980
some kind of pro wrestling move.
The jet,

1385
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:11.640
it's almost like from half card,
right?
Like on top and half car.

1386
01:22:11.641 --> 01:22:15.030
I don't even remember it.
Just twist the body in a weird way.

1387
01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:17.460
It's kind of Nice.
Yeah.

1388
01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.770
<v 0>So in a regular twister,</v>

1389
01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:23.280
you would be underneath with your half guard,

1390
01:22:23.281 --> 01:22:27.750
locked around the left leg and you'd be pulling on the head with your hands

1391
01:22:27.751 --> 01:22:31.950
clasped together.
But his was from the top position,
right?
Is that Hagen twist it.

1392
01:22:31.951 --> 01:22:35.970
Hagen trust her.
Oh,
here we go.
It doesn't say that.

1393
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.480
It says a half guard back.
Take to twister.
Oh,

1394
01:22:40.481 --> 01:22:41.160
this is different.

1395
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.760
<v 4>That won't,
that won't be it.
This is,
it's got to say,
Hey,
uh,</v>

1396
01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.640
R I g a n Higgins twister.

1397
01:22:47.710 --> 01:22:50.380
<v 0>Higgin Machado.
Twister.
He had his own way.</v>

1398
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:53.540
He might not have ever put it on youtube.
Probably highly likely did.

1399
01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:58.120
Might be up there.
Someone might know it came from that search.

1400
01:22:58.121 --> 01:23:02.590
That's why it was
amazing.
It's endless.
It's really is man.

1401
01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.300
Oh look,
it's a beautiful page.
Gets to take down page.
Just have,
ah,

1402
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:09.160
I should have stuck with it.
I'm joking.
You could still go back to it,
man.

1403
01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:14.050
I might.
I like,
I like boxing so much.
Anthony Jordan game.
Then when I started,

1404
01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:17.590
uh,
recently.
Beautiful.
Yeah.
What Scott Ross,

1405
01:23:17.591 --> 01:23:20.950
he would literally fall is where Scott at these days,

1406
01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.130
he's teaching at HQ and the daytime.

1407
01:23:24.970 --> 01:23:29.470
Daytime and nighttime has a school in Culver City.
Right.

1408
01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.780
And is applied to this store called the city.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.

1409
01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:34.210
On that point you could go there.
Look,
you're in Venice.
You're,

1410
01:23:34.211 --> 01:23:35.680
you're near a lot of places.
Yeah.

1411
01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:39.730
There's a lot of people that could teach you down there easily and well,

1412
01:23:39.731 --> 01:23:44.110
your boy Hernando is still down there.
Yeah.
And not so magnet.
Where's he at?
Yeah,

1413
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:47.170
I got to figure it out.
He's still in the same spot.
Yeah.

1414
01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.170
I like boxing so much though.
It's so hard.

1415
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.390
It's so hard.
It's so fucking hard.

1416
01:23:56.530 --> 01:23:59.890
You mean physically look just tarring and had a fucking spar learning how to

1417
01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:03.490
like slip a jack to Mr on kicks.
Yeah,
of course I do.

1418
01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.380
So why don't you take more time?
I'd like to,
where's a good school?

1419
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.620
There's gotta be a bunch of near you,
dude.
We,

1420
01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:16.050
anybody who can't find a good MMA or karate or anything school in MMA and a la

1421
01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:20.440
is crazy.
This is the spot.
Yeah,
I know.
I mean,

1422
01:24:20.441 --> 01:24:23.740
how many Goddamn Jujitsu schools are there,
Eddie?

1423
01:24:23.741 --> 01:24:26.320
How many 10th planets are there?
Just in La?

1424
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:31.150
I'm going to 10 plants in the southern California area.
That does,
I went to,

1425
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:36.460
yeah.
How many,
how many tenths plants are down here,
including San Diego or not?

1426
01:24:36.461 --> 01:24:39.990
Let's not include,
uh,

1427
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:46.570
probably 10.
Isn't that amazing?
It's crazy.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
It's crazy.

1428
01:24:46.571 --> 01:24:49.930
It's an almost a hundred worldwide guys,
man.
It's amazing.

1429
01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:56.210
I can't believe the Hashtag balling.
You earned it.
Yeah,
for sure.
It out.

1430
01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.730
You work hard.
You do work hard and you're innovative.
Thank you,
sir.
You're both,

1431
01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:02.110
you're an artist.

1432
01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:05.860
I don't think anybody gets by in this crazy competitive world unless you got

1433
01:25:05.861 --> 01:25:10.060
both.
You gotta.
You gotta be working hard and you gotta be thinking hard.

1434
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:13.680
You gotta be creative,
but you also gotta be disciplined.
Oh,
full mind.

1435
01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.600
Full mouth your mouth though.

1436
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:19.640
<v 9>Ooh.
Ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh.</v>

1437
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:24.350
<v 0>Oh,
beautiful.
Triangle triangle.</v>

1438
01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:29.820
Real close.
Almost.
Almost.
Almost so close.
So close.

1439
01:25:29.821 --> 01:25:33.930
Should be close.
Not quite there.
You got to get it all.

1440
01:25:33.931 --> 01:25:37.730
Now we're talking.
Now we're talking on bar now she's fucked.
Pay.

1441
01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:42.130
She fucked me the arm.
She's like eight out of 10 fucked.
She comes.

1442
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.960
If you pulled your arm across your totally fine.
Now she's fucked more.

1443
01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:47.770
A lot of time here.
Oh yeah.

1444
01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:51.270
The arm bar option under the armpit or you pulled across and get the regular

1445
01:25:51.271 --> 01:25:55.470
triangle.
Oh,
he's got to pull her head.
Well,
Paige is doing right.

1446
01:25:55.471 --> 01:25:58.050
There was a good Moodle punch her in the face,
punched in the face.

1447
01:25:58.110 --> 01:26:02.250
Get that arm to come into the arm now just tell me Shit.
Fuck.

1448
01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:04.130
Fucking is a little animal

1449
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:07.340
<v 5>is Matt.
She's got to pull her head.
That's all covered.</v>

1450
01:26:07.341 --> 01:26:10.760
I know now she should be thinking it's pulling or just telling her head,

1451
01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.280
pulling her head.
She's trying to get that on the other side,
you know?

1452
01:26:13.281 --> 01:26:18.230
Then now she's got,
she's got all the full wrap up.
Shit.
Wrap them.
Wrap it up.

1453
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.640
Wrap it up tight.
She ain't gonna tap man.
I'm telling you.

1454
01:26:22.641 --> 01:26:24.410
This girl doesn't go to sleep.
She's not tapping.

1455
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:29.770
You're gonna have to put her asleep.
Damn page is tough as shit.
Oh No.

1456
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:32.000
Look at all the time.

1457
01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:35.210
37 seconds to go and she went to make it out of this fucking red time.

1458
01:26:35.211 --> 01:26:37.070
You've got time.
He's just an animal.
She hasn't had,

1459
01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:40.460
I'm so impressed with that girl.
I mean how many girls are as hot as her?

1460
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:43.320
That her,
that fucking tough.
Yup.
Well what's going over the football?

1461
01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.100
I think they're both adorable.
Okay.
Someone's going to be.

1462
01:26:46.101 --> 01:26:49.430
That's because I'm an old man.
It's not as good.

1463
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:52.570
And she's dropped and bows dropping the hard bows.

1464
01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:57.670
He's got to go the
triangle.

1465
01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:02.490
It's got an angle and finish and she's going to run out of town.
Oh,
oh,

1466
01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:05.780
oh,
am I going down?
Why isn't she pulling the head?

1467
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:09.080
That's what she hasn't really committed to it.
No,
not no pulling in the head.

1468
01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:13.310
She was trying to do the legs.
She was trying to pull with the legs.

1469
01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.040
There was a Ben Saunders fight.
He fought a guy,
Brian Baker,

1470
01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:20.660
the fight that I called and he was doing like 10 different moves and you end up

1471
01:27:20.661 --> 01:27:24.050
losing that fight and at the end,
you know,
he's in the Middle East,
transitions,

1472
01:27:24.051 --> 01:27:26.900
whatever.
And,
and I think my broadcast part of the time goes,
man,

1473
01:27:26.901 --> 01:27:28.580
this is great transitions.
I go,

1474
01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.660
the problem is nobody taps to a toe hold triangle armbar risks lock.

1475
01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:35.480
It's the one you commit to.
And too many guys,
you know,

1476
01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:37.700
five transitions look as transitioning in,
but yeah,

1477
01:27:37.701 --> 01:27:41.510
but the one that gets you is the one you commit to all the way 100% and he

1478
01:27:41.511 --> 01:27:44.630
didn't do that enough.
They ended up rounding up,
going into losing the decision,

1479
01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:48.780
but if he chained to one and one stuck,
you'd be impressed by it.
Right.

1480
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:51.530
That's all my other of whether whether or not once did I didn't see,

1481
01:27:51.531 --> 01:27:54.230
I didn't see that commitment to that one in a sense.
You know what I mean?

1482
01:27:54.231 --> 01:27:57.320
Like I think she had the armor and the triangle was kind of halfway with all of

1483
01:27:57.321 --> 01:27:57.590
them.

1484
01:27:57.590 --> 01:28:00.610
I think she just needed to pull the head if she has grabbed the back of the head

1485
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:04.060
count and compare them to have faith in your triangle.
I told him,
I said,

1486
01:28:04.061 --> 01:28:05.000
have faith in your triangle.

1487
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.940
Too many people go triangle it doesn't work in two seconds and they go to the

1488
01:28:07.941 --> 01:28:10.850
onboard and let the,
let the guy breathe again.
Commit to your triangle.

1489
01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.860
When you deal with someone like Paige vanzant.

1490
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:15.560
It's the difference between trying to put someone asleep and trying to make

1491
01:28:15.561 --> 01:28:18.590
someone tap.
You can't try and make her tap.
You've got to try to put her asleep.

1492
01:28:18.990 --> 01:28:22.010
I really think that's what you got to do with her.
This little girl is a savage.

1493
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.630
She's a little beautiful savage,
but she's down to rounds none to,

1494
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:28.640
but she's still got those crazy switch kicks,
man.

1495
01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:30.980
She's super athletic with that shit too.

1496
01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:35.840
She goes from the outside and then she commits to these wild jumping roundhouse

1497
01:28:35.841 --> 01:28:38.750
kicks.
Damn guys,
I've got to run.
Oh,

1498
01:28:38.751 --> 01:28:43.430
you fucking fuck.
I know.
I gotta pick my family.
Well,

1499
01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:47.210
you gotta do what you gotta do.
How about you stay for 10 more minutes.
All right.

1500
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:50.750
Thanks idea.
But I'm doing it.
That wasn't a hard sell either.

1501
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:54.840
You went right for that.
You just gave right in.
Well,
I got to stay.

1502
01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:58.430
You're okay and watch this.
Yeah,
you just got to tell your family.
They can wait.

1503
01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:00.380
It's gonna have to wait on the curb.
Yeah,
you're in the year.

1504
01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.980
Tail wasn't safe to America.

1505
01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:06.510
<v 0>Not In Guatemala.
Fucking beam got that flew.
I had asked us for 10 days.</v>

1506
01:29:06.850 --> 01:29:11.610
We got a viral rash.
I had it to Jimmy who were doing our podcast.
I was coughing.

1507
01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:15.420
I'm done now when you're down for,
I was down for it.
I was down for two days.

1508
01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.130
But you know why?
Because I saw it coming.

1509
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.340
Oh there's that jumping around house kicked.
I saw it coming and I was like,

1510
01:29:20.341 --> 01:29:24.120
you know what,
this is,
don't feel normal.
Right.
This feels like a little extra.

1511
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:26.490
So you slept?
Yeah,
I just stayed in bed.

1512
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.980
The beautiful thing of being self employed.
My son got it.
Fuck his friends.

1513
01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:36.570
Got his friend's,
mom's got Alex.
Yeah,
my youngest got it.

1514
01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:38.910
And she got over it and that day,
like a little wolverine.

1515
01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.610
My kids eat a lot of probiotics.
Man.
I got to meet and by okay.

1516
01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:49.350
And different probiotics and taking probiotic little snacks.
Fuck.

1517
01:29:49.351 --> 01:29:54.120
It makes a big difference.
So important.
I take too many of those.
I don't know.

1518
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:58.050
Can you hear us talking about healthy food?
Have you heard of Sheila?

1519
01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:02.360
Jot The tar from um,
from the Himalayas.

1520
01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:06.310
It's loaded with trace minerals.
Sounds like it's from the Himalayas.
No,

1521
01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:09.900
we taste like garbage supposedly.
It's a shit.

1522
01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:13.920
She's got to be careful with that over and over and over again going to that

1523
01:30:13.921 --> 01:30:17.790
well without jumping round kick because if a girl's got a real good right hand

1524
01:30:17.791 --> 01:30:20.760
and she times that shit take you right after.
Yeah,

1525
01:30:20.761 --> 01:30:24.360
take you right off your feet and you're going to get fucking hurt because she's

1526
01:30:24.361 --> 01:30:26.130
throwing it and she's fully committing to it.

1527
01:30:26.131 --> 01:30:29.160
Meaning like she throws her arms into it so our hands are down.

1528
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:33.840
Her Chin's up in the air like it's on a flag pole and it's a beautiful technique

1529
01:30:33.841 --> 01:30:36.150
of Atlanta.
But the problem is she,
she CalEd Beck wrong.

1530
01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:39.600
See She just tried to go do it again.
Like that well is tapped.

1531
01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:42.810
She's going to that well a lie hands are down too and she's kind of kick it.

1532
01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:48.330
She,
you know,
when she CalEd Beck Rawlings with it,
it was so sensational.

1533
01:30:48.331 --> 01:30:50.930
I think that's become like her shit.
You get hooked on it.

1534
01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:55.550
Hooked on that feeling I've seen all the time.
Yep.
Oh Nice.
Ooh.

1535
01:30:56.150 --> 01:31:00.870
Karch is much cleaner with the striking.
She's doing like basics,

1536
01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:05.460
technical basics,
and she's got a good timing with her right hand.

1537
01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:10.890
Clark's definitely had two rounds to know.
Oh,
for sure.
For sure.
See,

1538
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:13.920
it goes again.
She's going to it again and you watch when she does it,

1539
01:31:13.921 --> 01:31:18.820
that left hand goes right down to her hips to fucking soak.
Dangerous.

1540
01:31:18.821 --> 01:31:22.390
She might be,
it's good every now and then,
but it,
Ooh,
right man.

1541
01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.630
He's just makes her pay every time she comes close with us.

1542
01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:29.510
If you're doing that against a man who is a kol artist,
oh,

1543
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.800
almost landed that flying name.
Hey Dude,
she could land it,

1544
01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:37.140
but what I'm saying as she's making it very obvious that that's our goto shit.

1545
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:40.620
She does it so often and it's an unusual move.
See,

1546
01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:41.730
she's tried to do it right there.

1547
01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:45.540
She takes his big step and then she tried to jump and throw around.
I mean,

1548
01:31:45.630 --> 01:31:48.990
who the fuck does a jumping routes?
Just two in a row right there.

1549
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:53.610
Who the fuck does this that much?
Yeah,
you're Rodriguez.
No more than her hit me.

1550
01:31:53.611 --> 01:31:55.590
Then she does it more than him.

1551
01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:00.010
She does it more than anybody is like her go to shit as a jumping switch kick.

1552
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.120
Like that's crazy.
I don't even care if that lands like,
just looks good.
It again.

1553
01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:07.840
Oh,
left hand behind it though.
It does look good.
At least she's doing something.

1554
01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:12.520
Yeah.
Well look,
she's going,
she's going after her and she's behind.
Yeah,

1555
01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:13.331
she's going after it.

1556
01:32:13.331 --> 01:32:16.570
She's trying to win by knockout Paige vanzant and presses his shit out of me.

1557
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:21.010
She's,
she's tough.
And again,
just keeps coming up is a button.
Yup.

1558
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:27.270
You know,
cute as a button on.
Oh Shit.
Fucking barbarian.
Yep.

1559
01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:33.590
Good athlete.
Good movement.
Eh?
Like why

1560
01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:39.120
didn't anybody see Claressa shields fight last night?
No page.

1561
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.030
Santa has a broken arm right now.
She does what?

1562
01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:45.970
She told her corner after the first round.
Which arm must be the left,
right?
Yeah,

1563
01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:49.960
the left she's,
she's holding for.
Yikes.
Wow.

1564
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.700
That's probably why she keeps throwing.

1565
01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:54.460
That's probably why she keeps throwing it.
Yeah,
it's definitely the left.

1566
01:32:54.461 --> 01:32:58.150
See how she's extended and she's not punching with it.
Wow.
That's crazy.
Ouch.

1567
01:32:58.210 --> 01:33:01.660
Yeah.
Wow.
That's fucking nuts,
man.
She must've got kicked with something.

1568
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:02.790
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1569
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:06.590
<v 0>Oh Shit.
Still Game's still going at it alone for it.</v>

1570
01:33:06.630 --> 01:33:10.140
Toughest fuck dude.
Well that makes sense now why she keeps going to the,

1571
01:33:10.141 --> 01:33:11.870
well with that jumping round kick.
That's,

1572
01:33:11.871 --> 01:33:15.750
that's what she's got from the left side.
Oh Damn.
Oh,
kick to the body.

1573
01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:20.130
It's a good scrap hall.
What's her name?
[inaudible] fundamentals,
ma'am.
Yeah,

1574
01:33:20.131 --> 01:33:23.190

Yeah,
that's what I'm thinking.
Oh,
it's her right arm.

1575
01:33:23.191 --> 01:33:27.920
Interesting to right arm.
Wow.
Wow.
Owns in there.
Wow.
She goes right to the Raj.

1576
01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.600

They moved the whole front bar area.
They took it out and expanded the showroom.

1597
01:34:47.971 --> 01:34:52.700
people listening to a podcast,
which is weird.
I mean different planets.

1598
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.560
Oh Shit.
Fucking bullshit.

1599
01:34:57.410 --> 01:35:00.080
What are you talking you?
We hear you shut the door.

1600
01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:07.050
Was he trying to do,
he asked what the man,
he's like,

1601
01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.300
this is MMA,
right?

1602
01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:15.700
Brian Cowan is on a podcast that is about fighting the fighter and the kid and

1603
01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:20.420
barely pays attention to this board.
I mean it's like his,

1604
01:35:20.710 --> 01:35:25.550
his big Gig is him being on the podcast and it's half the fun.

1605
01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.970
Is Brendan going,
how do you not know this?
How do you not know this?

1606
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.490
So Shab is home right now with the flu.
Is He?
Yeah,
that's why I called you.

1607
01:35:34.670 --> 01:35:37.940
I called it today.
He was in the backup.
That's cool.
Listen,
I'll call you again.

1608
01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:42.470
But he was going to be here and it was last minute.
He's like,
dude,
I'm too sick.

1609
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:46.700
He was working in Portland and he's like,
I'm coughing so bad I can't do this.

1610
01:35:46.710 --> 01:35:50.990
I said,
my man Jimmy Smits around three now she meets him is so gangster later,

1611
01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:53.380
whichever.
I just want you to know.
He drives here in uh,

1612
01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.290
1968 Firebird stock.
Yes.

1613
01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:01.160
Fully stock stock seed stock breaks,
doc poses.

1614
01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:06.380
He's driving a 1968 car.
Like it's 1968.
That's my only car.

1615
01:36:06.381 --> 01:36:09.030
And that's how you get to also like how do they know that's all I drive it on.

1616
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:12.590
That's very good.
Your mechanic?
No,
I just,
well I,
I like,

1617
01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:16.730
I can keep up with certain things,
but I'm on the road so much.

1618
01:36:16.731 --> 01:36:18.530
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't,
like,

1619
01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:21.830
it would be in a garage all the time and that's very gangster.

1620
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:26.300
But even before that and it got,
it got rear ended and I had to get it,

1621
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:27.530
I need to get it replaced.
Yeah.

1622
01:36:27.531 --> 01:36:31.700
The 69 Barracuda is a beautiful year or two under appreciated year.

1623
01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:35.510
I had a 70.
And that's the bigger body.
It's a different one,

1624
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:38.870
but in everybody knows that one.
Is that a head one?
Yeah.

1625
01:36:38.871 --> 01:36:41.990
And it's also like what the new challenge it looks like.
Right.

1626
01:36:41.991 --> 01:36:44.060
The new challenges,
like sort of a version of that.

1627
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:49.330
But that older one is really unique in the muscle car world at 69 68 Barracuda,

1628
01:36:49.791 --> 01:36:50.690
it's a weirder shit.

1629
01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:54.780
Hard to find harder to find parts for a bed and to get the dash from like uh,
uh,

1630
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:59.180
uh,
like a,
a junk yard in Hawaiian eye or some shit.
We know what they're doing.

1631
01:36:59.181 --> 01:37:02.930
It's really interesting.
Now a lot of companies are,
um,
there was a news company,

1632
01:37:02.931 --> 01:37:04.160
Steve Strope was just telling me about it,

1633
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:09.370
that are making a 1969 Camaro from the ground up with all new parts,

1634
01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:14.490
making everything,
all the fenders.
They're making the subframe,

1635
01:37:14.530 --> 01:37:17.960
they're making the,
the,
the doors,
the dash panels,

1636
01:37:17.961 --> 01:37:22.450
like they're making a 1969 Camaro,
but it's not from 1969.

1637
01:37:22.451 --> 01:37:27.110
It's from 2018 I've heard crazy.
I've heard about people doing that same thing,

1638
01:37:27.111 --> 01:37:30.230
but the internal parts are all like eco friendly,

1639
01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:33.090
but it runs same frame and everything and the,

1640
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:35.060
they're doing crazy shit and I've heard of that.
Yeah.

1641
01:37:35.061 --> 01:37:39.830
There's a Mustang that's like an 850 horsepower electric Mustang that someone in

1642
01:37:39.831 --> 01:37:42.890
Texas made and it's a 1968 Mustang,

1643
01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.450
but it's just some fucking beast fuck electric engine.
Wow.

1644
01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:51.160
Patrons.
And with a spinning back fist there.
Oh,
that's when she broke her arm.

1645
01:37:51.170 --> 01:37:56.040
Looks like,
oh wow.
She broke it on a spinning back fist.
That's,
that's crazy.

1646
01:37:56.610 --> 01:38:00.960
Fuck yeah.
These bones are weak as shit,
man.
Hey,
crack.
So easy.

1647
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:07.770
Once again.
Tim Silvia.
Frank Mir.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Didn't and try to keep fighting.

1648
01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:10.920
I remember,
remember every Boone herb dean was so much like,

1649
01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.750
and then they saw the refit like,
oh,
okay,
yeah,

1650
01:38:12.751 --> 01:38:16.320
we got to point it out in the replay too.
We had to say slow it down.
Slow down.

1651
01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:18.240
What's that?
That's a broken arm.

1652
01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:20.040
Like that thing is not supposed to bend like that.

1653
01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:23.940
What was your worst on air in terms of like,

1654
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.530
oh fuck moment.
Corey Hill and Anderson Silva,
those two leg breaks,

1655
01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:32.490
both of them feel worse because the referee didn't see it.

1656
01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:37.380
And so I threw my headset off and I jumped up and I was screaming,
stop.

1657
01:38:37.381 --> 01:38:42.030
The fight stopped the fight because the referee was in an odd position and the

1658
01:38:42.031 --> 01:38:45.930
leg,
he kicked the leg snapped.
I saw the Lego rubber.

1659
01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.270
I saw his lego down.

1660
01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:52.110
I saw him go down and then I forget who he was fighting was on top of him

1661
01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:56.490
hitting him and the referee wasn't,
it wasn't,
it wasn't on it.

1662
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:59.100
He just wasn't aware.
He was in a bad position.
You know,

1663
01:38:59.101 --> 01:39:00.620
he's looking at the punches being landed.

1664
01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.750
He didn't realize that the leg had been snapped.
Those two were the worst.

1665
01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:07.950
There's Corey.
We did one.
It was,

1666
01:39:08.590 --> 01:39:11.650
oh,
I see.

1667
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:16.160
So the referee calls over there and uh,
Corey Hill,
uh,

1668
01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:20.670
rest in peace.
He died.
Fears bag.
That ain't gone know.

1669
01:39:20.671 --> 01:39:25.170
Knock out of fucking,
oh,
so that's the UFC performance institute.

1670
01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:28.680
I went there two weeks ago when I was in Vegas.
Holy Shit.

1671
01:39:28.681 --> 01:39:33.510
Is that place impressive?
I mean,
have you been there Eddie?
Yeah.
Fuck man.

1672
01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:38.380
Amazing.
Did Tony Train there?
No,
I had a meeting at Ebi.
Meebo.
Right,

1673
01:39:38.381 --> 01:39:41.840
right,
right.
Oh,
nice.
Forest forest.

1674
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.220
How amazing is that place did,
it's incredible.

1675
01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.980
It's one of the coolest places I've ever seen.
I was like,
oh my God,

1676
01:39:49.981 --> 01:39:51.170
I want to live here,
dude.

1677
01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:54.840
The screen where you can record your sparring and it's like an NFL thing where

1678
01:39:54.841 --> 01:39:57.870
you can write notes and circles and all this shit on it and give it to your

1679
01:39:57.871 --> 01:39:58.570
coach.

1680
01:39:58.570 --> 01:40:02.430
They were recording it in 360 degrees so they can look at you from any angle.

1681
01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:05.250
Yeah,
it's fucking incredible.
It's so cool.

1682
01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:08.190
And then they have all these different recovery stations.

1683
01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:13.370
They have a cryo machine that goes down to like 240 degrees below zero and then

1684
01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:19.110
up to 170 degrees above zero.

1685
01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:24.090
You can go hot cold inside the machine.
Like which is what the fuck.

1686
01:40:24.091 --> 01:40:27.870
It's crazy that like three pools of different temperatures for like,

1687
01:40:27.871 --> 01:40:30.330
well they have,
but they have two pools that are different temperatures.

1688
01:40:30.330 --> 01:40:33.490
One really hot one and run really cold one with their degrees.

1689
01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.720
And there's one your [inaudible].
That's my video.
Oh,
okay.

1690
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:38.840
And then there's a treadmill to your left and a pool.

1691
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:41.550
And that's Angela hills on that one right here while I'm filming.

1692
01:40:41.551 --> 01:40:42.890
And she's running their shoes.
Yeah.

1693
01:40:43.130 --> 01:40:47.850
And trust me with running on this treadmill that lifts,
lifts and lowers.

1694
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.510
And you could watch your running form on these little screens.

1695
01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:55.900
Get a c I think.
Uh,
I think I cut to the screen.
She was joking around butter,

1696
01:40:55.930 --> 01:41:00.930
but you can check out the screen and you could see like your form to make sure

1697
01:41:01.451 --> 01:41:06.010
that your landing ball of the foot first,
you know,
with proper running form,

1698
01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.020
the fucking whole place is incredible.

1699
01:41:08.021 --> 01:41:10.270
They have sleep pods that you get in there,

1700
01:41:10.271 --> 01:41:14.760
like these lounge chairs and it's like some Scifi movie with his big ag comes

1701
01:41:14.761 --> 01:41:19.510
down over the Darth Vader.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1702
01:41:19.511 --> 01:41:22.570
The sleep pods.
So you line down there,
it's playing music and shit.

1703
01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.260
Dude off the charts.
I mean they have everything.

1704
01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:30.010
So last week I'm on your podcast and I can say it now.

1705
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:32.860
You were talking about the performance center.
Well,

1706
01:41:32.861 --> 01:41:36.010
I had gotten a tour of that when I met Dana white and everybody like two weeks

1707
01:41:36.011 --> 01:41:39.560
ago.
So I was like,
whoa.
Yeah,

1708
01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:45.280
yeah.
So anyway,
I got a tiny thing,
but it's kind of funny if you said yeah,

1709
01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:50.680
that seems familiar with that.
Yeah.
Amazing.
Yeah,

1710
01:41:50.681 --> 01:41:54.580
we were hoping that we were going to be able to imagine at the,
on the podcast,

1711
01:41:54.581 --> 01:41:59.230
but things take,
take time.
Paperwork,
man.
It takes,
it takes a minute.
Yeah.
And Hey,

1712
01:41:59.231 --> 01:42:03.850
congratulations to our boy.
Big John McCarthy.
Jacques Dude call him.

1713
01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:08.360
He'll be very good at that.
He's the new took over for me,
I felt.
Oh really?
Yeah.

1714
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:12.490
Yeah.
He'll be great at that.
He'll be great at that.

1715
01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:15.850
I think he's going to be awesome at that.
Um,
we're trying to work,
he's like,

1716
01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:19.870
I didn't know he was living in Vegas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They moved.

1717
01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:22.060
Get tired of flying to Vegas all the time for fights,

1718
01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:26.650
so just fucking moved to Vegas.
That's the kind of guy big John Is.
He is man.

1719
01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:27.970
But he lives out in the burbs.

1720
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.290
He's not like a on the Strip going to fucking hockey song every night.
Yeah.

1721
01:42:32.291 --> 01:42:35.440
I think he'll do a good job,
man.
I do know.
He'll be great.
He'll be great.

1722
01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:39.370
He's really happy about that person.
Yeah,
he'll be great.
You know,
I mean,

1723
01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.350
you talk about a guy who's seen literally every major fight.

1724
01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:49.930
I mean,
he was the go to guy for over a decade.

1725
01:42:50.170 --> 01:42:53.920
Like every big fight had to have big John McCarthy as a referee.
You know,

1726
01:42:53.921 --> 01:42:56.650
after a while a lot of guys have gotten like some of the calls for some of the

1727
01:42:56.651 --> 01:42:57.630
big,
big fights.
But yeah,

1728
01:42:58.210 --> 01:43:02.080
he's the gold standard and the guy knows so much about the sport and he's a

1729
01:43:02.081 --> 01:43:03.150
legit black belt.

1730
01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:06.280
He's not going to ref anymore now he's not gonna refer anymore for a while,

1731
01:43:06.281 --> 01:43:10.330
but he always could go back to it.
Do you know he's got two or three?

1732
01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.770
I might be at least two fake discs in his neck and then I think it might be

1733
01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:18.970
three and then he just got some shit fuse to Dale.
Yeah,

1734
01:43:20.050 --> 01:43:24.960
that Jujitsu is a motherfucker was a mother fucker and your joints man and

1735
01:43:24.970 --> 01:43:27.160
you're back.
You hear about so many people.

1736
01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.990
I got this thing I want to show you an every grappler should get one of these.

1737
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:36.570
You should get one for the gym.
It's called an iron neck and it was created by a,

1738
01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:41.580
this guy who is a former football player and he created it to deal with CTE.

1739
01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:43.840
He's like a lot of what these guys are getting,

1740
01:43:43.841 --> 01:43:46.390
they're getting from their head getting snapped and he's like,

1741
01:43:46.391 --> 01:43:48.700
and I think you can mitigate a lot of that with neck strength,

1742
01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:52.130
but a lot of the different things that people create for neck strength.

1743
01:43:52.131 --> 01:43:54.770
This is him.
Show me how to do it.
We got one here,

1744
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:59.120
so you strap this thing on your head,
you pump it up,
it's like a Reebok pump.

1745
01:43:59.121 --> 01:44:00.410
Remember those pumps?
We pressed it,

1746
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:05.240
it gets real tight to your head and then you're pulling on that bungee cord.

1747
01:44:05.241 --> 01:44:09.800
That black cord is 50 pounds of resistance and so I'm pulling back and he's like

1748
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:13.670
straightened out my posture and then there's resistance and turning the band

1749
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:17.750
phenomenal.
I love that thing.
I love it.
How often do you do it?

1750
01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:20.600
Whenever I want to.
I have it.
I have one in my house and I have one here,

1751
01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:25.940
so I do it all the time.
I did it yesterday as part of my workout yesterday.

1752
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:28.580
I still,
I like to start off my workout with it.
Um,

1753
01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:32.240
I put that fucker on and I go through a whole series of Stevie wonder's.

1754
01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:37.370
It was like you have it on your head and you go like this.
And what it does is,

1755
01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.700
you know,
he's real big on it.
Aaron Peko,
he loves that thing.

1756
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:44.240
He said it turned his neck into a weapon.
You know,
and for me,

1757
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:48.770
I had some pretty big problems with my neck for a while.
Um,

1758
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.720
I think from,
uh,

1759
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:54.740
two things from not tapping and two from head unarmed chokes,
cause I always,

1760
01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:59.150
I was doing a lot of head nom chokes on this side.
Oh,
is using,

1761
01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:03.050
you're always using your neck,
your neck becomes a part of your game.

1762
01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:08.630
And uh,
I never really strengthened my neck other than training.

1763
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:13.040
And this,
this has made a big fucking difference.
Is that Johnny Hendricks?

1764
01:45:13.041 --> 01:45:15.020
So is that like a fact that it looks like Johnny Hendricks?

1765
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:19.940
It's not Jonny Andrews.
Sorry,
fat guy.
You're not really fat,
Bro.

1766
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:24.410
You're not fat.
You're not,
you're not ripped.
Like Michael Johnson,

1767
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:28.340
but you're not fat.
I'm just talking shit.
But that machine,
um,

1768
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:32.260
is like one of the best methods I've ever found of,

1769
01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:35.570
of strengthened in your neck.
Stabilizing your neck.

1770
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:38.660
Edit that out about me calling that guy fat.

1771
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:43.970
Sometimes you say things,
you just talk.
Yeah.
Just comes out of your mouth.

1772
01:45:43.971 --> 01:45:47.600
You know what I mean?
To forgot.
I'm going to say,
listen buddy,
I'm fat.
Um,

1773
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:50.510
but this,
uh,
machine,
actually it's not fat at all,

1774
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:56.180
but this machine is fucking phenomenal.
I just,
I'm a,
I'm a giant fan of it.

1775
01:45:56.870 --> 01:46:01.010
You can either have it on a bungee cord or some people put it on them.

1776
01:46:01.011 --> 01:46:05.360
Cable machines,
like out.
Imagine if you were some Frances and Ghana with fellow,

1777
01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:08.630
you would want even more resistance.
Oh,
that's an Austin.
They're doing that.
The,

1778
01:46:08.631 --> 01:46:11.980
uh,
the Onnit gym.
Um,

1779
01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:15.770
I'm a big fan of this thing and think every grappler in particular,

1780
01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:18.640
because how many people have fucking neck problems?
I mean,

1781
01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:22.310
to not have him as weird.
Yeah,
it is.
And I'm,

1782
01:46:22.311 --> 01:46:24.470
and I think this is a great machine,

1783
01:46:24.471 --> 01:46:26.870
but I think there's a bunch of other things you should do as well.

1784
01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:31.790
I'm a big believer in shrugs,
I think for,
for grapplers,

1785
01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.800
just protecting that whole area of building up all that muscle in the back area

1786
01:46:37.090 --> 01:46:41.830
and you get them fucking Overeem traps.
Remember Overeem?
Overeem?

1787
01:46:42.130 --> 01:46:46.310
Yeah.
Those believable,
they started at the top of his ear and was robbed down.

1788
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:49.980
Yup.
You know what I got recently that,
um,
I'd like

1789
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.960
<v 4>to recommend is,
you know,</v>

1790
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:56.640
I have something really wrong with my right shoulder and I like to sleep on my

1791
01:46:56.641 --> 01:46:58.380
side.
So sometimes man,

1792
01:46:58.381 --> 01:47:01.770
I wake up in the middle of the night and my shoulder's sore just from sleeping

1793
01:47:01.771 --> 01:47:04.620
wrong on it.
It sucks putting all your weight on it.

1794
01:47:04.621 --> 01:47:07.590
And after a while fucking and I got the flu like you did too.

1795
01:47:07.591 --> 01:47:11.640
I got it last week for a day.
I was in bed for 24 hours and man,

1796
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.940
my shoulder was killing me from being sick in bed.

1797
01:47:15.450 --> 01:47:19.530
So I got this pillow that's for people that have acid reflux.
It's,

1798
01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:24.570
it's a sloped pillow and there's a hole in it where you could put your arm under

1799
01:47:25.130 --> 01:47:29.100
and you sleep on the side.
I'm in love with it.
I've seen it.
It's called,

1800
01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:33.600
it's called Med Klein,
Maggie Klein.
It's awesome.

1801
01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:35.490
And you could see both,
both sides.

1802
01:47:35.491 --> 01:47:37.620
And there's like this snake pill that goes through it.

1803
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.840
So your arm is feeling beautiful.

1804
01:47:39.841 --> 01:47:44.310
There's no pressure on it and you're on your side.
Um,
oh look at that.
That's it.

1805
01:47:44.370 --> 01:47:47.520
That's it.
That's a weird looking dude.
I'm telling you.

1806
01:47:47.521 --> 01:47:51.120
I'm in love with this thing,
man.
It's incredible.
No Shit.
Yes.

1807
01:47:51.121 --> 01:47:54.690
I think maybe that's a big part of my shoulder problem.

1808
01:47:54.691 --> 01:47:57.120
Maybe I'm thinking cause like,
yeah,

1809
01:47:57.121 --> 01:47:59.820
just like I sleep on my side and I know that you're not supposed to,

1810
01:47:59.821 --> 01:48:02.820
you supposed to sleep flat on your back.
I cannot sleep flat on my back.

1811
01:48:02.821 --> 01:48:06.810
I gotta be on either side.
I'm always switching to one side to the next.

1812
01:48:06.811 --> 01:48:10.680
Well when you,
you started lifting heavy again,
um,

1813
01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:14.100
after you got those cortisone shots,
you said her shoulder was feeling amazing.

1814
01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:17.610
Yeah.
And then you told me you were doing bench.
I was like,
like batches,

1815
01:48:17.611 --> 01:48:19.020
one of the worst things for your shoulds,

1816
01:48:19.021 --> 01:48:21.870
I should have never got a cortisone shot.
That was the big mistake right there.

1817
01:48:21.871 --> 01:48:25.050
I got talked into it by a doctor I wanted,

1818
01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:30.060
I went into the doctor to get a prescription for an Mri and I told them what I,

1819
01:48:30.061 --> 01:48:34.350
you know,
my shoulder's been,
just doesn't heal.
It's just constantly bothering me.

1820
01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:37.560
And he did a couple tests and he said,
hey,
you don't have any tears,

1821
01:48:37.561 --> 01:48:40.620
but what's wrong is you're the tendon that's connecting your bicep to your

1822
01:48:40.621 --> 01:48:44.940
shoulder.
It's thrashed.
But if we put a cortisone shot in there,
you'll be fine.

1823
01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:49.560
And I grew up a big football fan and I always thought cortisone shots,

1824
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:52.890
but an athlete takes,
you know,
for,
to play the rest of the game.

1825
01:48:52.891 --> 01:48:55.530
But he's going to pay for it afterwards.
But just to get through the game,

1826
01:48:55.710 --> 01:48:56.670
give them a cortisone shot.

1827
01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:00.720
I thought it was just a painkiller and that's what I told him.
And he said,
no,

1828
01:49:00.721 --> 01:49:05.190
it's a big myth that it actually heals the tendon.
And I,
I said,
really?
I said,

1829
01:49:05.191 --> 01:49:09.590
okay.
So he did it.
He said,
don't do shit for 10 days.
I didn't.
Then it,

1830
01:49:09.591 --> 01:49:11.460
it actually did,
it felt amazing.

1831
01:49:11.461 --> 01:49:15.600
And then I started lifting again and I started lifting heavier than ever.

1832
01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:18.870
And then about,
uh,
and dude,

1833
01:49:18.871 --> 01:49:21.330
like all the time I started doing your little,
uh,

1834
01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:22.500
that routine you were talking about.

1835
01:49:22.501 --> 01:49:26.490
Some Russian said that you're supposed to do the,
the same body parts,

1836
01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:31.710
like,
uh,
uh,
not just once a week,
but like,
you know,

1837
01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:34.710
every time you go in and hit the same body parts,
just don't hit them that hard.

1838
01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:39.120
Remember that preceded the groove.
Yeah.
So that's what I started doing.

1839
01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:41.320
But then I started doing DH,

1840
01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:45.450
working the same body part every time I went to the gym,
the gym,

1841
01:49:45.451 --> 01:49:48.520
I did chest hard every time I went to the gym back hard.

1842
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:51.520
Every time I went to the gym I was doing a complete body workouts.

1843
01:49:51.521 --> 01:49:54.970
It just slowly morphed into that.
And I always want her to go to failure.

1844
01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.360
And then within two months the pain started coming back and then it just slowly

1845
01:50:00.521 --> 01:50:04.750
progressed.
And now it's worse than ever.
So I'll never get an MRI.
Yeah.
And I am.

1846
01:50:04.810 --> 01:50:08.020
I am.
I am.
I just got the prescription for that last week.

1847
01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:10.280
All I gotta do is go in.
Now I'm going to go get that checked out.

1848
01:50:10.281 --> 01:50:14.240
And it's such a common injury,
you know so many guys.

1849
01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:18.220
But that pillow though was helping.
That pillow is huge.

1850
01:50:18.450 --> 01:50:20.610
<v 0>I'm going to get one that's interesting.
Looks Awesome.
All right.</v>

1851
01:50:20.611 --> 01:50:24.960
We're about to hit the main event.
Jeremy Stevens just showed up.
Oh Shit.

1852
01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:26.040
Jeremy Stevens,

1853
01:50:26.730 --> 01:50:30.300
he's a tough fucking out at 145 pounds.

1854
01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:35.220
That's a big 45 or,
I mean,
he's fucking big for that weight class

1855
01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:42.750
and he's coming off of that fight against,

1856
01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:46.050
who the fuck did he just fight?

1857
01:50:47.250 --> 01:50:52.250
He had a real good fight against a veteran where he kicked the shit out of his

1858
01:50:53.311 --> 01:50:56.370
legs.
I want to say Jim Miller.
No,

1859
01:50:56.371 --> 01:50:59.220
but that would be 55 13 first round

1860
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:06.210
finishes,
right?
Seventh by knockout second.

1861
01:51:06.211 --> 01:51:09.880
Most of knockdowns in UFC history.
He's an animal.
He's the best.

1862
01:51:10.450 --> 01:51:15.180
So he beat Gilbert Melendez.
Knockdowns in UFC history.

1863
01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:18.270
Crazy.
That's incredible.
He's a fucking animal.

1864
01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:23.070
I remember his prior Kao of Dos Anjos.
Yeah.
Stunning.

1865
01:51:23.071 --> 01:51:26.430
Stunning.
Upper cut.
Boom.
Next snap an uppercut.

1866
01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:31.410
He's a fucking animal.
Dennis Bermudez at flying knee against the cage.

1867
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:36.390
Jeremy Stephens,
honey,
Jason,
that head kick.
Woo.
He's got a ton of a man.

1868
01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:40.290
That's his thing.
It's a fucking animal.
I'm excited about this fight too.

1869
01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:44.010
Cause do Ho Troy brings it and he's got a clean right hand.

1870
01:51:44.210 --> 01:51:48.480
That right hand comes down the pipe like a piston.

1871
01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:52.620
Isn't he going to the Korean army though for awhile?
No,
no.

1872
01:51:52.621 --> 01:51:56.310
That's a chance on John the Korean Zombie.
He went two years.
No Korean.

1873
01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:58.570
He came by.
This guy's got,
he's going to,
well

1874
01:52:01.050 --> 01:52:03.570
maybe I'll do eventually.
Wow.

1875
01:52:03.571 --> 01:52:06.120
That's a bummer for guys that are like world class fighter.

1876
01:52:06.121 --> 01:52:09.090
They should think they should give him a little break.
You know,

1877
01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:11.370
let him put that shit off.
Nope.

1878
01:52:12.090 --> 01:52:16.470
Two years baby sacrifice.
Do Ho choice.

1879
01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:19.080
Here we go baby.

1880
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:25.560
<v 4>It is,
uh,
it is,
uh,
I mean,
uh,
from uh,
a ruler standpoint.</v>

1881
01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:29.400
It's actually a great idea.
I make everybody go to the army for two years,
right?

1882
01:52:29.850 --> 01:52:33.150
<v 0>It's not a bad idea if you want to instill patriotism and people too.
And,</v>

1883
01:52:33.151 --> 01:52:38.070
and understanding of like what it means to have a country,
you know what is,

1884
01:52:38.071 --> 01:52:42.030
what does it mean to have an armed service if you're just some soft fat,

1885
01:52:42.031 --> 01:52:46.200
little pudgy fuck.
Like me sitting back letting the soldiers do all the work.

1886
01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:51.700
You actually have to go and do it yourself and you're actually over there.
Oh,

1887
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:55.280
they gotta worry about is North Korea.
That's it.
No one else is messing it down.

1888
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:59.480
Well China,
China's on the side of North Korea.
That's part of the problem.

1889
01:52:59.690 --> 01:53:02.330
That's a part of our problem with negotiating clear war.

1890
01:53:03.290 --> 01:53:06.140
Most people don't know North Korea and South Korea,
they signed a cease fire.

1891
01:53:06.141 --> 01:53:09.140
They never signed an armistice,
so then there's no peace treaty.

1892
01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:13.390
They just will stop fighting for right now.
I didn't help Hawaii the other day.

1893
01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:17.690
Yeah.
What the fuck man,
I done fucking with us.

1894
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:20.960
Kelly Slater's Instagram.
I was like what?

1895
01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:26.140
There was a fake nuclear or a fake missile warning that a missile was coming in

1896
01:53:26.931 --> 01:53:31.400
and they said it was not a drill,
like how was that a wrong button kind of thing.

1897
01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:36.460
Like go through a few people before it goes out to the whole state and getting a

1898
01:53:39.351 --> 01:53:44.120
phone call and you have the option to like say,
Hey,
I'll call you back.

1899
01:53:44.121 --> 01:53:45.410
I'm driving.
You know,

1900
01:53:45.411 --> 01:53:48.170
like it's one of the two or three options that you could just press.
Yeah.

1901
01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:51.680
Is one of them.
Hey,
and intercontinental ballistic missiles heading your way.

1902
01:53:51.681 --> 01:53:54.830
Hawaii.
It's like,
oh,
here's weather,
here's missile and you hit the wrong.
No,

1903
01:53:54.831 --> 01:53:57.680
it shouldn't work that way.
Shouldn't be anywhere near like that.

1904
01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:01.380
And lots to the whole state it us too.
Yeah,
I know.
Legally Mcfarland,

1905
01:54:01.381 --> 01:54:03.610
who was on her Instagram,
I was like,
yeah,
apparently is a mess hall.

1906
01:54:03.611 --> 01:54:05.840
It's the same shit.
I was unbelievable.

1907
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:08.270
People were fucking crying and freaking out.

1908
01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:11.240
Apparently I have a friend who lives in Hawaii,

1909
01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:14.630
you know that's a state that's been hit before.
If I can,
I literally,
yeah.
Right,

1910
01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:17.690
so you gotta think mean memory of Pearl Harbor.

1911
01:54:17.691 --> 01:54:19.610
This is people who were alive back then.
Plenty of them.

1912
01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:20.840
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1913
01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:25.130
<v 0>Jeremy,
mother fucking Steve,
dom,
dom,</v>

1914
01:54:25.131 --> 01:54:29.600
dom.
This should be war.
I am very excited about this.

1915
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:32.743
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1916
01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.800
<v 0>There's certain guys who don't know how to have a boring fight and Jeremy</v>

1917
01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:39.340
Stevens is one of those guys.
Yeah,
he's one of them.
He's a fucking animal and he,

1918
01:54:39.341 --> 01:54:44.080
he's looking forward to this fight to stylistically and a lot like the Gilbert

1919
01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:46.490
Melendez fight.
Yeah.
I don't think it was another guy.

1920
01:54:47.650 --> 01:54:50.500
I want to see if he goes right back to that same low calf kick.

1921
01:54:50.890 --> 01:54:54.460
He had so much success with it in that Melendez fight.

1922
01:54:54.461 --> 01:54:57.610
I mean that essentially took Melendez out of his game plan real early.

1923
01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:01.150
He looks like such a wolf would that crazy beard.

1924
01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:03.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1925
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.070
<v 0>Never went boxing.
Didn't let guys have beards.</v>

1926
01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:09.300
The fuck was out about or bitching about Canelo's hair when he fought a triple g

1927
01:55:09.930 --> 01:55:13.080
interest in it.
As long as barriers,
too long and it softens a punched Ia.

1928
01:55:13.090 --> 01:55:15.570
I don't buy that at all.
Seems so ridiculous.

1929
01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:19.110
That was like something that they used to say like you used to have to shave

1930
01:55:19.111 --> 01:55:23.410
your beard.
Oh,
sound style.
It's a big pad.
Ooh,

1931
01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:26.770
duo Choi land is too hard.
Leg kicks in a row.

1932
01:55:27.070 --> 01:55:30.130
I just can't imagine it realistically softening up punch to make a difference.

1933
01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:32.520
And I mean,
I kind of see,
I have to show me something.

1934
01:55:33.570 --> 01:55:37.330
Maybe Kimbo slice beard because he had that thick hair.

1935
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:39.850
Oh,
there's a nice one.
Bye Jeremy.

1936
01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:43.980
Dual choice tall for

1937
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.790
<v 2>the weight class man at five 10 and a half,
one 46 golden.
Nice.</v>

1938
01:55:50.530 --> 01:55:54.100
<v 0>This is,
uh,
you know,
people complain about weight cutting all the time when,</v>

1939
01:55:54.101 --> 01:55:58.120
you know,
we've talked about it many times,
but you see how big these fuckers are.

1940
01:55:58.121 --> 01:56:01.970
You see why they do it.
I mean,
it's crazy.
If you can do it,
it's worth it.

1941
01:56:02.650 --> 01:56:05.220
What's interesting is what California is doing.
You know,

1942
01:56:05.230 --> 01:56:09.490
there's a bunch of guys like Marlin,
like Marlin Mariah's,
they,
they essentially,

1943
01:56:10.030 --> 01:56:14.560
they're not saying that he can't fight one 35 again,
but they're saying,
dude,

1944
01:56:14.561 --> 01:56:19.150
you're 145 pound fighter who's killing themselves to make one 35 Ooh,

1945
01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:24.130
another one by choice.
So do Ho choice.

1946
01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.020
Having mow right hand over the top I two O ne by choice.
Oh Shit.

1947
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:33.660
He looks clean.
Yeah.
Chin's up.
Yeah.
He,
oh,

1948
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:38.890
he was relying a lot on its ability to read punches.
Was Jenna.
Hi.
Yeah.

1949
01:56:39.190 --> 01:56:40.023
Maybe

1950
01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:45.600
how do they decide if someone misses wait in a certain way category two or three

1951
01:56:45.601 --> 01:56:49.620
times then automatically?
Well,
that's a good way to do it.
Just no,

1952
01:56:49.650 --> 01:56:53.510
there's no hard fast rule in terms of like how the UFC approaches it.

1953
01:56:53.511 --> 01:56:57.660
It varies depending upon the individual circumstances.
But with California,

1954
01:56:57.690 --> 01:56:58.710
Andy Foster,

1955
01:56:58.711 --> 01:57:01.830
who's the head of the Athletic Commission in California is in my opinion,

1956
01:57:01.831 --> 01:57:06.480
one of the very best in the world.
He's real proactive,
is super on top of things.

1957
01:57:06.630 --> 01:57:10.530
He,
and he's instituted a bunch of different weight classes.
They,

1958
01:57:10.531 --> 01:57:14.220
they've added 65 75 they're,
they're adding more weight classes,

1959
01:57:14.221 --> 01:57:17.350
which I think is critical.
I think that's the future.
I really think we,

1960
01:57:17.351 --> 01:57:21.210
we spent way too much time with 20 pound gaps in between.
Oh,

1961
01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:24.780
Jeremy's Davis tags them two in a row.
Yeah.
Oh,

1962
01:57:24.781 --> 01:57:26.310
and then a good leg kick as well.

1963
01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:30.660
I think we spent way too much time with a minimal amount of weight classes with

1964
01:57:30.661 --> 01:57:34.350
these eight weight classes.
I think we could use more.
And,
um,

1965
01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:39.120
what they've decided is that if a fighter is a certain weight,

1966
01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:43.140
when they weigh in,
they can only be a certain weight more when they fight.

1967
01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:47.010
So they're weighing guys when they weigh in and then they're weighing them right

1968
01:57:47.011 --> 01:57:51.150
before they fight.
And guys like Marlin,
he gained a Shitload of weight.

1969
01:57:51.151 --> 01:57:54.660
I think he gained 17 pounds.
Sorry if I'm wrong,

1970
01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.480
but I think it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 17 pounds,

1971
01:57:57.481 --> 01:57:59.370
which they were like,
get the fuck out of here with that.

1972
01:57:59.490 --> 01:58:04.020
So what happens when you show up the day of the fight and you were 20 pounds

1973
01:58:04.021 --> 01:58:06.300
over?
What did they do?
I don't think they do anything yet.

1974
01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:10.440
I think they're recommending you move up.
So the real problem would be what?

1975
01:58:10.441 --> 01:58:14.910
What would happen if Marlin Mariah's won the title at 135 pounds?

1976
01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:18.510
Which he's world class.
I mean that's,
that's a real,

1977
01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:20.730
that's certainly a possibility.
It's not out of the realm,

1978
01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:25.020
the realm he's going to be fighting if everything keeps going well for him,

1979
01:58:25.170 --> 01:58:28.740
the way they aljamain sterling knockout was he's going to wind up fighting for a

1980
01:58:28.741 --> 01:58:29.574
world title.

1981
01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:34.050
And I think it's a great fight for teaching a world title at one 35 then your

1982
01:58:34.051 --> 01:58:38.220
one 35 on that title.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
I mean he made it.
Right.

1983
01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:43.340
But the UFC and you know also the California State Athletic Commission,

1984
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:48.520
even Nevada now they're trying to do something which I think is important to do

1985
01:58:48.521 --> 01:58:51.640
something about these fucking heavyweight.
We'll talk about this fight,

1986
01:58:51.641 --> 01:58:54.670
this fight.
It's crazy.
Yeah,
it's really good.
Well,

1987
01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:57.670
somewhere they were talking about if you,
if you,
if you missed,
wait,

1988
01:58:57.671 --> 01:59:00.010
you weren't allowed to fight at that weight class for your next fight.

1989
01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:02.880
I don't remember where they were.
They were talking about doing that.
That,

1990
01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:05.260
that's smart too.
That was,
yeah,
that was a planet heard.

1991
01:59:05.530 --> 01:59:06.770
That's where you're the commissioner,
uh,

1992
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:11.790
George Lockhart or a dolce or someone who has a wealth of it by choice.

1993
01:59:13.050 --> 01:59:13.940
<v 10>Woo.</v>

1994
01:59:15.650 --> 01:59:17.720
<v 0>Jeremy Stevens could take it to,
that's the thing about it.</v>

1995
01:59:17.721 --> 01:59:21.230
She has a tendency to come forward when he's hurt.
He just wants to throw more.

1996
01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:25.770
He wants to get you back.
Yeah.
He's not a recoup and,
and,

1997
01:59:25.771 --> 01:59:29.210
and figure it out kind of guy.
He wants some payback.
He's a fucking savage.

1998
01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:32.690
That's why he's so fun.
He's,
he's looking for something though.

1999
01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:37.460
He gets creative in there though.
I mean he'll,
Ooh,
Snappy Jab by choice.

2000
01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:42.140
Ooh,
Choi has got some clean technique.
Men.

2001
01:59:42.570 --> 01:59:44.030
<v 10>Ooh.</v>

2002
01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:49.030
<v 0>Firefight and good foot work by Choi to,
oh he goes to the body,</v>

2003
01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:51.160
goes the body with that left hook

2004
01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:58.550
and he invites him in by keeping the hands just low enough to bait Jeremy

2005
01:59:58.550 --> 02:00:01.790
Stevens in.
But he's reading the punches really,
really well.

2006
02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:05.430
He keeps tagging that fucking left leg.
Stevens set.
Last one.

2007
02:00:05.431 --> 02:00:09.840
One strong hold stuff.
Ooh,
this is a five round or two right?

2008
02:00:10.330 --> 02:00:15.230
Of course.
Must Be.
Yeah man,
it ain't event.
That's a weird argument,

2009
02:00:15.231 --> 02:00:15.501
right?

2010
02:00:15.501 --> 02:00:20.501
Like what do you like when they changed the main events to five rounds,

2011
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:25.220
not just world title fights,
right.
Main events like that.
Yeah,

2012
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:29.360
like a rounds.
The better.
Yeah.
I have more five round fights.

2013
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:31.820
Definitely get you thinking.
Look,
you'll,

2014
02:00:31.821 --> 02:00:35.480
you'll figure out who the fuck is the best fighter because oftentimes things

2015
02:00:35.481 --> 02:00:40.130
start getting weird around the fourth round.
But fighters make the argument,

2016
02:00:40.131 --> 02:00:41.420
I've heard this argument before,

2017
02:00:41.421 --> 02:00:44.760
like you only have so many five round fights in your body.
Yeah.

2018
02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:48.290
And when you're using them up on these,
uh,
uh,

2019
02:00:48.410 --> 02:00:50.600
fights where you're trying to get to a world title,

2020
02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:54.130
like by the time you get there,
those fourth and fifth rounds are there.

2021
02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:56.090
They're taking a toll on you.
It could,

2022
02:00:56.091 --> 02:00:59.030
we could potentially see guys with a shorter careers because of that.
Yeah.

2023
02:00:59.031 --> 02:01:01.490
When also thinking about what goes into a camp for a five round fight,
I mean,

2024
02:01:01.491 --> 02:01:04.850
it's five rounds harder for eight weeks,
10 weeks,

2025
02:01:04.851 --> 02:01:07.970
and you're starting to get into,
I had this camp for a five round fight.

2026
02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:10.340
So the camp itself is harder to,
and you only know,

2027
02:01:10.341 --> 02:01:12.830
we only have so many those in yet.
Yeah.
There's no,

2028
02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:16.640
there's no arguing that a boxing,
you know,
it used to be 15 rounds and they went,

2029
02:01:16.641 --> 02:01:21.500
you know,
those last three.
Yeah.
Really a killer.
Well,
I think it was that Dr. Kim.

2030
02:01:21.501 --> 02:01:24.500
That was the fight,
right?
Ray?
Boom,
boom.
Manzini what a fight that was.

2031
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:26.630
And that was another weight cut issue.
Yup.

2032
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:30.320
That was back when they used to make them way in the day of the fight.
Yeah.
Ooh,

2033
02:01:30.321 --> 02:01:34.550
front kick to the face.
Yup.
Referee committed suicide.

2034
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:40.050
Did he really?
Is He did God damn.
Which referee was that?
I that,

2035
02:01:40.051 --> 02:01:42.860
that I don't,
I don't remember his name.
And I know he took his life.
Oh Man.

2036
02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:46.040
Already got suicide to the body.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

2037
02:01:46.041 --> 02:01:47.900
Jeremy Stephens with a right knee left knee.

2038
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:53.090
Shit rolls like Chevy stole something from him.
Jeremy.

2039
02:01:53.091 --> 02:01:57.140
It's rose hay makers.
He ticked,
he tagged them with that right hand.

2040
02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:02.730
Who the fuck is more savage than Jeremy Stephens?
Not many.
Oh,
switch elbow.

2041
02:02:02.731 --> 02:02:06.050
That bald by choice.
Nice.
Looked like a jab,
then turned it over

2042
02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.670
and a leg kick for strong leg kick by choice.
Well,

2043
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:15.800
and a lot of people would hesitate at this point to throw that many leg kicks

2044
02:02:15.801 --> 02:02:18.480
when the guys got a right hand like that.
And he's not hesitating.
No.

2045
02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:23.520
He's like the really prepared well to avoid it and to counter make them pay in

2046
02:02:24.351 --> 02:02:25.184
that long,

2047
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:29.810
long stiff jab of his helps to get a little of reach advantage as well.
Jeremy.

2048
02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:33.110
I think Jeremy's five,
eight and a half inch and a half

2049
02:02:33.150 --> 02:02:35.690
<v 3>taller,
maybe two inches tall.</v>

2050
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:38.743
Ooh.

2051
02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:42.810
<v 8>Oh,</v>

2052
02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:46.680
<v 0>beautiful timing with that right hand.
Snapped his head back.
Ooh.</v>

2053
02:02:46.681 --> 02:02:49.950
Nice Jab to there,
Jeremy.
Jeremy getting that timing down.

2054
02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:53.400
Choice taking it well though.
Yup.
Well he took a while and that cub Swanson,

2055
02:02:55.230 --> 02:02:56.790
he took a hard leg kick there too.

2056
02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:02.400
Now he's tied.
Starting to turn a little bit of walking him down.

2057
02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:06.900
He's walking him down,
switching legs and looking for those big shots,
throwing,

2058
02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:09.990
throwing some offspeed punches to close the distance.

2059
02:03:11.490 --> 02:03:13.560
I think a couple of checklists would be good for them.

2060
02:03:13.561 --> 02:03:15.450
Choice coming in once again with that head straight on.

2061
02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:18.400
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2062
02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:23.210
<v 0>But Steven's just loves walking forward,
man.
But he's such a fucking animal.
Yeah.</v>

2063
02:03:23.590 --> 02:03:28.390
I mean he just loves these firefights that the opportunity to test who's the

2064
02:03:28.391 --> 02:03:31.000
tougher guy and especially at one 45

2065
02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:33.140
<v 8>oh right.</v>

2066
02:03:36.630 --> 02:03:40.960
<v 0>Might be it.
That was good.
Good.
Leaping shot.
Staying with the left hand.</v>

2067
02:03:41.770 --> 02:03:46.140
<v 8>Oh,
Don Donald.</v>

2068
02:03:46.150 --> 02:03:49.090
That's done it.
Oh my God.
Wow.

2069
02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:54.140
What a fucking writing is an animal.
Oh,

2070
02:03:54.190 --> 02:03:58.420
broke that guy's back and go.
That guy's fucked.
Who is that guy?
His

2071
02:03:58.430 --> 02:04:03.140
<v 0>Dad.
Oh,
he's playing it off.
Oh Man.</v>

2072
02:04:03.141 --> 02:04:07.190
That's beautiful.
Whew.
What a fight too.
Huh?

2073
02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:09.400
But as soon as that tide turned,

2074
02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:12.260
as soon as he felt like I can walk through these punches,
it was over.
Yeah.

2075
02:04:12.590 --> 02:04:17.000
Fucking animal is a savage.
He's such a savage,

2076
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:21.830
Jeremy.
Steve,
it's great stuff,
man.
Fuck.
That was awesome.

2077
02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:25.760
Ooh.
And he could do that to anybody.
That's the thing.

2078
02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:28.310
He takes it so well and his,

2079
02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:31.700
that attitude that he's got that fucking ferocious attitude.

2080
02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:33.200
Now here's what's really impressive.

2081
02:04:34.090 --> 02:04:38.370
When you think about choice war with cub Swanson and think Jeremy Stevens just

2082
02:04:38.371 --> 02:04:41.910
smashed him inside a two.
It's impressive to that.

2083
02:04:41.911 --> 02:04:43.800
He got front kicked in the face,
Kinda.

2084
02:04:43.801 --> 02:04:46.560
It was almost like a crest and kick took him on the side.
Boom,

2085
02:04:46.561 --> 02:04:50.640
right hand boom,
snapped him back with that one.

2086
02:04:51.090 --> 02:04:54.360
That was the beginning of [inaudible].
That was the,
the head snap or that was it.

2087
02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.470
And that one over the top.

2088
02:04:55.471 --> 02:04:59.640
He caught him right on the temple and his legs go and boom,
look at that.

2089
02:04:59.641 --> 02:05:03.840
Jesus Christ.
Here's the one.
That's the big one.
Oh my goodness.

2090
02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:08.100
Boom.
That was great.
Boom,
boom.
Good job.

2091
02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:13.860
Fuck.
Hell yeah.
Good stuff man.
It's good fucking fight.

2092
02:05:15.550 --> 02:05:20.250
My boys is always going to be that guy didn't just toss bag over rat right hand.

2093
02:05:22.050 --> 02:05:26.520
Uh,
what was it?
King Mo.
Seth Petrocelli.
Do you see that one?

2094
02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:31.380
He cleared his legs and bombed them and out.
I mean eyes wide shut was crazy.

2095
02:05:31.410 --> 02:05:35.190
Now he fought Max Holloway,
correct?

2096
02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:38.760
Stephens.
Yeah,
probably.

2097
02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:42.930
I feel like my Max Holloway beat him.
Clear decision.

2098
02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:44.070
See if you pull it up.

2099
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:48.690
I think Max Holloway beat him on the way up to the title.
You know,

2100
02:05:48.691 --> 02:05:53.400
it was a good fight too for Holloway.
He really avoided all Jeremy Stephens.
Yeah,

2101
02:05:53.401 --> 02:05:56.400
there you go.
Max.
No Max Holloway decision.
Unanimous three rounds.

2102
02:05:57.330 --> 02:06:02.330
But that was in 2015 a little over three years ago to December of 2015.

2103
02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:06.720
Um,
interesting.
You know,

2104
02:06:07.110 --> 02:06:10.500
got think with a Kol like that.
He's like one,

2105
02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:15.560
maybe two fights outside of another possible shot or a possible shot at Max.

2106
02:06:17.190 --> 02:06:20.430
Now that Max has the title.
I liked that.

2107
02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:25.170
I liked that a lot.
Very interesting.

2108
02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:29.980
But once again,
I always fun to watch.
He's a fucking always him.
Yeah.

2109
02:06:30.010 --> 02:06:34.860
I don't always watch him so much fun.
So,
um,

2110
02:06:35.490 --> 02:06:39.320
next week is the big world title fight the heavyweight division.
And what,

2111
02:06:39.330 --> 02:06:40.950
what does the undercard looked like?
Jamie?

2112
02:06:41.610 --> 02:06:46.550
Pull up the full under card for a Francis and gone oh versus steep.

2113
02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:47.393
Amy.
Oh chick.

2114
02:06:47.670 --> 02:06:50.070
I think this is like the most important heavyweight title fight that I can

2115
02:06:50.071 --> 02:06:50.610
remember.

2116
02:06:50.610 --> 02:06:54.590
I don't remember a heavyweight title fight that people are biggest one in a long

2117
02:06:54.591 --> 02:06:58.700
time because what's going on steep.
It has the history side.
He has the,

2118
02:06:58.730 --> 02:07:03.500
I can be the greatest of all time or amongst them and uh,

2119
02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:07.610
yeah.
And if he could turn it on,
it was so scary.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2120
02:07:07.611 --> 02:07:11.860
The last time I think I was disinterested in the fight was um,

2121
02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:16.640
junior dos Santos versus cane one.
It was a lighter,
right.

2122
02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:19.340
Oh,
here it is right there.
I'm an idiot.
Yeah.
Here we go.

2123
02:07:19.341 --> 02:07:23.150
So we got Steve Bay versus Francis,
the main of it all.

2124
02:07:23.151 --> 02:07:26.340
Daniel Cormier versus Volk on owes demeanor.
Ooh,

2125
02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:33.240
that's interesting.
There's Volkov like he got a quick ride to the title,

2126
02:07:34.410 --> 02:07:39.040
you know,
I um,
he beats OSP and a real close decision,

2127
02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:42.040
knocks out,
circle off,

2128
02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:46.840
then knocks out Jimmy Manawat whenever it is like holy Shit,

2129
02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:50.380
three fights in and then boom,
next fight.
It's fighting core me.

2130
02:07:50.710 --> 02:07:54.220
It's just the way he was able to knock out Manoa and so corn off people like

2131
02:07:54.221 --> 02:07:56.440
listen,
let's see it.
And also,

2132
02:07:56.441 --> 02:08:00.850
I mean it's division where there was room for that new guy and he was the right

2133
02:08:00.851 --> 02:08:02.950
guy.
It,
we've seen it a million times.
The right guy at the right time,

2134
02:08:03.070 --> 02:08:05.670
right guy at the right time.
And uh,

2135
02:08:05.710 --> 02:08:08.080
by all accounts in the gym,

2136
02:08:08.110 --> 02:08:11.910
he was one of the only guys that was sparring with rumble on a daily basis.
Yeah,

2137
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:16.360
he's rumbles main guy,
which is,
that says a lot.
Oh yes,
I,
he does.

2138
02:08:16.890 --> 02:08:19.090
Ron was talking about coming back as a heavyweight.

2139
02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:23.350
Check out the shot right here.
Oh No,
I didn't show it.
That was before.
Yeah.
The,

2140
02:08:23.351 --> 02:08:25.530
the one big one,
the big one to us.

2141
02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:30.520
They showed the big shop but they didn't show it.
Set it up.
Here it is.
Boom.

2142
02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:35.620
That was nice.
Yeah.
And then the big one is we throw it to the side.
Nope.

2143
02:08:35.650 --> 02:08:39.560
Nope.
Stands up.
Chucks him to the site.

2144
02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:44.210
Ah.
Just cause they know you're a

2145
02:08:45.710 --> 02:08:49.540
lefty through the left leg or his left arm on the right leg.

2146
02:08:51.070 --> 02:08:52.000
Fuck yeah man.

2147
02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:59.780
I feel like he's a at the top of the heap now.
So who else we got here?

2148
02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:00.953
Um,

2149
02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:08.850
interesting.
The big fights,
the two big fights,

2150
02:09:08.851 --> 02:09:11.640
obviously the light heavyweight title in the heavyweight title,

2151
02:09:11.641 --> 02:09:14.540
which is really rare that you have.
I'm so out that mixed with the UFC.

2152
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:16.590
Most of that car and I don't know any of those fighters.

2153
02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:22.680
Like half the bottom half of that main card.
I know Thomas Almeda.
That's it.

2154
02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:28.020
Yeah.
There's so many guys.
Man.
Rob Font and Thomas I met is a good,
again,

2155
02:09:28.290 --> 02:09:32.120
that's very interesting.
And Rob Fonts,
a Boston guy too.
He's wanting to,

2156
02:09:32.130 --> 02:09:36.690
della [inaudible] guys.
That should be a lot of fun.
So Jimmy Smith,

2157
02:09:36.691 --> 02:09:38.700
when's the first time they have you working?
Well,

2158
02:09:38.701 --> 02:09:43.360
I'm doing the pre and post for two 20.
Okay,
so you're in California,

2159
02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:47.460
the California here at Fox and then um,
they have,
they've,

2160
02:09:47.490 --> 02:09:51.270
they've offered me a couple and I've accepted them,

2161
02:09:51.271 --> 02:09:54.150
but they haven't announced it yet,
so I don't know.
Oh,
it's nothing official yet.

2162
02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:57.450
Okay.
But soon,
soon as the best way to put it,
they just color,

2163
02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:02.220
I'm assuming they just trust you or you don't have to do any bullshit like test

2164
02:10:02.221 --> 02:10:05.550
shows or anything like that because I've heard a guy where I've heard of guys

2165
02:10:05.551 --> 02:10:08.820
doing test shows,
they try people out and shit.
Not that I'm aware of.
No.

2166
02:10:08.821 --> 02:10:11.660
I mean it's already,
yeah,
I mean obviously you know what the fuck you're doing.

2167
02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:15.070
I would imagine that though the real hard Gig,

2168
02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:17.310
it's gotta be finding when then play by play guys.

2169
02:10:17.311 --> 02:10:21.930
That doesn't annoy the shit out of you.
But no,
seriously,
that's a real job.

2170
02:10:21.931 --> 02:10:26.580
Like that.
Colors,
colors,
easy doing play by play.
That's a real job.

2171
02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:31.200
They do a lot more of those anchor was that the different skin color and play by

2172
02:10:31.201 --> 02:10:34.100
play is is we're specific.
A particular sport

2173
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:38.120
<v 5>and we can call grappling and combat sports and whatever.
A play by play guys do.</v>

2174
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:42.410
I'll do basketball one week and then hogs and then this and then it's a job,

2175
02:10:42.530 --> 02:10:44.600
but there are a lot more of them.
You can go,
okay,

2176
02:10:44.601 --> 02:10:46.350
he's good at basketball and soccer.

2177
02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:50.000
You can see a body of work before they jump in because a lot of times it's we

2178
02:10:50.001 --> 02:10:53.530
need a guy who knows a sport and there are only so many.
Yeah,

2179
02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:57.360
it's a very different job,
very different skillset,
but people get real

2180
02:10:57.460 --> 02:10:59.050
<v 1>angry if you don't know MMA.</v>

2181
02:10:59.110 --> 02:11:02.980
If you're like a play by play guy and you say some goofy shit and you don't

2182
02:11:02.981 --> 02:11:06.630
really know the sport
they do,

2183
02:11:07.230 --> 02:11:10.120
they free and they'll forgive you either they don't.

2184
02:11:10.150 --> 02:11:13.240
If they don't think you really know the sport or really love the sport,

2185
02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:16.810
those two things are critical.
You have to really know it and really love it.

2186
02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:19.650
Or though,
otherwise they're like,
fuck you hated me when I,

2187
02:11:19.870 --> 02:11:24.520
when I compensated for king
stupid.

2188
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:28.390
Oh,
we show how to say Sarah.
He just did it.
They just showed it,

2189
02:11:28.810 --> 02:11:32.770
showed the big Jeremy Stephens haymaker

2190
02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:39.940
I socked.
Oh my God.
Well that was terrible.
You think of it as a,

2191
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:41.410
you know what you were really good at.

2192
02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:46.440
You were really good as the guy in between the rounds that was explaining who

2193
02:11:46.691 --> 02:11:49.840
won the fight.
Like when you,
you and I,
people don't even remember this,

2194
02:11:49.841 --> 02:11:52.590
but we worked together.
Uh,

2195
02:11:52.690 --> 02:11:57.690
it would be Goldberg and me and then for a bunch of cards you would be beside us

2196
02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:03.460
car guy.
Yeah.
So he had,
but anyhow,
had a real system.

2197
02:12:03.730 --> 02:12:06.070
Like we talked about it and I was like,
how are you doing this?

2198
02:12:06.071 --> 02:12:09.460
And he had like a really well thought out system where he had a line down,

2199
02:12:09.461 --> 02:12:13.840
a piece of paper and he had a bunch of categories and he had all these different

2200
02:12:13.841 --> 02:12:15.590
things,
whether it was takedowns are key.

2201
02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:19.480
And so he marked all these things on top of watching the fight.

2202
02:12:19.540 --> 02:12:22.640
A wanted to know,
like we'll be able to look down on it like,

2203
02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:27.130
oh he landed all these right hands.
Yeah,
I could look at the end of the fight.

2204
02:12:27.850 --> 02:12:30.640
They go to me.
I have to talk about what happened in the first though.

2205
02:12:30.641 --> 02:12:33.640
I gave him the second,
cause remember that second he had to take downs.

2206
02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:36.700
But if I didn't write it down I would forget.
Yeah.

2207
02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:41.400
So as I'm waiting to go on,
I'm revealing that first round I remember,
you know,

2208
02:12:41.410 --> 02:12:43.270
it's,
it's a lot easier to see what,

2209
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:46.180
what actually happened cause you forget or anyways,
I do,

2210
02:12:46.181 --> 02:12:48.070
I would forget unless I wrote it down.

2211
02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:51.270
<v 5>The funniest thing to me are the most frustrating thing to me is they wanted me</v>

2212
02:12:51.271 --> 02:12:53.790
to do scorecards,
calling unofficial score card,
you know,
whatever.

2213
02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:55.710
Just like you did.
And I would do it.

2214
02:12:55.980 --> 02:13:00.980
And every time I never wrote down a number without explaining what I was talking

2215
02:13:01.441 --> 02:13:03.990
about.
I gave it tonight as close round,
but I gave it because of this,

2216
02:13:03.991 --> 02:13:04.650
this and this.

2217
02:13:04.650 --> 02:13:07.920
And people would always act like you just threw out a fucking number without

2218
02:13:07.921 --> 02:13:11.970
saying anything.
What was he thinking?
I said,
what I was thinking,

2219
02:13:12.370 --> 02:13:15.420
I never just wrote down nine 10.
I always said,
and here's why.

2220
02:13:15.421 --> 02:13:18.690
Here's you may disagree,
but here's my logic behind what I'm saying.

2221
02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:19.860
You can disagree with me.
Fine.

2222
02:13:20.070 --> 02:13:23.330
But the people that act like I just write down a number without explicit.

2223
02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:26.140
It's insane.
I'm just,
I'm so not going to miss it.

2224
02:13:26.530 --> 02:13:30.500
<v 1>Commentators
post fight interviews once I said,</v>

2225
02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:32.170
congratulations to Randy couture.

2226
02:13:32.210 --> 02:13:33.900
<v 5>I said,
congratulations,
chuck.</v>

2227
02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:42.660
I said that,
and when I walked out of the octagon,
uh,

2228
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:47.670
who was it?
Joe Silva goes,
Dude.
He said,
congratulations,
chuck.
I said,
watch,
watch.

2229
02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:50.790
Oh my God,
I'm going to get fired.
I thought I was going to get fired right there.

2230
02:13:51.210 --> 02:13:54.720
And I went up to John.
I said,
dude,
did I say congratulations,
chuck?
He goes,

2231
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:58.350
you go,
yes.
I'm like,
oh no.
This is my last show.

2232
02:13:59.490 --> 02:14:03.300
I totally thought I was getting fired by 100% I can talk about this because we

2233
02:14:03.301 --> 02:14:07.320
joke about it.
We joked about in belt of it,
but uh,
uh,

2234
02:14:07.710 --> 02:14:10.140
Jen Brown,
one time we were in and it was alive.

2235
02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:12.960
It was a live piece was just to the house so it didn't go out on air or
anything.

2236
02:14:12.961 --> 02:14:16.620
It was just for the house.
She and Brown football,
Jim Brown,
Jim Brown,

2237
02:14:16.621 --> 02:14:20.130
Jim Brown does extend them stuff for,
okay.
We were in,
uh,

2238
02:14:20.610 --> 02:14:24.700
that could fill Oklahoma and she said,
we had been in Kansas the week before.

2239
02:14:24.730 --> 02:14:29.540
She goes,
Hey Kansas and the place,
there's what are pretty,

2240
02:14:30.210 --> 02:14:33.810
she goes,
you know that they really didn't,
they really didn't react much.

2241
02:14:33.811 --> 02:14:38.280
And she and the guy goes,
you sit Kansas,
we're in Oklahoma.
And

2242
02:14:39.810 --> 02:14:43.260
we always joke about,
I love jam.
But yeah,
for weeks it was,

2243
02:14:43.261 --> 02:14:47.730
what state are we in jail?
We did me forever.
But it was just an inhouse piece.

2244
02:14:47.731 --> 02:14:51.120
It didn't go out on TV and he was hilarious.
Lucky.
No,
no.

2245
02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:55.210
All done knows we've all messed up.

2246
02:14:56.490 --> 02:14:59.580
People were talking,
Shit,
I've called over a thousand fights.

2247
02:14:59.581 --> 02:15:02.090
I've fucked up a bunch of dog,
man.
The brain,

2248
02:15:02.091 --> 02:15:06.570
the human brain just doesn't work perfect.
You make mistakes sometimes,

2249
02:15:06.571 --> 02:15:11.571
which drives me crazy is I have a very good recall for fights and for scenarios

2250
02:15:11.671 --> 02:15:14.340
and positions of people been in and ways guys won.

2251
02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:18.720
But occasionally there'll be a guy and I can't remember his fucking name and

2252
02:15:18.721 --> 02:15:21.430
it's like weird.
It's,
but it's a guy that I've seen fight.
Oh,

2253
02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:24.360
like Jorge Mazda dollar,
someone like that.
But I see him fight a hundred times,

2254
02:15:24.361 --> 02:15:27.420
like,
how the fuck do I,
why isn't that one coming out?

2255
02:15:27.570 --> 02:15:31.860
It's like the brain is just not a perfect vehicle.

2256
02:15:32.070 --> 02:15:36.390
It just doesn't always work.
Right.
It's like a range rover.
They look beautiful,

2257
02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:40.020
but range rovers work most of the time.
You know what I'm saying?

2258
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:43.050
I have a friend who has a range rover and I asked him,
I said,
hey,

2259
02:15:43.710 --> 02:15:45.990
do you like that guy?
He's like,
yeah,
this is my second one.

2260
02:15:45.991 --> 02:15:50.010
My last one was a lemon.
I fucking knew it.
And he's like,
but it's a great car.

2261
02:15:50.070 --> 02:15:54.780
It's amazing when it drives pleasing.
That's like how a brain is.

2262
02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:59.160
It's not always good.
So you saying congratulations,
chuck,

2263
02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:03.610
and then leave and you're like,
oh,

2264
02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:06.510
watch fights.
Not necessarily yours of course,

2265
02:16:06.630 --> 02:16:10.200
but I'll watch somebody calling the fight and I'll know when they spaced on the

2266
02:16:10.201 --> 02:16:15.090
name,
they'll still start going,
you know that because you're watching you go,

2267
02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:18.770
he spaced on his name,
Dude.
It's sometimes that we basketball,
football,
whatever,

2268
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:22.660
but I'll go,
I'll know as a broadcaster,
I'm like,
he he space.

2269
02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:25.140
He looked at his notes and he got the name back,

2270
02:16:25.141 --> 02:16:28.890
but he's spaced on the fucking name and it has some possible hundred percent

2271
02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:30.160
happens all the time.

2272
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:35.190
<v 0>My big fear is that I'm going to be interviewing a fighter after a fight and</v>

2273
02:16:36.551 --> 02:16:39.400
then I can't remember their name when I congratulate them.

2274
02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:44.860
The biggest fear Bro,
I all I know that's not just you do,
that's fine too.

2275
02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:46.150
Before I go out there,

2276
02:16:46.151 --> 02:16:48.640
I will write it like if it's a dude I've never seen quite before,

2277
02:16:48.670 --> 02:16:51.130
like maybe one by first round knock out.
I've never seen him fight before.

2278
02:16:51.131 --> 02:16:53.900
I'm like,
Oh shit.
Who is this guy?
He might've come from,
you know,

2279
02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:58.000
CFA or something like that.
I'll write his name down,
I'll read it.

2280
02:16:58.001 --> 02:16:59.680
I'll say it back.
I'll repeat you.

2281
02:16:59.681 --> 02:17:03.340
You might see me walking to the stage to the cage and I got my earpiece in and

2282
02:17:03.341 --> 02:17:06.040
I'm saying,
you know,
blah blah blah blah blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah blah.

2283
02:17:06.041 --> 02:17:07.660
I'm saying his name.
I don't want to fuck it up.

2284
02:17:07.730 --> 02:17:08.840
<v 7>You are not alone though.</v>

2285
02:17:08.841 --> 02:17:12.900
Do that fear is huge because you're thinking about question Tim cause you'll see

2286
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:16.340
him on what to ask them and what well we on Aaron,
we saying this,

2287
02:17:16.341 --> 02:17:19.130
we were talking about interviewing fires is a literally the hardest part of the

2288
02:17:19.131 --> 02:17:23.480
job because lot of time to prepare for it.
No,

2289
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:29.030
you have time to ask him one,
maybe two questions that said no.

2290
02:17:29.330 --> 02:17:32.390
Everyone has their own question in their own head that they want to ask.

2291
02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:36.260
And if you don't come up with something entertaining or creative,

2292
02:17:37.010 --> 02:17:40.210
um,
you know,
people talk shit on you.
It's all dude.

2293
02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:43.300
<v 0>Yeah.
It's also very important.</v>

2294
02:17:43.301 --> 02:17:46.540
This is what I tell people that are just trying to now for the first time and

2295
02:17:46.541 --> 02:17:47.171
then anybody,

2296
02:17:47.171 --> 02:17:51.550
any young people that are thinking about getting into MMA commentary.
You're the,

2297
02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:54.220
you're not the show like you,
you are,

2298
02:17:54.221 --> 02:17:57.640
you are just trying to extract information out of this person.

2299
02:17:57.670 --> 02:18:00.370
Like your question should be just to lead them.

2300
02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:03.550
I try to have as little personality and those things as possible.

2301
02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:06.580
I'm just trying to just give you the platform.

2302
02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:10.690
I'm just trying to give you maybe a path to take your answer.
Um,

2303
02:18:10.710 --> 02:18:12.950
I saw some beautiful things happen in the fight.
I want to,

2304
02:18:13.210 --> 02:18:18.010
I want you to express what happened in your mind or maybe there's some adversity

2305
02:18:18.011 --> 02:18:20.380
that you had to go through.
I want to know how bad it was,

2306
02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:22.690
but I don't want to be there.
I'm just,

2307
02:18:22.710 --> 02:18:25.000
I'm just the guy that has to say those words.

2308
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:29.830
<v 7>Yeah.
They hate it.
I never enjoyed that shit.</v>

2309
02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:33.820
The flip side of that though,
that I've run into personally,
um,
you know,

2310
02:18:33.970 --> 02:18:36.240
overdoing it too is if your question isn't it

2311
02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:40.830
<v 0>a eat,
you know,
hey,
great performance tonight,
man.
He,</v>

2312
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:45.130
if it's too open and a lot of times they go,
yeah.
You know what I mean?

2313
02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:48.490
<v 7>Right.
If you don't ask him something a little specific,
they'll just kind of go,</v>

2314
02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:53.200
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You know,
if you don't say,
oh great,
you know that tired,

2315
02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:56.920
they're out of breath.
It's that you want them to go wherever they want to go.

2316
02:18:57.130 --> 02:19:01.060
But also if you don't ask something specific enough,
sometimes they'll go,
yeah,

2317
02:19:01.061 --> 02:19:05.890
it was how shitting your pants.
Cause my person was with a translator.
Oh,

2318
02:19:05.891 --> 02:19:09.150
those are rough back and forth.
But honestly sometimes

2319
02:19:09.310 --> 02:19:13.960
<v 0>gives you more time.
I always try to talk slow and give them something.</v>

2320
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:17.920
I try to simplify what I'm saying.
Yeah.
But I even then,
I still,

2321
02:19:17.921 --> 02:19:22.210
sometimes I fucked that up.
You know?
It's just,
it's one of the weirder job.

2322
02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:25.250
<v 7>Yeah.
I never liked it.
I never liked that at all.</v>

2323
02:19:25.370 --> 02:19:26.930
I never really liked commentating.

2324
02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:30.830
I tried to get DC when DC was doing it because DC was doing a few of them.

2325
02:19:30.831 --> 02:19:33.620
Like we were doing it and I go,
oh,
that's your job now,
bro.
He's like,

2326
02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:38.330
you're doing that Joe Rogan get in there.
I go,
no,
no,
no man,
I'm a,

2327
02:19:38.331 --> 02:19:39.980
you're doing a good job.
But like sitting here,

2328
02:19:39.981 --> 02:19:42.530
I'm gonna just get to sit back and I was like fuck that.

2329
02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:45.350
Cause he was doing like the the fight pass prelim ones.

2330
02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:47.870
Unless you're in the industry,

2331
02:19:48.350 --> 02:19:53.350
you'd be surprised at how many people don't realize that there's a play by play

2332
02:19:53.601 --> 02:19:57.710
guy and a color.
They just see two dudes talking.
They don't know.

2333
02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:01.100
I didn't know I was a grown ass man when I first got offered the job for King of

2334
02:20:01.101 --> 02:20:03.590
the cage.
I didn't know the difference.
I just thought,

2335
02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:07.320
yeah there's two dudes to old dudes talking to.
They're just chit chatting.

2336
02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:11.330
I didn't see the system in the and the owner of the real problem though.

2337
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:16.510
The problem in MMA is that the color guy is the martial arts experts and the

2338
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:21.200
football,
but the play by play guy,
it's just the news guy is just the guy.

2339
02:20:21.201 --> 02:20:26.000
But the play by play guy in sports is kind of calling what's happening as well.

2340
02:20:26.330 --> 02:20:30.140
He's saying,
you know,
they're moving the ball,
they're doing this,
they're going,

2341
02:20:30.141 --> 02:20:33.560
this,
this formation is,
but when you're calling a fight,

2342
02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:35.690
especially when the fight goes to the ground,

2343
02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:39.230
that play by play guys not really saying anything.
Right?
Yeah.

2344
02:20:39.231 --> 02:20:42.950
He could say he's in the mount,
in the mount taking big shots in the amount.

2345
02:20:42.951 --> 02:20:45.500
You don't have to be an expert to know a little bit,
but he's basically,

2346
02:20:45.501 --> 02:20:46.334
he's like,

2347
02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:50.690
like when Golde Goldie and I had a great rhythm cause Goldie like kind of laid

2348
02:20:50.691 --> 02:20:52.460
off when it,
especially when it would go to the ground,

2349
02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:55.820
he would lay off and he would just sort of like,
you know,

2350
02:20:55.850 --> 02:20:59.630
he would set me up like he'd say any moves into the mount position or he would

2351
02:20:59.631 --> 02:21:00.620
say,
you know,
something like that.

2352
02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:05.450
And then he would just lay it up for me and then I would elaborate on the

2353
02:21:05.451 --> 02:21:10.270
progression of techniques and where they were at.
Is he supposed to do that?

2354
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:15.020
Um,
that's the hardest motherfucking job ever.
I didn't know.

2355
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:16.580
So I get this job,

2356
02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:21.730
but Brotzmann he takes over the production part of King of the cage and he wants

2357
02:21:22.161 --> 02:21:26.960
to use me as a commentator cause we went to the producer and I went to John

2358
02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:27.170
Jacques Machado Academy.

2359
02:21:27.170 --> 02:21:31.940
He knew me as the NNA fanatic guide and he asked me if I wanted to commentate

2360
02:21:32.420 --> 02:21:35.750
and I said,
yeah,
fuck,
I'll try it.
I didn't know shit.

2361
02:21:35.780 --> 02:21:37.220
Those first king of the cages,

2362
02:21:37.370 --> 02:21:40.670
he didn't know that there was a difference between a play by play and color guy.

2363
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:45.620
The producer didn't know the difference because once I started really listening

2364
02:21:45.621 --> 02:21:47.000
to the broadcast and the UFC,

2365
02:21:47.001 --> 02:21:50.240
I started listening to the opening and how they opened shit.
I go,
oh,

2366
02:21:50.241 --> 02:21:52.420
there's two jobs here.
This guy's,

2367
02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:57.350
this guy is just a news telecaster and this other guy's the expert didn't even

2368
02:21:57.351 --> 02:22:00.150
really realize it.
I thought they were both experts and just talk.
I thought,

2369
02:22:00.220 --> 02:22:04.100
I thought there were two different jobs so that yes,
exactly.

2370
02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:07.070
Once I realized that I talked to,
but I said,
hey,
listen,

2371
02:22:07.130 --> 02:22:10.730
there's two jobs going on to be the play by play guy.

2372
02:22:11.090 --> 02:22:14.480
I want to be the color guy.
He said to both.
You're going to do both.

2373
02:22:14.481 --> 02:22:18.230
I go all sports don't have guys that do both.

2374
02:22:18.390 --> 02:22:21.800
He have a color guy and you have a play by Buicks.
One to the producers.

2375
02:22:21.980 --> 02:22:24.110
Just the to the,
to the producer.
Okay.

2376
02:22:24.111 --> 02:22:26.180
I just want it to the first that does a gun.

2377
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:29.730
<v 4>He'd never done sports before so he didn't understand.
He just said,
dude,</v>

2378
02:22:29.731 --> 02:22:34.010
you're going to do both.
Both of you.
Me and Don the dragon.
Wilson.
We were done

2379
02:22:35.970 --> 02:22:39.330
in there.
Winging it.
It was so bad.

2380
02:22:39.430 --> 02:22:44.160
What's terrible up to these days?
I have no idea.

2381
02:22:44.310 --> 02:22:49.230
I have no idea.
But those,
those are some of the worst shows.
Yeah.

2382
02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:53.310
<v 7>Ever for commentary.
First of all,</v>

2383
02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:56.910
I want it so hard.
It was so bad.

2384
02:22:57.890 --> 02:23:00.750
Oh my God.
You did it or some shit for pride to

2385
02:23:02.850 --> 02:23:07.640
five 10 pride.
10 with the Hanzo and Sakuraba when handled got his arm broken.

2386
02:23:07.650 --> 02:23:09.420
You're got headbutted by Vandelay Silva.

2387
02:23:10.050 --> 02:23:14.730
You were saying that so that soccer,
I would never go to submit Hanzo.
Yes.

2388
02:23:14.731 --> 02:23:17.670
That was one of the biggest blunders ever.
Soccer.

2389
02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:22.210
Robert has to come in and they're standing and I said,
[inaudible]

2390
02:23:22.430 --> 02:23:27.420
<v 4>I,
I'm in the commentary.
I said,
that may work at his gym,</v>

2391
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:30.920
but that turns out Gracie,
it's never going to work on him.
And then boom,

2392
02:23:30.921 --> 02:23:31.754
he breaks his home

2393
02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:37.550
<v 7>on cue.
I call</v>

2394
02:23:40.510 --> 02:23:43.500
work here.
There was a guy,
ed west,

2395
02:23:43.501 --> 02:23:47.250
ed wild west was fighting and he had never knocked anybody out.

2396
02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:49.530
Really good striking.
But like,
you know,
pitter pat can all striker.

2397
02:23:49.531 --> 02:23:54.000
And I literally said,
man,
eds land and great but not a knockout guy.

2398
02:23:54.030 --> 02:23:57.600
And he instantly knocks him out first one of his career right there,

2399
02:23:57.601 --> 02:24:01.080
right in front of him.
Like he did that just to make me fucking look stupid.

2400
02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:05.310
Thanks.
That's what it happens on the job,
man.
You can never,

2401
02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:07.980
it's almost like the universe is punishing you for Hubris.

2402
02:24:08.490 --> 02:24:12.630
Like you're pretending you know more than you do this.
No,
just shut the fuck up.

2403
02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:17.060
Say it looks good.
It's deep.
There was,
yes,
seriously.

2404
02:24:17.070 --> 02:24:20.770
Get that habit of going.
Who knows?
Probably will

2405
02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:26.740
<v 4>one fight for an endo.
Boskin cellos fought this one guy and he schooled him yet</v>

2406
02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:32.430
<v 7>got above
one of the great guy.
Great.</v>

2407
02:24:32.431 --> 02:24:36.140
You never really did it.
Fuck crazy to communicate.

2408
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:40.580
Remember that key was good.
Carl fucked him up,
didn't he?
Yeah,
Carl one.

2409
02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:45.390
<v 4>And he in a fight that he won because he won I think two straight.
He was,</v>

2410
02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:49.620
he had good hands and he wrestled and um,

2411
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:55.290
uh,
he had a guy,
he passed,
guys guard had them in north south and I said,

2412
02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:58.560
this position is called a,
some people call it north south,

2413
02:24:58.950 --> 02:25:02.460
but if you look at an old judo books,
it's actually called the tea bag.

2414
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:05.150
And then I just kept going and don the dragon eggs.

2415
02:25:05.430 --> 02:25:09.260
I never stopped her and I would just throw it away.

2416
02:25:10.050 --> 02:25:14.340
<v 7>That's how we're talking about
seriously.</v>

2417
02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:20.050
And Bud loved it.
The Terry Terry triple cop,

2418
02:25:20.051 --> 02:25:24.130
the owner hated it.
He hated it.
But,
but loved it.
The producer

2419
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:27.850
<v 8>love them.
Every now and then.
I would say some crazy wild shit.</v>

2420
02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:32.230
But Terry hated and the director,
no,
no,
no.
Terry loved it.
What am I saying?

2421
02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:35.440
The director Steve,
he hated it.

2422
02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:40.100
He was begging me to stop because I wasn't renters.
Yeah.

2423
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:43.660
That wasn't being unprofessional,
but nobody,
but the owner didn't care.

2424
02:25:43.661 --> 02:25:47.440
He loved it.
So,
um,
anyways,
I sucked regardless.
But

2425
02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:54.760
I'm a retired,
we're all in the right spot where we want to be.

2426
02:25:54.850 --> 02:25:57.220
I'm not born to connotate.
That's not my thing.

2427
02:25:57.630 --> 02:26:01.200
<v 0>Like now when people offer me jobs,
like I'm like,
I don't want to commentate.</v>

2428
02:26:01.201 --> 02:26:04.220
I want to just enjoy the fight and just watch with literally no.

2429
02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:06.720
When I said to Dana,
when he forced me into doing it,

2430
02:26:06.750 --> 02:26:09.300
don't you remember when you and I used to get free tickets.

2431
02:26:09.630 --> 02:26:13.830
I don't want to work too and I want to watch it and just relax doing commentary

2432
02:26:13.831 --> 02:26:16.230
because I would get free tickets from the UFC.

2433
02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:21.000
This was like when the UFC first started going to Vegas and Eddie and I were

2434
02:26:21.001 --> 02:26:24.600
like,
dude,
the UFC is in Vegas.
This is crazy.
We got to go.

2435
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:28.500
And Dana White,
somehow or another found out that I was a fan.

2436
02:26:28.590 --> 02:26:31.050
So he started sending me,
he's like,
hey,
we'll fly you out.

2437
02:26:31.051 --> 02:26:32.910
We'll give you free tickets.
I'm like,
fuck cash.

2438
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:36.780
And so we started going and hanging out with them and I started doing commentary

2439
02:26:36.781 --> 02:26:39.810
because when we'd hang out,
but I'd be like,
have you ever seen saccharine?

2440
02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:42.380
You do watch pride.
What do you watch overseas?
Like have you,

2441
02:26:42.381 --> 02:26:44.940
if you've seen any of the shooto fights,
I'm like,
you gotta see this guy?

2442
02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:47.730
And I started telling him about this guy and that guy,
and he goes,

2443
02:26:47.731 --> 02:26:51.960
my favorite man,
saccharine love,
amazing,

2444
02:26:51.961 --> 02:26:52.794
amazing fights.

2445
02:26:53.010 --> 02:26:55.860
So I started talking to him about all these crazy fights and he had never heard

2446
02:26:55.861 --> 02:27:00.000
of.
And he's like,
do you want to do commentary on the next thing?
He knows like,

2447
02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:03.840
oh,
I don't want to do that.
I don't want to work.
And then boom,

2448
02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:06.930
I did first 18 shows for free.

2449
02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:11.330
<v 8>I was sitting alone for a couple shows.
This all</v>

2450
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:15.910
all by myself,
the IP front row.

2451
02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:19.840
How did you come here to be by myself?

2452
02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:24.050
<v 0>We saw some classic shit though.
If you really,</v>

2453
02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:26.240
if you think about like the history of the sport,

2454
02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:29.360
like the history of boxing's an amazing history,
right?

2455
02:27:29.361 --> 02:27:34.361
But boxing from 1994 inboxing from 2017 eighteen's not incredibly different.

2456
02:27:37.701 --> 02:27:38.920
Yeah,
I mean there,
there's,

2457
02:27:38.930 --> 02:27:42.200
there definitely I think in all sports the fighters get better and better.

2458
02:27:42.201 --> 02:27:46.280
But you know,
you're talking about like Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield.

2459
02:27:46.281 --> 02:27:48.170
Then you'd look at like what we got today for heavyweight.

2460
02:27:48.180 --> 02:27:52.070
It's like arguably as good if not better back then.
Right.
But not an MMA.

2461
02:27:52.490 --> 02:27:56.330
Let me see.
Giant leaps and changes in the sport.
I was telling somebody,

2462
02:27:56.331 --> 02:28:01.331
I said Jack Johnson has more in common with a modern heavyweight then and then a

2463
02:28:01.581 --> 02:28:03.860
mixed martial artist does with a mixed martial artist in the late nineties

2464
02:28:03.861 --> 02:28:07.340
you're 100% right by a lot.
You're 100% by a lot.
Yeah.

2465
02:28:07.610 --> 02:28:11.900
Jack Johnson might be able to be.
Yeah.
A lot of modern day and stuff.

2466
02:28:12.270 --> 02:28:15.980
He can compete of course.
Sure.
Yeah.
You take,
I mean you,

2467
02:28:15.981 --> 02:28:18.620
even if you go to teach him anything,

2468
02:28:19.130 --> 02:28:21.860
if you put him in there against some,
you know,

2469
02:28:21.890 --> 02:28:26.060
top 30 heavyweight that,
you know,
nobody knows.

2470
02:28:26.061 --> 02:28:29.410
Guys are like not that athletic,
not that good.
Kinda.
Okay.

2471
02:28:29.660 --> 02:28:33.380
He will fuck a lot of people up and then he would start making his way through

2472
02:28:33.381 --> 02:28:36.890
the ranks.
My favorite Jack Johnson story of all time,

2473
02:28:37.010 --> 02:28:41.480
he gets pulled over speeding the the,
the,
the cop says,
uh,
you're speeding.

2474
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:43.860
It's 50 bucks.
He gives him a hundred bucks.
He goes,

2475
02:28:43.861 --> 02:28:45.620
I'm going to be coming back the same way in about an hour.

2476
02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:50.730
<v 5>Awesome.
Cause I'm going to be speeding again,
bitch.
Yup.</v>

2477
02:28:50.860 --> 02:28:54.010
And I'm going to be fucking a lot of white chicks,
unforgivable blackness.

2478
02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:56.620
If you haven't seen that documentary,
that's amazing.

2479
02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:03.110
<v 0>Yeah.
He's one of the best routes of fight shirts.
The Galveston giant,</v>

2480
02:29:03.370 --> 02:29:06.020
it's a roots of fight shirts with him.
When his wingspan

2481
02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:10.600
<v 5>front of the shirt there was,
I used to box with a guy when I,</v>

2482
02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:13.550
when I had a gym and he was our boxing guy and he had the history of the

2483
02:29:13.551 --> 02:29:16.610
heavyweight title memorized.
Do you give him any year?

2484
02:29:16.730 --> 02:29:18.920
And he would tell you who the heavyweight champion was at that time.

2485
02:29:19.730 --> 02:29:20.563
He's one of those guys.

2486
02:29:20.570 --> 02:29:24.770
I didn't memorize every president for what you in order when I was a history

2487
02:29:24.771 --> 02:29:28.280
major,
God damn,
this kind of thing,
you just never let go.
Once you have to do it,

2488
02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:31.820
you're,
you're screwed.
Right.
You don't want to unlearn.
Yeah.
You can't.
Once you,

2489
02:29:31.821 --> 02:29:32.660
once you,
once you're stuck

2490
02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:37.740
<v 4>and the May in the 90s was fucking way different than put Internet,</v>

2491
02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:40.780
no Internet.

2492
02:29:40.780 --> 02:29:45.780
The UFC was huge and there was no fucking internet and the first taste of MMA

2493
02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:50.950
and to get any kind of um,
uh,
fights,
you know,

2494
02:29:50.951 --> 02:29:54.310
like Brazilian fights,
you had to go to these specialty video stores,
like,

2495
02:29:54.670 --> 02:29:57.730
you know,
Japanese stores where they,
they,

2496
02:29:57.910 --> 02:30:02.770
you rent taped TV shows and they were the commercials they would take.
Yeah,

2497
02:30:02.771 --> 02:30:07.630
there was on the commercial you'd watch shooto and I'm on TV from Japan

2498
02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:12.440
<v 5>placing a little Tokyo where I used to go a little Tokyo here in La and when I</v>

2499
02:30:12.441 --> 02:30:13.630
was in college,
when I was at Ucla,

2500
02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:18.640
started doing Jujitsu and I should go in there and the guy didn't speak English

2501
02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:21.170
and I went to the front and I'm trying to explain to him what I'm looking for

2502
02:30:21.171 --> 02:30:25.430
because I knew I had to go to like a Japanese store and I literally said I sell

2503
02:30:25.431 --> 02:30:27.710
it since he'd understand me.
And I said,
look at him.

2504
02:30:27.711 --> 02:30:30.650
I said Ruminal Sato and he goes,
oh,
don't want to start on that.

2505
02:30:30.651 --> 02:30:33.020
And he points to this wall and it's just covered,

2506
02:30:33.350 --> 02:30:38.350
covered in Chucho and pride and pancreas and they it off TV.

2507
02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:42.170
And I went in there like every two days,

2508
02:30:42.740 --> 02:30:46.280
three more until I just knew all of them because you couldn't find them
anywhere.

2509
02:30:46.290 --> 02:30:49.940
You have Tokyo.
The the card for the video store was in Japanese.

2510
02:30:49.941 --> 02:30:50.774
I couldn't read it.

2511
02:30:51.740 --> 02:30:55.870
<v 4>Yeah,
like today there was
Federico,</v>

2512
02:30:55.871 --> 02:30:59.150
the pen panda and I sort of jump out of Raleigh.

2513
02:30:59.330 --> 02:31:03.030
Those are the two promoters in Brazil that valid Mecca,
fides and validators.

2514
02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:06.590
Surgill,
Bartow rally and Federico the panda with the two.

2515
02:31:06.591 --> 02:31:09.860
Dana White's down in Brazil in the nineties before the Internet.

2516
02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:14.840
And I remember my first taste of MNA news on the Internet,
uh,

2517
02:31:14.841 --> 02:31:18.650
was that um,
Todd white,
my training partner,
we're both purple belts.

2518
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:20.120
He was a cartoon.

2519
02:31:20.180 --> 02:31:25.180
A cartoon is at Nickelodeon and at Nickelodeon data they had the internet there.

2520
02:31:25.890 --> 02:31:29.280
So when everyone was gone during lunch date we would,

2521
02:31:29.430 --> 02:31:32.880
we would do drills at Nickelodeon and their gem that an awesome gem.

2522
02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:36.330
How would drive down there and he would take his lunch in the gym and we would

2523
02:31:36.331 --> 02:31:39.150
do Jujitsu.
And then if there was like five or 10 minutes left up,

2524
02:31:39.151 --> 02:31:41.930
we would like sneak into the offices and go into the,

2525
02:31:42.050 --> 02:31:45.390
the Internet and all I wanted,

2526
02:31:46.410 --> 02:31:49.950
all I wanted to see was the Abu Dhabi combat club.
Remember that?

2527
02:31:49.951 --> 02:31:51.240
That was one of the first news.

2528
02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:55.230
There was the only place really that you were getting news from these Brazilian

2529
02:31:55.231 --> 02:31:58.470
shows.
It was a website for MMA.
Yeah,
dude,

2530
02:31:58.530 --> 02:32:03.030
Nma and the 90s was alive and well,
you know,
you know,
there was a heart,

2531
02:32:03.031 --> 02:32:06.570
it was a big hardcore movement,
but there was no internet.

2532
02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:08.460
Yeah,

2533
02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:11.400
<v 5>that's interesting.
I mean,
Wayne and I were talking about last time,
you know,</v>

2534
02:32:11.401 --> 02:32:15.810
weighing in on a bathroom scale and Soboba and I'll in the desert somewhere and

2535
02:32:15.811 --> 02:32:19.830
it's just,
you just wanted to do it.
You just,
you want it to be part of it.

2536
02:32:19.831 --> 02:32:22.350
You didn't,
you know,
it's,
it's hard to understand.

2537
02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:27.270
I got paid 150 bucks from my first fight or something and,
and you just,
well,

2538
02:32:27.271 --> 02:32:30.530
first one,
I didn't get bit neutral grounds.
I fought that new routes.

2539
02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:34.280
It was my first fight,
man.
You fight.

2540
02:32:35.010 --> 02:32:39.090
I fought somebody from a submission factory.
[inaudible] leary,

2541
02:32:39.091 --> 02:32:43.590
landless has hold camp and my coach was [inaudible] Huntington beach.

2542
02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:47.070
He called me and he goes,
he goes,
uh,
it was Friday.
And he goes,

2543
02:32:47.071 --> 02:32:50.760
what are you doing Sunday?
And I went,
nothing.
And he goes,
you want to fight?

2544
02:32:50.820 --> 02:32:52.680
I'm fighting in the back of it.
It was like in the back of a club,

2545
02:32:52.681 --> 02:32:55.950
someone and they'd set up a row.
Actually really big cage.
And I went,
yeah,
sure.

2546
02:32:55.951 --> 02:32:59.340
And they'd line us up against the wall and I was next to this dude and they
went,

2547
02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:00.720
you're about the same size,
you and him.

2548
02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:03.630
Like they literally lined us up and I was like,
how big you were,

2549
02:33:03.690 --> 02:33:06.240
cause they didn't have scale or anything and they go,
you and this dude.

2550
02:33:06.241 --> 02:33:07.074
And I went,
okay.

2551
02:33:07.320 --> 02:33:11.790
And I was a 13th bite at a 13 fights and I got in there and they said,

2552
02:33:12.270 --> 02:33:14.310
um,
all right,
it's two,
five minute rounds.

2553
02:33:14.311 --> 02:33:16.080
Because the rounds were all weird back then.
People don't remember.

2554
02:33:16.081 --> 02:33:19.080
It was like three,
three minute rounds,
two,
five minute rounds.
Well,
whatever,

2555
02:33:19.081 --> 02:33:21.660
you know,
can kiss a lot of times with two,
five minute rounds.
I don't know why.

2556
02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:25.380
So I get in there and I remember thinking to myself,
I didn't train for this.

2557
02:33:25.380 --> 02:33:27.410
I've been doing Jujitsu nine months.
Um,

2558
02:33:27.960 --> 02:33:29.880
so I'm just gonna give it everything and half of the first five minutes,

2559
02:33:30.450 --> 02:33:31.980
because I don't think I have any more of that.

2560
02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:35.130
And the moment I wonder what I'm going to do.
And the bell went off.

2561
02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:39.790
That dude fucking sprinted at me and I hit him and knocked him down and I got,

2562
02:33:39.791 --> 02:33:43.110
had been Fabiano as far side arm barred bro.
Oh 29 seconds.

2563
02:33:43.111 --> 02:33:46.590
And that was my first fight and I was like,
oh,
okay.
All right,
fine.

2564
02:33:47.180 --> 02:33:52.140
It was my first coach.
He was one of the famous our arm body armor.

2565
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:57.930
<v 4>He was a Brazilian hopeful like after Hoy's um,
every,</v>

2566
02:33:58.100 --> 02:34:01.100
all Americans that were into Jujitsu,
we were,
we were,

2567
02:34:01.310 --> 02:34:02.970
we'd like to Brazilians more than

2568
02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:06.530
we were training in Jujitsu and we were white.

2569
02:34:06.590 --> 02:34:10.730
We would be on the Brazilian side in any NMA fight.
Cause you,
you,
you,

2570
02:34:10.910 --> 02:34:14.800
you find out real quick that style is thicker than blood.
Yeah.

2571
02:34:17.850 --> 02:34:21.870
<v 0>Nationality.
How about when the minute Tarro beat Bob?
Sapp you're right.</v>

2572
02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:26.740
You out.
Yes.
Oh Shit.
Knee popped out.
Ooh.

2573
02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:32.920
Eddie Bartow has what I believe is probably a bucket handle tear of his meniscus

2574
02:34:33.101 --> 02:34:37.170
in his meniscus.
We'll pop out and it locks and we'll get you some ice mass.

2575
02:34:37.171 --> 02:34:41.470
Straighten it out.
Sure.
Alright.
Let me know if you need anything.
What do you do?

2576
02:34:41.471 --> 02:34:43.750
Do you pull on it to get it back?

2577
02:34:44.740 --> 02:34:47.930
I'm not asking him questions when I'm asking questions.
He's in so fucking,

2578
02:34:47.970 --> 02:34:51.810
he didn't go back.
It didn't go back.
Didn't go back.
He's in some pain.
Ooh,

2579
02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:57.460
real life folks.
In February.
Eddie,

2580
02:34:57.461 --> 02:35:01.270
you're supposed to get a knee surgery to fix this knee.

2581
02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.400
Do you ever have any knee surgeries?
Jimmy?
None.
None.
Knock on wood.
Oh,

2582
02:35:06.401 --> 02:35:09.390
you're lucky.
Very,
very lucky.
I had three hernia surgeries.

2583
02:35:09.410 --> 02:35:12.910
Only surgery I've ever had.
Oh no shit.
Yeah.
Very Lucky Eddie had that.
Oh,

2584
02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:17.380
there you go.
There you go.
Back.
Whoa.
So is it pop back in place?

2585
02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:20.760
Fuck Ah,
Ooh.

2586
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:25.960
Did that looked really painful?
Yeah,
it's back.
You're good.

2587
02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:30.070
That's good.
It's like the seventh time it's happening.
Check for you.

2588
02:35:30.071 --> 02:35:33.580
Ever seen this?
I was sitting,
I had my leg up like this.
I fucked up.

2589
02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:35.680
Can you pause this and bring this back?
I want you,

2590
02:35:35.681 --> 02:35:37.760
I want to play this video for you guys cause I,

2591
02:35:37.761 --> 02:35:42.340
I call this video the thirsty white people video like back this up.

2592
02:35:42.370 --> 02:35:46.870
This is one of them testosterone videos.
Thomas gimme,
some gimme,
some volume.

2593
02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:51.400
I'll get no,
take it from the beginning.
Good.
And hold that hall and uh,
yeah,

2594
02:35:51.401 --> 02:35:53.950
and give me some volume like pause it for a second.
Okay,

2595
02:35:54.100 --> 02:35:55.780
now give me some volume so we could all hear it.

2596
02:35:55.930 --> 02:35:59.020
This is the thirstiest white people video ever.

2597
02:35:59.290 --> 02:36:03.460
These white people are gawking about,
what's the gentleman's name?
Frank Thomas.

2598
02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:06.730
Frank Thomas has a big ass football player.
He's a baseball player.

2599
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:10.180
Whatever the fuck he is,
whatever.
He had a bomb.
But here's the thing,
sorry.

2600
02:36:10.390 --> 02:36:14.020
Big Ass professional athlete.
Yes,
but happens to be an African American.

2601
02:36:14.290 --> 02:36:18.250
Listen to how thirsty these white people sound when they're talking about him.

2602
02:36:18.290 --> 02:36:19.123
Go ahead.
Play it.

2603
02:36:19.950 --> 02:36:20.783
<v 3>No.</v>

2604
02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:27.380
<v 0>Okay.
Do it again so people can hear you got a too low.</v>

2605
02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:32.540
Louder.
If that's her husband.
Hold on.
I'll turn it louder.

2606
02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:40.500
<v 3>How's it going?
You look like you can still be playing off what?
I said.</v>

2607
02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:44.580
<v 0>Yeah.
Listen,
this part it's,
what's your secret?</v>

2608
02:36:45.290 --> 02:36:46.280
<v 3>Which my husband did.</v>

2609
02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:51.030
<v 0>I wish my husband did.
Jesus Christ.
New Jetta.
I take new genetics.</v>

2610
02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:55.870
I wished my husband did.
She stared right next to him just begging for the crazy.

2611
02:36:57.190 --> 02:37:01.450
That dude is Steve White people commercial ever.
Oh,
that's a gay friend.

2612
02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:06.010
No,
she said or honk.
She said,
oh no,
that's her husband.

2613
02:37:06.011 --> 02:37:08.710
She's making them feel like shit.
Look at him and this guys.
Oh,

2614
02:37:08.711 --> 02:37:12.400
you're bench pressing and shit and throwing Dick and all the white chicks in the

2615
02:37:12.401 --> 02:37:16.190
gym.
Guaranteed.
How does he not,
how does he say no?

2616
02:37:16.570 --> 02:37:21.530
<v 6>This literally back in that pussy up into a catapult munching it.
Adam.</v>

2617
02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:28.640
I wish my husband did,
but he doesn't look.
It says smash.
See that in the texts,

2618
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:33.620
the text message,
it says smash.
They're talking about smashing pussy.
That's what,

2619
02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:36.710
that's what dudes say when they say what happened?
Aw,
smashed it.

2620
02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:40.280
That's what they're saying.
It says that in the thing.
It says smash.

2621
02:37:40.281 --> 02:37:43.650
What are you smashing?
Yeah.
God Damn it.
That's a thirsty

2622
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:45.470
<v 1>white people commercial smashing.</v>

2623
02:37:45.471 --> 02:37:48.110
You want to stop now and that's just what I'm curious about.
You then it work.

2624
02:37:48.140 --> 02:37:50.960
Is it effective?
I mean it might work.
Probably Bullshit.

2625
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:54.050
It's not bullshit is the love that those white people,

2626
02:37:54.090 --> 02:37:58.080
<v 6>well,
half of that black athlete.
Yeah.</v>

2627
02:37:58.150 --> 02:38:00.980
That was crazy commercial.
Whoa.

2628
02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:03.210
More like a honk.

2629
02:38:03.211 --> 02:38:06.810
Like she says she's going to the hog in front of her husband and then the other

2630
02:38:06.811 --> 02:38:10.590
lady is saying,
I wish my husband like,
Whoa,

2631
02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:13.530
slow down,
thirsty white people.

2632
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:18.830
<v 1>Slow the fuck down.
Well there's a replay or your boy.</v>

2633
02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:23.480
Yeah.
Mek and come out with Mon.
Interesting.
Interesting.

2634
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:26.120
Oh see right there.
That's spinning back fist.
He got tagged,

2635
02:38:27.410 --> 02:38:29.150
showed some good goddamn wrestling now.

2636
02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:32.870
It all entertaining fights to it's good all around.
Yeah,
it was a very good card.

2637
02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:35.750
Very,
I'm sorry.
Very good card.
Very interesting.

2638
02:38:37.610 --> 02:38:37.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2639
02:38:37.930 --> 02:38:40.420
<v 1>Um,
I'm so curious about next weekend.</v>

2640
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:44.710
I mean that's only six days away from today.
Yeah.
I,
I'm so curious.

2641
02:38:45.580 --> 02:38:48.310
What do you think about the switch?

2642
02:38:48.730 --> 02:38:52.000
You guys were talking about the wrestling move,
the switch switching you think,

2643
02:38:52.670 --> 02:38:57.160
how important do you think that is to train in an MMA god,
it was huge.

2644
02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:59.650
I think it's very important to know for sure.
For sure.

2645
02:38:59.651 --> 02:39:03.370
It's just one of many components,
but it seems like an important move.

2646
02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:09.040
You'd think you'd see it more Ma Russell's do it all at time.
Wrestlers in MMA.

2647
02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:13.330
Yeah.
I know it's a wrestling move.
Yeah.
But an NMA,

2648
02:39:13.331 --> 02:39:15.040
you'd think you'd see it more.

2649
02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:19.560
You see a once every four years it's actually executed all the way through.
Yeah.

2650
02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:23.020
Right.
You don't see it that I didn't see it at all until a few years ago.

2651
02:39:23.021 --> 02:39:24.940
It was like Russell's just started doing it.
Yeah.

2652
02:39:24.941 --> 02:39:28.640
Like you would think you would see it all the goddamn time.
Yeah.
Hmm.

2653
02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:32.950
That's a good move.
So I just,
you know,

2654
02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:35.980
it's in our warmups and everything.
I just wanted your opinion.

2655
02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:41.370
Is it necessary?
You never seen it.
I think it's okay.
I do.
Yeah.

2656
02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:45.130
I really gotta be right.
Yeah.
I teach you guys all the time.
I think it's great.

2657
02:39:47.100 --> 02:39:50.640
Personally,
I think it's getting mouth Camaros.
Mon Talking Mad Shit.

2658
02:39:50.641 --> 02:39:53.580
I wish I could have heard what you said.
Paul felt really beautiful.

2659
02:39:53.581 --> 02:39:57.060
Pocket Square and a nice watch.
Look at him.
Handsome.
That's a nice suit.

2660
02:39:57.430 --> 02:40:02.160
Looks good.
It's a big watch it again.
Low.
Can you wire it again?
You get to work.

2661
02:40:02.410 --> 02:40:06.450
You could wear the suit again.
Yeah.
As in think nobody,

2662
02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:11.310
they're all afraid to fight me cause Bruce Bumper has a different outfit every

2663
02:40:11.311 --> 02:40:14.220
show.
He can't.
He doesn't wear the same one.
Well let

2664
02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:16.020
<v 5>me just tell you a David August</v>

2665
02:40:16.090 --> 02:40:19.660
<v 0>makes all the suits for the commentary team on the UFC.</v>

2666
02:40:19.661 --> 02:40:22.990
He makes my suits and um,
he uh,

2667
02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:24.930
he tailors him to you perfectly.

2668
02:40:24.940 --> 02:40:28.150
See that one that's on Pol or if you see the ones on me,
I'm a slob man.

2669
02:40:28.450 --> 02:40:30.760
I would never bought those suits on my own.
I'm too stupid.

2670
02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:32.500
They had to bring somebody in.

2671
02:40:32.580 --> 02:40:36.660
<v 5>But since then I had him make me some stuff in my personal life.
Might as well.</v>

2672
02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:38.520
Yeah.
He,
I had him,
I hired him.

2673
02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:40.650
<v 0>Make Damn Darrin tells number seven,</v>

2674
02:40:41.070 --> 02:40:45.720
one fight with cowboy and he's number seven above Neil Magni,

2675
02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:50.970
which is crazy.
That's interesting.
Um,

2676
02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.820
but yeah,
so the UFC makes you a few suits.

2677
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:55.530
I got a couple of different color suits.

2678
02:40:55.710 --> 02:41:00.510
<v 5>Nice.
Like three or four different,
one sentence,
black shirt anymore.
Well,</v>

2679
02:41:00.511 --> 02:41:04.290
I have black shirts,
but now I have like real close,
real dope.

2680
02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:09.050
Like an adult.
I never wear black shirts.
Why?
Because everybody,

2681
02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:12.870
I get so much shit every time I tell somebody I throw away,

2682
02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:14.670
I had black shirts because they go with everything.

2683
02:41:14.700 --> 02:41:19.470
I fucking throw them way for the people at home.
By the way,
Eddie Bravo outside.

2684
02:41:19.471 --> 02:41:23.910
As I pulled up,
fought,
I was,
Joe walked up to me like,
hey dude.

2685
02:41:24.710 --> 02:41:28.170
Oh Hey Jimmy.
And I was like,
he fucking thought I was,
and he goes,

2686
02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:30.720
I thought you were Joe Dude.
And I was like,
no.

2687
02:41:31.110 --> 02:41:36.040
He came in there with an old ass car.
Carbon fiber.
That's fine.

2688
02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:38.520
Yeah.
I don't wear fucking black shirt.
I'm so sorry.

2689
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:41.610
What's fucked up is that you are bald before me.

2690
02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:46.070
I was fucking freaked out one sheet and,

2691
02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:50.970
but it's cool man.
It's all good.
Well that's all right.
No,
no.

2692
02:41:50.971 --> 02:41:54.840
It's just an illustration of the of the natural.
My mom got us confused one time.

2693
02:41:55.050 --> 02:41:59.010
I'm not even fucking joke.
Oh no,
that's right.
That's right.

2694
02:41:59.790 --> 02:42:01.080
I was at my mom's house.

2695
02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:04.320
She was making me dinner and I was going to watch you and sees a lot of times

2696
02:42:04.321 --> 02:42:06.150
where my mom's house,
she's an amazing cook.
She's Greek.

2697
02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:09.050
You guys will have to come over and get,
have dinner some time.
So we came,

2698
02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:11.640
I went to her house,
she's making me dinner.
Some were watching the UFC.

2699
02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:16.350
She turns around.
She goes,
oh,
this is one of yours.
No mom,
that's Joe Rogan.

2700
02:42:16.470 --> 02:42:21.180
And she goes,
she fucking Paul.
She goes,
man,
he looks like you.
It was like,

2701
02:42:21.181 --> 02:42:25.410
thanks mom.
I can't do shit fucking 50 times a day on the Internet.

2702
02:42:25.830 --> 02:42:29.420
I'm going to get this from my own mother.
But I still eat the food that,

2703
02:42:29.970 --> 02:42:33.330
but one of the things about you do,
you don't toot your own horn.

2704
02:42:33.331 --> 02:42:38.331
It's like your like universally respected thanking me with people that know the

2705
02:42:39.001 --> 02:42:40.130
sport,
you know,

2706
02:42:40.170 --> 02:42:44.850
which is why I was a campaign to get you hired by the UFC years ago.
I'm like,

2707
02:42:45.150 --> 02:42:49.250
this guy's the shit just stuffed.
I'm excited man.

2708
02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:53.790
I'm excited too.
For Big John.
I love it and I'm excited he got that Gig.

2709
02:42:53.791 --> 02:42:56.370
I hope that really works out well for them.
I think it's gonna be interesting.

2710
02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:59.850
I understand completely kind of the step.

2711
02:42:59.851 --> 02:43:04.470
And then I don't recall a referee ever doing Khan Academy.
He did affliction,

2712
02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:07.350
he did the first afflictions show.
But it's a different perspective.

2713
02:43:07.351 --> 02:43:11.010
He's seeing it from an angle that no fighter or coach is really going to see.

2714
02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:12.100
And so I

2715
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:14.050
<v 0>think it's great cause any,
you know,</v>

2716
02:43:14.410 --> 02:43:17.020
any fighter is going to be compared to all the other fighters that do it.

2717
02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:19.720
A referee,
he's just going to have a different perspective.

2718
02:43:19.721 --> 02:43:23.470
And I think that's a good choice if he does it with John or if John does it with

2719
02:43:23.471 --> 02:43:27.820
Mike Goldberg and John are real good friends.
First show is Mike.
That's belief,

2720
02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:29.470
I believe.
Don't quote me on that,

2721
02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:33.340
but they were real good friends so that should just be real easy.
Yeah.

2722
02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:36.490
Mike's easy to work with.
He's easy to work with.
Uh,

2723
02:43:36.610 --> 02:43:39.370
Mara was to both guys were easy to work with.
They're very different,

2724
02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:42.310
but both guys were easy to work with.
Man.
I was,

2725
02:43:42.311 --> 02:43:45.610
I was impressed with both of them.
Honestly.
Mike's Mike's a sweetheart.
The,

2726
02:43:45.730 --> 02:43:50.560
we need more work for a lot of guys,
but what,
what for what we do,

2727
02:43:51.050 --> 02:43:52.750
there's not a lot of guys that do it.
You know,

2728
02:43:52.751 --> 02:43:55.780
there's Paul Felder who I think does a fucking phenomenal job and I would have

2729
02:43:55.781 --> 02:43:59.300
loved to listen to him tonight if we weren't yapping.
But uh,
he,

2730
02:43:59.350 --> 02:44:02.800
he does a great job.
He has a smooth,
smooth guy,
very smooth.

2731
02:44:03.010 --> 02:44:06.190
I think Dan Hardee does a great job.
Um,
you know,

2732
02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:10.500
Brian Stan was one of my favorites.
I was bummed out when Brian left.
Yeah.
He,

2733
02:44:10.501 --> 02:44:13.120
he prepared better than anybody.
Brian,

2734
02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:17.680
Stan would pull out shed about training and all these different weird things

2735
02:44:17.681 --> 02:44:21.820
that you didn't know about preparation and other things that fighters do that

2736
02:44:21.821 --> 02:44:24.220
this guy did that was unusual and you're like,
whoa.

2737
02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:28.670
His preparation was top of the food chain.
So fulltime job people,

2738
02:44:29.470 --> 02:44:33.750
people don't get that,
you know,
in terms of like,
um,
you know,
uh,

2739
02:44:34.660 --> 02:44:36.580
when I'm not doing commentary,

2740
02:44:36.581 --> 02:44:40.630
I'm studying fights all the time because I'm not just watching am I got to sit

2741
02:44:40.631 --> 02:44:42.880
there and study them,
which is a totally different job.

2742
02:44:42.910 --> 02:44:45.130
<v 8>What's funny is Joan fulltime job,
shit,</v>

2743
02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:51.500
I'm speaking to myself.
Joe would just walk on and just karate,
but the,

2744
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:54.280
no preparation.
Maybe a couple of thoughts,
couple notes,

2745
02:44:54.281 --> 02:44:58.390
but he wasn't preparing at all.
That's what it was.
It was hilarious.

2746
02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:02.950
It's like it's too easy.
Well,
it's all the things I do live.

2747
02:45:03.030 --> 02:45:05.080
If you think about how much stand up I do live,

2748
02:45:05.470 --> 02:45:09.620
then how much podcasts I do live before the podcast.
True.

2749
02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:13.410
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
you know,
the thing was they,</v>

2750
02:45:14.250 --> 02:45:19.050
they wanted to have like some sort of planned out interaction between,

2751
02:45:19.051 --> 02:45:20.880
like that's one of the things that people would freak out about.

2752
02:45:20.881 --> 02:45:25.210
Like when we would do the beginning of the fight and gold were bolt.

2753
02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:29.850
Goldberg would say like Matt Hughes Fights Frank Trig for the UFC welterweight

2754
02:45:29.851 --> 02:45:32.460
title.
You know,
and this is an important fight.
He would hit,

2755
02:45:32.490 --> 02:45:34.500
I didn't know what the fuck I was gonna say.

2756
02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:37.710
I didn't know what he was going to say.
I didn't know what I was going to say.

2757
02:45:37.860 --> 02:45:42.060
I had no idea.
But I knew about the fight.
So my point was like,
hey,

2758
02:45:42.061 --> 02:45:47.061
it's better to be in the moment and really care about this fight and care about

2759
02:45:47.341 --> 02:45:50.250
what I think is going to happen and not have anything planned out.

2760
02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:51.900
I just wanted to be able to go,

2761
02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:55.590
this is what's critical in this fight and we're going to know early on whether

2762
02:45:55.591 --> 02:45:58.260
or not,
you know the fight is going to go one way or other based on a couple of

2763
02:45:58.261 --> 02:45:58.711
parameters.

2764
02:45:58.711 --> 02:46:02.180
And I would just go into those things and then after would it be over?
But like,

2765
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:03.063
whoa.

2766
02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:07.390
<v 8>But I tell,
I tell new PPC for you,
man,
nobody.</v>

2767
02:46:08.090 --> 02:46:09.740
I told him he's the of

2768
02:46:10.810 --> 02:46:14.740
<v 5>Cherry for Emma May.
Are you kidding me?
100% but,
but,
but what I,</v>

2769
02:46:14.810 --> 02:46:17.000
what I tell people don't write down.

2770
02:46:17.270 --> 02:46:21.110
You'll think about what did I write down rather than the APP.
I tell people I go,

2771
02:46:21.111 --> 02:46:24.410
never play by play.
Do of course,
but I go color.

2772
02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:27.110
Don't write down notes or don't write down.
Here's what I'm going to say.

2773
02:46:27.111 --> 02:46:30.470
Because you'll start thinking about what you wrote down and you'll sell fake and

2774
02:46:30.471 --> 02:46:33.860
you'll sound fake.
It doesn't work.
Have a couple of bullet points in your head.

2775
02:46:34.310 --> 02:46:35.540
You know what you want to hit,

2776
02:46:35.541 --> 02:46:38.540
just know the two bullet points and you'll get through the open and it opens.

2777
02:46:38.541 --> 02:46:40.260
You know,
I think the two most 15 seconds,

2778
02:46:40.261 --> 02:46:44.030
the two most important things are you've got to actually care like that.

2779
02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:46.940
That isn't,
this has to be important to you.
Like when like Francis,

2780
02:46:46.941 --> 02:46:49.610
like I'm thinking about Francis and Steve Bay all fucking day.

2781
02:46:49.940 --> 02:46:51.470
I'm going to think about them all day tomorrow.

2782
02:46:51.530 --> 02:46:54.200
I'm going to think about if I'm bored and I'm in the middle of doing something

2783
02:46:54.201 --> 02:46:56.930
else,
I'm going to like,
what the fuck is gonna Happen next Saturday night?
Yeah.

2784
02:46:57.080 --> 02:46:57.980
So you've got to care.

2785
02:46:58.010 --> 02:47:00.920
It has to mean something to you and you have to know what you're talking about.

2786
02:47:01.100 --> 02:47:04.340
So you have to understand the sport,
you have to have a deep knowledge in it,

2787
02:47:04.490 --> 02:47:08.390
you have to really care.
And then it should just sort of work itself out.

2788
02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:11.720
Like if you've thought about it and you like,
okay,
here's what's going to happen.

2789
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:14.540
Steve Bay's got to get the clinch.
He's got to figure out a way to get,

2790
02:47:14.570 --> 02:47:16.520
he doesn't want to stand on the outside with that guy.

2791
02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:21.020
The guys got these crazy long arms and you can't make a mistake.

2792
02:47:21.290 --> 02:47:23.960
One Punch puts you into orbit so you have to,

2793
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:28.220
you have to be real careful with your closing the distance you got to click and

2794
02:47:28.221 --> 02:47:31.340
then I,
I think if,
if you go into it that way,

2795
02:47:31.460 --> 02:47:35.480
if you really understand fighting and you really care about what's going on,

2796
02:47:35.690 --> 02:47:37.400
it's just a matter of expressing yourself.

2797
02:47:37.970 --> 02:47:42.970
The two things that separate the men from the boys in commentary and I'm like,

2798
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:47.720
this is,
this is the honest truth to me is number two,

2799
02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:51.590
and I will always text like you are antique or something.

2800
02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:54.830
When there are a lot of knockouts early in a fight,
I'll be like,
how's it going?

2801
02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:58.510
Because that's when it's like we have to fill all this time because you

2802
02:47:58.520 --> 02:47:59.730
understand the TV is they've,

2803
02:47:59.731 --> 02:48:02.600
they've booked a two hour TV show or through our paper,
whatever it is,

2804
02:48:02.810 --> 02:48:06.710
they got to fill x amount of minutes period.
Doesn't matter what happens.

2805
02:48:06.860 --> 02:48:10.850
So they either use fights that they've already used or Jimmy get up and

2806
02:48:10.851 --> 02:48:13.070
interview this fight and we need five minutes like right now.

2807
02:48:13.071 --> 02:48:16.290
So that's when the tap dance and happens is a lot of early,
not guts.

2808
02:48:16.291 --> 02:48:17.780
You have to fill a lot of time.
That's tough.

2809
02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:22.280
The second one is when you have a 25 minutes snooze fest and you're going,

2810
02:48:23.210 --> 02:48:24.880
oh,
I got to think of some.

2811
02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:28.850
Those are the two parts that are really channel we are talking about hard

2812
02:48:28.851 --> 02:48:31.670
interviews are,
but in terms of in commentary,

2813
02:48:31.880 --> 02:48:36.230
those two are tough when there are those early knockouts or long boring coming

2814
02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:39.570
to for fights that you have never heard of.
The fighters,

2815
02:48:39.580 --> 02:48:41.390
just the whole car was just a bunch of guys.

2816
02:48:41.450 --> 02:48:46.450
Rookies back in 2001 2002 just and man it was,

2817
02:48:49.220 --> 02:48:53.660
it wasn't fun.
25 fights in a fucking nightmare.

2818
02:48:53.930 --> 02:48:56.690
It used to be all fucking day.

2819
02:48:56.700 --> 02:49:01.160
Gladiator challenged Eddie Jr three member paid more,

2820
02:49:01.161 --> 02:49:04.820
nine to two 10 write me off.
I got the 200 bucks a fight in the fucking thing.

2821
02:49:05.530 --> 02:49:10.530
Do you remember the Hitman show where they pretended they'd fight?

2822
02:49:10.650 --> 02:49:15.000
God,
Bob Ballou and chill.
But there was real fights.
There were real fights,

2823
02:49:15.001 --> 02:49:18.270
but they were like,
hey,
we're filming a show starting the beginning.
It's fake.

2824
02:49:18.390 --> 02:49:23.370
So they got around the MMA rules by saying that it was like fake.

2825
02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:25.500
It's a famous movie.

2826
02:49:25.530 --> 02:49:30.060
It's a famous thing here in California for the listeners who weren't around MMA

2827
02:49:30.061 --> 02:49:30.900
wasn't legal.

2828
02:49:31.290 --> 02:49:35.310
So what they did is that they pretended they were shooting a movie and they the

2829
02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:39.810
the,
do you remember the,
the cards for the fight said like Hitman,
the movie?

2830
02:49:40.110 --> 02:49:42.090
Yes.
Do you remember that?

2831
02:49:42.260 --> 02:49:45.240
And on the back and had the fight card on it and it was a real fight card,

2832
02:49:45.450 --> 02:49:47.640
but they pretended they were filming a movie.

2833
02:49:48.450 --> 02:49:51.810
And so the cop showed up and said,
oh yeah,

2834
02:49:51.811 --> 02:49:55.480
then who wins the fights if this is fake?
And they,

2835
02:49:55.481 --> 02:49:59.730
that's why that night they just chose winners even though it didn't matter who

2836
02:49:59.731 --> 02:50:03.540
won.
And so for a while,
those people had goofy records until they eliminated.

2837
02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:05.590
And this is a famous cal.
Do you remember that?

2838
02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:08.550
The cop showed up and they had to like,
oh yeah,

2839
02:50:08.551 --> 02:50:10.890
this is fake chill wins or whatever.
I forget who won.

2840
02:50:10.891 --> 02:50:15.060
But they just raised his hand and even though he didn't win and so te,

2841
02:50:15.090 --> 02:50:18.300
so the cops wouldn't when bust everybody.
But that's,
yeah,

2842
02:50:18.301 --> 02:50:22.800
the famous Hitman show hit man the movie.
I remember that crazy back in the day,

2843
02:50:22.801 --> 02:50:27.720
dude,
back in the day.
Now listen,
we should get,
we got to wrap this up,
but um,

2844
02:50:27.780 --> 02:50:32.780
I just want to say that it's been real cool to be friends with you all these

2845
02:50:33.331 --> 02:50:36.270
years while you were working for Bella tour.

2846
02:50:36.300 --> 02:50:40.620
It always meant a lot to me that you and I were never weird even though we were

2847
02:50:40.621 --> 02:50:44.880
both doing the same job for other organizations were both really cool.

2848
02:50:44.881 --> 02:50:47.820
I got you tickets to UFC before we hung out a bunch of times.

2849
02:50:48.030 --> 02:50:52.230
He did the podcast a bunch of times and we would text back and forth.

2850
02:50:52.231 --> 02:50:53.800
All the title fights we're going on.

2851
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:56.390
I would text him like crazy Bela Tarr fights are going on.

2852
02:50:56.410 --> 02:51:00.000
He would text me when crazy UFC fights are going on.
So like during the fight,

2853
02:51:00.001 --> 02:51:02.760
sometimes I text and Jimmy we'd be going back and forth.

2854
02:51:03.060 --> 02:51:05.790
It meant a lot to me that we were tight.
It did.

2855
02:51:06.210 --> 02:51:10.680
And it means a lot to me now that you're at the UFC.
I love it.
Well,
I,

2856
02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:14.670
I wouldn't be there without you.
I wouldn't.
And,
and,
and I'm,
I'm,

2857
02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:19.440
I'm happy everybody knows that.
I mean,
it's like,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,

2858
02:51:19.470 --> 02:51:22.080
it's meant a lot to me that,
that you didn't,

2859
02:51:22.081 --> 02:51:26.370
you reached out to me when I first left belter and you said,
keep your head up,

2860
02:51:26.371 --> 02:51:27.510
man.
You're,
you're the best.

2861
02:51:27.570 --> 02:51:30.390
And I didn't know you knew who I was and that's where things started.

2862
02:51:30.390 --> 02:51:32.640
And it was a first time I realized,
man,

2863
02:51:32.641 --> 02:51:37.020
people outside this bubble actually have any idea who I am and you didn't have

2864
02:51:37.021 --> 02:51:37.810
to do that.
And I,

2865
02:51:37.810 --> 02:51:42.720
it's meant a lot for years and I'm just thrilled that it finally worked out and

2866
02:51:42.750 --> 02:51:45.270
one in the same spot,
man.
I'm so,
you're an amazing dude,
man.

2867
02:51:45.271 --> 02:51:48.420
I really appreciate your mad and you're really fucking good.
Thank you.

2868
02:51:48.480 --> 02:51:52.200
It means a lot to me because I'm a fan.
You know,
I like,

2869
02:51:52.260 --> 02:51:56.790
I like watching fights and you call them.
Fantastic.
Thanks man.
I appreciate that.

2870
02:51:56.791 --> 02:51:58.790
Any problem?
You're pretty beautiful too.
You're awesome too.
Heady.

2871
02:51:58.870 --> 02:52:01.110
Like your face looks so amazing.
Is You not drinking?

2872
02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:06.460
When are you getting your knee surgery?
That's a good question.

2873
02:52:06.700 --> 02:52:09.010
<v 1>You said February,
Tony's got a fight coming up,</v>

2874
02:52:09.011 --> 02:52:12.790
so I'm going to wait till after that's over.
Oh,
did they schedule something?

2875
02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:18.230
What the F five for Tony?
We,
he's gonna.
They're working on something.
Oh,

2876
02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:21.260
okay.
So you wouldn't be able to move.
You heard it here first.

2877
02:52:21.340 --> 02:52:25.270
You just let something out of the bag on.
Tony is a fighter.

2878
02:52:25.271 --> 02:52:26.770
He's always working on a new fight,

2879
02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:30.640
so if you have your knee fucked up,

2880
02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:34.420
you just won't be able to demonstrate techniques.
Is that what it is?
If I have,

2881
02:52:36.130 --> 02:52:40.750
if I think I'm going to be on crutches for four weeks or something,

2882
02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:46.010
no.
Okay.
See,
I went to a party five days after my surgery.
I was crutches.

2883
02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:48.850
Okay,
good.
I just put a knee brace on the days afterwards.

2884
02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:50.290
I've never had ACL surgery,

2885
02:52:50.291 --> 02:52:53.200
so I was just thinking maybe like four weeks crutches.

2886
02:52:53.260 --> 02:52:57.350
If you get a cadaver graft,
it's so noninvasive.
It's fucking amazing.
Here.

2887
02:52:57.370 --> 02:53:01.570
Patel is the best.
No,
I've had both the,
the cadavers the best.

2888
02:53:01.870 --> 02:53:04.850
The problem with the cadaver is it's getting,
some people say,
Nah,

2889
02:53:04.860 --> 02:53:09.260
I've never heard that.
I mean,
it might happen to Benji radic he got to cut back,

2890
02:53:09.680 --> 02:53:11.050
but I think he just got an infection.

2891
02:53:11.110 --> 02:53:14.020
I think I know exactly what happened because the doctor,

2892
02:53:14.021 --> 02:53:18.280
the knee doctor that did it,
he,
I know him.
He's my doctor.

2893
02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:22.870
He said that was the last time I did a cadaver because it got infected and it

2894
02:53:22.871 --> 02:53:27.820
was really bad.
So,
um,
ever since then he stopped doing cadavers.

2895
02:53:27.821 --> 02:53:31.960
He just sticks to Patella.
I have both.
This one's Patella,

2896
02:53:31.990 --> 02:53:36.550
this one's cadaver.
This one was way quicker.
Healing a way less invasive.

2897
02:53:36.610 --> 02:53:41.150
And neither one of them give me problems today.
But I think,
uh,

2898
02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:45.500
I think if I had to do it again,
I do cadaver.
Hmm.
Interesting.
I'll look into it.

2899
02:53:45.501 --> 02:53:48.250
I also use a thicker tendon because they used the Achilles tendon,

2900
02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:52.330
these big fat rope.
The stick,
that bad boy in there,

2901
02:53:52.331 --> 02:53:55.690
it's 150% stronger than your natural ACL.

2902
02:53:56.950 --> 02:54:01.690
Damn.
Maybe I need to do that.
I would do with it 100%.
I would do it if you want.

2903
02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:05.290
My Guy Gettleman who did both my knees,
he's amazing.

2904
02:54:05.291 --> 02:54:08.980
He just hit my buddy shoulder too.
He's amazing.
And he's out here.
He's a,

2905
02:54:09.220 --> 02:54:12.100
he's actually Simi Valley.
Anything.
He has a place in Beverly Hills too.

2906
02:54:12.170 --> 02:54:15.190
He does a lot of pro athletes can't do shit til after that fight.

2907
02:54:15.191 --> 02:54:19.990
So it's going to be a couple months.
But if you,
if you just did it,
um,

2908
02:54:20.140 --> 02:54:22.420
it did the surgery,
you would still be able to coach them.

2909
02:54:22.450 --> 02:54:23.890
You just wouldn't be able to do certain moves.

2910
02:54:23.891 --> 02:54:27.530
And maybe you could bring someone like Marvin or you know,
one of your best guys.

2911
02:54:27.530 --> 02:54:30.940
Yeah.
You know what?
You're right.
I don't think you should put it off.

2912
02:54:30.970 --> 02:54:34.540
You're right.
I'm looking at a whole different way now.
Yeah,

2913
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:36.130
I should just fucking do it.
Let's do it.

2914
02:54:36.190 --> 02:54:38.800
Just do it because that's six months that'll take to rehab.

2915
02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:41.350
It happens before you know it,
but if you put it off,

2916
02:54:41.410 --> 02:54:44.800
that's six months happens before you know it too and all of a sudden six months

2917
02:54:44.801 --> 02:54:47.200
later you still have a fucked up neat and you haven't gotten the surgery.

2918
02:54:47.201 --> 02:54:51.670
It just went out on air.
Yeah,
can get that shit fixed,

2919
02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:52.901
get that shit fixed.

2920
02:54:52.901 --> 02:54:55.690
Cause look like it was going to pop back in the last two times it happened.

2921
02:54:55.691 --> 02:54:57.790
It was really hard to pop back in and I'm thinking,
man,

2922
02:54:57.791 --> 02:54:59.150
when if it gets stuck like this shit,

2923
02:54:59.230 --> 02:55:01.360
you won't be able to roll hard for six months,

2924
02:55:01.361 --> 02:55:05.630
but the reality is you'll be able to do a lot of stuff before then,

2925
02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:09.710
especially when you're showing your drilling and just showing there's no

2926
02:55:09.711 --> 02:55:12.110
resistance.
Yeah.
You'll be able to do a lot pretty quick.

2927
02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:14.150
Songs is no resistance on your name.

2928
02:55:14.151 --> 02:55:17.150
You'll be able to do a lot like three months in and you'll be doing,

2929
02:55:17.180 --> 02:55:20.630
I'm sure you'd be doing a ton of Rehab.
You'll be on the ball with that shit.

2930
02:55:20.990 --> 02:55:23.640
You know,
you're,
you're going to be,
you're going to be very,
yeah,

2931
02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:28.010
very disciplined to get back to work.
I hear you.
Dot.
All right.
Uh,

2932
02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:30.950
let's wrap this bitch up.
Jimmy Smith.
Thanks for doing this,
brother.

2933
02:55:31.010 --> 02:55:34.460
Welcome aboard.
We'll love you.
Love you too,
Eddie Bravo.
Love you too.

2934
02:55:35.270 --> 02:55:39.350
I'm releasing combat Jujitsu worlds one.
