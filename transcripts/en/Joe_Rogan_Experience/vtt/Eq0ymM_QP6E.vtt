<v Speaker 1>right back there.</v>

9
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.090

18
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.120

<v Speaker 1>This is just coincidence that we have to</v>

19
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 1>happen to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we have had an offer for our very </v>

20
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>first sponsor and it is the fleshlight </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

21
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I got some funny to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

22
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>

23
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 2>We've got to tell people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fleshlight</v>

24
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

26
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a,</v>

27
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>an online type person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

28
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>a very famous device that you can fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

29
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:16.851
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why it's famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's supposed to feel really </v>

30
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:19.041
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to feel like way better </v>

31
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:20.541
<v Speaker 1>than your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other reason is that there was </v>

32
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:20.541
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing that was online,</v>

33
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>like I accidentally the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashlight.</v>

34
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 2>What was that Guy Pranking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:30.291
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a customer service rep </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a saying only as something that he,</v>

36
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 2>he is a flashlight or something like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a really bad accident.</v>

37
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 2>No flush Elo Carola.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well cat,</v>

38
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 2>well this guy</v>

39
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 1>watched that or heard that thing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember it.</v>

40
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:46.801
<v Speaker 1>But I do remember that that fleshlight </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing got stuck in my head because of </v>

41
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:49.390
<v Speaker 1>that because everybody kept saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

42
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.740
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

43
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

44
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.020
<v Speaker 1>you hear about it so often on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet just because of that.</v>

46
00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>So when they contacted me I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

47
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>that's kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when he told me that he sponsored a</v>

48
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Smith podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

49
00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's super cool.</v>

50
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Like he's going to do our podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Smith's podcast.</v>

51
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:09.580
<v Speaker 1>That sounds fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we met the dude and Chris was a</v>

52
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>super cool guy and uh,</v>

54
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.140
<v Speaker 1>with like a normal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was really a kind of a spiritual </v>

55
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.461
<v Speaker 1>guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of interesting because we </v>

56
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:23.461
<v Speaker 1>were talking about the porn side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of porn now that you don't</v>

59
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 2>really would necessarily want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with either really good at </v>

60
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.451
<v Speaker 2>his job researching you because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed like your long lost brother </v>

61
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 2>document because he was like pulling out</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentaries you didn't even know </v>

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like books that I didn't know about when</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

67
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.650
<v Speaker 2>He was</v>

68
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>real bright guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

69
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.520
<v Speaker 1>When we talked about me and Musashi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about different schools of </v>

70
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different books that he's read.</v>

71
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different.</v>

72
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different volcanoes.</v>

73
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:59.481
<v Speaker 1>He knew about some super volcanoes </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploding in the past that I didn't </v>

74
00:02:59.481 --> 00:02:59.481
<v Speaker 1>even.</v>

75
00:02:59.481 --> 00:02:59.481
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get them on the shelf.</v>

76
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

77
00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:01.190
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>

78
00:03:01.191 --> 00:03:03.650
<v Speaker 3>he lives in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the next time we're in Austin,</v>

79
00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:08.651
<v Speaker 3>what we'll do is we'll bring our </v>
<v Speaker 3>equipment and everything is set up in </v>

80
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Austin or we can move there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up.</v>

81
00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:13.400
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up moving to Colorado for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of reasons.</v>

82
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.190
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Mrs Rogan can't fucking drive in</v>

83
00:03:16.191 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 3>the snow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just a,</v>

84
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.480
<v Speaker 3>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you know Mrs Rogan,</v>

85
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 3>that's not something that I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be comfortable with her learning really </v>

86
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.630
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just that doesn't seem like a good move.</v>

87
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking moving where it's freezes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit gets dangerous and sliding the </v>

88
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 3>trees and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when the dog,</v>

89
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.390
<v Speaker 3>when the dog got eaten by the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 3>lion,</v>

90
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.860
<v Speaker 3>that killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

91
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.630
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Austin would have been great.</v>

92
00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 3>And if our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

93
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 3>the point is if Austin was great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would definitely hang around with </v>

94
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Chris Kelly,</v>

95
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.480
<v Speaker 2>but what's funny is he gave us a sample </v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can feel and touch it of the </v>

96
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 2>flashlight and the fleshlight uses </v>
<v Speaker 2>patent and rubber technology.</v>

97
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 2>They have a patent on this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

98
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a very specific type of insert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bushy squishy stuff has their own </v>

99
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 3>proprietary blends.</v>

100
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like you,</v>

101
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 2>you think in your head like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

102
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it feels like rubber and oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not gonna.</v>

103
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.060
<v Speaker 2>It's just gonna feel like really soft </v>
<v Speaker 2>rubber.</v>

104
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 2>This actually is kind of creepy to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

105
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Was He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave us a sample.</v>

106
00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:15.741
<v Speaker 2>What he did is he took a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>flashlights and he cut it in half just </v>

107
00:04:15.741 --> 00:04:18.531
<v Speaker 2>so we can feel the actual rubber part </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then at the end of our dentists and </v>

108
00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:19.320
<v Speaker 2>really feel like puts you though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt.</v>

109
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 2>It feels soft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

110
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 2>it feels really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels really.</v>

111
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Hasn't even moved up though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

112
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.090
<v Speaker 2>it's not even lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he gave us the samples too.</v>

113
00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a pushy that sick.</v>

114
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Well because it's usually in a can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's usually,</v>

115
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got some bonus</v>

116
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 3>behind you want like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

117
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.950
<v Speaker 3>but wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would that make it more clear?</v>

118
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

119
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Because you have like a wall right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually have a box of them.</v>

120
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

121
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:45.361
<v Speaker 2>he gave us these samples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a few of them and we left them on </v>

122
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:45.500
<v Speaker 2>the table and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to take that.</v>

123
00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

124
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just trash just so you can see </v>

125
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm going to take it.</v>

126
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 2>So I took the samples and I had it there</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a bag and the other day,</v>

127
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decided when no one was around that I </v>

128
00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 2>would try to fuck one of the samples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was only half of it.</v>

129
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 2>So have you used both of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One for the bottom and one for the top.</v>

130
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.080
<v Speaker 2>And so it's doing the left hand and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right hand left hand was the left </v>

131
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.080
<v Speaker 2>sample,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right with the right sample.</v>

132
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

133
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 2>fleshlight company you need something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

134
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Because I had like two different hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs going on.</v>

135
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 2>I had one with a different texture on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top.</v>

136
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.970
<v Speaker 2>One on yourself off with two hands like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're milking.</v>

137
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Milking a cow will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you work in the balls.</v>

138
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.120
<v Speaker 2>It's hung on the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put the balls in the bottom one.</v>

139
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 2>I wrapped it around the bottom one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of to your balls around the</v>

140
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:28.670
<v Speaker 2>bottom one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fucking smaller balls.</v>

141
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 2>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small,</v>

142
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 2>but I was doing both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to eat a lot of Nmr.</v>

143
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.010
<v Speaker 2>You remember the falls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She cried,</v>

144
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it felt really real.</v>

145
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I only had hot water and lube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

146
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:42.840
<v Speaker 2>for a loop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it felt really good,</v>

147
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.850
<v Speaker 2>like shampoo or something I'm good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's supposed to be a water </v>

148
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.121
<v Speaker 2>based oil and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they felt good for even just being </v>

149
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Speaker 2>samples outside of its cocoon and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

150
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:56.401
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even in the can or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't wait to fuck one of these </v>

151
00:05:56.401 --> 00:05:56.401
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this one of them right now?</v>

152
00:05:56.401 --> 00:05:57.110
<v Speaker 2>These are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the ones.</v>

153
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 4>This is not without some controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

154
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 4>This is actually going to be really </v>
<v Speaker 4>loud,</v>

155
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:07.631
<v Speaker 4>so to speak softly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to do it</v>

156
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.830
<v Speaker 1>so it's not annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a.</v>

157
00:06:10.831 --> 00:06:13.860
<v Speaker 1>apparently this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the fleshlight wow.</v>

158
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.090
<v Speaker 1>It comes in a nice packaging like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

159
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.820
<v Speaker 1>are you going to do an unboxing video </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us,</v>

160
00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

161
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.270
<v Speaker 1>We'll do the flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what we got here.</v>

162
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Now this is not without some controversy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where it gets strange.</v>

163
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my manager is very,</v>

164
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>very upset with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>And does not think that the fleshlight </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a good thing to have for a sponsor.</v>

166
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised with that because they </v>

167
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.290
<v Speaker 1>were like really adamant about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

168
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>you could be up for some sort of a show </v>
<v Speaker 1>cbs and they find out that you have the </v>

169
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.170
<v Speaker 1>flashlight on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your podcast.</v>

170
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're sponsored by a thing,</v>

171
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.730
<v Speaker 1>not just that you have an opinion about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing.</v>

172
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.060
<v Speaker 1>They were saying that the big deal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are sponsored by this thing and</v>

173
00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:03.060
<v Speaker 1>because you're sponsored by this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another that makes you like,</v>

174
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.970
<v Speaker 1>what does that make you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bad person?</v>

175
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't masturbate your hand.</v>

176
00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

177
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad person because you </v>

178
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>preferred to masturbate with the rubber </v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina.</v>

179
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like really</v>

180
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.740
<v Speaker 2>old school.</v>

181
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.080
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

182
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy the idea that you don't </v>

183
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>masturbate if you don't masturbate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with you?</v>

184
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great.</v>

185
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

186
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 1>First of all to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way of getting a release,</v>

187
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>like a sexual release.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not built up.</v>

188
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>It's on annoying you all day because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting laid.</v>

189
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of us aren't.</v>

190
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 1>If you're not getting laid and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerk off,</v>

191
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

192
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

193
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally fair.</v>

194
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.160
<v Speaker 1>So what is this some sort of a leftover </v>
<v Speaker 1>purity?</v>

195
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't show your ankles,</v>

196
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.030
<v Speaker 2>your ankles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technology.</v>

197
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.370
<v Speaker 2>Fucking</v>

198
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.720
<v Speaker 1>put dresses over the legs of chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen those,</v>

<v Speaker 1>way back in the Victorian era.</v>

204
00:07:58.981 --> 00:08:03.981
<v Speaker 1>I guess when they put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would literally put dresses around </v>

205
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:03.981
<v Speaker 1>the legs of chair,</v>

<v Speaker 1>from fucking dmt to the fact that I </v>

223
00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 1>think the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy and the same people are probably</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it's inappropriate or look,</v>

235
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:27.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm just curious about this certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

236
00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:32.921
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's on my message board or </v>

237
00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:32.921
<v Speaker 1>whether we're talking about on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

238
00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:36.760
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a podcast or whether we put it on </v>

239
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:36.760
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:36.760
<v Speaker 1>if I find something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting.</v>

241
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be honest about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why is that a fucking bad thing?</v>

242
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.910
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is the idea of me fucking this </v>

243
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.000
<v Speaker 1>rubber flashlight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that a bad thing?</v>

244
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't think people in Middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>America wants to think of you </v>

245
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.140
<v Speaker 2>masturbating and then if that gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown in their faces.</v>

246
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not supposed to hand in </v>

247
00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Speaker 2>their face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to have sex too.</v>

248
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's what it is when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't want people to see people</v>

249
00:10:02.291 --> 00:10:07.291
<v Speaker 1>having sex or talking about sex too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you endorse sex with yourself,</v>

250
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.460
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

251
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

252
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 2>to me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

253
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.430
<v Speaker 2>you can't marry that with the craziest.</v>

254
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.810
<v Speaker 1>The thing is they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manager said that,</v>

255
00:10:16.811 --> 00:10:21.811
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of the things that we're </v>

256
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:21.811
<v Speaker 1>talking about was the fact that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the pornography industry.</v>

257
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:26.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the pornography that it's </v>

258
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:26.450
<v Speaker 1>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

259
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:26.450
<v Speaker 1>how is it involved in pornography </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry?</v>

260
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.080
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's just a rubber vagina.</v>

261
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:29.710
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

262
00:10:29.711 --> 00:10:31.720
<v Speaker 1>when you use it you watch pornography.</v>

263
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.000
<v Speaker 2>So that was an actual argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

264
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.070
<v Speaker 2>so like how can we can't do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can either do it with your </v>

265
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.070
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to involve pornography.</v>

266
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>

267
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 2>how many documentaries have you done on </v>
<v Speaker 2>DMT and drugs?</v>

268
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.880
<v Speaker 2>So the drug industry's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the porn industry,</v>

269
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:47.610
<v Speaker 2>the Janet Jackson Nipple industry is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just out of control.</v>

270
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why.</v>

271
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might pay a little bit too much to </v>

272
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.310
<v Speaker 1>talk right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

273
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Many rambled with your women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries.</v>

274
00:10:56.441 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Have you done about drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done.</v>

275
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.880
<v Speaker 1>So the drug industry to your managers </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine with drug industry is not really an</v>

276
00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:02.660
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

277
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.380
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that a documentary is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different because it's just your opinion</v>

278
00:11:06.381 --> 00:11:09.050
<v Speaker 1>on a certain subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas this is an endorsement.</v>

279
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Endorsement endorsements were endorsed </v>

280
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.200
<v Speaker 1>by marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was marijuana is illegal.</v>

281
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.090
<v Speaker 1>You are endorsed by marijuana and </v>
<v Speaker 1>endorsement.</v>

282
00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana.</v>

283
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Actually none of the only sponsors this </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

284
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 1>It writes most of the material and </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes most of the things to happen.</v>

285
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:26.810
<v Speaker 1>And he's the producer with marijuana is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the senior producer.</v>

286
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Train wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Train wreck.</v>

287
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.640
<v Speaker 1>This week it was green crack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>

288
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Crack is executive producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secret executive producer of this show </v>

289
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.070
<v Speaker 1>this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

290
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:37.850
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

291
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:43.030
<v Speaker 1>so this is a real argument right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real argument is that if I endorse </v>

292
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.360
<v Speaker 1>this thing that somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a bad thing.</v>

293
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Packaging on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

294
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the butthole is have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's the vagina.</v>

295
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a super tight.</v>

296
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we just touch it and they put.</v>

297
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

298
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 2>give me one and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been wearing them.</v>

299
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a loop?</v>

300
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 2>A One?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a loop.</v>

301
00:11:57.881 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you guys know Lupus.</v>

302
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 2>She was on the Howard Stern show.</v>

303
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

304
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.870
<v Speaker 3>this ain't no motherfucking clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The table of all the junk.</v>

305
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 3>This is way less annoying than the way I</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to have.</v>

306
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some junk on the table.</v>

307
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.280
<v Speaker 3>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take this out.</v>

308
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.600
<v Speaker 3>Move this out of the way with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>helping.</v>

309
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.910
<v Speaker 3>It does look a little bit if I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

310
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:22.911
<v Speaker 3>I'm cleaning up for you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference between the </v>

311
00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:23.600
<v Speaker 3>ustream crowd and the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>IPAD,</v>

312
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.570
<v Speaker 3>ipod crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the flashlight fellow.</v>

313
00:12:27.571 --> 00:12:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

314
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I got the stamina training unit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to practice v longer in </v>

315
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.570
<v Speaker 2>bed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

316
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.630
<v Speaker 2>every man knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way to get better is to </v>

317
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.290
<v Speaker 2>practice view can last 10 minutes in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unit.</v>

318
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.540
<v Speaker 2>You can last 20 minutes in bed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

319
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bold.</v>

320
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.220
<v Speaker 3>That's strong words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things that this guy</v>

321
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:53.221
<v Speaker 3>was telling us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's one of the more fascinating </v>

322
00:12:53.221 --> 00:12:55.111
<v Speaker 3>things about this whole thing was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual therapeutic applications of the </v>

323
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:58.090
<v Speaker 3>flashlight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this sounds like nonsense.</v>

324
00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like someone's just justifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to fuck a rubber pussy,</v>

325
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.690
<v Speaker 3>but know what they use them for a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 3>of different therapeutic reasons.</v>

326
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:09.691
<v Speaker 3>And one of them is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in certain religions aren't </v>

327
00:13:09.691 --> 00:13:12.571
<v Speaker 3>allowed to touch their penis and because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not allowed to touch their </v>

328
00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:12.571
<v Speaker 3>penis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys,</v>

329
00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 3>he said that his city Jews in particular</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually have a hard time,</v>

330
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:20.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>orgasming when they have sex with women </v>

331
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.190
<v Speaker 3>because they're so used to like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>pillows because they do most of their </v>

332
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 3>masturbation like grabbing a sheet or </v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbing a pillow.</v>

333
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:25.870
<v Speaker 3>This is his words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not mine.</v>

334
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:28.150
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this could be totally nonsense.</v>

335
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:28.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

336
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.210
<v Speaker 3>I have not researched this at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my caveat.</v>

337
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 3>But he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

338
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.340
<v Speaker 3>the flashlight is actually covered by </v>
<v Speaker 3>some insurance policies as therapy,</v>

339
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.130
<v Speaker 3>as sexual therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get them to learn how to orgasm with </v>

340
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.180
<v Speaker 3>a vagina instead of fucking like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>rough pillow.</v>

341
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.500
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not validated this.</v>

342
00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

343
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.630
<v Speaker 3>it totally makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other reason for the fresh </v>

344
00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.650
<v Speaker 3>flashlight is it trains guys not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prematurely ejaculate.</v>

345
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 3>And guys who have problems with </v>
<v Speaker 3>premature ejaculation,</v>

346
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.660
<v Speaker 3>they can practice in the flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea.</v>

347
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to take this to.</v>

348
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>

349
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:07.700
<v Speaker 2>doesn't feel good.</v>

350
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Metal plastic card asked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

351

352
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking panic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

353
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:18.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think there's any.</v>

354
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously we all masturbate.</v>

355
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.680
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's silly at this point in this stage </v>

356
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:25.680
<v Speaker 3>of life to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to deny that it,</v>

357
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:25.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

358
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.740
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dumb.</v>

359
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.430
<v Speaker 3>So if we all masturbate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

360
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

361
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with this?</v>

362
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
<v Speaker 2>You know what's crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do things like smoke cigarettes are </v>

363
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 2>used to smoke cigarettes in the car and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a of of my hand.</v>

364
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I think therapeutically I can put this </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my car instead of smoking cigarettes.</v>

365
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Just finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel so good.</v>

366
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't touch my butt.</v>

367
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's something to do with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

368
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

369
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:53.470
<v Speaker 2>like that feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That feels like I'm playing with like </v>

370
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.020
<v Speaker 2>one of those stress balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it actually feels like I'm 10 </v>

<v Speaker 2>we already recovered that.</v>

379
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.240

<v Speaker 2>and religions that don't masturbate.</v>

420
00:16:52.981 --> 00:16:57.981

<v Speaker 1>with a product that makes masturbation </v>

421
00:16:57.981 --> 00:16:57.981
<v Speaker 1>easier or better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>makes sense.</v>

435
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 2>Instead of using your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did you use something that feels </v>

00:18:36.051 --> 00:18:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do a fear factor again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

468
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so tempting not to for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

469
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.730
<v Speaker 1>but I got to do something more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

470
00:18:43.731 --> 00:18:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I got to do shit that I like doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have so much more fun.</v>

471
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like getting in bed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a flashlight.</v>

472
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:54.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like protects me from doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything stupid that I know I'll do for </v>

473
00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:54.490
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

474
00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:59.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just so easy when something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear factor comes along and they're </v>

475
00:18:59.080 --> 00:18:59.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

476
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.171
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give you all this money </v>
<v Speaker 1>every week and only have to do is just </v>

477
00:19:02.171 --> 00:19:04.100
<v Speaker 1>show up and watch people do stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

478
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.930
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy to get that money.</v>

479
00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.870
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have got a pass on it.</v>

480
00:19:08.871 --> 00:19:11.540
<v Speaker 1>You really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if it was good that I did it,</v>

481
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.840
<v Speaker 1>but at a certain point in time you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pass on doing those things because if</v>

482
00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:16.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to be better.</v>

483
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.940
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

484
00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:21.390
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about old TV while you </v>
<v Speaker 5>while you're doing new TV.</v>

485
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

486
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.120
<v Speaker 1>This is way easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This look,</v>

487
00:19:25.121 --> 00:19:27.940
<v Speaker 1>we could have never had a fucking show </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this that reaches as many people as</v>

488
00:19:27.941 --> 00:19:29.530
<v Speaker 1>this thing does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Including the,</v>

489
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.240
<v Speaker 1>the podcast on itunes and this thing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>ustream and there's,</v>

491
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:40.270
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking way we could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever gotten someone to agree to let us </v>

492
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.100
<v Speaker 1>practice a TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we're gonna do.</v>

493
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.940
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna start off just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with boxes of shit behind me,</v>

494
00:19:45.941 --> 00:19:50.941
<v Speaker 1>piled up on the desk and that eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to move on to like try to </v>

495
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:52.480
<v Speaker 1>have like a real show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a desk and real microphones and the</v>

496
00:19:52.481 --> 00:19:55.340
<v Speaker 1>sound is much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to like a top end MP,</v>

497
00:19:55.341 --> 00:19:58.240
<v Speaker 1>three recorder and then the next thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>we got ustream producer.</v>

498
00:19:58.241 --> 00:20:03.241
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have high def cameras in </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and eventually we're going to </v>

499
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:05.731
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to do it all through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tri caster so that we can have a </v>

500
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:05.770
<v Speaker 1>background and we'll put a green screen </v>
<v Speaker 1>up behind us.</v>

501
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.890
<v Speaker 1>We never thought that this was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

502
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.640
<v Speaker 1>This is just a goof and and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not that.</v>

503
00:20:11.641 --> 00:20:13.720
<v Speaker 1>This is any big deal like this could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happened,</v>

504
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's this easy and this fun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would enjoy this much.</v>

505
00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 1>You could never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have never done this on </v>

506
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would've never let me,</v>

507
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.680
<v Speaker 1>and if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would never let me just do it the </v>

508
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:25.680
<v Speaker 1>way we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wing it and talk about whatever.</v>

509
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.150
<v Speaker 1>For the first fucking 10 weeks we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even have plan what we're going to talk </v>

510
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.000
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would just get in there,</v>

511
00:20:31.001 --> 00:20:33.280
<v Speaker 1>turn it on and just talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

512
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 1>So I completely lost what the fuck I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

513
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I completely lost what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My.</v>

514
00:20:38.711 --> 00:20:43.711
<v Speaker 1>I know what my point is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is that this is new TV and </v>

515
00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:46.780
<v Speaker 1>you're right and it protects me really </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I do something like the flashlight or</v>

516
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:52.140
<v Speaker 1>any of the ridiculous should I do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>protects me from doing any dumb fear </v>

517
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 1>factor type shit in the future.</v>

518
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:57.320
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny because there is a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct line on the old TV where the new </v>

519
00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.611
<v Speaker 2>tvs mixing with the old TV right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching family guy and the </v>

520
00:21:01.611 --> 00:21:05.901
<v Speaker 2>episode involved at dog licking out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby's asshole,</v>

521
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 2>but it was on the last episode had that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

522
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:15.170
<v Speaker 2>were Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dog ate out steelies asshole and </v>

523
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:15.270
<v Speaker 2>cleaned shit office as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's that?</v>

524
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.160
<v Speaker 2>And we're talking about masturbating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a problem with masturbating.</v>

525
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

526
00:21:22.411 --> 00:21:23.570
<v Speaker 2>I have to see that episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

527
00:21:23.571 --> 00:21:26.940
<v Speaker 2>It's the best episode download last </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode of family guy.</v>

528
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.910
<v Speaker 2>They're trapped in a bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bank vault or something like that,</v>

529
00:21:29.911 --> 00:21:34.911
<v Speaker 2>and it is so fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shit that they get away with </v>

530
00:21:34.911 --> 00:21:37.530
<v Speaker 2>unregular primetime television and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about fucking at rubber.</v>

531
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

532
00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.990
<v Speaker 1>as successful as they are or successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>south park is,</v>

533
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:49.140
<v Speaker 1>you basically can do whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want because people want to be on </v>

534
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.140
<v Speaker 1>your show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.820
<v Speaker 1>advertisers rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

536
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.390
<v Speaker 1>They want to advertise on your show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your show is gigantic.</v>

537
00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:57.391
<v Speaker 1>South Park has just got such all loyal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Legion of followers at this point in </v>

538
00:21:57.391 --> 00:22:01.411
<v Speaker 1>time until the Mohammed thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've pretty much got away with doing </v>

539
00:22:01.411 --> 00:22:01.630
<v Speaker 1>like almost anything they wanted for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

540
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.680
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy about the Mohammed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean because in New York City they just </v>

541
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.831
<v Speaker 2>captured that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bomber and there's a connection </v>

542
00:22:09.831 --> 00:22:13.160
<v Speaker 2>that people are starting to make between</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Republican senator or something like </v>

543
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.160
<v Speaker 2>that said that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

544
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.880
<v Speaker 2>I think there might be a connection </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the two,</v>

545
00:22:14.881 --> 00:22:16.530
<v Speaker 2>but they haven't proved anything yet.</v>

546
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

547
00:22:17.521 --> 00:22:22.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing to speculate </v>

548
00:22:22.521 --> 00:22:24.260
<v Speaker 1>automatically that be a connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know who the fuck knows yoder </v>

549
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:24.260
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

550
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.010
<v Speaker 1>what if listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

551
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:31.040
<v Speaker 1>people are that dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people that really do believe </v>

552
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.250
<v Speaker 1>that you're not supposed to make fun of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them at all and if you do,</v>

553
00:22:32.251 --> 00:22:34.860
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to die like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the.</v>

554
00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst example of human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

555
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.860
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I've always talked </v>

556
00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.291
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about it as a joke in my </v>

557
00:22:45.291 --> 00:22:45.291
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really is kind of true.</v>

558
00:22:45.291 --> 00:22:48.090
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why the there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so arcane in their ways.</v>

559
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:53.150
<v Speaker 1>We don't try and adjust the sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why there are so </v>

560
00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.350
<v Speaker 1>arcane in their ways is that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>where culture like began.</v>

561
00:22:55.530 --> 00:23:00.530
<v Speaker 1>The oldest known civilization that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know of is Sumir and that's where Iraq </v>

562
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:00.530
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

563
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:05.450
<v Speaker 1>So basically like the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>still in that area or like the townies </v>

564
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.450
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

565
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:10.251
<v Speaker 1>they're really stuck on some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>multifamily hundred year old trip and us</v>

566
00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:13.110
<v Speaker 1>being in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not that America is better than</v>

567
00:23:13.111 --> 00:23:18.111
<v Speaker 1>other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the one advantage that America has </v>

568
00:23:18.111 --> 00:23:20.910
<v Speaker 1>as it were the most recent country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're all from somewhere that sucked.</v>

569
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Every one of us here is we came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that sucked or answer says </v>

570
00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:31.011
<v Speaker 1>came from somewhere that suck and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>congregate it to this one place to get </v>

571
00:23:31.011 --> 00:23:34.491
<v Speaker 1>the most fresh idea supposedly to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most progressive because they're at the </v>

572
00:23:34.491 --> 00:23:37.680
<v Speaker 1>furthest ahead of the curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people in like the Middle East,</v>

573
00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:41.070
<v Speaker 1>that's the furthest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the beginning point of the curve.</v>

574
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Like do they really are the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>townies of the world and that's why the </v>

575
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.231
<v Speaker 1>problem with this fucking cartoon thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that these motherfuckers really do </v>

576
00:23:50.231 --> 00:23:53.450
<v Speaker 1>believe that there's some magical </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker that you're not supposed to</v>

577
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 1>draw.</v>

578
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

579
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:59.950
<v Speaker 1>it's bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that is the enemy of </v>

580
00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This ancient ideology,</v>

581
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:06.551
<v Speaker 1>this multipurpose fucking ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that somehow or another several </v>

582
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:09.500
<v Speaker 1>thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had it wired.</v>

583
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.680
<v Speaker 1>They hadn't figured out back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they didn't know Jack Shit </v>

584
00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.400
<v Speaker 1>about medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the constellations.</v>

585
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:18.650
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had it wired.</v>

586
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.460
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew.</v>

587
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.790
<v Speaker 1>They knew what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>

588
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:28.150
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that there's people willing to </v>

589
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.091
<v Speaker 1>die for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in 2010 that is still rocking.</v>

590
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

591
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise was the same way to do.</v>

592
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the scariest thing is not </v>

593
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.140
<v Speaker 1>even the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the scariest thing in this</v>

594
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 1>world is that ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very scary,</v>

595
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:53.350
<v Speaker 1>but to me what's scarier is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in Mexico and the fact that </v>

596
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Mexico is connected to us and Mexico is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of gigantic gang wars between</v>

597
00:24:57.531 --> 00:25:02.531
<v Speaker 1>the police and these gang cartels that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fucking billions of dollars.</v>

598
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:07.400
<v Speaker 1>These guys have insane amounts of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the only way you can make</v>

599
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:08.740
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically like.</v>

600
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the only way you can make </v>

601
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:14.220
<v Speaker 1>money in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I what I'm saying,</v>

602
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

603
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.920
<v Speaker 1>they're totally illegal to sell cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be sold illegal.</v>

604
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:18.800
<v Speaker 1>You can't sell it legally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't regulate it and tax it.</v>

605
00:25:18.801 --> 00:25:21.230
<v Speaker 1>You can't do anything with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to sell it illegally.</v>

606
00:25:21.231 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 1>So people are going to buy cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to buy cocaine from Mexico</v>

607
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:25.400
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to get that money.</v>

608
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck's going to get that money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will these drug lords have all that </v>

609
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.150
<v Speaker 1>money and now they're more powerful than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police and they've got US troops are</v>

610
00:25:32.151 --> 00:25:33.890
<v Speaker 1>going in there now and fucking helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

611
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bananas down there,</v>

612
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's fucking ward in the streets with</v>

613
00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 1>tanks with bananas and people are still </v>
<v Speaker 1>going there for vacations.</v>

614
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:46.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like the last spring break that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>still one of the hotspots for people to </v>

615
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 1>go for spring break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they were Muslims,</v>

616
00:25:48.201 --> 00:25:49.520
<v Speaker 1>we'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

617
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.120
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they're Christians and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then on into blown themselves up for,</v>

618
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Jesus,</v>

619
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.860
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

620
00:25:54.861 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 1>they're into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean what's going on is it's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and a lot of influence and a lot </v>

622
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.281
<v Speaker 1>of people that get illegal money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dominating the actual political </v>

623
00:26:06.281 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 1>system over there and as many as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to raid,</v>

624
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:13.090
<v Speaker 1>there's so many more of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a fucking hard fight because </v>

625
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:13.670
<v Speaker 1>they let them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig in and get infested.</v>

626
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.910
<v Speaker 1>There's so many fucking gigantic cartels</v>
<v Speaker 1>with just tons and tons of money and </v>

627
00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:20.810
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so frightening.</v>

628
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.060
<v Speaker 1>But if they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were the enemy,</v>

629
00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 1>if that was Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if like,</v>

630
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.420
<v Speaker 1>if like Pakistan was right next door to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us and this shit was going down,</v>

631
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:30.470
<v Speaker 1>it would be even scarier.</v>

632
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:35.830
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really would because for some reason </v>

633
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.990
<v Speaker 1>the Mexicans aren't blaming the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

634
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:41.410
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Mexican people are pretty </v>

635
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 1>proud people and now they're not blaming</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of family here and that's fine.</v>

636
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.630
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to fuck with half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their families.</v>

637
00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.380
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really clear what happened.</v>

638
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.910
<v Speaker 1>They want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico wanted to make drugs illegal,</v>

639
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:56.060
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to decriminalize it and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>them legal and make it so that people </v>

640
00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.830
<v Speaker 1>can sell them and tax and mental and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States said no fucking way,</v>

641
00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:04.090
<v Speaker 1>like no way and if you don't have laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know you were involved in a </v>

642
00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:09.021
<v Speaker 1>business like selling drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have criminals because </v>

643
00:27:09.021 --> 00:27:12.171
<v Speaker 1>even when you have laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have things like pharmaceutical </v>

644
00:27:12.171 --> 00:27:15.171
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pharmaceutical companies are basically </v>

645
00:27:15.171 --> 00:27:17.361
<v Speaker 1>legal drug dealers and they're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that kills motherfuckers every day.</v>

646
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:21.900
<v Speaker 1>There's always people dropping off from </v>
<v Speaker 1>vicodin and percocet.</v>

647
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I got my nose fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got my deviated septum operated </v>

648
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.520
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good doctor gave me to a value.</v>

649
00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

650
00:27:29.121 --> 00:27:32.820
<v Speaker 1>a vicodin and percocet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave me a prescription for both and I</v>

651
00:27:32.821 --> 00:27:33.810
<v Speaker 1>looked at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

652
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:38.811
<v Speaker 1>this stuff is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how bad is this going to fucking </v>

653
00:27:38.811 --> 00:27:41.751
<v Speaker 1>hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to hurt way more than it </v>

654
00:27:41.751 --> 00:27:43.311
<v Speaker 1>hurts right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd rather just deal with it being </v>

655
00:27:43.311 --> 00:27:45.981
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then get hooked on some crazy fucking </v>

656
00:27:45.981 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical pills that like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>addict.</v>

657
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:48.750
<v Speaker 1>You like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 30 percent of the time.</v>

658
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.840
<v Speaker 1>How many people get addicted to Vicodin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did they think of those things out </v>

659
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.570
<v Speaker 1>like candy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

660
00:27:54.571 --> 00:27:57.540
<v Speaker 1>right after I decided not to accept the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription.</v>

661
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.720
<v Speaker 1>A study came out showing that the FDA </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and Drug Administration so was </v>

662
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.130
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to recommend like cutting </v>

663
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.660
<v Speaker 1>way back on prescriptions and they like </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend that doctors did not prescribe</v>

664
00:28:09.661 --> 00:28:14.661
<v Speaker 1>them because of liver damage and because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of addiction I have probably for half </v>

665
00:28:14.661 --> 00:28:16.590
<v Speaker 1>full bottles of magnum laying around </v>
<v Speaker 1>just from going to the dentist.</v>

666
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.850
<v Speaker 1>They talked to you sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they talk to you that vitamin </v>

667
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.850
<v Speaker 1>bottles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only when I sleep,</v>

668
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:25.320
<v Speaker 1>like in the middle of the night I wake </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and you're combing my hair and go,</v>

669
00:28:25.321 --> 00:28:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really stressed right now.</v>

670
00:28:26.691 --> 00:28:28.630
<v Speaker 1>You feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually I hate Mike.</v>

671
00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Shoe me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

672
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I hate fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate feeling.</v>

673
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I just feel gross when I do like it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only done vicodin once.</v>

674
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.990
<v Speaker 1>When I had my first knee operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had three knee operations,</v>

675
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:43.230
<v Speaker 1>two acl reconstructions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one meniscus surgery,</v>

676
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time I had the acl done it was</v>

677
00:28:47.101 --> 00:28:50.160
<v Speaker 1>pretty painful because they did what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called a Patella tendon graft,</v>

678
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:54.960
<v Speaker 1>a scar that goes from here to here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they do is they take a chunk of</v>

679
00:28:54.961 --> 00:28:59.961
<v Speaker 1>bone out of your knee and a chunk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bone out of your Shin and they cut this </v>

680
00:28:59.961 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 1>big tendon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the,</v>

681
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:05.150
<v Speaker 1>they cut a slice of it off with the bone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they open you up like a fish </v>

682
00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.810
<v Speaker 1>and they drill it in place.</v>

683
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:11.550
<v Speaker 1>So they take this tendon and they make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it smaller to make you a fake tendon for</v>

684
00:29:11.551 --> 00:29:16.551
<v Speaker 1>the acl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's apparently it was supposedly </v>

685
00:29:16.551 --> 00:29:16.551
<v Speaker 1>like physically stronger than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original acl.</v>

686
00:29:16.551 --> 00:29:21.130
<v Speaker 1>But the point is you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got holes in your bones and screws </v>

687
00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.410
<v Speaker 1>and your bones and it hurts like a bitch</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get up,</v>

688
00:29:22.411 --> 00:29:24.450
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're sitting down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get up.</v>

689
00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:29.451
<v Speaker 1>It's way more pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the other one done with a </v>

690
00:29:29.451 --> 00:29:29.451
<v Speaker 1>cadaver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got a dead dudes.</v>

691
00:29:29.451 --> 00:29:33.501
<v Speaker 1>Shit in this knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the one with the acl where they do </v>

692
00:29:33.501 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 1>the surgery with the ticket off the bone</v>
<v Speaker 1>is way,</v>

693
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:36.330
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more painful.</v>

694
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:41.510
<v Speaker 1>You get up from the couch and be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching TV and it was just like hot </v>

695
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.050
<v Speaker 1>lava,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hot lead.</v>

696
00:29:42.051 --> 00:29:47.051
<v Speaker 1>Just going right into my bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so fucking painful and I took a </v>

697
00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:52.141
<v Speaker 1>vicodin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the only time I ever took one </v>

698
00:29:52.141 --> 00:29:52.141
<v Speaker 1>and I felt so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

699
00:29:52.141 --> 00:29:56.130
<v Speaker 1>just so drugged and my jaw was slack and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching TV and I thought to </v>

700
00:29:56.171 --> 00:29:58.060
<v Speaker 1>myself while it was under it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

701
00:29:58.061 --> 00:30:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I will never take this dumb shit again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stuff's terrible.</v>

702
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

703
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.030
<v Speaker 2>so we'd have some people are the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>

704
00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.300
<v Speaker 2>They'll give you 20 bucks for awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

705
00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.060
<v Speaker 1>W w what basically we're trying to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>is there's no fucking difference between</v>

706
00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:16.270
<v Speaker 1>vicodins inheritance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heroin and Oxycontin and heroin are </v>

707
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 1>really the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking difference between </v>

708
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies and drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealers.</v>

709
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.700
<v Speaker 1>The only difference is that drug dealers</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to.</v>

710
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.670
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to work within the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pharmaceutical companies,</v>

711
00:30:25.671 --> 00:30:27.950
<v Speaker 1>they have to bribe politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to.</v>

712
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.040
<v Speaker 1>They have to wax doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what to do with doctors.</v>

713
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.250
<v Speaker 1>They take everybody out to dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mrs Rogan is,</v>

714
00:30:34.251 --> 00:30:37.520
<v Speaker 1>her mom is a nurse and I'm the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a.</v>

715
00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.200
<v Speaker 1>She works with these pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

716
00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:44.380
<v Speaker 1>these nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't make much money and they </v>

717
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.541
<v Speaker 1>don't get to go out to fancy dinners </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the pharmaceutical companies come </v>

718
00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:46.541
<v Speaker 1>along and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

719
00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:50.321
<v Speaker 1>Viagara is going to take us out on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice dinner and they all get to go to a </v>

720
00:30:50.321 --> 00:30:53.291
<v Speaker 1>nice restaurant and have a nice meal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all on these pharmaceutical </v>

721
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:53.291
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pay for the drinks,</v>

722
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:58.181
<v Speaker 1>they pay for everything and so these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are more likely to talk nice </v>

723
00:30:58.181 --> 00:30:59.480
<v Speaker 1>about their pharmaceuticals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they prescribe them more.</v>

724
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.560
<v Speaker 2>You know what's fucked up about that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about that also when I go </v>

725
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.140
<v Speaker 2>to the doc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other is that the doctor review.</v>

726
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 2>It was a poor example because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good one.</v>

727
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the doctor's the other day for</v>

728
00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:12.580
<v Speaker 2>acid reflux because sometimes after eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>like too much caffeine,</v>

729
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:17.610
<v Speaker 2>onions or a drink too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of have feel like an acid coming </v>

730
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:21.331
<v Speaker 2>up from my throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes my throat feel tight and all </v>

731
00:31:21.331 --> 00:31:21.331
<v Speaker 2>this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this for a long time.</v>

732
00:31:21.331 --> 00:31:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I've had it for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so finally went to the doctor,</v>

733
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.480
<v Speaker 2>the ODA digestive doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I told him everything I had and then</v>

734
00:31:25.481 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

735
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 2>let me give you some samples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave me a garbage bag,</v>

736
00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:31.810
<v Speaker 2>almost full of the sample was called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue pill.com.</v>

737
00:31:31.811 --> 00:31:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but was the blue pill.com</v>

738
00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:34.700
<v Speaker 2>or something that.</v>

739
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

740
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:41.641
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if this is even the best thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be taking right now or if this </v>

741
00:31:41.641 --> 00:31:46.411
<v Speaker 2>guy just got paid to get me a bottle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he gave me like 20 bottles of </v>

742
00:31:46.411 --> 00:31:49.010
<v Speaker 2>samples and coupons and books and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

743
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.770
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take it and I'm like,</v>

744
00:31:50.771 --> 00:31:52.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that kind of is better,</v>

745
00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:55.810
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if I'm just tricking </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself or if I have to go back there,</v>

746
00:31:55.811 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 2>make a second appointment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

747
00:31:57.191 --> 00:31:57.910
<v Speaker 2>just to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

748
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.830
<v Speaker 2>whatever you gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bullshit.</v>

749
00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.620
<v Speaker 1>We know for sure the doctors are </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by pharmaceutical.</v>

750
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give them money,</v>

751
00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.820
<v Speaker 1>they get money for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were getting,</v>

752
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's still true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still legal in or if there's </v>

753
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.490
<v Speaker 1>different states have different laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it all works,</v>

754
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.640
<v Speaker 1>but from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors have been busted where they're </v>

755
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.330
<v Speaker 1>getting a percentage of the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sales that they have.</v>

756
00:32:20.331 --> 00:32:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Like say if they sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

757
00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:26.290
<v Speaker 1>x amount of volumes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a kickback from the </v>

758
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:27.330
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should absolutely be illegal.</v>

759
00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's</v>

760
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.400
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what an analyst that's </v>

761
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.491
<v Speaker 2>hopefully technology helps that done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they tried to prescribe </v>

762
00:32:34.491 --> 00:32:35.280
<v Speaker 2>something like a million topics come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from text to your phone and you go,</v>

763
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.110
<v Speaker 2>actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to take this one.</v>

764
00:32:37.111 --> 00:32:39.060
<v Speaker 2>This one's better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like yeah,</v>

765
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.210
<v Speaker 2>an iphone apps.</v>

766
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.220
<v Speaker 1>It tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your doctors trying to get you to turn </v>

767
00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:45.220
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you turned it on and when the doctor not</v>

768
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.270
<v Speaker 1>trying to shit on doctors anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's.</v>

769
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:52.330
<v Speaker 1>The whole system is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're a doctor and you're </v>

770
00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.211
<v Speaker 1>struggling to get along and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay an insane amount of malpractice </v>

771
00:32:55.211 --> 00:32:58.631
<v Speaker 1>insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malpractice insurance for doctors has </v>

772
00:32:58.631 --> 00:33:01.141
<v Speaker 1>goddamn brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have all these assholes </v>

773
00:33:01.141 --> 00:33:01.141
<v Speaker 1>that want to sue you for fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

774
00:33:01.141 --> 00:33:03.020
<v Speaker 1>for no reason for shit getting wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

775
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Getting an affection for things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally unavoidable.</v>

776
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.970
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying the doctors perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

777
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their medical bills or fucking or </v>

778
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.550
<v Speaker 1>medical school bills are gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking huge.</v>

779
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.760
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical company comes along and </v>

780
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:18.760
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

781
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:18.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

782
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 1>you're still helping all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still doing great thing.</v>

783
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 1>We just would love it if you would tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

784
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take Vioxx if you have arthritis.</v>

785
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 1>So these doctors say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

786
00:33:27.201 --> 00:33:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I could do that and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

787
00:33:28.261 --> 00:33:31.310
<v Speaker 1>we'll be in on a deal with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can buy it,</v>

788
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:36.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll give you a share in the company </v>

789
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.650
<v Speaker 1>will give you a certain percentage for </v>
<v Speaker 1>every Vioxx bottle you sell.</v>

790
00:33:36.651 --> 00:33:41.651
<v Speaker 1>We'll give you x percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they don't think they're doing </v>

791
00:33:41.651 --> 00:33:44.351
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vioxx is something that was created to </v>

792
00:33:44.351 --> 00:33:44.351
<v Speaker 1>help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This person has a pain,</v>

793
00:33:44.351 --> 00:33:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll give them this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll help their pain and I'll profit in</v>

794
00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.050
<v Speaker 1>it and they don't even think it's a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

795
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're prescribing it way more than </v>

796
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:55.841
<v Speaker 1>they did before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like nutty pills or you talk </v>

797
00:33:55.841 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 1>to like there's been many studies done </v>
<v Speaker 1>on people who take on to have a presence</v>

798
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:57.530
<v Speaker 1>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

799
00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.980
<v Speaker 1>people have gone to a psychiatrist just </v>
<v Speaker 1>for experimentation purposes just to </v>

800
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.400
<v Speaker 1>write stories on it and just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

801
00:34:04.401 --> 00:34:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just having trouble sleeping.</v>

802
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I feel shitty all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do here.</v>

803
00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Take this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

804
00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:12.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like that simple of Zoloft and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll feel better,</v>

805
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just dishing it out.</v>

806
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Try this for a little bit and tell us </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you feel like,</v>

807
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking with human neurochemistry </v>

808
00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:22.700
<v Speaker 1>and we're allowing these heartless </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies to do it.</v>

809
00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

810
00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:29.410
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be more oversight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a lot of money in </v>

811
00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 1>involved in pharmaceuticals and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a lot of pharmaceuticals </v>

812
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 1>that do a lot of good for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

813
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Not saying there's anything bad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

814
00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:38.350
<v Speaker 1>but there's got to be way more oversight</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have so much shit out there</v>

815
00:34:38.811 --> 00:34:43.760
<v Speaker 1>that you can get addicted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much that will fuck your life</v>

816
00:34:43.761 --> 00:34:48.761
<v Speaker 1>up and it's readily available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxycontin's fucking percosets.</v>

817
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Volume's vicodins.</v>

818
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those fucking things will crush you and </v>

819
00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.270
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys are doing something that's </v>

820
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.510
<v Speaker 1>way more acceptable than some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

821
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Pot or coke or Fox or rubber or vagina </v>
<v Speaker 1>or vagina looked at as heroes,</v>

822
00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:16.121
<v Speaker 1>doctors and staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet if you talk about this book,</v>

823
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.720
<v Speaker 1>doctors are heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

824
00:35:17.721 --> 00:35:20.390
<v Speaker 1>the doctors at a fixed me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in forever in their debt.</v>

825
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.390
<v Speaker 1>The guy who fixed my nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys who fixed my knees,</v>

826
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for them,</v>

827
00:35:24.701 --> 00:35:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I knows what suck and I wouldn't be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to walk that good.</v>

828
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:28.790
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctors are fucking awesome.</v>

829
00:35:28.791 --> 00:35:33.791
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying we live in this </v>

830
00:35:33.791 --> 00:35:36.641
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous state of a poc resy because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain drugs that we make </v>

831
00:35:36.641 --> 00:35:39.000
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You aren't supposed to have them.</v>

832
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you can get them </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribed if you need them or they can,</v>

833
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:43.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monitor,</v>

834
00:35:43.471 --> 00:35:45.120
<v Speaker 1>you know you're not allowed to.</v>

835
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Big Daddy who knows more than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells you that if you're with this drug,</v>

836
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.500
<v Speaker 1>this drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to lock you in a cage like </v>

837
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:54.500
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

838
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.641
<v Speaker 1>Is that set up so that the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>really appreciate and recognize the </v>

839
00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:03.801
<v Speaker 1>merits and the psychedelic drugs rise up</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they realize they have to </v>

840
00:36:03.801 --> 00:36:05.640
<v Speaker 1>literally overthrow the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture,</v>

841
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:07.830
<v Speaker 1>the way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to not overthrow rather,</v>

842
00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:12.831
<v Speaker 1>but overturn the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the culture accepts drugs </v>

843
00:36:12.831 --> 00:36:14.230
<v Speaker 1>because that's the only thing that seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sense.</v>

844
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.280
<v Speaker 1>All the beneficial ones are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't ever hear about someone </v>

845
00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:19.700
<v Speaker 1>talking to you about they did value them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they.</v>

846
00:36:19.701 --> 00:36:23.220
<v Speaker 1>They just really had this life changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and learn to love everyone.</v>

847
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that fucking on valium.</v>

848
00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I felt connected to the universe and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that I'm just a part of a never</v>

849
00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:32.280
<v Speaker 1>ending process in my biology is trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hold onto everything and that's where</v>

850
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:33.330
<v Speaker 1>the insecurity comes from.</v>

851
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.410
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

852
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.600
<v Speaker 1>you don't get that from fucking value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

853
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.950
<v Speaker 1>You get that from mushrooms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms grow outside and if they catch</v>

854
00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put you in a cage.</v>

855
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:48.050
<v Speaker 1>If they come by your fucking house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have mushrooms growing on your car </v>

856
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.120
<v Speaker 1>under your tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your backyard,</v>

857
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.240
<v Speaker 1>they are legally allowed to lock you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a box.</v>

858
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:56.510
<v Speaker 1>They can take you and arrest you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking bananas.</v>

859
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Bananas and that are enforcing our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous thinking on the Mexican </v>

860
00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:05.670
<v Speaker 1>people is why those drug cartels got </v>
<v Speaker 1>into power.</v>

861
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that a conspiracy theory perhaps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a little bit of Tinfoil hat </v>

862
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.150
<v Speaker 1>perhaps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

863
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.610
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

864
00:37:11.611 --> 00:37:13.640
<v Speaker 1>some of that tin foil hat shit is on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money and I,</v>

865
00:37:13.641 --> 00:37:18.641
<v Speaker 1>I think it is with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're live right next to a country </v>

866
00:37:18.641 --> 00:37:22.400
<v Speaker 1>that's involved in a way more deadly war</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the one going on in Afghanistan or </v>

867
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:22.400
<v Speaker 1>going on in Iraq.</v>

868
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Both of them combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't even touch the body counts that </v>

869
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.460
<v Speaker 1>are happening in Mexico right next door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're killing motherfuckers.</v>

870
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:31.230
<v Speaker 1>They're going crazy over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

871
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.250
<v Speaker 1>and you can get there by walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

872
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all invested in Afghanistan and </v>

873
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.430
<v Speaker 1>securing Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

874
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:44.010
<v Speaker 1>we live right next to a fucking third </v>
<v Speaker 1>world country.</v>

875
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:49.011
<v Speaker 1>We are connected to them with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>invisible line and they're involved in </v>

876
00:37:49.011 --> 00:37:53.121
<v Speaker 1>the bloodiest pharmaceutical war that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been fought in the history of this </v>

877
00:37:53.121 --> 00:37:54.870
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the illegal pharmaceutical war.</v>

878
00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:00.050
<v Speaker 1>They're finding it with God damn tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting a pharmaceutical war </v>

879
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.210
<v Speaker 1>with tanks and that's what the war is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst.</v>

880
00:38:02.211 --> 00:38:07.211
<v Speaker 1>Who gets to sell your shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to be people that have no </v>

881
00:38:07.211 --> 00:38:10.941
<v Speaker 1>law whatsoever or is it going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have laws and if you say </v>

882
00:38:10.941 --> 00:38:12.690
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be people that have laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the other stuff,</v>

883
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:17.691
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to allow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then someone's gonna sell that </v>

884
00:38:17.691 --> 00:38:17.691
<v Speaker 1>other stuff cause he's a goddamn demand </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

885
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.050
<v Speaker 2>It sits dangerous everywhere that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about this?</v>

<v Speaker 2>A woman walks into target at West </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood.</v>

<v Speaker 2>target will not carry the rubber pussy.</v>

896
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:57.090

<v Speaker 1>When they took her out,</v>

904
00:39:17.091 --> 00:39:19.490
<v Speaker 1>they should have just shoved that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking knife right into our heart.</v>

905
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:21.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the middle of a battle,</v>

906
00:39:21.621 --> 00:39:24.170

<v Speaker 1>assailant.</v>

907
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.720

<v Speaker 1>right in neck.</v>

908
00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm bipolar.</v>

910
00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.670
<v Speaker 2>There's no witness protection program.</v>

911

<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

912
00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.140
<v Speaker 1>At that point we have to know when to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill people.</v>

913
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:41.170
<v Speaker 1>We really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't bring that person back and </v>

914
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.021
<v Speaker 1>reintroduce them to society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This life is short and you have fucked </v>

916
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:49.490
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just got to start from scratch and it</v>

917
00:39:49.491 --> 00:39:52.520
<v Speaker 1>sends a message to all the other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there thinking about going nutty.</v>

918
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Don't go that nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

920
00:39:59.591 --> 00:39:59.591
<v Speaker 1>fucking stabbing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to allow that shit.</v>

921
00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

922
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:05.630
<v Speaker 1>we're so goddamn tolerant of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>loonies to kill him.</v>

923
00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen those back?</v>

924
00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I think I talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about it the other day when we </v>

925
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:13.360
<v Speaker 2>were talking to the fleshlight dude does</v>
<v Speaker 2>it the new,</v>

926
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.110
<v Speaker 2>the new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

927
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.060
<v Speaker 2>piercings where they have a up and down </v>
<v Speaker 2>your back.</v>

928
00:40:17.061 --> 00:40:20.360
<v Speaker 2>They have hoops and then they take laces</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go back and forth,</v>

929
00:40:20.361 --> 00:40:23.840
<v Speaker 2>like it's a dress and I tie bows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff with it.</v>

930
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:26.150
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how fucking crazy is that?</v>

931
00:40:26.151 --> 00:40:31.151
<v Speaker 2>Even piercings are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember back in the day it was left </v>

932
00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:31.151
<v Speaker 2>hoop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right hoop,</v>

933
00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the whigs and one eyebrow </v>

934
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.310
<v Speaker 2>eyebrow eyebrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it moved on the belly button and </v>

935
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:40.610
<v Speaker 2>then like some crazy girls got nipples </v>
<v Speaker 2>and clits.</v>

936
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Now they're fucking making clothes out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your skin.</v>

937
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I think you should probably talk to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>microphone more.</v>

938
00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Put the pumped up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick it up.</v>

939
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's getting to the point where now </v>

940
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like like laces back and forth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're.</v>

941
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:55.420
<v Speaker 2>You're making skin dresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how crazy piercing is.</v>

942
00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's talking about as a series of </v>

943
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.571
<v Speaker 1>loops that these women are putting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies and their back and they </v>

944
00:41:02.571 --> 00:41:03.230
<v Speaker 1>make it like shoelaces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

945
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the trippiest thing ever.</v>

946
00:41:05.311 --> 00:41:07.620
<v Speaker 1>When you see someone that's a girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give a fuck,</v>

947
00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:08.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

948
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:11.160
<v Speaker 1>There was a blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you fuck her in the ass,</v>

949
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.000
<v Speaker 1>she'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

950
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:16.800
<v Speaker 2>There was a girl standing outside of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery store trying to do Greenpeace,</v>

951
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:21.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever that shit is because she had </v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing up and down with a bra </v>

952
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:21.900
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you</v>

953
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.240
<v Speaker 1>think that that's the message that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>message is that they're just.</v>

954
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:29.390
<v Speaker 1>They can take all sorts of crazy pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sexiness of the message that </v>

955
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.350
<v Speaker 1>our people are just getting weird about </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

956
00:41:31.351 --> 00:41:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but does that maybe the sexiness of the.</v>

957
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 1>What it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you know,</v>

958
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:39.430
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is you're taking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lust to the next level because </v>

959
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:43.391
<v Speaker 1>everything has got to go to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>level now because we have this crazy </v>

960
00:41:43.391 --> 00:41:43.391
<v Speaker 1>access to information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

961
00:41:43.391 --> 00:41:45.050
<v Speaker 1>like people are fucking way different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they fucked.</v>

962
00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Like in the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

963
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:49.080
<v Speaker 1>no one is accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

964
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:50.130
<v Speaker 1>lights out,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just fucking and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no dirty talk.</v>

966
00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:56.360

<v Speaker 1>Missionary Style Rollover Kiska and I go</v>

967
00:41:56.361 --> 00:42:01.361

<v Speaker 1>No one is accepting that everyone's </v>

968
00:42:01.361 --> 00:42:03.250
<v Speaker 1>going [inaudible] style and this is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the Internet because </v>

969
00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:06.371
<v Speaker 1>pornography has changed the way people </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at sex and you know what they're </v>

970
00:42:06.371 --> 00:42:06.371
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

971
00:42:06.371 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem with young girls right</v>

972
00:42:08.181 --> 00:42:11.710

<v Speaker 1>their bubbles because they're having but</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

975
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:19.450
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a lot of 30 year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>women in a couple years from now with </v>

976
00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:19.450
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fashion I fastened with your pamper.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

979
00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:27.761
<v Speaker 1>you know it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big operation is not going to be </v>

980
00:42:27.761 --> 00:42:30.311
<v Speaker 1>botox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be getting your butthole </v>

981
00:42:30.311 --> 00:42:31.890
<v Speaker 1>tightening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your butthole brought back to </v>

982
00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:34.031
<v Speaker 1>reality and like a filter for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to use a colostomy </v>

983
00:42:34.031 --> 00:42:37.361
<v Speaker 1>bag for a little while until your </v>
<v Speaker 1>butthole gets recovered from the </v>

984
00:42:37.361 --> 00:42:37.361
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Shit's real,</v>

985
00:42:37.361 --> 00:42:37.361
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

986
00:42:37.361 --> 00:42:39.360
<v Speaker 1>That's one of these people doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're their.</v>

987
00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:40.770
<v Speaker 1>You know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

988
00:42:40.771 --> 00:42:41.940
<v Speaker 1>They're getting there.</v>

989
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 1>They're getting everything to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest level possible.</v>

990
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what these piercings are about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what guys think.</v>

991
00:42:47.841 --> 00:42:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Girls who were tattooed up or sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's sexy about tattoos?</v>

992
00:42:51.621 --> 00:42:56.621
<v Speaker 1>If you have tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how much fucking pain it </v>

993
00:42:56.621 --> 00:42:56.621
<v Speaker 1>causes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so God damn painful,</v>

994
00:42:56.621 --> 00:42:57.970
<v Speaker 1>so you see someone with tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

995
00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:59.620
<v Speaker 1>that's someone who doesn't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

996
00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:03.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's the sexiness of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but shit,</v>

997
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.270
<v Speaker 1>we're word bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

998
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Our society is going in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

999
00:43:07.281 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange direction.</v>

1000
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

1001
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:14.750
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of information is not </v>

1002
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:18.491
<v Speaker 1>necessarily aiding it entirely because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't necessarily using the </v>

1003
00:43:18.491 --> 00:43:20.570
<v Speaker 1>information on the Internet to make an </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective opinion.</v>

1004
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:25.690
<v Speaker 1>They're usually trying to find stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that reinforces their own current </v>

1005
00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:26.060
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very tempting thing.</v>

1006
00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to look at like,</v>

1007
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.080
<v Speaker 1>like w with ideas in the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to look at both sides of it,</v>

1008
00:43:30.081 --> 00:43:31.100
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people aren't.</v>

1009
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:36.190
<v Speaker 1>So it's like almost helping retards be </v>
<v Speaker 1>retarded if they can find other sites </v>

1010
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:38.930
<v Speaker 1>that say the earth is flat and dinosaurs</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived with people 6,000</v>

1011
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:40.040
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you can.</v>

1012
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:45.430
<v Speaker 1>You can find plenty of sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look around and tells you that </v>

1013
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:48.671
<v Speaker 1>evolution is retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have plenty of science that </v>

1014
00:43:48.671 --> 00:43:51.371
<v Speaker 1>we'll have guys who are doctors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're scientists and they are telling </v>

1015
00:43:51.371 --> 00:43:56.050
<v Speaker 1>me they're obviously crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're telling people that the </v>

1016
00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:59.051
<v Speaker 1>earth is only 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old and carbon dating is not real </v>

1017
00:43:59.051 --> 00:43:59.870
<v Speaker 1>and that evolution is a myth and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1018
00:43:59.871 --> 00:44:03.080
<v Speaker 1>we had to come from somewhere so there </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be a god and that,</v>

1019
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible is,</v>

1020
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:09.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can prove the Bible mathematically and </v>

1021
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:09.920
<v Speaker 1>they start talking talk and these are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors and scientists.</v>

1022
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.530
<v Speaker 1>So if you just look for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

1023
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you'll decide on their point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1024
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:18.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you just look at any one side </v>
<v Speaker 1>of any issue you can,</v>

1025
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.300
<v Speaker 1>you can get your answers reinforced.</v>

1026
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 1>So the problem with that is people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting their answers reinforced or</v>

1027
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:26.480
<v Speaker 1>questions rather reinforced there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not necessarily like learning,</v>

1028
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're finding other retards,</v>

1029
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:32.660
<v Speaker 1>your setup websites that confirmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're retarded ideas and all that.</v>

1030
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.200
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1031
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:37.050
<v Speaker 1>That's one problem with the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1032
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.970
<v Speaker 1>the other part of it is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnificent.</v>

1033
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.960
<v Speaker 1>The other part of it is people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>open minded who are really using it,</v>

1034
00:44:42.961 --> 00:44:47.130
<v Speaker 1>it's this crazy network of information </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're really learning like at this</v>

1035
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.520
<v Speaker 1>incredible exponentially expanding rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're learning shit and we're so </v>

1036
00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.300
<v Speaker 1>much more aware of shit than our parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

1037
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Were so much more aware of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much more shit going on that </v>

1038
00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.681
<v Speaker 1>you have to store in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the one I talked to my mom </v>

1039
00:45:03.681 --> 00:45:05.460
<v Speaker 1>about like the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's going on in the world.</v>

1040
00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.110
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm talking to my daughter.</v>

1041
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1042
00:45:08.851 --> 00:45:13.851
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a level of understanding that </v>

1043
00:45:13.851 --> 00:45:16.140
<v Speaker 1>our civilization or are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a generation has reached that really</v>

1044
00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.600
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been reached before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that just an age thing?</v>

1045
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:19.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1046
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:20.430
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the Internet man.</v>

1047
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:21.450
<v Speaker 1>The Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's acceleration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1049
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:28.100
<v Speaker 1>I think our parents were smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 1>their parents and their parents were </v>

1050
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 1>smarter than their parents and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always been that way that we evolve</v>

1051
00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:30.990
<v Speaker 1>and as we evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get brighter.</v>

1052
00:45:30.991 --> 00:45:34.000
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that in culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that in like the movies that</v>

1053
00:45:34.001 --> 00:45:35.700
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to watch the 19 forties,</v>

1054
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.050
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1055
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:38.270
<v Speaker 1>they're way worse than the right.</v>

1056
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.250
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't even have to be the 1940 the </v>
<v Speaker 6>other day.</v>

1057
00:45:40.251 --> 00:45:45.251
<v Speaker 6>I watched a reality bites.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you remember that movie </v>

1058
00:45:45.251 --> 00:45:45.251
<v Speaker 6>had a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1059
00:45:45.251 --> 00:45:45.251
<v Speaker 6>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ben Stiller.</v>

1060
00:45:45.251 --> 00:45:47.570
<v Speaker 6>Janeane Garofalo had all these famous </v>
<v Speaker 6>people are awesome.</v>

1061
00:45:47.571 --> 00:45:48.620
<v Speaker 6>Sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was the other one that you.</v>

1062
00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.850
<v Speaker 1>You're telling me that you made your </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl watch you.</v>

1063
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.120
<v Speaker 1>You thought it was an awesome movie at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

1064
00:45:53.121 --> 00:45:55.100
<v Speaker 1>but it was fucking terrible and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>mad at you.</v>

1065
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:56.450
<v Speaker 6>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1066
00:45:56.451 --> 00:46:01.451
<v Speaker 6>can't buy me love.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But Reality Bites don't you?</v>

1067
00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:08.051
<v Speaker 6>The dream big dream is in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he used to mow lawns and he paid the</v>

1068
00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.630
<v Speaker 6>money bag.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All those bras delivering pizzas.</v>

1069
00:46:11.631 --> 00:46:16.631
<v Speaker 6>And that's the same one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one paid the most popular girl to be </v>

1070
00:46:16.631 --> 00:46:20.141
<v Speaker 6>his girlfriend for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then he became too popular and then </v>

1071
00:46:20.141 --> 00:46:20.970
<v Speaker 6>she's still cranberry juice on a dress </v>
<v Speaker 6>today.</v>

1072
00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.090
<v Speaker 6>But I watched that the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was awful.</v>

1073
00:46:23.091 --> 00:46:24.950
<v Speaker 6>But reality bites,</v>
<v Speaker 6>horrible,</v>

1074
00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.970
<v Speaker 6>like really uncomfortable to watch and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then.</v>

1075
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:30.140
<v Speaker 6>But the worst disturbing thing is I used</v>
<v Speaker 6>to have a crush on Janeane Garofalo back</v>

1076
00:46:30.141 --> 00:46:32.030
<v Speaker 6>in that time period.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought she was like,</v>

1077
00:46:32.031 --> 00:46:33.740
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's a hot comic girl.</v>

1078
00:46:33.741 --> 00:46:35.270
<v Speaker 6>She's so high.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I looked at that movie,</v>

1079
00:46:35.271 --> 00:46:38.720
<v Speaker 6>almost puked because how ugly she was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now I want to know what the fuck.</v>

1080
00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.940
<v Speaker 6>Don't be rude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's rude.</v>

1081
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:48.970
<v Speaker 6>You're being rude in a movie character </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the character in that movie with </v>

1082
00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:49.880
<v Speaker 6>Abby,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you used to have different tastes.</v>

1083
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:51.410
<v Speaker 6>Now you're into like the porn star.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

1084
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.290
<v Speaker 6>that's all cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all cool.</v>

1085
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.390
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But back then that's what it is.</v>

1086
00:46:56.391 --> 00:46:57.950
<v Speaker 6>Everybody has a look and he watched the </v>
<v Speaker 6>movie.</v>

1087
00:46:57.951 --> 00:46:59.360
<v Speaker 6>You could see the line where we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>making it up.</v>

1088
00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.650
<v Speaker 6>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>

1089
00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:05.651
<v Speaker 6>that's not what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's important is the evolution of </v>

1090
00:47:05.651 --> 00:47:05.651
<v Speaker 6>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's important in this conversation is</v>

1091
00:47:05.651 --> 00:47:06.870
<v Speaker 6>not your fucking weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which my.</v>

1092
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:12.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying I evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That movie to me is like I watched </v>

1093
00:47:12.861 --> 00:47:14.570
<v Speaker 6>altered states.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was terrible,</v>

1094
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:15.860
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ultra stays totally.</v>

1095
00:47:15.861 --> 00:47:16.380
<v Speaker 6>Just not home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hold</v>

1096
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:16.800
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1097
00:47:16.801 --> 00:47:21.801
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie changed my life because </v>

1098
00:47:21.801 --> 00:47:21.801
<v Speaker 1>that's the movie that got me into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation tanks.</v>

1099
00:47:21.801 --> 00:47:24.120
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for altered states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably never would have a tank in my</v>

1100
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:29.121
<v Speaker 1>basement and when that tank in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement has changed the way I look at </v>

1101
00:47:29.121 --> 00:47:29.590
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing is like my reset button.</v>

1102
00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I got anything that's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my hand,</v>

1103
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 1>that tank kicks me the real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time.</v>

1104
00:47:35.681 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like my guidebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like literally to me,</v>

1105
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:43.741
<v Speaker 1>my isolation tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like my connection to the spirit </v>

1106
00:47:43.741 --> 00:47:43.741
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like my spirit guide.</v>

1107
00:47:43.741 --> 00:47:47.200
<v Speaker 1>It sounds completely retarded and gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it sounds new agey,</v>

1108
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.680
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it feels like when I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and I just zone.</v>

1109
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:55.690
<v Speaker 1>I just disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My body disappears when my mind has no </v>

1110
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:55.690
<v Speaker 1>sensory input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1111
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm just floating through space in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>

1112
00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I get truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get straight truth about everything </v>

1113
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I've ever done about anything that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever done where I was the Douche bag.</v>

1114
00:48:06.281 --> 00:48:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Anything that I've ever watched where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1115
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:13.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can rewatch like things that have </v>

1116
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:13.660
<v Speaker 1>happened in my life and see where I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally made mistakes,</v>

1117
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.600
<v Speaker 1>things that I've done well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I could have avoided,</v>

1118
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:21.720
<v Speaker 1>reasons why people are upset at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything you kicks you and then </v>

1119
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.560
<v Speaker 1>it kicks me everything about what am I </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing wrong in my personal life?</v>

1120
00:48:23.561 --> 00:48:26.530
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing wrong in my career?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing wrong in my comedy?</v>

1121
00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:29.590
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing wrong in my writing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you could eliminate.</v>

1122
00:48:29.591 --> 00:48:34.591
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you can do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost never like it's never appraising </v>

1123
00:48:34.591 --> 00:48:38.670
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always like a ruthless </v>

1124
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 1>self-examination experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never like a experience like,</v>

1125
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:40.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking awesome here.</v>

1126
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

1127
00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:43.990
<v Speaker 1>It's almost always uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after you get out of it,</v>

1128
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:48.991
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a new found appreciation and </v>

1129
00:48:48.991 --> 00:48:48.991
<v Speaker 1>respect for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1130
00:48:48.991 --> 00:48:53.821
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that experience would not have happened </v>

1131
00:48:53.821 --> 00:48:53.821
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't watch that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Altered states and get,</v>

1132
00:48:53.821 --> 00:48:55.000
<v Speaker 1>get confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile watched it.</v>

1133
00:48:55.001 --> 00:48:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even watch the whole movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shut it off.</v>

1134
00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.760
<v Speaker 1>It was a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those old movies just don't hold up like</v>

1135
00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:05.830
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched that the other day and you </v>

1136
00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.641
<v Speaker 1>remember when it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could believe this is an alien I saw </v>

1137
00:49:07.641 --> 00:49:07.641
<v Speaker 1>the other day and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>

1138
00:49:07.641 --> 00:49:10.380
<v Speaker 7>I can stop any rocks when he stops on my</v>
<v Speaker 7>rocking.</v>

1139
00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:12.610
<v Speaker 7>It's so bad.</v>

1140
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.480
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1141
00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:19.660
<v Speaker 1>The technology available today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a random dude with a pc who knows how to</v>

1142
00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:24.360
<v Speaker 1>encode three d animation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could make something its own computer</v>

1143
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.760
<v Speaker 1>and literally have a texture to it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1144
00:49:26.761 --> 00:49:31.761
<v Speaker 1>It will be way better than 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what you could do that with </v>

1145
00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:31.761
<v Speaker 1>avatar graphics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

1146
00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:31.761
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does that?</v>

1147
00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Would that be 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years,</v>

1148
00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.160
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years?</v>

1149
00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Shit is happening so quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1150
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the internet,</v>

1151
00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:43.850
<v Speaker 1>with the level of complexity that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can pull off and animation now is just </v>

1152
00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:43.860
<v Speaker 1>astounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1153
00:49:43.861 --> 00:49:47.370
<v Speaker 1>avatar still looked a little off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason why they got away with it</v>

1154
00:49:47.371 --> 00:49:51.060
<v Speaker 1>looking a little off is that they used </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters and shit that you don't know in</v>

1155
00:49:51.061 --> 00:49:52.740
<v Speaker 1>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

1156
00:49:52.741 --> 00:49:54.120
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at it and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1157
00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.440
<v Speaker 1>it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell it's fake.</v>

1158
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.540
<v Speaker 1>But like you've watched like I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>legend,</v>

1159
00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legend is the shit.</v>

1160
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.830
<v Speaker 1>But when they had those lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

1161
00:50:01.831 --> 00:50:04.750
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those lines look so bad here.</v>

1162
00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.070
<v Speaker 1>They're making a sequel to that have so </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1163
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that movie.</v>

1164
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.940
<v Speaker 1>That movie was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1165
00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:11.510
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1166
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.920
<v Speaker 1>in the scene where he shoots the lion or</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shoot,</v>

1167
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:16.290
<v Speaker 1>he's going to shoot a deer and align it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes out the deer.</v>

1168
00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.940
<v Speaker 1>It looks so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks so corny and fake.</v>

1169
00:50:20.941 --> 00:50:23.400
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be totally unacceptable.</v>

1170
00:50:23.401 --> 00:50:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Like they really should have to film in </v>
<v Speaker 1>another way,</v>

1171
00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:29.930
<v Speaker 1>but you should have to do it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I can't see it when it happened so</v>

1172
00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:34.931
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you show me is just dog shit </v>

1173
00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:36.470
<v Speaker 1>for a movie that's that powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't totally recreate real life.</v>

1174
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:39.350
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't totally recreate people yet,</v>

1175
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:43.580
<v Speaker 1>but they can really recreate monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that they make up.</v>

1176
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.640
<v Speaker 1>They can make shit that they invent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look fucking amazing.</v>

1177
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Like king kong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>king kong.</v>

1178

<v Speaker 1>You know what I do with that movie?</v>

1181
00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:58.520
<v Speaker 1>I turned it on to the scene where king </v>
<v Speaker 1>kong's fucking shit up.</v>

1182
00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 1>He jack off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost do.</v>

1190
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel very connected to the monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get angry when I go to the zoo and I </v>

1191

<v Speaker 1>being curious.</v>

1193
00:51:33.101 --> 00:51:34.900
<v Speaker 1>George fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sIcilian man.</v>

1194
00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:39.930

<v Speaker 1>they're way closer to monkeys and </v>

1195
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:39.930
<v Speaker 1>regular people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

1196
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.080
<v Speaker 1>There's something about my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ancestors,</v>

1197
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:46.320

<v Speaker 1>I got lucky all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I did,</v>

00:54:59.561 --> 00:55:03.480
<v Speaker 1>have easily broken a wrist or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's was one time when I went down </v>

1283
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:06.561
<v Speaker 1>where it was pretty fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went over the handlebars and I got </v>

<v Speaker 1>then my face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my chin hit the ground,</v>

1286
00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.190
<v Speaker 1>but I absorbed it and I pulled back </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

1287
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:14.440
<v Speaker 1>It was like just enough level headedness</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I did.</v>

1288
00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I wound up not because of jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always fallen.</v>

1289
00:55:17.221 --> 00:55:19.500

<v Speaker 1>Like here's the round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's normal.</v>

1291
00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:22.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a normal feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but dude,</v>

1292
00:55:22.871 --> 00:55:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I kind of got fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have lost some teeth</v>

1293

1296
00:55:32.671 --> 00:55:36.001
<v Speaker 6>a curb.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was dark out and I hit a curb and it </v>

1297
00:55:36.001 --> 00:55:38.371
<v Speaker 6>didn't like pop over.</v>

1298
00:55:38.371 --> 00:55:39.010
<v Speaker 6>and I flipped over my bike and I felt </v>
<v Speaker 6>like my teeth.</v>

<v Speaker 8>it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You just launched like you're on a </v>

1341
00:57:28.071 --> 00:57:28.071
<v Speaker 8>spring head first,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right into the dirt.</v>

1342
00:57:28.071 --> 00:57:30.000
<v Speaker 8>Snap your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How cool would it be?</v>

1343
00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.890
<v Speaker 6>none of us had cars because gas went out</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we all had to get horses.</v>

1344
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:36.330
<v Speaker 6>We all had our own horse and then like </v>
<v Speaker 6>every time we went,</v>

1345
00:57:36.331 --> 00:57:41.331
<v Speaker 6>hung out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all had her horses together to be </v>

1346
00:57:41.331 --> 00:57:41.331
<v Speaker 6>friends with their horse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Breaks his leg.</v>

1347
00:57:41.331 --> 00:57:42.690
<v Speaker 6>You to shoot him in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

1348
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:43.610
<v Speaker 6>Think that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1349
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.650
<v Speaker 6>but then we'll get into horse or two of </v>
<v Speaker 6>her friends.</v>

1350
00:57:45.651 --> 00:57:50.651
<v Speaker 6>Horses would mate and have a baby horse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'd be cool just to have your own </v>

1351
00:57:50.651 --> 00:57:50.651
<v Speaker 6>horse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>

1352
00:57:50.651 --> 00:57:53.090
<v Speaker 6>where's into?</v>
<v Speaker 6>She definitely had one extra hit I think</v>

1353
00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:58.120
<v Speaker 6>should not have had that third hit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's cool that I live in an </v>

1354
00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.550
<v Speaker 6>equestrian district where it'd be nice </v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're with the horse and you treated</v>

1355
00:58:00.551 --> 00:58:05.551
<v Speaker 6>it very well from the time it was young,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you had an awesome relationship with </v>

1356
00:58:05.551 --> 00:58:05.551
<v Speaker 6>the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1357
00:58:05.551 --> 00:58:07.610
<v Speaker 6>But that's not always going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 6>case and it's going to be like you go to</v>

1358
00:58:07.611 --> 00:58:12.611
<v Speaker 6>a dog park with your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's always gonna be some douche bag </v>

1359
00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:12.611
<v Speaker 6>with his fucking dog that wants a bite.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's dog,</v>

1360
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:18.270
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's gonna be what it's going to </v>

1361
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:18.270
<v Speaker 6>be like with horses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My other two can't trust people to raise</v>

1362
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:22.661
<v Speaker 6>the horses correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you're gonna have a bunch of horses </v>

1363
00:58:22.661 --> 00:58:22.820
<v Speaker 6>out there that are douchebag horses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to get mad at your horses.</v>

1364
00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:25.040
<v Speaker 6>You're gonna have douchebag.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gang wars.</v>

1365
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:30.390
<v Speaker 8>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is the most ridiculous conversation</v>

1366
00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:33.790
<v Speaker 8>to have a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What else,</v>

1367
00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:34.620
<v Speaker 8>brian?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1368
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:39.330

<v Speaker 8>Wouldn't you get.</v>

1369
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:42.490
<v Speaker 8>I'd get a pony when,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I can't get a pegasus,</v>

1370
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:46.130
<v Speaker 6>what if we run out of oil or if we run </v>
<v Speaker 6>out of golf?</v>

1371
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.370
<v Speaker 6>Can we all go back to that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That'd be crazy.</v>

1372
00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:53.371
<v Speaker 6>If you had to go back to the board.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really ridiculous how short a </v>

1373
00:58:53.371 --> 00:58:53.371
<v Speaker 6>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I put this on my twitter this week.</v>

1374
00:58:53.371 --> 00:58:56.340
<v Speaker 6>Go just thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How nutty it is that 200 years ago,</v>

1375
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.220
<v Speaker 6>the fastest way to get around was on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>back of an animal.</v>

1376
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:00.810
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Two hundred years ago.</v>

1377
00:59:00.811 --> 00:59:03.870
<v Speaker 6>That's so funny to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there was no photographs in the best</v>

1378
00:59:03.871 --> 00:59:07.200
<v Speaker 6>way to get an image of someone was to </v>
<v Speaker 6>draw them 200 years ago.</v>

1379
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:07.200
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1380
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:08.790
<v Speaker 3>that's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's um,</v>

1381
00:59:08.791 --> 00:59:12.030
<v Speaker 3>a blink in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus christ.</v>

1382
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:15.540
<v Speaker 3>And it's all because of technology and </v>
<v Speaker 3>an oil.</v>

1383
00:59:15.541 --> 00:59:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all because of oil.</v>

1384
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.920
<v Speaker 3>All the plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the shit we use.</v>

1385
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:22.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is oil</v>

1386
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.560
<v Speaker 1>like embedded in our life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally,</v>

1387
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:27.980
<v Speaker 1>it's the main thing for almost all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words for religion and oil together.</v>

1388
00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

1389
00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I believe that religion and oil are </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuffed in together,</v>

1390
00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on purpose.</v>

1391
00:59:33.481 --> 00:59:35.550
<v Speaker 3>Just to make it easier to control the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oil,</v>

1392
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:37.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not that's true,</v>

1393
00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1394
00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:43.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the cia is involved and </v>

1395
00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:43.140
<v Speaker 3>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1396
00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 3>secret shadow government organizations </v>
<v Speaker 3>are involved in creating drama and </v>

1397
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:50.091
<v Speaker 3>turmoil so that we always have an enemy </v>
<v Speaker 3>over there and that's a very real </v>

1398
00:59:50.091 --> 00:59:50.091
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1399
00:59:50.091 --> 00:59:50.790
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to people who understand,</v>

1400
00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:56.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the United States is involved in </v>

1401
00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:58.131
<v Speaker 3>other countries and how we do sell arms </v>
<v Speaker 3>to people like Iran and Iraq and we do </v>

1402
00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:03.590
<v Speaker 3>provide them with weapons and we played </v>
<v Speaker 3>both sides of the fence will provide </v>

1403
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:04.290
<v Speaker 3>their enemy was shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we create,</v>

1404
01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.940
<v Speaker 3>we create drama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1405
01:00:05.941 --> 01:00:07.620
<v Speaker 3>this weekend go in there and cleaned it </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1406
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>We should find a way to make money off </v>
<v Speaker 1>of religion oil combining the two like </v>

1407
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>jesus oil</v>

1408
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:19.220
<v Speaker 3>in the oil business or all the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are supporting the conservative.</v>

1409
01:00:19.221 --> 01:00:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at this point,</v>

1410
01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:22.820
<v Speaker 3>I think the concern that I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's involved,</v>

1411
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:28.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's just the </v>

1412
01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:28.060
<v Speaker 3>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's just the republicans.</v>

1413
01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:28.060
<v Speaker 3>The democrats are just as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1414
01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.710
<v Speaker 3>I believe obama was in favor of offshore</v>
<v Speaker 3>drilling,</v>

1415
01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:35.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was so much pressure that </v>

1416
01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:35.740
<v Speaker 3>we need to relieve ourselves of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1417
01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.530
<v Speaker 3>the need for foreign oil that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1418
01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.660
<v Speaker 3>that they were in support of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody was of it.</v>

1419
01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.000
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like a great idea.</v>

1420
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.880
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1421
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:43.460
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1422
01:00:43.461 --> 01:00:46.100
<v Speaker 3>if they don't spill that shit and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem like they do very often.</v>

1423
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:46.850
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1424
01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:48.020
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they know what they're doing,</v>

1425
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.030
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they know what they're doing.</v>

1426
01:00:50.031 --> 01:00:52.310
<v Speaker 3>So I was in favor of it too until I saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and I was like,</v>

1427
01:00:52.311 --> 01:00:53.600
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

1428
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:54.260
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1429
01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:59.290
<v Speaker 3>that this could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that if something breaks you </v>

1430
01:00:59.290 --> 01:00:59.290
<v Speaker 3>just shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1431
01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I thought like you have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fail safe.</v>

1432
01:01:00.441 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't believe they had no backup </v>
<v Speaker 3>plan.</v>

1433
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.660
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know the exact estimate,</v>

1434
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:09.200
<v Speaker 3>but one of the estimates is 40,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about 40,000</v>

1435
01:01:09.201 --> 01:01:10.310
<v Speaker 3>gallons a day.</v>

1436
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.490
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1437
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>think of how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much oil that is.</v>

1438
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think have a big.</v>

1439
01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>The ocean is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've heard hundreds of thousands.</v>

1440
01:01:18.201 --> 01:01:23.201
<v Speaker 1>I've heard a million gallons a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard all these different efforts </v>

1441
01:01:23.201 --> 01:01:25.750
<v Speaker 1>for hundred thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if it's a thousand gallons of </v>

1442
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:26.690
<v Speaker 1>oil a day even that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the slIck,</v>

1443
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.730
<v Speaker 1>the slickest gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty fun green.</v>

1444
01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:33.731
<v Speaker 1>You can see it with a satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate seeing the animals that they're </v>

1445
01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:33.731
<v Speaker 1>like cleaning off their phones is and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1446
01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one of the ways that people describe</v>

1447
01:01:35.041 --> 01:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>me and they're saying that it could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic,</v>

1448
01:01:37.101 --> 01:01:38.450
<v Speaker 1>like that was the language that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

1449
01:01:38.451 --> 01:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk elliptic apocalyptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just sells more tee shirts.</v>

1450
01:01:42.201 --> 01:01:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is?</v>

1451
01:01:43.401 --> 01:01:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know dude.</v>

1452
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems pretty.</v>

1453
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at,</v>

1454
01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at images right now and </v>

1455
01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>you can't see because you're not here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the streak is jai fucking qinetiq.</v>

1456
01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty 2000 gallons of oil per day.</v>

1457
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what these people are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1458
01:01:57.621 --> 01:02:02.621
<v Speaker 1>who knows if they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's down there with the fucking a </v>

1459
01:02:02.621 --> 01:02:02.621
<v Speaker 1>measuring spoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MeasurIng,</v>

1460
01:02:02.621 --> 01:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>measuring spoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been</v>

1461
01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:08.590
<v Speaker 3>talking about nobody's down there </v>
<v Speaker 3>measuring for real,</v>

1462
01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:13.740
<v Speaker 3>but it is an insane amount of oil and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's leaking out every day and they </v>

1463
01:02:13.811 --> 01:02:16.810
<v Speaker 3>don't know exactly how they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop it and I heard someone last night,</v>

1464
01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:22.180
<v Speaker 3>but this is a dude in jujitsu class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so who knows if he was telling me the </v>

1465
01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:26.061
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could have been just talking out of </v>

1466
01:02:26.061 --> 01:02:27.721
<v Speaker 3>his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was saying that they could stop </v>

1467
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:30.171
<v Speaker 3>the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way they would have to stop it </v>

1468
01:02:30.171 --> 01:02:31.701
<v Speaker 3>is blow up the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they would have to blow it up and </v>

1469
01:02:31.701 --> 01:02:32.970
<v Speaker 3>if they did that the oil was stopped but</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they'd be fucked because they don't</v>

1470
01:02:32.971 --> 01:02:35.130
<v Speaker 3>want to do that because they have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>well down there.</v>

1471
01:02:35.131 --> 01:02:40.131
<v Speaker 3>They want to protect and they want to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to turn it back on again </v>

1472
01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:40.131
<v Speaker 3>eventually.</v>

1473
01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:40.680
<v Speaker 3>If that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's insane.</v>

1474
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:45.740
<v Speaker 3>If there really is a fix and I have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is blow it up and they're worried </v>

1475
01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:45.990
<v Speaker 3>becAuse this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this company wants to,</v>

1476
01:02:45.991 --> 01:02:50.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to pump oil out of there like </v>

1477
01:02:50.991 --> 01:02:53.300
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number one is you've got to stop what </v>

1478
01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:53.300
<v Speaker 3>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta stop oil coming out,</v>

1479
01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you build the build the.</v>

1480
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you built it right?</v>

1481
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 3>You built it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He going to have to build a new one.</v>

1482
01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't salvage the parts of this </v>

1483
01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 3>while it's bleeding oil into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's bananas.</v>

1484
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Like if there really is a fix and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fix involves them destroying the whole </v>

1485
01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to destroy the whole thing first</v>

1486
01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:14.540
<v Speaker 3>and then rebuild it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care how many years it takes to </v>

1487
01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:14.540
<v Speaker 3>make one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

1488
01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.510
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean think how many years </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to take to clean up?</v>

<v Speaker 5>glob boulders that'd be sitting on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bottom of the ocean floor and they would</v>

1495
01:03:36.971 --> 01:03:38.080
<v Speaker 5>just scoop them up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>apparently supposedly from the most </v>

1501
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.830
<v Speaker 3>recent reports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as far as getting it stopped or even</v>

1502
01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.600
<v Speaker 3>under control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not even close,</v>

1503
01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.460
<v Speaker 3>they could be a week away from doing </v>

1504
01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:03.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>listening online.</v>

1526
01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.870

01:04:58.871 --> 01:05:03.240
<v Speaker 5>Here Was this picture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're open image image file.</v>

1528
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:04.270
<v Speaker 5>That's open video file.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And it's bananas.</v>

1543
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:57.910
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so big and it's just nonstop and </v>

1544
01:05:58.881 --> 01:06:02.330

01:06:02.331 --> 01:06:03.560
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know how the fuck they're </v>

1555
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:25.950
<v Speaker 3>until we get off fossil fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're never going to be able to avoid </v>

1556
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:28.510
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes that happen when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when oil spills,</v>

1557
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 3>there was another one that just happened</v>

1558
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:32.650
<v Speaker 5>and where a m and a</v>

1559
01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:38.340
<v Speaker 3>laca straight an oil tanker exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was yesterday</v>

1560
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.880
<v Speaker 5>in</v>

1561
01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.890
<v Speaker 3>peck and baroo.</v>

1562
01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where that is.</v>

1563
01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.440
<v Speaker 3>A crude oil tanker was reported to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>exploded.</v>

1564
01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:48.450
<v Speaker 3>Like they fucking explode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit's flammable,</v>

1565
01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.970
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1566
01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.870
<v Speaker 3>you can't get away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to,</v>

1567
01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:53.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

1568
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:54.910
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a species,</v>

1569
01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:59.911
<v Speaker 3>we have to get past that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to figure out these super </v>

1570
01:06:59.911 --> 01:07:00.190
<v Speaker 3>duper smart dudes have to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>some new way.</v>

1571
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:05.470
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but right now it's so hard to do that </v>

1572
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 3>because their system is so oil based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it works so well,</v>

1573
01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:07.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1574
01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:12.960
<v Speaker 3>think about how much we travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about everything you do basically </v>

1575
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.510
<v Speaker 3>is involved in going somewhere and </v>
<v Speaker 3>burning fuel.</v>

1576
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:14.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never,</v>

1577
01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:15.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1578
01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm home for a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1579
01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here.</v>

1580
01:07:18.521 --> 01:07:20.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't sometimes I never leave my house</v>

1581
01:07:20.171 --> 01:07:22.960
<v Speaker 3>at all for like a few days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's still like,</v>

1582
01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:25.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking using electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1583
01:07:25.121 --> 01:07:25.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1584
01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:25.990
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1585
01:07:25.991 --> 01:07:28.270
<v Speaker 3>you're constantly using things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>made of plastic.</v>

1586
01:07:28.271 --> 01:07:31.310
<v Speaker 3>You constantly consuming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1587
01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:35.200
<v Speaker 3>things that people are produced from oil</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't see that changing.</v>

1588
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:37.030
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck is that going to change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1589
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.180
<v Speaker 3>we would have to come up with a new way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to reStructure the whole science.</v>

1590
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:43.570
<v Speaker 3>So there would have to be some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason to do that,</v>

1591
01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:48.930
<v Speaker 3>to get away from the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have to be some drastic </v>

1592
01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:48.930
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have to be like a cataclysm.</v>

1593
01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:53.550
<v Speaker 3>It would literally have to be something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that resets society and causes us to </v>

1594
01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:56.500
<v Speaker 3>start from scratch because unless we run</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and we're not going to like,</v>

1595
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.230
<v Speaker 3>we're not gonna like pay attention until</v>
<v Speaker 3>we run out.</v>

1596
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.520
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

1597
01:08:00.521 --> 01:08:01.480
<v Speaker 3>we're out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1598
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Now we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1599
01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:07.711
<v Speaker 3>like literally they're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like protecting us and </v>

1600
01:08:07.711 --> 01:08:09.310
<v Speaker 3>giving us a nice safety net so society </v>
<v Speaker 3>can progress easily from here.</v>

1601
01:08:09.311 --> 01:08:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Until then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not him.</v>

1602
01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>

1603
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:20.020
<v Speaker 3>Hot man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it would.</v>

1604
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it would help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1605
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:25.760
<v Speaker 3>but that's not going to fix everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to fix everything.</v>

1606
01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:26.330
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1607
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:28.520
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely we've got to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1608
01:08:28.570 --> 01:08:30.560
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this oil thing does not work.</v>

1609
01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:35.740
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of weird arguments </v>

1610
01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:38.981
<v Speaker 3>about what oil actually is and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people believe that oil is some sort of </v>

1611
01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:39.410
<v Speaker 3>a natural substance created by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

1612
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:43.760
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole book I got on it called </v>
<v Speaker 3>black gold stranglehold.</v>

1613
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
<v Speaker 3>I haven't bothered to research online to</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out if it's been totally disproven </v>

1614
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.661
<v Speaker 3>or whether it's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this guy's argument is that the oil </v>

1615
01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:55.541
<v Speaker 3>isn't fossil fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like really like plankton are </v>

1616
01:08:55.541 --> 01:08:59.711
<v Speaker 3>dead plants or shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when people assume that it is </v>

1617
01:08:59.711 --> 01:09:02.291
<v Speaker 3>millions of years of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with a finite amount left in the </v>

1618
01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:02.810
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually it's some sort of a natural</v>

1619
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:06.320
<v Speaker 3>fluid that's produced by the earth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's the truth,</v>

1620
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 3>if he's right and he's probably not </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1621
01:09:08.571 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 3>but if he is right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like the blood of the world.</v>

1622
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Like we're like little vampire bugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>sucking off the blood of the world.</v>

1623
01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:18.080
<v Speaker 3>That's too trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1624
01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Even if it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if fossil fuels,</v>

1625
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:23.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean even if it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1626
01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:26.330
<v Speaker 3>even if it is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the decay of,</v>

1627
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:31.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that have existed on this earth </v>

1628
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:32.390
<v Speaker 3>and we're consumed by death and decatur </v>
<v Speaker 3>and created this,</v>

1629
01:09:32.391 --> 01:09:35.090
<v Speaker 3>this substance that we use now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if that's the case,</v>

1630
01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.870
<v Speaker 3>then it's like the shit of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's like we're sucking the shit of</v>

1631
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:40.460
<v Speaker 3>the earth out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well either way,</v>

1632
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:45.610
<v Speaker 3>it's like we're sucking something out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a part of some sort of a natural </v>

1633
01:09:45.610 --> 01:09:45.610
<v Speaker 3>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1634
01:09:45.610 --> 01:09:47.080
<v Speaker 3>It's all supposed to be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1635
01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.670
<v Speaker 3>it's like literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like fucking mosquitoes,</v>

1636
01:09:49.671 --> 01:09:54.320
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really are in the earth is us.</v>

1637
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth is us and we're,</v>

1638
01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:01.140
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're ticks sucking off the blood and </v>

1639
01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.971
<v Speaker 3>the most progress that we've ever had in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of our race was when we </v>

1640
01:10:03.971 --> 01:10:04.400
<v Speaker 3>started sucking off the blood of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

1641
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:07.330
<v Speaker 3>When we started cannibalizing mother </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

1642
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:12.400
<v Speaker 3>when we started eating our mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when everything started going </v>

1643
01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.521
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they created cars and computers and </v>

1644
01:10:15.521 --> 01:10:18.860
<v Speaker 3>cell phones and you knoW,</v>
<v Speaker 3>google voice in your pocket.</v>

1645
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:24.010
<v Speaker 3>All that shit is all because that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have this oil because we have figured </v>

1646
01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:25.870
<v Speaker 3>out a way to to make sure that the oil </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that we can transport shit with oil.</v>

1647
01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.760
<v Speaker 3>You could get planes to fly using oil </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we can.</v>

1648
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:32.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what a crazy society.</v>

1649
01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:37.601
<v Speaker 3>One thing comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>combustion engines figuring out how to </v>

1650
01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:38.840
<v Speaker 3>use oil for plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for fuel,</v>

1651
01:10:38.841 --> 01:10:42.800
<v Speaker 3>for all these different things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everythIng just goes buck nana's.</v>

1652
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.340
<v Speaker 3>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's next?</v>

1653
01:10:46.341 --> 01:10:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard about the smart dust </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit?</v>

1654
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1655
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.120
<v Speaker 3>let me gliffy be our friend cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He be over at epic games,</v>

1656
01:10:52.121 --> 01:10:53.650
<v Speaker 3>sent me this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna,</v>

1657
01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.590
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have to google this.</v>

1658
01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:59.940
<v Speaker 3>You got to google up smart dust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the most bizarre thing that I </v>

1659
01:11:00.201 --> 01:11:02.720
<v Speaker 3>think I have ever heard in my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1660
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:05.180
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to this,</v>

1661
01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:10.260
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are wireless devices that are the </v>

1662
01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.830
<v Speaker 3>size of grains of sand inside these </v>
<v Speaker 3>wireless devices.</v>

1663
01:11:12.831 --> 01:11:17.831
<v Speaker 3>The of grains of sand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the ability to transmit </v>

1664
01:11:17.831 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 3>wirelessly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a power source.</v>

1665
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.440
<v Speaker 3>They have the ability to receive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>send data.</v>

1666
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:27.860
<v Speaker 3>They have the ability to take images.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the size of a fucking green sand.</v>

1667
01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:29.820
<v Speaker 3>What websites?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cnn.</v>

1668
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:33.850
<v Speaker 3>This is on cnn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it is fucking bananas and they're.</v>

1669
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:38.870
<v Speaker 3>They're literally talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>being this smart dust being a real world</v>

1670
01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.660
<v Speaker 3>web and the idea is that wireless </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensors,</v>

1671
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:47.750
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can use these wireless sensors </v>

1672
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:48.360
<v Speaker 3>to monitor everything all over the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

1673
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:50.730
<v Speaker 3>Like literally there will be no privacy.</v>

1674
01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:54.280
<v Speaker 6>So don't you think the smart desk </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably would already have existed?</v>

1675
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.940
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

1676
01:11:54.941 --> 01:11:59.941
<v Speaker 6>if this was true stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's probably already probably in our </v>

1677
01:11:59.941 --> 01:11:59.941
<v Speaker 6>room right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1678
01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:01.780
<v Speaker 6>do you think they're already been used?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it was telling us about it because</v>

1679
01:12:01.781 --> 01:12:03.430
<v Speaker 6>what did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Use it first and then</v>

1680
01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:09.570
<v Speaker 3>is pretty easy to track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty easy to track up to </v>

1681
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:10.370
<v Speaker 3>a certain point like what people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of.</v>

1682
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:12.620
<v Speaker 3>But this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't,</v>

1683
01:12:12.710 --> 01:12:17.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if the guys who make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most money of the top scientists who </v>

1684
01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:21.371
<v Speaker 3>they are incorporated by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not familiar with the scientific </v>

1685
01:12:21.371 --> 01:12:21.371
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know if they.</v>

1686
01:12:21.371 --> 01:12:22.610
<v Speaker 3>They get record recruited by big </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporations or if they get recruited by</v>

1687
01:12:22.611 --> 01:12:24.850
<v Speaker 3>the government and who gets all the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists.</v>

1688
01:12:24.851 --> 01:12:27.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who gets all the crazy genius do money,</v>

1689
01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.500
<v Speaker 3>money does right oil and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this thing is,</v>

1690
01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.350
<v Speaker 3>this is a really bananas fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>project.</v>

1691
01:12:33.351 --> 01:12:36.020
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to explain how crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

1692
01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.750
<v Speaker 3>There's a company called street line </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's installed 12,000</v>

1693
01:12:38.751 --> 01:12:43.250
<v Speaker 3>sensors on parking spots and highways in</v>
<v Speaker 3>san francisco and the sensors,</v>

1694
01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:48.400
<v Speaker 3>what they know is whether or not there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a car in that spot and what they're </v>

1695
01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:48.650
<v Speaker 3>going to do is they're going to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a way to give you data.</v>

1696
01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:50.380
<v Speaker 3>So say if you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1697
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:52.490
<v Speaker 3>16th street and fair banks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1698
01:12:52.491 --> 01:12:54.050
<v Speaker 3>I need a parking spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any available?</v>

1699
01:12:54.051 --> 01:12:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one right here.</v>

1700
01:12:55.110 --> 01:13:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Go get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they will tell you whether or not </v>

1701
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.110
<v Speaker 3>there's traffic headed to that parking </v>
<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

1702
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Traffic's clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No cars nearby.</v>

1703
01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Like you can fucking go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll tell you where the traffic is,</v>

1704
01:13:04.401 --> 01:13:08.630
<v Speaker 3>like the sensors on the street will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to pick up traffic and they'll know</v>

1705
01:13:08.631 --> 01:13:10.320
<v Speaker 3>what speed it's moving at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1706
01:13:10.321 --> 01:13:13.850
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be no more speeding son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be able to know who you</v>

1707
01:13:13.851 --> 01:13:16.340
<v Speaker 3>are and how fast you're going all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1708
01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.920
<v Speaker 3>Like that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to suck.</v>

1709
01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:19.840
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>

1710
01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:23.130
<v Speaker 6>So there's not going to be any sports </v>
<v Speaker 6>cars and sports cars.</v>

1711
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.830
<v Speaker 6>You have to have to turn in your shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>and get some slow ass.</v>

1712
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:30.070
<v Speaker 6>Only have horses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you and the horses because horses,</v>

1713
01:13:30.071 --> 01:13:31.310
<v Speaker 6>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not ethical.</v>

1714
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:32.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't.</v>

1715
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:34.680
<v Speaker 6>Who cares about speeding on horses?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1716
01:13:34.681 --> 01:13:35.820
<v Speaker 6>the sensor is going to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>streets,</v>

1717
01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:38.380
<v Speaker 6>so they'll be able to tell you that your</v>
<v Speaker 6>horse is going to factor.</v>

1718
01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:40.050
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't a speed limits when people had</v>
<v Speaker 6>horses,</v>

1719
01:13:40.051 --> 01:13:41.040
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

1720
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:43.170
<v Speaker 6>It was actually better to go as fast as </v>
<v Speaker 6>you could.</v>

1721
01:13:43.171 --> 01:13:45.000
<v Speaker 6>You had the best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You probably have the best world.</v>

1722
01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:47.460
<v Speaker 6>So we're going to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you fell as fast you could,</v>

1723
01:13:47.461 --> 01:13:52.461
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe we should take it easy and just </v>

1724
01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:52.461
<v Speaker 6>play it safe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why you have leather shit on.</v>

1725
01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:52.461
<v Speaker 6>Let's just not gonna help you in your </v>
<v Speaker 6>land,</v>

1726
01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:54.840
<v Speaker 6>in your fucking hand on a cobblestone </v>
<v Speaker 6>street because the horse,</v>

1727
01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:57.900
<v Speaker 6>he saw a rat sensors to protect as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>horse freaks out sandman</v>

1728
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:59.210
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking rat kuvan.</v>

1729
01:13:59.211 --> 01:14:01.940
<v Speaker 3>And you go flying and smash your head on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the curb.</v>

1730
01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:03.860
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horses,</v>

1731
01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.000
<v Speaker 3>horses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck oil.</v>

1732
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1733
01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:11.040
<v Speaker 3>this real world web that they are trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to create is one of the strangest </v>

1734
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.840
<v Speaker 3>inventions that I think I've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1735
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:14.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1736
01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I did not know that they were this far </v>
<v Speaker 3>along.</v>

1737
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these smart dust sensors can be </v>

1738
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:23.550
<v Speaker 3>relatively small and portable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>portable.</v>

1739
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:25.540
<v Speaker 3>What they're talking about with this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're gonna.</v>

1740
01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:28.960
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna have trillions of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things all over the world.</v>

1741
01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:30.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the idea behind it.</v>

1742
01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.960
<v Speaker 3>Is this even possible though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or is this just theories?</v>

1743
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Hewlett packard's involved and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling it.</v>

1744
01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:42.090
<v Speaker 3>They're calling it the central nervous </v>
<v Speaker 3>system for the earth and the coming </v>

1745
01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:45.151
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The company plans to deploy a trillion </v>

1746
01:14:45.151 --> 01:14:46.150
<v Speaker 3>sensors all over the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1747
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:50.110
<v Speaker 3>How bananas is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how bananas is it that someone's letting</v>

1748
01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:51.520
<v Speaker 3>them do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to do what</v>

1749
01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:56.630
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we vote on this before you put jesus </v>

1750
01:14:56.821 --> 01:14:59.790
<v Speaker 2>christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there will be no privacy.</v>

1751
01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.830
<v Speaker 2>There will be no privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be impossible.</v>

1752
01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Someone will be able to detect this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't happen because then if it's like </v>

1753
01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:10.401
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we can put sensors in the white </v>

1754
01:15:10.401 --> 01:15:10.401
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

1755
01:15:10.401 --> 01:15:10.401
<v Speaker 1>yes it can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1756
01:15:10.401 --> 01:15:10.401
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1757
01:15:10.401 --> 01:15:15.121
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying for a long time that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that the next stage of human </v>

1758
01:15:15.121 --> 01:15:17.320
<v Speaker 1>beings is going to be the no secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage that's going to.</v>

1759
01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:19.090
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1760
01:15:19.091 --> 01:15:24.091
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be eventually it's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the point where we can see each </v>

1761
01:15:24.091 --> 01:15:26.611
<v Speaker 1>other's thoughts and we can communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other and read each other's </v>

1762
01:15:26.611 --> 01:15:29.341
<v Speaker 1>minds and memories and ideas and we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's ideas directly from each </v>

1763
01:15:29.341 --> 01:15:29.341
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the next stage,</v>

1764
01:15:29.341 --> 01:15:30.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to go directly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1765
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:33.310
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a little pit stop along the way and</v>

1766
01:15:33.311 --> 01:15:36.100
<v Speaker 1>the pitstop it's going to take along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way is no more privacy.</v>

1767
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.920
<v Speaker 1>that's step number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before the interface,</v>

1768
01:15:38.921 --> 01:15:41.200
<v Speaker 1>before human beings are allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interface with each other,</v>

1769
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:44.410
<v Speaker 1>where before we were allowed to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>one gigantic,</v>

1770
01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.740
<v Speaker 1>gigantic wireless mind and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible</v>

1771
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.720
<v Speaker 3>and park probably.</v>

1772
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's gonna be some sort of a </v>

1773
01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:54.840
<v Speaker 1>neural connection that allows everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>to connect with everybody,</v>

1774
01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:59.540
<v Speaker 1>but before that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to come up with </v>

1775
01:15:59.540 --> 01:15:59.540
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that happens.</v>

1776
01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:03.561
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be an intermediate step</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the intermediate step will be </v>

1777
01:16:03.561 --> 01:16:03.561
<v Speaker 1>no more privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be able to watch people.</v>

1778
01:16:03.561 --> 01:16:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be able to do</v>

1779
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:07.730
<v Speaker 2>everything all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we're looking at the negative part</v>

1780
01:16:07.731 --> 01:16:08.430
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

1781
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Now we can see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1782
01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.940
<v Speaker 2>that was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we can see people.</v>

1783
01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could fucking watch you watch you.</v>

1784
01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Not with my marrow blocker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make when I make my neuro </v>

1785
01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:18.820
<v Speaker 2>block or I got to leave latest</v>

1786
01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:19.110
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo.</v>

1787
01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:21.720
<v Speaker 3>That's what the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's going to have a leadership.</v>

1788
01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:27.460
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be like computer viruses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to always be one </v>

1789
01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:29.961
<v Speaker 3>step up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know there's something like </v>

1790
01:16:29.961 --> 01:16:29.961
<v Speaker 3>fucking 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>new kubota was at 4:40.</v>

1791
01:16:29.961 --> 01:16:31.620
<v Speaker 3>how many computer viruses are created a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

1792
01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:35.310
<v Speaker 3>but at some been fucking crazy number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost said bananas again,</v>

1793
01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:40.490
<v Speaker 3>which would have been annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Caught myself to think about how crazy </v>

1794
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.870
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to get to a point where,</v>

1795
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:44.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many is that?</v>

1796
01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.150
<v Speaker 3>40 two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many are out there?</v>

1797
01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our.</v>

1798
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Our point is ladies and gentlemen that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are privacy is slowly going away and I </v>

1799
01:16:56.870 --> 01:17:01.050
<v Speaker 3>think that that is a part of the natural</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution of the human race.</v>

1800
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:06.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that the human race iS evolving </v>
<v Speaker 3>to something that is no longer to deal </v>

1801
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:07.180
<v Speaker 3>with embarrassment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

1802
01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have a different set </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs because</v>

1803
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.280
<v Speaker 1>our environment has changed so radically</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what our physical biology is coded </v>

1804
01:17:15.411 --> 01:17:20.411
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's forcing this sort of an evolution </v>

1805
01:17:20.411 --> 01:17:23.060
<v Speaker 1>of technology is forcing us to evolve as</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially as well as it is evolving like </v>

1806
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:29.980
<v Speaker 1>technologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as they come up with crazy and </v>

1807
01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:29.980
<v Speaker 1>crazier shit that dissolves boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more,</v>

1808
01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.390
<v Speaker 1>we're forced to play catch up and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's gonna happen.</v>

1809
01:17:32.391 --> 01:17:35.630
<v Speaker 1>If we get to a point where there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>more privacy,</v>

1810
01:17:35.631 --> 01:17:40.631
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to realize how </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous privacy isn't the first </v>

1811
01:17:40.631 --> 01:17:40.631
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1812
01:17:40.631 --> 01:17:40.910
<v Speaker 1>we're going to realize how ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassment is.</v>

1813
01:17:41.010 --> 01:17:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Shame and all the stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my daughter never wants to admit </v>

1814
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:47.450
<v Speaker 1>when she shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking too.</v>

1815
01:17:47.451 --> 01:17:48.950
<v Speaker 1>She never wants a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1816
01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:52.880
<v Speaker 1>she'll shake your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no machine making shit faces,</v>

1817
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:54.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't want you to touch her.</v>

1818
01:17:54.441 --> 01:17:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Like they get embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's,</v>

1819
01:17:56.050 --> 01:18:01.050
<v Speaker 1>it's almost a natural coding in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and I think eventually all that </v>

1820
01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:01.490
<v Speaker 1>stuff is going to deteriorate.</v>

1821
01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to dissolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be crushed by innovation.</v>

1822
01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:08.930
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what's going to force us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to catch up because it's like the things</v>

1823
01:18:08.931 --> 01:18:12.200
<v Speaker 1>that we accept as part of like our </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal culture and the way behave.</v>

1824
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.290
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is just just what we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to.</v>

1825
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the shit that people get </v>

1826
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.590
<v Speaker 1>used to another country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's thinking about the cultures and the</v>

1827
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:22.850
<v Speaker 1>weird traditions that people have been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of like throughout history,</v>

1828
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.720
<v Speaker 1>amish people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have plates in their lips and</v>

1829
01:18:26.721 --> 01:18:27.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1830
01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:31.130
<v Speaker 1>and nutty motherfuckers who do all kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different rituals all over the world.</v>

1831
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:32.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all what you get used to it.</v>

1832
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just used to privacy.</v>

1833
01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're used to it,</v>

1834
01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:41.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's not necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be more important for </v>

1835
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580
<v Speaker 1>us to get rid of douche bags.</v>

1836
01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:46.700
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be more important for us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize the importance of educating </v>

1837
01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:50.081
<v Speaker 1>human beings and raising human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>that think correctly and to be </v>

1838
01:18:50.081 --> 01:18:53.150
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the human beings you </v>
<v Speaker 1>create and raise like you're responsible</v>

1839
01:18:53.151 --> 01:18:57.830
<v Speaker 1>for your fucking dog biting something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not responsible for your son,</v>

1840
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1841
01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a mass murderer,</v>

1842
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's just,</v>

1843
01:19:00.771 --> 01:19:01.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got crazy.</v>

1844
01:19:01.611 --> 01:19:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1845
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:08.290
<v Speaker 1>if your son kick someone's ass and does </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Bad thing to someone and breaks their </v>

1846
01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:10.640
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get sued or you will have to pay</v>

1847
01:19:10.641 --> 01:19:12.890
<v Speaker 1>for that kid's medical expenses and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to.</v>

1848
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.260
<v Speaker 1>But if your son is some fucking mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderer,</v>

1849
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to do?</v>

1850
01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should go to fucking jail.</v>

1851
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:26.500
<v Speaker 1>You made a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You made someone that likes to kill </v>

1852
01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:26.500
<v Speaker 1>hookers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd that happen?</v>

1853
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just happened.</v>

1854
01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.600
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1855
01:19:29.601 --> 01:19:32.540
<v Speaker 1>You did something terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are so shitty.</v>

1856
01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:37.660
<v Speaker 1>And raising a human being that you raise</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human being that likes to kill and </v>

1857
01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:37.910
<v Speaker 1>eat other human beings.</v>

1858
01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.190
<v Speaker 6>Because sometimes that's totally just </v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing to do with parents.</v>

1859
01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.770
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know.</v>

1860
01:19:42.850 --> 01:19:43.740
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

<v Speaker 6>happened to people genetically.</v>

1862
01:19:47.251 --> 01:19:48.540

<v Speaker 6>What do you.</v>

1863
01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.910
<v Speaker 6>They recognize that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1865
01:19:52.771 --> 01:19:57.771
<v Speaker 6>Serial killers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because that's something that they're </v>

1866
01:19:57.771 --> 01:19:59.601
<v Speaker 6>not trained to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You mean that you mean they weren't </v>

1867
01:19:59.601 --> 01:20:01.050

<v Speaker 6>that's just just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's how you get people's eyes are </v>

1869
01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.811
<v Speaker 6>blue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people's eyes are brown skinned </v>

<v Speaker 3>comes from and it's not necessarily that</v>
<v Speaker 3>every serial killers or sociopath.</v>

1876
01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:25.941
<v Speaker 3>Some people are just obsessed and insane</v>
<v Speaker 3>and broken and they have a lot of other </v>

1877
01:20:25.941 --> 01:20:25.941
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they.</v>

1878
01:20:25.941 --> 01:20:28.890
<v Speaker 3>They think that there's a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 3>sociopaths.</v>

1879
01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:31.230
<v Speaker 3>People that don't care about other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's feelings</v>

1880
01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:36.280
<v Speaker 6>a lot more than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're not know though whether it </v>

1881
01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:39.221
<v Speaker 6>comes from nature or nurture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't really know a lot of </v>

1882
01:20:39.221 --> 01:20:41.921
<v Speaker 6>speculation like your dad molested you </v>
<v Speaker 6>stab somebody or your dad let you watch </v>

1883
01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:48.060
<v Speaker 6>when you're watching hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't know if anything that's been </v>

1884
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:48.060
<v Speaker 6>proven that watching horror movies,</v>

1885
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:52.680
<v Speaker 3>playing video games is a release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>According to todd hollingshead from id </v>

1886
01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.740
<v Speaker 3>software.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and I were having a conversation </v>

1887
01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:57.160
<v Speaker 3>aBout this the other night when he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that that violence among kids has</v>

1888
01:20:57.161 --> 01:21:02.161
<v Speaker 3>gone down since popularity and video </v>
<v Speaker 3>games and violent video games has gone </v>

1889
01:21:02.161 --> 01:21:05.940
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it has sort of a cathartic release </v>

1890
01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:05.940
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing.</v>

1891
01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.960
<v Speaker 6>That's what they believe in Japan to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's turning us into super </v>

1892
01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:12.331
<v Speaker 6>humans with dre.</v>

<v Speaker 3>video games.</v>

1980
01:24:37.391 --> 01:24:42.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like that starfighter movie where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they went and they put a game out.</v>

1981
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:43.020

<v Speaker 6>games.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like all based off like a video </v>

1989
01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:59.800
<v Speaker 6>I watched aliens the other day when I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was watching aliens.</v>

1990
01:24:59.801 --> 01:25:04.801
<v Speaker 6>They had the scene where he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 6>to the computer and the computer's like </v>

1991
01:25:04.801 --> 01:25:08.281
<v Speaker 6>old old ass text.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They haven't even figured out a graphic </v>

1992
01:25:08.281 --> 01:25:11.461
<v Speaker 6>user interface.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was no idea that that would ever </v>

1993
01:25:11.461 --> 01:25:14.880
<v Speaker 6>take place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it was computers were all lights all </v>

1994
01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.370
<v Speaker 6>around you for no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but was all lit up and big and stupid.</v>

1995

<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1997
01:25:17.351 --> 01:25:20.020
<v Speaker 6>That's how ridiculous is that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like star trek.</v>

1998
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:21.430
<v Speaker 6>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1999
01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.610
<v Speaker 6>So who knows what the fuck is ever going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to happen with the smart dust shit.</v>

2000
01:25:24.611 --> 01:25:28.570
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I find it amazing that this is something</v>

2001
01:25:28.571 --> 01:25:29.710
<v Speaker 6>that's on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2003
01:25:33.471 --> 01:25:36.830
<v Speaker 3>on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not hearing about this anywhere.</v>

2004
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:38.210
<v Speaker 3>Is anybody hearing about this?</v>

2005
01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.280
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was published April 1st.</v>

2006
01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.550
<v Speaker 6>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was it?</v>

2007
01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:44.650
<v Speaker 6>No mayfair,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2008
01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.700
<v Speaker 6>just double checking out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems ridiculous.</v>

2009
01:25:46.701 --> 01:25:48.520
<v Speaker 6>That was yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It does seem ridiculous or something.</v>

2010
01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:49.520
<v Speaker 6>But it was yesterday.</v>

2011
01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.460
<v Speaker 3>So this is a real project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real thing.</v>

2012
01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:55.140
<v Speaker 3>If that's really happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2013
01:25:55.190 --> 01:25:58.220
<v Speaker 3>are they gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let us know when it goes live.</v>

2014
01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:02.830
<v Speaker 6>Don't see how like the government's </v>
<v Speaker 6>allowing that to.</v>

2015
01:26:02.831 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 6>They're just doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's</v>

2016
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.360
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no precedent.</v>

2017
01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like google maps,</v>

2018
01:26:06.921 --> 01:26:07.300
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2019
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:09.470
<v Speaker 3>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing some nutty shit man.</v>

2020
01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.610
<v Speaker 3>They're just just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2021
01:26:10.611 --> 01:26:12.920
<v Speaker 3>google maps actually has gotten in </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble for a few things.</v>

2022
01:26:12.921 --> 01:26:17.921
<v Speaker 3>There has been some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some disputes about what they are in </v>

2023
01:26:17.921 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 3>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what these guys are doing is,</v>

2024
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they probably feel like they're </v>

2025
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:25.000
<v Speaker 3>just creating a network,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2026
01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:26.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2027
01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:28.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe they're exaggerating the </v>
<v Speaker 3>capabilities.</v>

2028
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's some dispute about what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be possible and what's not </v>

2029
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.030
<v Speaker 3>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line is they're not going</v>

2030
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:35.690
<v Speaker 3>to stop here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to stop with this.</v>

2031
01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is something that creating in </v>

2032
01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.551
<v Speaker 3>2010,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are they going to have in </v>

2033
01:26:42.551 --> 01:26:42.551
<v Speaker 3>2020?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2034
01:26:42.551 --> 01:26:42.620
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they going to have in 2030?</v>

2035
01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:47.660
<v Speaker 3>There's gonna be some nutty shits on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's getting fucking crazy</v>

2036
01:26:48.710 --> 01:26:51.440
<v Speaker 2>or it's like us talking about 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago and nothing really like,</v>

2037
01:26:51.441 --> 01:26:52.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have vcrs anymore.</v>

2038
01:26:52.671 --> 01:26:57.671
<v Speaker 2>We have blue ray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't spend a lot of things have </v>

2039
01:26:57.671 --> 01:26:57.671
<v Speaker 2>changed in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2040
01:26:57.671 --> 01:26:58.930
<v Speaker 2>to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you're also thinking like</v>

2041
01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:04.030
<v Speaker 3>on the high end level will the high end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the higher end of technology things </v>

2042
01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:08.741
<v Speaker 3>have changed drastically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with the large hadron collider and </v>

2043
01:27:08.741 --> 01:27:11.500
<v Speaker 3>those guys in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas I think it's a Massachusetts </v>

2044
01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.690
<v Speaker 3>that are trying to recreate a son or </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how to make a </v>

2045
01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:13.690
<v Speaker 3>fucking son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't even,</v>

2047
01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:19.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know the exact specifics of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that case.</v>

2048
01:27:20.210 --> 01:27:20.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

2049
01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:23.330
<v Speaker 3>I'll look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scientists trying to create son.</v>

2050
01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:29.850
<v Speaker 2>So a ufc comIng up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that he injured his shoulder </v>

2051

<v Speaker 2>hit.</v>

2052

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2055
01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:39.590
<v Speaker 3>his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on the undercard of a rashad </v>

2056
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.590
<v Speaker 3>evans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2057
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>be honest with you.</v>

2058
01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nuclear fusion scientists attempt to </v>

2059
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:47.661
<v Speaker 3>create artificial sun on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2060
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:50.670
<v Speaker 3>nothing's gonna happen wrong there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely going to be fine.</v>

2061
01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:57.680
<v Speaker 3>They're goIng to make a fucking son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have a little portable </v>

2062
01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:57.680
<v Speaker 3>sons that exist all around the earth and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2063
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:59.170
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2064
01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Unless it blows up like the fucking oil </v>
<v Speaker 3>town.</v>

2065
01:28:01.111 --> 01:28:02.640
<v Speaker 3>What if you have your own portable </v>
<v Speaker 3>sunday?</v>

2066
01:28:02.641 --> 01:28:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Just followed me around and kept you </v>
<v Speaker 3>warm.</v>

2067
01:28:04.081 --> 01:28:09.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless it blows up like the fucking oil </v>

2068
01:28:09.081 --> 01:28:09.081
<v Speaker 3>tanker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you Imagine?</v>

2069
01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Why do you always look at the bright </v>
<v Speaker 3>side of things?</v>

2070
01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Why do you guys look at the bad side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things together?</v>

2071
01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like the odd couple like tom and </v>

2072
01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:19.260
<v Speaker 2>jerry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two things on the shoulder,</v>

2073
01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:21.300
<v Speaker 2>like the devil and the angel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerry.</v>

2074
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:24.570
<v Speaker 2>ThIs animal house son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember everything I guess.</v>

2075
01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been on a million things.</v>

2076
01:28:26.771 --> 01:28:28.780
<v Speaker 3>There was a comic that used to do an act</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2077
01:28:28.781 --> 01:28:30.300
<v Speaker 3>Norm macdonald was making fun of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember?</v>

2078
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Remember he had like a logical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>logical left brain.</v>

2079
01:28:34.241 --> 01:28:37.390
<v Speaker 3>Right brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so look,</v>

2080
01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.940
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what the fuck is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening with the smart dust,</v>

2081
01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:41.830
<v Speaker 3>but you got to.</v>

2082
01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:46.980
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine snort and people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to find a way to take a snort.</v>

2083
01:28:46.981 --> 01:28:48.120
<v Speaker 2>It may get high off of it.</v>

2084
01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:53.220
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this got high up the smart dose dude,</v>

2085
01:28:53.410 --> 01:28:55.350
<v Speaker 3>the hp shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2086
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:58.380
<v Speaker 3>This is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The research that this is,</v>

2087
01:28:58.381 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 3>despite these differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>researchers say the dust theory,</v>

2088
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:06.930
<v Speaker 3>that monitoring everything will benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humanity remains essentially unchanged.</v>

2089
01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:10.020
<v Speaker 3>They believe that this will benefit </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity to monitor everything.</v>

2090
01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they might be right.</v>

2091
01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:19.040
<v Speaker 3>I think we might have to accept the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that technology is going to keep moving </v>

2092
01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:19.890
<v Speaker 3>forward and if technology keeps moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward,</v>

2093
01:29:19.891 --> 01:29:21.530
<v Speaker 3>what is the end result?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

2094
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 3>what's going to be at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rainbow?</v>

2095
01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is?</v>

2096
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Is there a singularity as ray kurzweil </v>
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>

2097
01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:28.770
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terence mckenna says,</v>

2098
01:29:28.810 --> 01:29:33.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>timewave zero know is there a moment of </v>

2099
01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:33.960
<v Speaker 3>ultimate novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a moment,</v>

2100
01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:39.020
<v Speaker 3>a moment where they create something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so fucking crazy that it changes </v>

2101
01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:39.020
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is probabLy the beginning,</v>

2102
01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:43.971
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This smart dust shit is probably the </v>

2103
01:29:43.971 --> 01:29:43.971
<v Speaker 3>fucking beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2104
01:29:43.971 --> 01:29:45.010
<v Speaker 2>google was probably the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a part of it.</v>

2105
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:46.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google's browser.</v>

2106
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:50.700
<v Speaker 3>That chrome browser is fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's my favorite browser by far.</v>

2107
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:53.820
<v Speaker 3>So this nuclear fusion thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2108
01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:55.830
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these scientists trying to create this,</v>

2109
01:29:56.130 --> 01:29:59.610
<v Speaker 3>this actual artificial sun or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a natural side.</v>

2110
01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would actually be a son.</v>

2111
01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:03.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's of the same elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars may not have.</v>

2112
01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it's a son,</v>

2113
01:30:04.561 --> 01:30:06.870
<v Speaker 3>it's a son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a fake tit.</v>

2114
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2115
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's the fucking son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2116
01:30:09.291 --> 01:30:11.300
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're just used throwing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>name son around.</v>

2117
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:15.430
<v Speaker 2>It's just a really hot light bulb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2118
01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.400
<v Speaker 2>it just seems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

2119
01:30:16.401 --> 01:30:16.700
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

2120
01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:17.890
<v Speaker 2>What's a son?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a planet.</v>

2121
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:21.160
<v Speaker 3>If you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to look it up.</v>

2122
01:30:21.161 --> 01:30:23.770
<v Speaker 3>It's in the telegraph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bright star as of yesterday.</v>

2123
01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2124
01:30:26.351 --> 01:30:31.351
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was published in since it was </v>

2125
01:30:31.351 --> 01:30:31.351
<v Speaker 3>published in 2008.</v>

2126
01:30:31.351 --> 01:30:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2127
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think they're moving.</v>

2128
01:30:33.411 --> 01:30:34.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a hope student there.</v>

2129
01:30:34.770 --> 01:30:35.650
<v Speaker 3>They're moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

2130
01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:36.860
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where it is right there.</v>

2131
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:39.140
<v Speaker 3>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This image of this thing.</v>

2132
01:30:39.141 --> 01:30:41.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like a fucking x men inside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>target chamber.</v>

2133
01:30:41.841 --> 01:30:44.180
<v Speaker 3>We're scientists will attempt to create </v>
<v Speaker 3>an artificial sun.</v>

2134
01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:46.640
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

2135
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's the latest update?</v>

2136
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:53.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>research shows that these two guys are </v>

2137
01:30:53.290 --> 01:30:55.490
<v Speaker 2>just smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of weed didn't exist.</v>

2138
01:30:56.161 --> 01:30:57.840
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just made it in a rush.</v>

2139
01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:59.400
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fascinating when you</v>

2140
01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:04.480
<v Speaker 3>listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While it seemed impossible goal for </v>

2141
01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.911
<v Speaker 3>nearly a hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists now believe they are at the </v>

2142
01:31:06.911 --> 01:31:09.431
<v Speaker 3>break on the brake rather of cracking </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest problems in physics </v>

2143
01:31:09.431 --> 01:31:11.270
<v Speaker 3>by harnessing the power of nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>fusion.</v>

2144
01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:16.580
<v Speaker 3>the reaction that burns at the heart of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sudden they really think they could </v>

2145
01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:16.580
<v Speaker 3>do this.</v>

2146
01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:18.310
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>

2147
01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Are people allowed to have like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2148
01:31:22.121 --> 01:31:24.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ingredients to make a son.</v>

2149
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.270
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it.</v>

2150
01:31:26.271 --> 01:31:28.690
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be allowed to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the ingredients to make science.</v>

2151
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2152
01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:35.010
<v Speaker 3>what we can look at the manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 3>project basically harness the power of </v>

2153
01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:35.010
<v Speaker 3>his son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2154
01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:36.010
<v Speaker 3>that's a nuclear energy is right,</v>

2155
01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:36.800
<v Speaker 9>right.</v>

2156
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Say you're not allowed to buy weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're allowed to make nuclear </v>

2157
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:43.560
<v Speaker 2>explosions.</v>

2158
01:31:44.970 --> 01:31:47.020
<v Speaker 3>Fireball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is sort of an older story.</v>

2159
01:31:47.021 --> 01:31:49.900
<v Speaker 3>It seems like I'm fine and from 2008 </v>
<v Speaker 3>with no a</v>

2160
01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:51.220
<v Speaker 2>no updates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>updates,</v>

2161
01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:55.240
<v Speaker 2>find whatever that scientIst is names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just google that guy's name and</v>

2162
01:31:55.241 --> 01:31:58.230
<v Speaker 2>then under more options in google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click the last month.</v>

2163
01:31:58.430 --> 01:32:00.260
<v Speaker 2>You crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

2164
01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like december 27,</v>

2165
01:32:02.111 --> 01:32:04.020
<v Speaker 3>2008 is when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2166
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:06.780
<v Speaker 3>now here's 2009 again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2167
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:11.790
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to make it in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when they believe that will be </v>

2168
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.790
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those,</v>

2169
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:13.060
<v Speaker 3>the bottom line is some shit is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

2170
01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:14.710
<v Speaker 3>That's the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

2171
01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:17.630

<v Speaker 3>and these little tiny sensors that go </v>

2205
01:33:40.761 --> 01:33:44.121
<v Speaker 3>over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people are aware of the smart </v>

2206
01:33:44.121 --> 01:33:44.121
<v Speaker 3>dust stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pr,</v>

2207
01:33:44.121 --> 01:33:45.990
<v Speaker 3>the amount that this should be a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking story.</v>

2208
01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.630
<v Speaker 3>There should be something that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's jaw drop.</v>

2209
01:33:48.810 --> 01:33:50.640
<v Speaker 3>When you step back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they gonna do?</v>

2210
01:33:50.641 --> 01:33:54.120
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna monitor everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

2211
01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:55.500
<v Speaker 3>What does that go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean?</v>

2212
01:33:55.501 --> 01:34:00.501
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when is it going to start with just </v>

2213
01:34:00.501 --> 01:34:00.501
<v Speaker 3>little bits of information like there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2214
01:34:00.501 --> 01:34:01.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a person in this area as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can eventually get to a point where they</v>

2215
01:34:01.741 --> 01:34:06.090
<v Speaker 3>can have your image and you could see </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything everywhere and eventually are</v>

2216
01:34:06.091 --> 01:34:08.100
<v Speaker 3>they going to get to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be able to tap into that</v>

2217
01:34:08.101 --> 01:34:08.890
<v Speaker 3>shit with your fucking.</v>

2218
01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:12.320
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like there should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>voting before this would ever happen for</v>

2219
01:34:12.321 --> 01:34:12.560
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

2220
01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:17.620
<v Speaker 3>but there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no voting on whether or not we </v>

2221
01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:19.481
<v Speaker 3>go to Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You vote a president in and then the </v>

2222
01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:21.020
<v Speaker 3>president gets to decide all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up shit that nobody wants.</v>

2223
01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.360
<v Speaker 3>If you allow the american people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide,</v>

2224
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:26.870
<v Speaker 3>90 percent of the shit we got involved </v>
<v Speaker 3>in would never happen,</v>

2225
01:34:26.871 --> 01:34:29.150
<v Speaker 3>so we have it set up where you don't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to decide.</v>

2226
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:33.200
<v Speaker 3>You get to decide on who gets to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you get to decide on,</v>

2227
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:35.810
<v Speaker 3>which is fucking ridiculous because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that one,</v>

2228
01:34:35.811 --> 01:34:40.811
<v Speaker 3>gosh should be trusted to fucking run </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in this day and age where as </v>

2229
01:34:40.811 --> 01:34:41.780
<v Speaker 3>much as we know about how complicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is,</v>

2230
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:45.260
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's total nonsense,</v>

2231
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:50.470
<v Speaker 3>but yet we accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right way to do it would be to have </v>

2232
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:54.701
<v Speaker 3>everybody vote on things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is people are </v>

2233
01:34:54.701 --> 01:34:55.340
<v Speaker 3>fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're really easy to manipulate.</v>

2234
01:34:55.370 --> 01:35:00.370
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could tell them all sorts of shit </v>

2235
01:35:00.370 --> 01:35:02.110
<v Speaker 3>not true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the dumb ones would all buy it and </v>

2236
01:35:02.110 --> 01:35:02.600
<v Speaker 3>the dumb ones are more than half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now what do you do?</v>

2237
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:06.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost like you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who you think is pretty smart to</v>

2238
01:35:06.171 --> 01:35:11.171
<v Speaker 3>get into power so that he could make the</v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions for you guys and look out for </v>

2239
01:35:11.171 --> 01:35:14.351
<v Speaker 3>your best interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's when money gets involved and </v>

2240
01:35:14.351 --> 01:35:14.840
<v Speaker 3>they get fucking corporations and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporations come the long money to make</v>

2241
01:35:14.841 --> 01:35:17.300
<v Speaker 3>sure that you get an office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once you get an office like yo man,</v>

2242
01:35:17.301 --> 01:35:22.301
<v Speaker 3>like we really like the oil that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting from the amazon jungle and we </v>

2243
01:35:22.301 --> 01:35:22.760
<v Speaker 3>like to keep getting that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2244
01:35:22.761 --> 01:35:24.500
<v Speaker 3>there's some places we like to cut down </v>
<v Speaker 3>some trees.</v>

2245
01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:25.770
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hayden</v>

2246
01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.000
<v Speaker 10>got you.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I got you.</v>

2247
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:29.190
<v Speaker 10>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You want the trees?</v>

2248
01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:30.140
<v Speaker 10>It was good.</v>

2249
01:35:30.670 --> 01:35:35.670
<v Speaker 3>This is what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go over there and we'll </v>

2250
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:35.670
<v Speaker 3>give them a giant as loan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't pay back.</v>

2251
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:35.910
<v Speaker 3>And then when they can't pay it back a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little jack,</v>

2252
01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:36.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take their shit.</v>

2253
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.610
<v Speaker 3>And we've been doing that since fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of time.</v>

2254
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:44.790
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's money involved and when there's </v>

2255
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.790
<v Speaker 3>money involved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can ever have a real power.</v>

2256
01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:49.860
<v Speaker 3>The real power can't be isolated in one </v>
<v Speaker 3>area and they can't be like all this </v>

2257
01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:53.940
<v Speaker 3>influence where like one group or one </v>
<v Speaker 3>person or one organization gets to </v>

2258
01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:58.861
<v Speaker 3>control shit because then everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be trying to kiss ass to that </v>

2259
01:35:58.861 --> 01:35:59.620
<v Speaker 3>organization to get them to do what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want so that they can,</v>

2260
01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:02.440
<v Speaker 3>they can conduct business and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're dealing with.</v>

2261
01:36:02.650 --> 01:36:07.650
<v Speaker 3>That's why people can't vote for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything because a real democracy </v>

2262
01:36:07.650 --> 01:36:07.650
<v Speaker 3>would wouldn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

2263
01:36:07.650 --> 01:36:09.680
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're fucking babies were infantiles.</v>

2264
01:36:10.210 --> 01:36:13.210
<v Speaker 3>There's no way with the way we've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>living our society,</v>

2265
01:36:13.211 --> 01:36:15.970
<v Speaker 3>like were there some big daddy looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>out for us?</v>

2266
01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:21.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way we can go from that to </v>

2267
01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.060
<v Speaker 3>like being able to be completely free </v>
<v Speaker 3>and vote for everything that happens.</v>

2268
01:36:22.061 --> 01:36:25.570
<v Speaker 3>It'd be too complicated right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just going to take a long time,</v>

2269
01:36:25.571 --> 01:36:26.680
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it's ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

2270
01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:31.570
<v Speaker 3>I think something's going to just bypass</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and launch our culture and launch our</v>

2271
01:36:31.571 --> 01:36:36.571
<v Speaker 3>civilization and to the next stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're never going to evolve as </v>

2272
01:36:36.571 --> 01:36:36.970
<v Speaker 3>we are in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this form.</v>

2273
01:36:37.150 --> 01:36:42.150
<v Speaker 3>I think this forum is all about fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and violence and chaos and laughter and </v>

2274
01:36:42.641 --> 01:36:44.500
<v Speaker 3>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's this life,</v>

2275
01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:49.740
<v Speaker 3>this life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this life is all about love and </v>

2276
01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.520
<v Speaker 3>friendships and shit you like to do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun and it's hang on,</v>

2277
01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:56.380
<v Speaker 3>hang on to the big ship that is humanity</v>
<v Speaker 3>because some shit is going to change and</v>

2278
01:36:56.381 --> 01:36:59.380
<v Speaker 3>you're about to go through a new door </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when we go through that new door,</v>

2279
01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:04.440

<v Speaker 3>about about whether or not you should </v>

2280
01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.990
<v Speaker 3>get a mac or a pc or whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a democrat or republican or </v>

2281

<v Speaker 3>fucking fuck those hooks.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2283
01:37:10.570 --> 01:37:15.570
<v Speaker 3>That's all going to be nonsense when the</v>
<v Speaker 3>big change happens and I think it's </v>

2284
01:37:15.570 --> 01:37:17.860
<v Speaker 3>common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is really fucking comment and</v>

2285
01:37:17.861 --> 01:37:21.220
<v Speaker 3>I think you see things like this little </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart dust thing and you see things like</v>

2286
01:37:21.221 --> 01:37:26.221
<v Speaker 3>people trying to create sons and you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like what's going on with with </v>

2287
01:37:26.221 --> 01:37:26.830
<v Speaker 3>the fucking oil spill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where this going to be?</v>

2288
01:37:26.831 --> 01:37:31.831
<v Speaker 3>Some radical changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way people approach extracting oil </v>

2289
01:37:31.831 --> 01:37:34.771
<v Speaker 3>from the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now people are going to demand this is </v>

2290
01:37:34.771 --> 01:37:34.771
<v Speaker 3>going to be a catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2291
01:37:34.771 --> 01:37:38.641
<v Speaker 3>I think some shit is change and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit is so freaky,</v>

2292
01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:44.740
<v Speaker 3>freaky to think that this ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>notion of 2012 being,</v>

2293
01:37:44.741 --> 01:37:49.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of humanity that is a date you </v>

2294
01:37:49.741 --> 01:37:50.470
<v Speaker 3>can actually track that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's happening that way.</v>

2295
01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:53.950
<v Speaker 3>It really would not be shocked if </v>
<v Speaker 3>december 20,</v>

2296
01:37:53.951 --> 01:37:58.951
<v Speaker 3>first 2012 actually does turn out to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of crazy invention or insane </v>

2297
01:38:00.871 --> 01:38:04.430
<v Speaker 3>innovation that catapults the human race</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the next stage.</v>

2298
01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:06.080
<v Speaker 2>You guys are going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be nothing.</v>

2299
01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:10.700
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be completely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like turning 2000.</v>

2300
01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:14.000
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like the computer virus</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it might not be</v>

2301
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:15.460
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it might happen before then.</v>

2302
01:38:15.461 --> 01:38:16.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be a rough estimate,</v>

2303
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:21.950
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that takes place and I think </v>

2304
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.950
<v Speaker 3>it's going to involve.</v>

2305

<v Speaker 3>And even if we do accept it,</v>

2510
01:47:59.850 --> 01:48:04.850
<v Speaker 3>I think it's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's going to save us and </v>

2511
01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:05.580
<v Speaker 3>what's going to change us is technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

2512
01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

2513
01:48:07.111 --> 01:48:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I think when we realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're slowly starting to realize</v>

2514
01:48:10.290 --> 01:48:12.780
<v Speaker 3>how full of shit people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're slowly starting to,</v>

2515
01:48:12.810 --> 01:48:15.570
<v Speaker 3>as we get more and more intrusive into </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's lives,</v>

2516
01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:16.710
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2517
01:48:16.770 --> 01:48:20.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're exposing like another level of,</v>

2518
01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:25.980
<v Speaker 3>of understanding of human beings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>busting politicians and busting.</v>

2519
01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was stuff like that guy that got </v>

2520
01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:31.100
<v Speaker 3>busted.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In New York.</v>

2523
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:34.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody got busted like that before.</v>

2524
01:48:34.890 --> 01:48:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's ever gotten better happening in</v>
<v Speaker 3>jail now.</v>

2525
01:48:37.230 --> 01:48:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2526
01:48:37.591 --> 01:48:40.470
<v Speaker 3>that guy was a guy that was a very vocal</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the market,</v>

2527
01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:43.040
<v Speaker 3>about the market being all fucked up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt and you know,</v>

2528
01:48:43.041 --> 01:48:48.041
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and talking about all these companies </v>

2529
01:48:48.041 --> 01:48:49.700
<v Speaker 3>and he believes that that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons why they went after him and </v>

2530
01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:50.280
<v Speaker 3>that's why they're one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 3>why they prosecuted,</v>

2531
01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:51.360
<v Speaker 3>persecuted him.</v>

2532
01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy was busting people for </v>

2533
01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:57.210
<v Speaker 3>prostitution and he was using </v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitutes,</v>

2534
01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:58.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

2535
01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:03.320
<v Speaker 3>that was like another example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a guy that was like all adamant </v>

2536
01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:03.570
<v Speaker 3>against we're going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitution.</v>

2537
01:49:03.571 --> 01:49:04.920
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2538
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:08.180
<v Speaker 3>what a good thing to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop people getting their dick sucked.</v>

2539
01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2540
01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:11.220
<v Speaker 3>why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you give a shit?</v>

2541
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:13.110
<v Speaker 3>You got to really put so much effort </v>
<v Speaker 3>into that.</v>

2542
01:49:13.230 --> 01:49:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out the reason why he's doing </v>

2543
01:49:18.230 --> 01:49:18.230
<v Speaker 3>this because you just covering up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that he's using them.</v>

2544
01:49:18.230 --> 01:49:21.860
<v Speaker 3>Like why wouldn't he is no different </v>
<v Speaker 3>than all these crazy gay activists that </v>

2545
01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:23.280
<v Speaker 3>are secretly gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2546
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:26.160
<v Speaker 3>he's hating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is trying to cover it up.</v>

2547
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:29.480
<v Speaker 6>So we should look at anyone that's like </v>
<v Speaker 6>a huge,</v>

2548
01:49:29.481 --> 01:49:34.481
<v Speaker 6>like loud person on a certain topic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the guy that likes slim jim's that </v>

2549
01:49:34.481 --> 01:49:38.351
<v Speaker 6>went to snap into slim seems probably </v>
<v Speaker 6>hates seeing it correctly at all the </v>

2550
01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:44.890
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just joking the what we have to </v>

2551
01:49:44.890 --> 01:49:44.890
<v Speaker 6>look in as anyone.</v>

2552
01:49:44.890 --> 01:49:45.630
<v Speaker 3>The formula,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

2553
01:49:45.690 --> 01:49:47.500
<v Speaker 3>and this is what I've seen to have out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

2554
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.980
<v Speaker 3>You have to look at anyone that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to suppress the behavior or the </v>

2555
01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:56.290
<v Speaker 3>desires of anyone else where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't concern them.</v>

2556
01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:01.860
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's someone who is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop you from whatever the fuck it is,</v>

2557
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.390
<v Speaker 3>whether it's masturbation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's anything.</v>

2558
01:50:04.570 --> 01:50:07.240
<v Speaker 3>If they're trying to suppress your </v>
<v Speaker 3>desire,</v>

2559
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:09.960
<v Speaker 3>if they're trying to stop you from </v>
<v Speaker 3>marrying other gay people,</v>

2560
01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:11.800
<v Speaker 3>stop gay rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at them,</v>

2561
01:50:12.010 --> 01:50:13.930
<v Speaker 3>look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out what the fuck it is.</v>

2562
01:50:14.110 --> 01:50:16.420
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to suppress prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We gotta stop prostitution.</v>

2563
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Find that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's getting his dick sucked is paying </v>

2564
01:50:21.630 --> 01:50:21.630
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking freak.</v>

2565
01:50:21.630 --> 01:50:25.381
<v Speaker 3>He's a freak and he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the people that are trying to </v>

2566
01:50:25.381 --> 01:50:27.931
<v Speaker 3>suppress people from doing things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't affect the person who's trying to </v>

2567
01:50:27.931 --> 01:50:28.630
<v Speaker 3>stop them from suppressing things.</v>

2568
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Just leave people the fuck alone and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't lead people to fuck alone,</v>

2569
01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:34.240
<v Speaker 3>you're the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2570
01:50:34.241 --> 01:50:36.160
<v Speaker 3>and that's really what It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This eliot spitzer guy,</v>

2571
01:50:36.161 --> 01:50:36.700
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2572
01:50:36.701 --> 01:50:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you were exposing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2573
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:40.390
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these flaws in the market.</v>

2574
01:50:40.391 --> 01:50:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you were exposing corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>

2575
01:50:42.371 --> 01:50:44.500
<v Speaker 3>douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were also getting people locked in a</v>

2576
01:50:44.501 --> 01:50:47.200
<v Speaker 3>cage because somebody gave somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>money to get their dick sucked,</v>

2577
01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:52.090
<v Speaker 3>which is fucking nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 2010 you can,</v>

2578
01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:55.480
<v Speaker 3>you can go to jail because you can suck </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's dick for free,</v>

2579
01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:58.060
<v Speaker 3>but if they give you $5,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a bad person.</v>

2580
01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:00.910
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is ridiculous.</v>

2581
01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:04.680
<v Speaker 3>That's completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then any,</v>

2582
01:51:04.690 --> 01:51:09.690
<v Speaker 3>anyone who's trying to suppress anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else's desires or needs and they're </v>

2583
01:51:11.111 --> 01:51:13.870
<v Speaker 3>trying to suppress them in a way that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>has nothing to do with them.</v>

2584
01:51:14.050 --> 01:51:14.940
<v Speaker 3>You got to look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

2585
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:16.120
<v Speaker 3>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all fucked up.</v>

2586
01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.960
<v Speaker 3>They're all doing something shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2587
01:51:19.210 --> 01:51:20.650
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you agree with me.</v>

2588
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:24.430
<v Speaker 3>That was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That ramp tapered off at the end,</v>

2589
01:51:24.431 --> 01:51:25.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty good.</v>

2590
01:51:25.161 --> 01:51:27.070
<v Speaker 3>At the beginning I had an important </v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

2591
01:51:27.071 --> 01:51:29.670
<v Speaker 3>but somewhere around there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through our market,</v>

2592
01:51:29.671 --> 01:51:30.710
<v Speaker 3>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

2593
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:34.170
<v Speaker 3>you lose the creative magic in </v>
<v Speaker 3>formulating your sentences.</v>

2594
01:51:35.010 --> 01:51:36.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like your setup this week.</v>

2595
01:51:36.361 --> 01:51:41.361
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one thing I think I just killed </v>

2596
01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:41.361
<v Speaker 3>sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that laptop on my lap,</v>

2597
01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.500
<v Speaker 3>just cooked my boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do it like?</v>

2598
01:51:43.501 --> 01:51:45.660
<v Speaker 3>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the laptop off to the side.</v>

2599
01:51:45.690 --> 01:51:47.790
<v Speaker 3>That's the move is if you put your </v>
<v Speaker 3>laptop,</v>

2600
01:51:47.791 --> 01:51:52.791
<v Speaker 3>if you move this thing and you put your </v>
<v Speaker 3>laptop like you put your microphone </v>

2601
01:51:52.791 --> 01:51:54.990
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Folks were fucking ghetto stuff.</v>

2602
01:51:55.050 --> 01:52:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Planned out situation there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've covered everything that I want </v>

2603
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:02.580
<v Speaker 3>to cover as far as ufc predictions.</v>

2604
01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:07.580
<v Speaker 3>People Keep asking me use predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never give you a few predictions </v>

2605
01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:07.580
<v Speaker 3>because who the fucK knows it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>

2606
01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm the super exciting fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The main event of course is spectacular.</v>

2607
01:52:12.030 --> 01:52:15.240
<v Speaker 3>Leo machida versus mauricio shogun who a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2608
01:52:15.241 --> 01:52:16.770
<v Speaker 3>very interesting fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2609
01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:19.530
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people thought that maricio won</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first fight,</v>

2610
01:52:19.531 --> 01:52:21.000
<v Speaker 3>but if he did win it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2611
01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.530
<v Speaker 3>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2612
01:52:22.531 --> 01:52:23.670
<v Speaker 3>it didn't kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't,</v>

2613
01:52:23.671 --> 01:52:24.950
<v Speaker 3>he didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2614
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:26.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't stop him.</v>

2615
01:52:26.491 --> 01:52:31.491
<v Speaker 3>He never really heard him badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never really had a real dominant </v>

2616
01:52:31.491 --> 01:52:32.160
<v Speaker 3>moment in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just edged them.</v>

2617
01:52:32.161 --> 01:52:35.340
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people felt like he edged them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a very exciting fight.</v>

2618
01:52:35.610 --> 01:52:36.960
<v Speaker 3>And I tHink that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2619
01:52:36.970 --> 01:52:41.970
<v Speaker 3>leonardo is going to have a completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different strategy most likely for this </v>

2620
01:52:41.970 --> 01:52:45.171
<v Speaker 3>flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very excited to see that he's a very </v>

2621
01:52:45.171 --> 01:52:45.171
<v Speaker 3>strategic dude.</v>

2622
01:52:45.171 --> 01:52:47.900
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think also he's going to be the both </v>

2623
01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:49.791
<v Speaker 3>guys got to be more prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to know what the other is </v>

2624
01:52:49.791 --> 01:52:53.051
<v Speaker 3>capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to review the first fight </v>

2625
01:52:53.051 --> 01:52:54.020
<v Speaker 3>and go over mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go over when they landed and you know,</v>

2626
01:52:54.021 --> 01:52:57.380
<v Speaker 3>and go over like maybe tendencies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>each might have that might,</v>

2627
01:52:57.410 --> 01:52:59.240
<v Speaker 3>maybe they can exploit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it does.</v>

2628
01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:01.910
<v Speaker 3>The second fight is going to start out a</v>
<v Speaker 3>chess match.</v>

2629
01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Now they're going to be a both guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be doing things that they think</v>

2630
01:53:05.931 --> 01:53:10.931
<v Speaker 3>are going to benefit them in this fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe they didn't do in the first </v>

2631
01:53:10.931 --> 01:53:13.871
<v Speaker 3>flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we'll find guys might start off </v>

2632
01:53:13.871 --> 01:53:13.871
<v Speaker 3>the fight a little bit more cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be interesting.</v>

2633
01:53:13.871 --> 01:53:15.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cfo maybe show them,</v>

2634
01:53:15.801 --> 01:53:20.801
<v Speaker 3>plays the role of a counter striker </v>
<v Speaker 3>initially or maybe they Just get to it </v>

2635
01:53:20.801 --> 01:53:21.350
<v Speaker 3>like it's around six.</v>

2636
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they just fucking go out each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

2637
01:53:22.941 --> 01:53:24.920
<v Speaker 3>That's very possible to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2638
01:53:24.921 --> 01:53:29.921
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that even more so because of the </v>

2639
01:53:29.921 --> 01:53:32.381
<v Speaker 3>controversy involving some of the fights</v>
<v Speaker 3>lately where guys haven't been exciting </v>

2640
01:53:32.381 --> 01:53:36.310
<v Speaker 3>like the anderson silva fight where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of slacked off over the last two </v>

2641
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:38.270
<v Speaker 3>rounds and people even criticizing jose </v>
<v Speaker 3>aldo for his last round of his fight.</v>

2642
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:41.300
<v Speaker 3>So If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're affected by that stuff,</v>

2643
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:42.980
<v Speaker 3>maybe they might come out and try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prove a point.</v>

2644
01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:46.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>because to too much is at stake and both</v>

2645
01:53:46.731 --> 01:53:51.731
<v Speaker 3>guys are too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're both two of the most dangerous </v>

2646
01:53:51.731 --> 01:53:52.220
<v Speaker 3>and explosive guys in that light </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight division.</v>

2647
01:53:52.221 --> 01:53:57.221
<v Speaker 3>And anything can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's my prediction for the main </v>

2648
01:53:57.221 --> 01:53:57.221
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>

2649
01:53:57.221 --> 01:53:57.820
<v Speaker 6>Karate guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his cheetah.</v>

2650
01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.650
<v Speaker 6>Cheetah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you think,</v>

2651
01:53:59.651 --> 01:54:00.780
<v Speaker 6>what do you think his karate as well?</v>

2652
01:54:00.810 --> 01:54:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Martial art in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2653
01:54:02.670 --> 01:54:07.670
<v Speaker 3>what machIda does is very smart is he </v>
<v Speaker 3>combined the good things of karate with </v>

2654
01:54:07.891 --> 01:54:10.380
<v Speaker 3>more thai and jujitsu and wrestling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing,</v>

2655
01:54:10.570 --> 01:54:15.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of good stuff in </v>

2656
01:54:15.570 --> 01:54:15.570
<v Speaker 3>karate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2657
01:54:15.570 --> 01:54:16.830
<v Speaker 3>the ability to leap in and leave out </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the way they fight.</v>

2658
01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:21.980
<v Speaker 3>They're very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The footwork is different than like </v>

2659
01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:21.980
<v Speaker 3>moitai guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more thai guys,</v>

2660
01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:25.430
<v Speaker 3>more like they learned that their light </v>
<v Speaker 3>on their feet but they weighed in and </v>

2661
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440
<v Speaker 3>they get real close to each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>

2662
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:30.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they check kicks and attacks the </v>

2663
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.550
<v Speaker 3>karate guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all,</v>

2664
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.550
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like fencing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like explode,</v>

2665
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:35.590
<v Speaker 3>explode out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not used to fighting </v>

2666
01:54:35.590 --> 01:54:35.590
<v Speaker 3>machida he's super hard to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that,</v>

2667
01:54:35.590 --> 01:54:38.130
<v Speaker 3>that explosion that is fucking throws </v>
<v Speaker 3>you off many.</v>

2668
01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:43.140
<v Speaker 3>He leans way back and he dives in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's super accurate with things and iF </v>

2669
01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:44.400
<v Speaker 3>he catches you with one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could fuck you up.</v>

2670
01:54:44.590 --> 01:54:47.010
<v Speaker 3>it lightens you up like pot shot at you </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a distance.</v>

2671
01:54:47.011 --> 01:54:48.930
<v Speaker 3>You're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened to rashad evans.</v>

2672
01:54:48.931 --> 01:54:52.320
<v Speaker 3>He started just lighten them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started like laying back and he comes</v>

2673
01:54:52.321 --> 01:54:55.350
<v Speaker 3>in and blast them and then once he does </v>
<v Speaker 3>it a couple of times,</v>

2674
01:54:55.351 --> 01:55:00.351
<v Speaker 3>that's all he needs to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even need to hit you a couple </v>

2675
01:55:00.351 --> 01:55:01.380
<v Speaker 3>of times before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like a little bewildered and he's</v>

2676
01:55:01.381 --> 01:55:02.640
<v Speaker 3>so good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did that too.</v>

2677
01:55:02.641 --> 01:55:03.870
<v Speaker 3>So could you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2678
01:55:03.871 --> 01:55:08.871
<v Speaker 3>he did that to tiago silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stopped him at the end of the first </v>

2679
01:55:08.871 --> 01:55:08.871
<v Speaker 3>round is a fucking killer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2680
01:55:08.871 --> 01:55:12.680
<v Speaker 3>He's a killer and he's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do that even more on shogun </v>

2681
01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:13.650
<v Speaker 3>den in their first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be more fired up,</v>

2682
01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:16.080
<v Speaker 3>more motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's going to be even better.</v>

2683
01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:21.200
<v Speaker 3>And then show gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got to be super confident because </v>

2684
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:23.541
<v Speaker 3>he feels like you won that first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He feels like he got robbed them </v>

2685
01:55:23.541 --> 01:55:25.971
<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's going to be confident and he's </v>

2686
01:55:25.971 --> 01:55:28.251
<v Speaker 3>gonna be fucking coming in guns blazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and leo's going to be confident and the </v>

2687
01:55:28.251 --> 01:55:30.090
<v Speaker 3>other is going to be more motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better strategies going to be an awesome</v>

<v Speaker 6>Well that's</v>

2695
01:55:44.230 --> 01:55:45.970

<v Speaker 3>mcdo.</v>

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Joe's joe's the muck jo jo syndrome is </v>

2697
01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:55.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when martial arts became popular in </v>

2698
01:55:55.370 --> 01:55:55.370
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess in the sixties or whatever,</v>

2699
01:55:55.370 --> 01:55:57.550
<v Speaker 3>when people started watching Bruce Lee </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies in the seventies and shit,</v>

2700
01:55:57.820 --> 01:56:02.820
<v Speaker 3>what happened was people got really into</v>
<v Speaker 3>karate and karate became a business and </v>

2701
01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:04.240
<v Speaker 3>they open up karate schools all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and people wanted to learn how to kick </v>

2703

<v Speaker 3>Martial arts,</v>

2727
01:56:55.930 --> 01:56:57.750
<v Speaker 3>they have much lower standards than </v>
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu.</v>

2728
01:56:57.790 --> 01:56:59.260
<v Speaker 3>Most of them do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>black belt if you're not ready.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think there's a white house.</v>

2770
01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:37.890
<v Speaker 3>White house press correspondents' </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinner.</v>

2771
01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I thinK that's what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2772
01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:41.440
<v Speaker 3>You didn't hear about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why I ignore all</v>

<v Speaker 6>you got to checK this out because it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>fascinating.</v>

2774
01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Obama goes on and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2775
01:58:46.570 --> 01:58:48.550

<v Speaker 1>obama did so well.</v>

2776
01:58:48.850 --> 01:58:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Opie and anthony were the only ones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>said obama didn't do well and I fucking </v>

2777
01:58:53.850 --> 01:58:54.760

<v Speaker 1>He just butchered the jokes,</v>

2778
01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:58.060
<v Speaker 1>like the timing sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the jokes were pretty well written.</v>

2779
01:58:58.061 --> 01:59:03.061
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the guys from the daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>show or something running for him and </v>

01:59:04.301 --> 01:59:06.040
<v Speaker 1>It's all clunky and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2782
01:59:06.041 --> 01:59:09.640
<v Speaker 1>he got big laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the jokes he did and no one's</v>

2783
01:59:09.641 --> 01:59:12.220
<v Speaker 1>even talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the jokes he did,</v>

2784
01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:14.560
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jonas brothers are here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And he said something about his </v>

2787
01:59:21.330 --> 01:59:21.330

<v Speaker 1>don't even think about it.</v>

2803
01:59:59.341 --> 02:00:04.341
<v Speaker 6>It's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's talking about things that kill </v>

<v Speaker 6>innocent people every day.</v>

2814
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:24.000
<v Speaker 6>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Patchy helicopters,</v>

<v Speaker 6>kind of in the news,</v>

2818
02:00:29.931 --> 02:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>your example is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2819
02:00:30.151 --> 02:00:31.220
<v Speaker 1>and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

2820
02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>when you're the president of the god </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn United States,</v>

2821
02:00:33.631 --> 02:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>it's just like when George Bush waS </v>
<v Speaker 1>president and he said,</v>

2822
02:00:36.291 --> 02:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>where are the weapons of mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction?</v>

2823
02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>None under here.</v>

2824
02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:40.960
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like looking under his desk.</v>

2825
02:00:41.010 --> 02:00:46.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But drones aren't just made for </v>

2826
02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:46.010
<v Speaker 6>killings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for spying and stuff,</v>

2827
02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:46.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have hellfire missiles on them.</v>

2828
02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:48.100
<v Speaker 6>They're there to find people that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>bad and lost,</v>

2829
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:51.080
<v Speaker 6>but there's also implying he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>spy on the jonas brothers.</v>

2830
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:53.600
<v Speaker 6>He's going to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right with,</v>

2831
02:00:53.790 --> 02:00:57.310
<v Speaker 6>with something that they've been killing</v>
<v Speaker 6>people with light lighthearted.</v>

2832
02:00:57.311 --> 02:01:02.311
<v Speaker 6>It's not like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's attacking somebody that </v>

2833
02:01:02.311 --> 02:01:03.010
<v Speaker 6>you want to attack the person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's ridiculous.</v>

2834
02:01:03.011 --> 02:01:06.070
<v Speaker 6>If you're getting angry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You think that me saying that,</v>

2835
02:01:06.071 --> 02:01:07.740
<v Speaker 6>him saying that is attacking him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2836
02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:12.840
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're obviously taking it like in </v>

2837
02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:12.840
<v Speaker 6>America,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2838
02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:12.840
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe he's joking about this </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

2839
02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:12.840
<v Speaker 6>Go man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>brian,</v>

2840
02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:17.761
<v Speaker 6>when you're the president of a country </v>
<v Speaker 6>that is literally fucking the whole </v>

2841
02:01:17.761 --> 02:01:17.761
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't see that</v>

2842
02:01:17.761 --> 02:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>evolve into wars overseas and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird things that happened in Pakistan </v>

2843
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:27.311
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who approves them or how </v>

2844
02:01:27.311 --> 02:01:28.790
<v Speaker 1>exactly they work where they have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>drones that fire these missiles at these</v>

2845
02:01:28.791 --> 02:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>people that we don't like and all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of other people die,</v>

2846
02:01:32.210 --> 02:01:34.790
<v Speaker 6>but that's not something I would joke </v>
<v Speaker 6>about if I was the president,</v>

2847
02:01:35.530 --> 02:01:39.140
<v Speaker 6>but there's plenty of shit to make you </v>
<v Speaker 6>think that he's joking.</v>

2848
02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:40.250
<v Speaker 6>Also kInd of acting</v>

2849
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>like my mom getting mad about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he said a joke.</v>

2850
02:01:43.701 --> 02:01:48.701
<v Speaker 1>It's a dumb joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he would think it's </v>

2851
02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:50.771
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he would think killing </v>

2852
02:01:50.771 --> 02:01:50.771
<v Speaker 1>boys that want to fuck his guy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

2853
02:01:50.771 --> 02:01:53.380
<v Speaker 1>It say that to the jonas brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that hilarious.</v>

2854
02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like you've got the worst </v>

2855
02:01:58.920 --> 02:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>response of any of his bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't well delivered either.</v>

2856
02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you think that because I</v>

2857
02:02:01.521 --> 02:02:04.640
<v Speaker 1>think I wouldn't say that if I was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president that's retarded,</v>

2858
02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:09.670
<v Speaker 1>which is saying something really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think there's any comment and </v>

2859
02:02:09.670 --> 02:02:10.910
<v Speaker 1>that there's something very serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>about being a person who's responsible,</v>

2860
02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>at least indirectly for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people dying because of these </v>

2861
02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:16.130
<v Speaker 1>fucking drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people crying.</v>

2862
02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Many families devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people lost theIr children.</v>

2863
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Many people lost their loved ones gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

2864
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:24.380
<v Speaker 1>but because it's taking place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan doesn't freak you out.</v>

2865
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:28.520
<v Speaker 1>what did we use involved In drone </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks in Ohio would have kids you went</v>

2866
02:02:28.521 --> 02:02:33.521
<v Speaker 1>to high school with got fucking killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got their legs blown off because </v>

2867
02:02:33.521 --> 02:02:35.240
<v Speaker 1>obama is using drones to target al qaeda</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ohio.</v>

2868
02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that wouldn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying,</v>

2869
02:02:37.011 --> 02:02:38.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if though joe,</v>

2870
02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:39.110

<v Speaker 1>what if not,</v>

2871
02:02:39.111 --> 02:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>what really happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just brought it.</v>

2872
02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No different than Ohio for you to think </v>

2873
02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:49.901
<v Speaker 1>that it's okay and Pakistan and not okay</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ohio because I didn't say it because </v>

2874
02:02:49.901 --> 02:02:49.940
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes it a what if joe,</v>

2875
02:02:49.941 --> 02:02:51.590
<v Speaker 1>you're making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making it seem like that.</v>

2876
02:02:51.591 --> 02:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm that sensitive about the middle east</v>

2877
02:02:54.321 --> 02:02:56.870
<v Speaker 1>and stuff where I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about that shit.</v>

2878
02:02:57.050 --> 02:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting really sensitive about </v>

2879
02:03:02.050 --> 02:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>our war and our troops and everything.</v>

2880
02:03:02.050 --> 02:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking like,</v>

2881
02:03:02.050 --> 02:03:03.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just made a joke about murder.</v>

2882
02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figure you're getting really sensitive</v>

2883
02:03:05.841 --> 02:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>about obama just doing a bad job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2884
02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:11.030
<v Speaker 1>That's just a bad joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a ridiculous,</v>

2885
02:03:11.031 --> 02:03:16.031
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to make a joke like that in the </v>

2886
02:03:16.031 --> 02:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>middle of two wars that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>approve and all these things that are </v>

2887
02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:20.780
<v Speaker 1>happening in Pakistan with unmanned </v>
<v Speaker 1>drones,</v>

2888
02:03:20.781 --> 02:03:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should be making jokes</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2889
02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:27.680
<v Speaker 1>It less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking hilarious and that show </v>

2890
02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:27.680
<v Speaker 1>was lame as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>

2891
02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty funny for it when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when the president says,</v>

2892
02:03:29.661 --> 02:03:34.661
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes our president seem </v>

2893
02:03:34.661 --> 02:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>edgy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it seems like he's not playing </v>

2894
02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:38.780
<v Speaker 1>dumb and trying to butter like nerf are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ears.</v>

2895
02:03:38.781 --> 02:03:40.040
<v Speaker 1>He's actually saying something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2896
02:03:40.041 --> 02:03:41.330
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of blue.</v>

2897
02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:42.860
<v Speaker 1>That's kinda crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2898
02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Military the president does now the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the drums.</v>

2899
02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so his joke is not only,</v>

2900
02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not correct as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think they would let hIm </v>

2901
02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>borrow the key so he could kill the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jonas brothers?</v>

2902
02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for trying to </v>

2903
02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2904
02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your,</v>

2905
02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:58.970
<v Speaker 1>like your joke on baby blowjobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying like,</v>

2906
02:03:58.971 --> 02:04:00.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bad to say,</v>

2907
02:04:00.070 --> 02:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people are child molesters and </v>

2908
02:04:05.070 --> 02:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I wasn't,</v>

2909
02:04:05.070 --> 02:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example that you need to use.</v>

2910
02:04:05.070 --> 02:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>If I was a child molester and I was out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there below and babies and then I did a </v>

2911
02:04:09.550 --> 02:04:13.571
<v Speaker 1>joke about baby blow jobs than it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the same as what the president is </v>

2912
02:04:13.571 --> 02:04:17.741
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the president is killing people with </v>

2913
02:04:17.741 --> 02:04:18.200
<v Speaker 1>drones right now while the president is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spokesperson for the country and the</v>

2914
02:04:18.201 --> 02:04:23.201
<v Speaker 1>country is in fact at war and has </v>
<v Speaker 1>military that is killing people with </v>

2915
02:04:23.201 --> 02:04:23.730
<v Speaker 1>drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2916
02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I see it as at the top of the food </v>
<v Speaker 1>chain.</v>

2917
02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I see why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see why you're upset,</v>

2918
02:04:27.081 --> 02:04:28.430
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see it.</v>

2919
02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that you don't see it,</v>

2920
02:04:30.861 --> 02:04:33.240
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand.</v>

2921
02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Here's the open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony were mad too about this.</v>

2922
02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2923
02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:39.930
<v Speaker 3>I think they were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

2924
02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:43.080
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about his jokes bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would just send me that they were,</v>

2925
02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:44.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were open.</v>

2926
02:04:44.970 --> 02:04:48.180
<v Speaker 3>Anthony were set at his delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His delivery was Tyler Norton.</v>

2927
02:04:48.181 --> 02:04:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Norton was going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was run on norton,</v>

2928
02:04:51.631 --> 02:04:54.330
<v Speaker 3>but he's also loves jay leno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2929
02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:57.150
<v Speaker 3>and he was honest in his assessment of </v>
<v Speaker 3>jay leno.</v>

2930
02:04:57.151 --> 02:05:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Jay was like rushing through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was lIke rushing through his joke,</v>

2931
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:05.030
<v Speaker 3>but the jokes were lame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew he had bad jokes and I think he </v>

2932
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.640
<v Speaker 3>thought it was going to be an easy crowd</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he could just squeak by,</v>

2933
02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:06.590
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2934
02:05:06.630 --> 02:05:11.630
<v Speaker 3>but I think he realized when he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that there was some pressure on </v>

2935
02:05:11.630 --> 02:05:14.571
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people don't like him </v>

2936
02:05:14.571 --> 02:05:14.571
<v Speaker 3>now they're poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

2937
02:05:14.571 --> 02:05:14.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's all mad at jake [inaudible].</v>

2938
02:05:14.571 --> 02:05:16.890
<v Speaker 3>He took his job back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why does everybody give a shit?</v>

2939
02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:22.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conan o'brian gets 35 fucking million </v>

2940
02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:22.100
<v Speaker 3>dollars and it gets to go to tbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2941
02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:23.830
<v Speaker 2>That's funny how he straight up lied </v>
<v Speaker 2>though on the,</v>

2942
02:05:23.890 --> 02:05:28.890
<v Speaker 2>on the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are 60 minutes the other day about </v>

2943
02:05:28.890 --> 02:05:29.220
<v Speaker 2>twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice.</v>

2944
02:05:29.221 --> 02:05:32.110
<v Speaker 2>And he said that the reason why he got </v>
<v Speaker 2>fired,</v>

2945
02:05:32.111 --> 02:05:37.111
<v Speaker 2>not lenovo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because his payout or leno's payout was </v>

2946
02:05:37.111 --> 02:05:37.390
<v Speaker 2>more or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they are like,</v>

2947
02:05:37.391 --> 02:05:38.440
<v Speaker 2>nbc is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lie.</v>

2948
02:05:38.710 --> 02:05:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Their payouts were exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also said something like,</v>

2949
02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:42.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he didn't know.</v>

2950
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was just mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2951
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:49.310
<v Speaker 2>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was another thing somebody told </v>

2952
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.310
<v Speaker 2>that by agents or something to something</v>
<v Speaker 2>about nbc losing money.</v>

2953
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:52.300
<v Speaker 2>But what I find odd though is that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>checked ratings the other day.</v>

2954
02:05:52.301 --> 02:05:57.301
<v Speaker 2>Jay leno's ratings and conan's ratings </v>
<v Speaker 2>are almost exactly the same as they </v>

2955
02:05:57.301 --> 02:05:59.110
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were going from year to year from</v>

2956
02:05:59.111 --> 02:06:01.600
<v Speaker 2>last year to this year or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the same.</v>

2957
02:06:01.601 --> 02:06:04.990
<v Speaker 2>So there's no money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no like leno's number one makinG</v>

2958
02:06:04.991 --> 02:06:07.030
<v Speaker 2>$50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollars extra month.</v>

2959
02:06:07.090 --> 02:06:09.130
<v Speaker 2>It's been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was saying he was,</v>

2960
02:06:09.131 --> 02:06:10.200
<v Speaker 2>but maybe before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2961
02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:15.380
<v Speaker 3>for what they're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's eventually going to bring it </v>

2962
02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:16.170
<v Speaker 3>back to where he was beFore that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna take over the reins and,</v>

2963
02:06:16.171 --> 02:06:21.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have it back to where it waS because </v>

2964
02:06:21.171 --> 02:06:21.171
<v Speaker 3>when he left he was number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2965
02:06:21.171 --> 02:06:21.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is this,</v>

2966
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:23.730
<v Speaker 3>a stupid argument is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

2967
02:06:23.731 --> 02:06:25.170
<v Speaker 3>it's just entertainment and not only </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2968
02:06:25.171 --> 02:06:27.420
<v Speaker 3>it's not the best entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If kony had a talk,</v>

2969
02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:29.630
<v Speaker 3>not a talk show rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like a,</v>

2970
02:06:29.631 --> 02:06:30.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sketch show,</v>

2971
02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:36.050
<v Speaker 3>I think that would rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would like to say because </v>

2972
02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:36.630
<v Speaker 3>I think conan's the best parts on conan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was when he does those sketches,</v>

2973
02:06:36.810 --> 02:06:37.610
<v Speaker 3>like when he did those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2974
02:06:37.611 --> 02:06:40.440
<v Speaker 3>the baseball player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 18 hundreds baseball players when he</v>

2975
02:06:40.441 --> 02:06:45.441
<v Speaker 3>went there and played baseball with them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking 1800 speak fucking </v>

2976
02:06:45.441 --> 02:06:48.801
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was way better to me than his </v>

2977
02:06:48.801 --> 02:06:48.801
<v Speaker 3>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these interviews are cool,</v>

2978
02:06:48.801 --> 02:06:49.200
<v Speaker 3>but most of the people that he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2979
02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:50.250
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and apparently advertising executives do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all the time.</v>

3004
02:07:51.190 --> 02:07:56.190
<v Speaker 2>They see comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go to comedy clubs and get an idea </v>

3005
02:07:56.190 --> 02:07:56.190
<v Speaker 2>from their ag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's something,</v>

3006
02:07:56.190 --> 02:07:58.720
<v Speaker 2>here's something weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a movie called miss march.</v>

3007
02:07:58.750 --> 02:08:00.610
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the pli.</v>

3008
02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I was half drunk watching this movie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3009
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:06.840
<v Speaker 2>the chat or it's the craig robinson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that his name?</v>

3010
02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:12.120
<v Speaker 2>He played a character in this movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>called horse cock dot mpeg.</v>

3011
02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:16.110
<v Speaker 2>And the whole time I'm watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they call listens character.</v>

3012
02:08:16.130 --> 02:08:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that whole thing,</v>

3013
02:08:16.961 --> 02:08:18.550
<v Speaker 2>they'll joke was his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that his character.</v>

<v Speaker 2>mpeg.</v>

3015
02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:26.220
<v Speaker 2>And the whole time I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of weird because of your </v>

3016
02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:28.450
<v Speaker 2>horse bit material about being a mr </v>
<v Speaker 2>han's dot mpeg.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>

3018
02:08:30.130 --> 02:08:35.130
<v Speaker 2>But it's weird that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how there's so much similar things like </v>

3019
02:08:35.130 --> 02:08:35.130
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm wondering like,</v>

02:08:35.130 --> 02:08:38.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writers and people in marketing and </v>

<v Speaker 2>commercial and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they really just,</v>

3022
02:08:38.431 --> 02:08:43.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real connection and anybody </v>

3023
02:08:43.050 --> 02:08:43.050
<v Speaker 2>could come over really hotdog mpeg.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a point that was called mr [inaudible] </v>

02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:49.040
<v Speaker 2>dot [inaudible].</v>

3027
02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:49.300

<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3028
02:08:49.301 --> 02:08:50.950
<v Speaker 3>I think that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd absolutely.</v>

3029
02:08:50.951 --> 02:08:52.940
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

3030
02:08:53.070 --> 02:08:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because I've talked about it on </v>

3032
02:08:58.070 --> 02:08:58.070

3034
02:08:58.901 --> 02:09:01.270

<v Speaker 3>funny and he just has the same voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3043
02:09:15.881 --> 02:09:16.790
<v Speaker 3>it's not the voice.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3045

<v Speaker 3>ridiculous to,</v>

3077
02:10:29.901 --> 02:10:31.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3078
02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:34.050
<v Speaker 3>to think that I should not accept a </v>
<v Speaker 3>because somehow</v>

3079
02:10:34.110 --> 02:10:35.960
<v Speaker 5>this is going to hurt my career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's ridiculous.</v>

3080
02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:38.810
<v Speaker 5>But I would like to hear your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Am I allowed to accept it?</v>

3081
02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:39.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can.</v>

3082
02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:41.300
<v Speaker 5>We can split the screen down in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle.</v>

3083
02:10:43.870 --> 02:10:48.680
<v Speaker 5>This is brian's part of this show is </v>
<v Speaker 5>sponsored by fleshlight.</v>

3084
02:10:48.681 --> 02:10:52.640
<v Speaker 5>My side is not hearsay shuchita banana </v>
<v Speaker 5>long and I want to let cbs,</v>

3085

<v Speaker 5>banana on this side flesh.</v>

3087
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:02.270
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3088
02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:04.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do we need back here?</v>

3089
02:11:04.071 --> 02:11:06.340
<v Speaker 5>Do we need a monitor or do we need a </v>
<v Speaker 5>green screen?</v>

3090
02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:09.200
<v Speaker 5>That's the other question is should it </v>
<v Speaker 5>be a monitor or green?</v>

3091
02:11:09.201 --> 02:11:13.600
<v Speaker 5>Sixty inch led 3d dlp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dlm.</v>

3092
02:11:13.601 --> 02:11:15.980
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lcd samsung.</v>

3093
02:11:16.050 --> 02:11:21.050
<v Speaker 3>that when you have people at home would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to watch with goggles on and we </v>

3094
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:21.050
<v Speaker 3>will be blurry and everything else you'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>be in three days.</v>

3095
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3096
02:11:21.310 --> 02:11:23.640
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably wouldn't even work.</v>

3097
02:11:23.641 --> 02:11:25.530
<v Speaker 3>I probably wouldn't transmit through </v>
<v Speaker 3>this little shitty ustream.</v>

3098
02:11:25.590 --> 02:11:26.370
<v Speaker 3>What if it did</v>

3099
02:11:28.650 --> 02:11:30.640
<v Speaker 5>fuck's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3100
02:11:30.670 --> 02:11:32.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a question too.</v>

3101
02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:34.460
<v Speaker 5>Should we do a green screen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say yes.</v>

3102
02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:35.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3103
02:11:35.751 --> 02:11:37.970
<v Speaker 5>it would be dope if we have an image of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Space behind us.</v>

3104
02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:39.320
<v Speaker 5>That's the move,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3105
02:11:39.330 --> 02:11:44.330
<v Speaker 5>You have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently we can't do that with this </v>

3106
02:11:44.330 --> 02:11:45.140
<v Speaker 5>stream producer though when I'm worried </v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

3107
02:11:45.141 --> 02:11:46.360
<v Speaker 5>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

3108
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.650
<v Speaker 5>ustream producers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only way we can get this thing up on</v>

3109
02:11:48.651 --> 02:11:53.651
<v Speaker 5>itunes or we're just using the eastern </v>
<v Speaker 5>producer to take the signal out to the </v>

3110
02:11:53.651 --> 02:11:58.121
<v Speaker 5>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we'll plug this into your computer </v>

3111
02:11:58.121 --> 02:11:58.121
<v Speaker 5>and it'll be an input on eastern </v>
<v Speaker 5>producer.</v>

3112
02:11:58.121 --> 02:11:59.210
<v Speaker 5>So we'll still be able to use.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should produce or.</v>

3113
02:11:59.220 --> 02:11:59.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should.</v>

3114
02:11:59.901 --> 02:12:04.901
<v Speaker 5>You know how this thing works for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can try castor figured out in five </v>

3115
02:12:04.901 --> 02:12:05.810
<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how easy it was.</v>

3116
02:12:05.850 --> 02:12:10.850
<v Speaker 3>God damn genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without him we would be doing the same </v>

3117
02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:15.021
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would suck more and probably the </v>

3118
02:12:15.021 --> 02:12:15.021
<v Speaker 3>sound would be going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>

3119
02:12:15.021 --> 02:12:15.021
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Green screen.</v>

3120
02:12:15.021 --> 02:12:19.581
<v Speaker 3>Most people think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what we're going to go </v>

3121
02:12:19.581 --> 02:12:19.581
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
