<v Speaker 1>I had to get around.</v>

30
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.090
<v Speaker 1>We didn't bring out that orange where </v>
<v Speaker 1>that blueberry orange from 2005 and not </v>

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>It was the best shit back in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

33
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.130
<v Speaker 1>it was before train wreck when I first </v>
<v Speaker 1>started buying weed before we had a,</v>

34
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we had licenses,</v>

35
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I would always buy mass quantities </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want to have to deal </v>

36
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 1>with those dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always had just laying around.</v>

37
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was incredible.</v>

38
00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This marijuana and there's a lot of </v>

39
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.030
<v Speaker 1>controversy behind it and I'm not given </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

40
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid topic.</v>

41
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>

42
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.690
<v Speaker 1>care about what other people are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is always the same tired ass fucking</v>

43
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:20.021
<v Speaker 1>argument about what about children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're setting an example to the </v>

44
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:20.660
<v Speaker 1>children to what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To what?</v>

45
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:23.720
<v Speaker 1>To eventually be a person who's an adult</v>
<v Speaker 1>who enjoys marijuana.</v>

46
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>That's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is real life.</v>

47
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Like why are we have to pretend that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that to hide that and you,</v>

48
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.751
<v Speaker 1>you parent your fucking kids and don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>let them do anything until they're in </v>

49
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:38.531
<v Speaker 1>their twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think kids should be getting </v>

50
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:38.531
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you barely can keep your fucking</v>

51
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:41.480
<v Speaker 1>shit together as a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it is emotionally,</v>

52
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:43.780
<v Speaker 1>psychologically to get drunk on top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

53
00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

54
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I know you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a terrible idea.</v>

55
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.770
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to be honest with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

56
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 1>I would say don't get drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get high,</v>

57
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 1>don't do shit while you're developing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beat.</v>

58
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Become uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man first.</v>

59
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

60
00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>people ask me why I'm so vocal about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I'm about it is</v>

61
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.130
<v Speaker 2>because I can get thrown in jail for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to be vocal about it until </v>

62
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 2>there's absolutely no possibility that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get thrown in jail.</v>

63
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 2>And this is for the kids too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking making a stand here.</v>

64
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 2>You are making a stand here in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

65
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 2>By the time the kids are 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

66
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it will be legal.</v>

67
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.910
<v Speaker 2>So we're doing this for the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

68
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of Coca Cola.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love coke,</v>

69
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.540
<v Speaker 2>but I never talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it was illegal it was illegal to </v>

70
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.980
<v Speaker 2>drink soda and you can get thrown in </v>
<v Speaker 2>jail for it.</v>

71
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I'd be talking about it every goddamned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

72
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm drinking this fucking soda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be videotaping me drinking soda.</v>

73
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we being thrown in jail?</v>

74
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a productive guy drinking coke.</v>

75
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's legal.</v>

76
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when weed is legal 100 percent all </v>

77
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 2>the way through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

78
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch.</v>

79
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to shut up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

80
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a positive thing and that's what </v>

81
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 3>people aren't willing to accept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many people want to think that it's a</v>

82
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:02.521
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just shows a negative image or it </v>

83
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 3>sends a negative message that you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to get through your life with,</v>

84
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 3>and that's not what anybody is saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need it.</v>

85
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 3>You don't need it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's good.</v>

86
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 3>It's that sense.</v>

87
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.170
<v Speaker 2>It's the wonder drug for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like instead of taking tylenol off,</v>

88
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:18.171
<v Speaker 2>smoke some weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of doing this weed is so safe </v>

89
00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:21.810
<v Speaker 2>that if you smoke too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might call the cops on yourself.</v>

90
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.310
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to call the cops on </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

91
00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:25.190
<v Speaker 2>If you do a lot of heroin or you get too</v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk,</v>

92
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.440
<v Speaker 2>imagine getting too drunk and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling the cops on yourself on weed.</v>

93
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.450
<v Speaker 2>You'll call the cops on yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

94
00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

95
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weed is the safest of all of them and </v>

96
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 3>it's the most introspective evolve them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

97
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.020
<v Speaker 3>alcohol doesn't make an introspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you an asshole,</v>

98
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.470
<v Speaker 3>but weed makes you like sensitive about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that you're saying.</v>

99
00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:46.160
<v Speaker 3>It makes you more aware of when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>being socially awkward.</v>

100
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel the sting of,</v>

101
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird shit coming out of your mouth.</v>

102
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Whereas when you're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't give a fuck,</v>

103
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 3>it just comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just pours out.</v>

104
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

105
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.170
<v Speaker 3>it's an amazing thing that so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people believe different and yeah,</v>

106
00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:04.070
<v Speaker 3>it could fuck up your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people that didn't smoke pot and</v>

107
00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:05.930
<v Speaker 3>become losers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>

108
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.200
<v Speaker 3>They would have been losers anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it is.</v>

109
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 3>And it's like what you're saying is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lazy people with no ambition who aren't </v>

110
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.410
<v Speaker 3>that bright pop gets a hold of them.</v>

111
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.360
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna make it's gonna fuck up their</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

112
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their life has already fucked up.</v>

113
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 3>If you let you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come to certain roadblocks or </v>

114
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.961
<v Speaker 3>certain things in your life where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to sort of make decisions about </v>

115
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:32.771
<v Speaker 3>your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you sort of have to reassess </v>

116
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:34.691
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you can't get through the weed </v>

117
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:38.040
<v Speaker 3>hurdle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really how the fuck are you going to </v>

118
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.560
<v Speaker 3>deal with the real world if you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get through the hurdle of weed?</v>

119
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Because weed to me is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is when I smoke pot.</v>

120
00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can say a lot of silly shit and I know</v>

121
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.770
<v Speaker 3>you get weird and started talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe,</v>

122
00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:52.820
<v Speaker 3>but what it is to me is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that's bullshit,</v>

123
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
<v Speaker 3>anything that's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that's blatantly misleading </v>

124
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>when you're high</v>

125
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 4>is just glaring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like acting is glaring.</v>

126
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 4>If you go to see a movie high and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're bad actors,</v>

127
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.120
<v Speaker 4>it's gold layering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you watch a political speech when </v>

128
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 4>you're high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's glaring.</v>

129
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 4>You feel the bullshit where you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I listening to?</v>

130
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 4>It's offensive to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have the wrong impression,</v>

131
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:21.450
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's.</v>

132
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 4>It's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is a shame.</v>

133
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 4>It's not that everyone should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to do it,</v>

134
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.810
<v Speaker 4>but you shouldn't be upset if someone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling you an honest interpretation of </v>

135
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 4>the positive experiences they have on it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people will go,</v>

136
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

137
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 4>what do you always have to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking annoying.</v>

138
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys ever fucking talk about his </v>

139
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 4>week because there's still people out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there that are arguing against it.</v>

140
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 4>There's still people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get it.</v>

141
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.210
<v Speaker 4>It's a personal choice issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a human being and it's the most </v>

142
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 4>Republican of all ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stay the fuck out of my private life.</v>

143
00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.150
<v Speaker 4>Stay the fuck out of my personal life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get,</v>

144
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 4>let government get too big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

145
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:07.121
<v Speaker 4>this is exactly what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is only something that's being </v>

146
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:10.210
<v Speaker 4>pushed into illegality by gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 4>corporations is the only way in this day</v>

147
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 4>and age that it would still be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

148
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 4>there's resistance because people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>making money with it being illegal.</v>

149
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 4>It's that simple.</v>

150
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.950
<v Speaker 2>And when you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the,</v>

151
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.910
<v Speaker 2>like the movie reefer madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was made back in the thirties.</v>

152
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:29.911
<v Speaker 2>It was produced by the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at that and you see </v>

153
00:07:29.911 --> 00:07:32.470
<v Speaker 2>where it all came from and all came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the beginning</v>

154
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.430
<v Speaker 4>was actually made by alcohol companies </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the beginning,</v>

155
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.690
<v Speaker 4>in the beginning.</v>

156
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

157
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.440
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to scare everybody by saying </v>

158
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.310
<v Speaker 2>that we'd major kill and major crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll jump out of windows.</v>

159
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.010
<v Speaker 2>You'll kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made lots of movies.</v>

160
00:07:48.011 --> 00:07:49.930
<v Speaker 2>They made a whole bunch of them in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties.</v>

161
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.220
<v Speaker 2>That was the reefer madness propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It worked.</v>

162
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Any negative negative thought you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>about weed,</v>

163
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.210
<v Speaker 2>it stems from that propaganda from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties.</v>

164
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.820
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a conspiracy theory.</v>

165
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:07.000
<v Speaker 2>There's many movies out there that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could watch.</v>

166
00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 2>You could watch them on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it started.</v>

167
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they don't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 2>you go crazy and you jump out of windows</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you kill people and all that shit </v>

169
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.431
<v Speaker 2>anymore is because people got hip to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believed in the thirties and the </v>

170
00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:20.431
<v Speaker 2>forties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

171
00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:20.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were,</v>

172
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 2>were smoking weed in the fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties.</v>

173
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:23.860
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not making me crazy.</v>

174
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.860
<v Speaker 2>This is actually pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had to change their stance </v>

175
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.321
<v Speaker 2>slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It evolved from weed kills you to weed </v>

176
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.880
<v Speaker 2>makes you worthless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:35.180
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all because you know,</v>

178
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.200
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of examples because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of potheads who are </v>

179
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:40.200
<v Speaker 2>worthless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just worthless people.</v>

180
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.190
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just focus on that.</v>

181
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Any negative thought you have for weed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and marijuana?</v>

182
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.150
<v Speaker 2>It's because you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all been brainwashed.</v>

183
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I used to be the biggest weed hater ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I was 28 my whole life.</v>

184
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't stand potheads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made me sick.</v>

185
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.360
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those guys on the underground were </v>

186
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:02.360
<v Speaker 2>writing all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have been doing that.</v>

187
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I would have been doing the same fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

188
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:09.081
<v Speaker 2>I was annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every band I was in had one or two </v>

189
00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 2>potheads they fuck up on stage or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck up rehearsing.</v>

190
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I would blame the wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

191
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:12.630
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotTa fucking high.</v>

192
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.150
<v Speaker 2>You fucking smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't play bass and smoke weed.</v>

193
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I was so clueless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any idea because every now</v>

194
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:21.770
<v Speaker 2>and then I get talked into smoking weed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in high.</v>

195
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.480
<v Speaker 2>There was an high school moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a moment and when I was 23,</v>

196
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 2>24,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that where I freaked the fuck out.</v>

197
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:30.440
<v Speaker 2>I got all paranoid and I freaked out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated it.</v>

198
00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:35.441
<v Speaker 2>And Weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens when you're high is it's </v>

199
00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.930
<v Speaker 2>like a roaring river of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just flooded into your brain.</v>

200
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't want to ride those </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild rapids.</v>

201
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

202
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll stay in the tent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people like it's wide,</v>

203
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:49.010
<v Speaker 2>ride that wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rapid and just absorb that energy and </v>

204
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.010
<v Speaker 2>use it to benefit yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>

205
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get paranoid,</v>

206
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 2>I still get paranoid every now and then.</v>

207
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then that fucking roaring </v>
<v Speaker 2>river.</v>

208
00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

209
00:09:56.281 --> 00:09:57.330
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to.</v>

210
00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's all like the paranoia and you </v>

211
00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:08.081
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling Irie two opposite ends of the </v>

212
00:10:08.081 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all up to you with the weed.</v>

213
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 2>If you smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can get paranoid.</v>

214
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:12.690
<v Speaker 2>If you can't handle all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

215
00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:15.120
<v Speaker 2>you want to suppress a lot of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get high.</v>

216
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got a lot of crazy stressful </v>

217
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 2>things on your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are making you nervous.</v>

218
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:24.261
<v Speaker 2>You got to talk to some people but you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to say you might get </v>

219
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:24.261
<v Speaker 2>fired from your job or your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife's,</v>

220
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:28.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be cheating on your whatever </v>

221
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:29.070
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you smoke weed,</v>

222
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Focus on that.</v>

223
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:30.580
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

224
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.600
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recommend that you start smoking weed </v>

225
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 2>around 28,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30.</v>

226
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I never recommend we do kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never do.</v>

227
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it's best if you're fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed,</v>

228
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 2>you know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what kind of person you are.</v>

229
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lifetime of art.</v>

230
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 2>And then at 28 you see how your art </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes every whatever art you do,</v>

231
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.590
<v Speaker 2>it'll change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'll appreciate it.</v>

232
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.850
<v Speaker 2>The later you wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say wait till 30.</v>

233
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Jack Herrera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest hip activists out there,</v>

234
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 2>started smoking weed when he was 35.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was totally anti.</v>

235
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 2>We'd just like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like Joe.</v>

236
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Joe Hated potheads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were all just like you all those guys</v>

237
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:12.771
<v Speaker 2>that think that are fucking throwing up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their mouth right now and they're </v>

238
00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:13.230
<v Speaker 2>sick of me and joe talking all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those guys,</v>

239
00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:15.280
<v Speaker 2>we were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you smart motherfuckers,</v>

240
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 2>you guys are smart.</v>

241
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.250
<v Speaker 2>But that we were brainwashed by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucking government.</v>

242
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 2>We were brainwashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really simple.</v>

243
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 2>So you should be happy that we're trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell you the truth.</v>

244
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Don't deny the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're telling you the truth man.</v>

245
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.110
<v Speaker 2>And it's not some crazy alien </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>

246
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.490
<v Speaker 2>This is some real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

247
00:11:33.491 --> 00:11:37.170
<v Speaker 2>it's only our subjective truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your truth is different than my truth</v>

248
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:39.400
<v Speaker 2>of you do part and you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Stan hopes,</v>

249
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 2>townhome just doesn't like wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like it.</v>

250
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.620
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like the feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fine,</v>

251
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's forcing you to do it.</v>

252
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real problem is when people were </v>

253
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.660
<v Speaker 2>upset at other people doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't affect them,</v>

254
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.120
<v Speaker 2>but they get upset at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

255
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see that</v>

256
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 3>possible potential weakness in </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

257
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 3>And so they lash out at it when they see</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in someone else.</v>

258
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 3>I really think that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

259
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:04.070
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're scared themselves that it's a,</v>

260
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 3>it's their future that they could get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get hooked on a drug too.</v>

261
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I look at it.</v>

262
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of cool it at talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms.</v>

263
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 5>Mushrooms was on a cartoon the other day</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a,</v>

264
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 5>a family guy like Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>9:00,</v>

265
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.950
<v Speaker 5>8:30,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they add,</v>

266
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:25.951
<v Speaker 5>Brian found a bag of mushrooms and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>showed the mushrooms that looked like </v>

267
00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:25.951
<v Speaker 5>the mushrooms and any aid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

268
00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:29.220
<v Speaker 5>and went onto this huge mushroom trip </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the whole episode was about Brian,</v>

269
00:12:29.221 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 5>like showrooming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the majority of it.</v>

270
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 5>And it was kind of interesting to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

271
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 5>that actually they had that on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a regular show on TV.</v>

272
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:41.791
<v Speaker 5>That was that the first time that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that may maybe like a primetime show </v>

273
00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:43.160
<v Speaker 5>actually dealt with mushrooms as well.</v>

274
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Simpsons the homer Simpson went into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chili cook off and eat.</v>

275
00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.630
<v Speaker 5>So that was always kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was always kind of like,</v>

276
00:12:50.631 --> 00:12:52.040
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like mushrooms,</v>

277
00:12:52.041 --> 00:12:53.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't like him eating a mushroom.</v>

278
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.360
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it,</v>

279
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 3>it was some sort of psychedelic pepper </v>
<v Speaker 3>member.</v>

280
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:03.410
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pepper is made him have these crazy </v>

281
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:03.410
<v Speaker 3>trips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the most awesome Simpson's ever.</v>

282
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they've done that before.</v>

283
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.450
<v Speaker 5>You would love this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

284
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:07.760
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't really look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make mushrooms look great.</v>

285
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.560
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not what I see when I,</v>

286
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.670
<v Speaker 5>when I share my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my Sherman's,</v>

287
00:13:10.671 --> 00:13:12.730
<v Speaker 5>but it's definitely fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While showrooming,</v>

288
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.130
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

289
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.930
<v Speaker 3>there's a new study on mushrooms that </v>
<v Speaker 3>magic mushrooms make you a better person</v>

290
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.530
<v Speaker 3>and it stays with you for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like shrugging.</v>

291
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.780
<v Speaker 3>So the thing is John Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

292
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:30.250
<v Speaker 3>researchers led by [inaudible] mccleon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a postdoctoral student at John Hopkins </v>

293
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.880
<v Speaker 3>University analyzed personality data on </v>
<v Speaker 3>52 participants,</v>

294
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.120
<v Speaker 3>average age of 46 years old who had </v>
<v Speaker 3>participated in the groups earlier </v>

295
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.991
<v Speaker 3>research on the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These volunteers took siliciden during </v>

296
00:13:42.991 --> 00:13:46.170
<v Speaker 3>to five two to five sessions at various </v>
<v Speaker 3>doses under highly controlled conditions</v>

297
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:51.181
<v Speaker 3>at the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were also given personality tests </v>

298
00:13:51.181 --> 00:13:54.480
<v Speaker 3>before the taking psilocybin and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple months after each drug session </v>

299
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.520
<v Speaker 3>and then again about a year later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what they're saying is that all </v>

300
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.971
<v Speaker 3>these people have all said that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns you into a better person that's</v>

301
00:14:04.271 --> 00:14:09.271
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had a positive effect on their </v>

302
00:14:09.271 --> 00:14:09.271
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about,</v>

303
00:14:09.271 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 3>think about some people went unchanged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It said,</v>

304
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

305
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 3>think about</v>

306
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 2>the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

307
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.100
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

308
00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:20.320
<v Speaker 2>you guys are just using the medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

309
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Just isn't as an excuse to smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

310
00:14:22.901 --> 00:14:23.890
<v Speaker 2>you guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

311
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.190
<v Speaker 2>faking your ailments just to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana card.</v>

312
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are dumb dumb.</v>

313
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.890
<v Speaker 2>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to go through the medical thing.</v>

314
00:14:32.891 --> 00:14:37.891
<v Speaker 2>This is the process of making it legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately there won't be a medical </v>

315
00:14:37.891 --> 00:14:37.950
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>

316
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Just going to be really faking it though</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not faking it.</v>

317
00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I smoke weed for exactly what I tell a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of things.</v>

318
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:48.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying there are a lot of people </v>

319
00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:48.871
<v Speaker 2>would say that would just fake or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

320
00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying yes,</v>

321
00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 2>we have get through the medical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a baby steps.</v>

322
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately it won't be medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>

323
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.030
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to be adult use because </v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's not.</v>

324
00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a neutral.</v>

325
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.180
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a vitamin.</v>

326
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 2>It's better than a vitamin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually cures diseases.</v>

327
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.440
<v Speaker 2>It's better than just a vitamin or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein.</v>

328
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

329
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

330
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it relieves glaucoma for instance,</v>

331
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.620
<v Speaker 2>and now they're finding so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many studies of,</v>

332
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:21.130
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

333
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:26.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reducing cancerous tumors and all that </v>

334
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:26.460
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vitamins don't do this.</v>

335
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.240
<v Speaker 2>This is a magic herb with no side </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>

336
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 2>There's no side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever died from it.</v>

337
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Why are you so worried about your kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it?</v>

338
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

339
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

340
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I have a son coming and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell them the truth.</v>

341
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:44.321
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to lie to Mama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell him the truth about weed and I'm </v>

342
00:15:44.321 --> 00:15:45.520
<v Speaker 2>going to tell him that he should not </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke until he's 28 to 30.</v>

343
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.620
<v Speaker 5>Why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would you want him to wait so long </v>

344
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.801
<v Speaker 5>now so that he could appreciate it more?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of young until I was 15 </v>

345
00:15:52.801 --> 00:15:54.230
<v Speaker 5>and I appreciate the fuck out of every </v>
<v Speaker 5>time I smoke it.</v>

346
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.150
<v Speaker 5>Not everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are some people,</v>

347
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 5>and I've mentioned the best examples.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

348
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:00.160
<v Speaker 5>I would think like the older you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

349
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I get older,</v>

350
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.400
<v Speaker 5>I've noticed I'm more concerned about my</v>
<v Speaker 5>health because your health starts to go </v>

351
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:06.400
<v Speaker 5>when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're getting old.</v>

352
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.150
<v Speaker 5>I think if I were to start smoking weed </v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was 30,</v>

353
00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:10.430
<v Speaker 5>I would even be more freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You say this,</v>

354
00:16:10.431 --> 00:16:13.250
<v Speaker 5>but yet how do you smoke weed and smoke </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes at the same time?</v>

355
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 5>Because I got to think that if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>do it on the same time,</v>

356
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:17.720
<v Speaker 5>I had one in each hand and I just go </v>
<v Speaker 5>from back and forth.</v>

357
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 5>I would think that if I was smoking weed</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was also smoking cigarettes,</v>

358
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:26.530
<v Speaker 5>the fact that I was smoking cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 5>would start to freak me out so bad that </v>

359
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.520
<v Speaker 5>I would quit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would realize how ridiculous it is and</v>

360
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 5>how crazy and terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all know it's ridiculous and terrible</v>

361
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:33.700
<v Speaker 5>and horrible for your body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're also addicted to it.</v>

362
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.920
<v Speaker 5>It's like any other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you just carry around a </v>

363
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:38.920
<v Speaker 5>packet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>joints and just smoked joints all day?</v>

364
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 5>Because I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

365
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like Joey Diaz style.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to smoke one or two hits and they</v>

366
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.130
<v Speaker 5>go do something and then later I'll take</v>
<v Speaker 5>one or two hits.</v>

367
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:47.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like I am as well and this whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking joint.</v>

368
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:50.390
<v Speaker 5>If you raise your tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a panel wants to,</v>

369
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.300
<v Speaker 5>you can get to the habit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like being in a cloud.</v>

370
00:16:53.301 --> 00:16:55.180
<v Speaker 5>We'd instead of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like being.</v>

371
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't like being in a cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd cloud you mean?</v>

372
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

373
00:16:58.611 --> 00:17:00.230
<v Speaker 5>You can get definitely getting a weed </v>
<v Speaker 5>cloud,</v>

374
00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:02.030
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're one of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>wakened biggers,</v>

375
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can.</v>

376
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.370
<v Speaker 2>My best of your health's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Point Brian was,</v>

377
00:17:06.371 --> 00:17:11.371
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying some people that have been </v>

378
00:17:11.371 --> 00:17:12.040
<v Speaker 2>smoking since they were like 11 or 12 or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

379
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:17.020
<v Speaker 2>I know some serious artists are super </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative and uh,</v>

380
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.280
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell me,</v>

381
00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I think you're giving them too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

382
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just chills me out.</v>

383
00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 2>They smoke weed all day every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing artists like will,</v>

384
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.710
<v Speaker 2>they just chills me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

385
00:17:26.711 --> 00:17:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at your gallery,</v>

386
00:17:28.361 --> 00:17:33.361
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the one of the most creative </v>

387
00:17:33.361 --> 00:17:33.361
<v Speaker 2>molly's doing sculptures and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the weed has.</v>

388
00:17:33.361 --> 00:17:38.160
<v Speaker 2>And it was hard for him to see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was always artistic and he </v>

389
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.791
<v Speaker 2>always smoked weed so he couldn't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference if he weren't a smoked </v>

390
00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:45.391
<v Speaker 2>weed and did all this artistic stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will still been a great artist I'm </v>

391
00:17:45.391 --> 00:17:45.490
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that would have been a difference in</v>

392
00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:50.491
<v Speaker 2>the art if you would have been an artist</v>
<v Speaker 2>until he was 28 and then started is art </v>

393
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 2>would have definitely changed.</v>

394
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.140
<v Speaker 2>And what I'm saying is I would be way </v>
<v Speaker 2>more concerned about my kid being an </v>

395
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.820
<v Speaker 2>alcoholic or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting addicted to coke or something.</v>

396
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people die from,</v>

397
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

398
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't want my kids smoking weed at 13 </v>
<v Speaker 2>or 14,</v>

399
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 2>but worst case scenario he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does start smoking weed.</v>

400
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:14.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to trip out on it.</v>

401
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

406
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.390

<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

407
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Watch,</v>

<v Speaker 6>problem.</v>

00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:10.450
<v Speaker 6>You chose right here Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to.</v>

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 6>Do you want to just be the podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I even tried to talk some sense for Joe </v>

425
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 6>Hogan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's at least I can drop the bad guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

427
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.320
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to cut you off man.</v>

428
00:19:23.321 --> 00:19:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Joe Doesn't want to talk to you.</v>

429
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know</v>

430
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just turn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the most inside of inside jokes.</v>

431
00:19:33.311 --> 00:19:38.311
<v Speaker 1>That 99 percent of the people listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>to podcasts will not have any idea what </v>

432
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:38.311
<v Speaker 1>the fuck that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

433
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.950
<v Speaker 5>apple releases the iphone four s today </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's not the five,</v>

434
00:19:41.951 --> 00:19:45.160
<v Speaker 5>whichever one's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but remember the three gs when the three</v>

435
00:19:45.161 --> 00:19:50.161
<v Speaker 5>g went to the three gs and that whisk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a real iphone and I think </v>

436
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:53.850
<v Speaker 5>that's what they're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think there's going to be a five </v>

437
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.310
<v Speaker 5>maybe around June or so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this s isn't that bad.</v>

438
00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.590
<v Speaker 5>The cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just taking a wild guess.</v>

439
00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.250
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah and that's definitely a guest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean they did it before,</v>

440
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the three gs was not.</v>

441
00:20:01.691 --> 00:20:03.970
<v Speaker 5>It was a mild upgrade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they never caught it.</v>

442
00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:05.500
<v Speaker 5>The Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the three gs added.</v>

443
00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.980
<v Speaker 5>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even remember like a better </v>

444
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:10.980
<v Speaker 5>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So many rumors about this.</v>

445
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.650
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

446
00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:12.910
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always feel so.</v>

447
00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:17.911
<v Speaker 5>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my life revolves around fucking being </v>

448
00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:18.670
<v Speaker 5>really into the next phone that comes </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There's a new intelligent assistant that</v>

<v Speaker 5>which is a thing that you push and you </v>

453
00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:27.621

<v Speaker 5>you can be like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And just say yes and then we'll schedule</v>

<v Speaker 5>And be like the weather,</v>

459
00:20:39.381 --> 00:20:44.381
<v Speaker 5>the weather's this and it's like they </v>
<v Speaker 5>showed a bunch of examples and you can </v>

460
00:20:44.381 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 5>see examples on apple.com</v>
<v Speaker 5>or any of the websites that can gadget </v>

461
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 5>Gizmodo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it seems legit.</v>

462
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.460
<v Speaker 5>You can even say like call Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the android stuff too.</v>

463
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 5>It's called Siri S.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's how it's spelled.</v>

464
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 5>It's like an assist.</v>

465
00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

466
00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:03.751
<v Speaker 5>And it's pretty much the first step into</v>
<v Speaker 5>having no interaction with having to </v>

467
00:21:03.751 --> 00:21:07.891
<v Speaker 5>touch your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this looks like maybe in five years </v>

468
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be texting by voice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be calling,</v>

469
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to.</v>

470
00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 5>I would say this is a pretty good step.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say it's 100 percent there </v>

471
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't think you're,</v>

472
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.490
<v Speaker 5>you're still gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Use your google voice,</v>

473
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.730
<v Speaker 5>the Google Google for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

474
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.920
<v Speaker 5>use your voice and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

475
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 5>10th Planet Jiu Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just use that as a surge boom.</v>

476
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.560
<v Speaker 5>And it instantly pulls up all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's really accurate,</v>

477
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.050
<v Speaker 5>like the way it picks up the things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're saying,</v>

478
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:37.051
<v Speaker 5>it's super.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing that they showed today looks </v>

479
00:21:37.051 --> 00:21:39.870
<v Speaker 5>even more amazing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they also announced something that </v>

480
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.661
<v Speaker 5>we talked about earlier about an idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had since I was a kid and now they </v>

481
00:21:42.661 --> 00:21:43.000
<v Speaker 5>have it as a feature on the phone and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

482
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:44.170
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should I,</v>

483
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.990
<v Speaker 5>it's they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what it's called,</v>

484
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 5>but mine was called snail mail where it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

485
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:49.920
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you remember,</v>

486
00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:55.050
<v Speaker 5>you would write an email to this company</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the company would write it out and </v>

487
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:55.960
<v Speaker 5>hand form and then send it to somebody.</v>

488
00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.960
<v Speaker 5>And I originally said I thought of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea because I wanted when my </v>

489
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.931
<v Speaker 5>grandmother was still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to be able to email my </v>

490
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:03.931
<v Speaker 5>grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then have somebody hand write it and</v>

491
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:08.621
<v Speaker 5>then send it to my grandmother.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well now they just announced it on this </v>

492
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:10.210
<v Speaker 5>new iphone that it's a feature and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>forget what they call it,</v>

493
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.510
<v Speaker 5>but that's one of the new features.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's like it's a real person hand </v>

494
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 5>writes it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's either a handwriting.</v>

495
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:21.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they do it by person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet it's a printer that looks like </v>

496
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:21.690
<v Speaker 5>handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably what they do.</v>

497
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.070
<v Speaker 5>But that's what the whole thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's two $99 per letter.</v>

498
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 5>But that's kind of funny that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

499
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:31.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should have fucking copyrighted that </v>

500
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.690
<v Speaker 5>alongside Chinese people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all I'm thinking.</v>

501
00:22:31.691 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking the shops sweatshops people</v>
<v Speaker 5>copying people's signatures.</v>

502
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shit would be horrendous if you </v>

503
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.751
<v Speaker 5>found out that that was true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't imagine that there's really a </v>

504
00:22:42.751 --> 00:22:42.751
<v Speaker 5>business for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

505
00:22:42.751 --> 00:22:47.431
<v Speaker 5>you did come up with that a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A long time ago and the camera looks </v>

506
00:22:47.431 --> 00:22:50.551
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they're using a whole new lens </v>

507
00:22:50.551 --> 00:22:52.351
<v Speaker 5>system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is making an eight megapixel and </v>

508
00:22:52.351 --> 00:22:53.040
<v Speaker 5>hd is 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>80 p I believe is what they should phone</v>

509
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.150
<v Speaker 5>the same phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to get a new phone,</v>

510
00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.900
<v Speaker 5>you got to get a new phone for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>opera,</v>

511
00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.350
<v Speaker 5>for ss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a new phone.</v>

512
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:04.410
<v Speaker 5>It's got.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also got a dual processor now they </v>

513
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:04.410
<v Speaker 5>switched to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're a five chip,</v>

514
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:05.440
<v Speaker 5>so now it's supposed supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>really fast.</v>

515
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.200
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a slight upgrade in some ways like</v>

516
00:23:08.201 --> 00:23:09.760
<v Speaker 5>the screens nine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any difference,</v>

517
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:11.560
<v Speaker 5>but there is a lot of stuff under the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hood.</v>

518
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.730
<v Speaker 5>Did they improve upon going from apps </v>
<v Speaker 5>back to your texting and sometimes </v>

519
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.230
<v Speaker 5>you're just looking at a white screen </v>
<v Speaker 5>for 20 seconds on your phone?</v>

520
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.020
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

521
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.330
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you,</v>

522
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.710
<v Speaker 5>have you cracked your friend before?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a new phone.</v>

523
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.980
<v Speaker 5>I kept dropping on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going from,</v>

524
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 5>going from like twitter to my texting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going back to the texting.</v>

525
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
<v Speaker 5>You just got to sit there and it takes </v>
<v Speaker 5>forever to cancel out the running </v>

526
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.430
<v Speaker 5>programs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how to do that?</v>

527
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.450
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

528
00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:41.680
<v Speaker 5>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

529
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.540
<v Speaker 5>You got to cancel out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're running programs,</v>

530
00:23:43.541 --> 00:23:45.220
<v Speaker 5>it's like a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really stupid,</v>

531
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 5>it's a stupid</v>

532
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.830
<v Speaker 3>fucking design,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you press that home button,</v>

533
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 3>the button on your screen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to press it twice and when it</v>

534
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:57.071
<v Speaker 3>does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of icons show up in the bottom </v>

535
00:23:57.071 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 3>of the screen and you've got to manually</v>
<v Speaker 3>go through press one of them,</v>

536
00:23:57.621 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Speaker 3>you hold it and it gives you the option </v>
<v Speaker 3>to delete it and then you go through all</v>

537
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:05.801
<v Speaker 3>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deleting all of them and all you're </v>

538
00:24:05.801 --> 00:24:05.801
<v Speaker 3>doing is shutting them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the stupidest thing ever.</v>

539
00:24:05.801 --> 00:24:08.370
<v Speaker 3>Is one of apple's dumbest clumsy as </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

540
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.440
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you're gonna have to worry</v>

541
00:24:10.441 --> 00:24:15.441
<v Speaker 5>about it too much anymore because this </v>
<v Speaker 5>process is two times faster now in the </v>

542
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:19.311
<v Speaker 5>graphics are seven times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still the fact that all these </v>

543
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:21.840
<v Speaker 5>applications stay open and running in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the background is only running the first</v>

544
00:24:21.841 --> 00:24:23.910
<v Speaker 5>four.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They might show all of it running,</v>

545
00:24:23.911 --> 00:24:28.911
<v Speaker 5>but the supposedly none of those other </v>
<v Speaker 5>programs are running except the first </v>

546
00:24:28.911 --> 00:24:30.330
<v Speaker 5>four and then that even that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cameras,</v>

547
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.310
<v Speaker 5>the camera though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>33 percent more light.</v>

548
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.200
<v Speaker 5>Like why isn't it when you shut it off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's off because it's,</v>

549
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.280
<v Speaker 5>it's called multitasking so you can go </v>
<v Speaker 5>through it back and forth it and now </v>

550
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:41.280
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

551
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.730
<v Speaker 5>it's so it keeps a program running,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but only supposedly I thought only kept </v>

552
00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:46.950
<v Speaker 5>the first for it might show all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other programs,</v>

553
00:24:46.951 --> 00:24:48.770
<v Speaker 5>but it's only actually using the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ford.</v>

554
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.280
<v Speaker 5>That's cool though because I have</v>

555
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:55.310
<v Speaker 3>had to tweet something and somebody sent</v>
<v Speaker 3>me a text and then a copy and the text </v>

556
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.780
<v Speaker 3>and then go right back to tweet and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing the same page.</v>

557
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:02.080
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which wouldn't be if I had to close it </v>

558
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:02.080
<v Speaker 3>and open it.</v>

559
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:02.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's huge.</v>

560
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 5>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

561
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:07.631
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is going back like you're </v>

562
00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:11.111
<v Speaker 5>gonna have to before you go to texting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gonna have to shut off everything </v>

563
00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:13.991
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably even slower than just </v>

564
00:25:13.991 --> 00:25:13.991
<v Speaker 5>hitting the Teks and waiting for like 20</v>
<v Speaker 5>seconds.</v>

565
00:25:13.991 --> 00:25:16.190
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they need to work on that because</v>

566
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 5>that's a big fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would she say?</v>

567
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.940
<v Speaker 5>What did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was that again?</v>

568
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.420
<v Speaker 5>So you got to turn off these programs so</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you don't get that delay going back</v>

569
00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 5>to the text.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

570
00:25:24.171 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

571
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:24.850
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

572
00:25:24.851 --> 00:25:25.250
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

573
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:30.460
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the process or a thing for the </v>

574
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.011
<v Speaker 5>most part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you can be running for intensive </v>

575
00:25:33.011 --> 00:25:35.531
<v Speaker 5>programs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you had something crazy on like </v>

576
00:25:35.531 --> 00:25:37.870
<v Speaker 5>ustream broadcaster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know if that's an intense </v>

577
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.870
<v Speaker 5>program or a video game that might slow </v>
<v Speaker 5>it down a lot,</v>

578
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:42.791
<v Speaker 5>but this is two times faster now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you probably won't be having that </v>

579
00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:43.520
<v Speaker 5>problem if that is the case of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>four programs.</v>

580
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.050
<v Speaker 5>Very interesting.</v>

581
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.010
<v Speaker 3>New phones supposedly has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has two antennas,</v>

582
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:53.370
<v Speaker 3>one antenna that sends one antenna that </v>
<v Speaker 3>receives instead of it both happening at</v>

583
00:25:53.711 --> 00:25:57.430
<v Speaker 3>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like it's supposed to double.</v>

584
00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.700
<v Speaker 3>I might not be interpreting it exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly,</v>

585
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's supposed to be able to double </v>
<v Speaker 3>the downloads.</v>

586
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about the intensity.</v>

587
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.350
<v Speaker 5>I do know that it uses the verizon </v>
<v Speaker 5>antenna,</v>

588
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.270
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking for that right now.</v>

589
00:26:09.271 --> 00:26:10.740
<v Speaker 5>What you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would make sense.</v>

590
00:26:10.741 --> 00:26:12.000
<v Speaker 5>That'd be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it had a,</v>

591
00:26:12.001 --> 00:26:12.960
<v Speaker 5>an intended for both.</v>

592
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:18.060
<v Speaker 3>I read about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know which one of the websites </v>

593
00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.131
<v Speaker 3>or read about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they said they had basically they </v>

594
00:26:20.131 --> 00:26:22.090
<v Speaker 3>had duplicated four g speeds with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>three g device or what?</v>

595
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Some people consider four g speeds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

596
00:26:25.571 --> 00:26:27.540
<v Speaker 3>because there's some bunk ass four g </v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

597
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.520
<v Speaker 3>If you get that verizon four g,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bad ass man.</v>

598
00:26:30.521 --> 00:26:32.380
<v Speaker 3>I got up one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A laptop cards,</v>

599
00:26:32.381 --> 00:26:35.530
<v Speaker 3>man at the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in a place where it's four G,</v>

600
00:26:35.531 --> 00:26:36.640
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

601
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the best Wifi.</v>

602
00:26:39.371 --> 00:26:40.070
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

603
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:45.180
<v Speaker 5>What I want to know though is is this </v>
<v Speaker 5>new version and it sounds like what </v>

604
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:45.180
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this would make sense.</v>

605
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.600
<v Speaker 5>Is this new version for verizon?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you going to be able to talk and do </v>

606
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.750
<v Speaker 5>data at the same time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the four lte network.</v>

607
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:52.610
<v Speaker 5>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

608
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.970
<v Speaker 5>But this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this isn't.</v>

609
00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:56.710
<v Speaker 5>The Lte network is a four g anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's forward.</v>

610
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this isn't for GE.</v>

611
00:26:57.811 --> 00:27:02.811
<v Speaker 5>That was one of the big things that that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think because the network's not ready </v>

612
00:27:02.811 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 5>for iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right.</v>

613
00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:03.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

614
00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.350
<v Speaker 2>one thing that I think they need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>improve upon.</v>

615
00:27:06.351 --> 00:27:11.351
<v Speaker 2>I think if they put like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a headphone ear piece on each side </v>

616
00:27:12.111 --> 00:27:15.070
<v Speaker 2>where you can like click it off and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>wireless and you can put it on your,</v>

617
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:20.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to click advanced headphones </v>

618
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.331
<v Speaker 2>with you because so many times I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget to bring my fucking headphones </v>

619
00:27:22.331 --> 00:27:22.331
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how many times I buy headphones</v>

620
00:27:22.331 --> 00:27:25.370
<v Speaker 2>at the God damn airport if they just had</v>
<v Speaker 2>one to like clicked on,</v>

621
00:27:25.371 --> 00:27:27.320
<v Speaker 2>like the corners you can pop it off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

622
00:27:27.321 --> 00:27:32.321
<v Speaker 2>And then you lose it and then your </v>
<v Speaker 2>iphone is everyone's gonna love lost </v>

623
00:27:32.321 --> 00:27:34.670
<v Speaker 2>that like the first week or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some or you know,</v>

624
00:27:34.671 --> 00:27:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you know where you could pull it out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's a wire even though,</v>

625
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.710
<v Speaker 2>because you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you pop it back in.</v>

626
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking about headphones for </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to the things or talking on </v>

627
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:45.210
<v Speaker 2>the phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Headphones for listening to shit videos.</v>

628
00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.660
<v Speaker 2>You're not talking about photography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then it would work for that too.</v>

629
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

630
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I never used a headphone and talk on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

631
00:27:51.261 --> 00:27:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I always hold the phone up to my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

632
00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.100
<v Speaker 5>but the more I'm reading about </v>
<v Speaker 5>radiation,</v>

633
00:27:55.101 --> 00:27:57.050
<v Speaker 5>the more reading about cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 5>radiation,</v>

634
00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:02.350
<v Speaker 5>the more it really has to be thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really starting to think is there </v>

635
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 5>really something to that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the,</v>

636
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.680
<v Speaker 5>the what they accept,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they say what the acceptable range </v>

637
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.280
<v Speaker 5>of radiation you're allowed to have this</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole time.</v>

638
00:28:10.281 --> 00:28:15.281
<v Speaker 5>The wizards were right talking on </v>
<v Speaker 5>speakerphone outside is the way to go </v>

639
00:28:15.281 --> 00:28:15.670
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're concerned about their brother,</v>

640
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.380
<v Speaker 2>their radiation product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lizards.</v>

641
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

642
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.230
<v Speaker 5>With black dudes who are really </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggressive,</v>

643
00:28:24.231 --> 00:28:27.230
<v Speaker 5>who talk on the speakerphone on their </v>
<v Speaker 5>cell phone wizard wizards,</v>

644
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.930
<v Speaker 5>smart wizards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're not getting radiation in</v>

645
00:28:29.931 --> 00:28:30.790
<v Speaker 5>their head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is wrong?</v>

646
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.640
<v Speaker 5>That's what if those all those people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that use speakerphone.</v>

647
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm talking about everybody on my ex</v>

648
00:28:35.891 --> 00:28:40.891
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend does it to all those people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that use the speakerphone is that </v>

649
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:44.851
<v Speaker 5>they're probably thinking of it that </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe maybe you know when you get to </v>

650
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:48.391
<v Speaker 5>this four g shit too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you've got some super potent flying </v>

651
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:49.960
<v Speaker 5>through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is all this shit flying through the</v>

652
00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:50.580
<v Speaker 5>air man?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's that?</v>

653
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:50.630
<v Speaker 5>How's it</v>

654
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.520
<v Speaker 2>going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

655
00:28:51.521 --> 00:28:53.350
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that interact with ourselves?</v>

656
00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:58.530
<v Speaker 2>The fact that all these different Wifi </v>
<v Speaker 2>signals and we could put on a like one </v>

657
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.990
<v Speaker 2>of those infrared goggles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could see everything.</v>

658
00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:06.991
<v Speaker 2>Like you can see the cell phone signal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the information coming through if </v>

659
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:08.670
<v Speaker 2>you could just be everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

660
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:14.180
<v Speaker 2>We're in a sea of like frequencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows what that actually </v>

661
00:29:15.041 --> 00:29:17.290
<v Speaker 2>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone knows how it works.</v>

662
00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Like who the fuck figured out how that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell phone works.</v>

663
00:29:19.781 --> 00:29:22.180
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're sending video through the air.</v>

664
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Someone figured out that there was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>some tracks that we can put information </v>

665
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:32.311
<v Speaker 2>on an Ra and Jesus is magic and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a place that has nothing,</v>

666
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:37.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain sound to the silence </v>
<v Speaker 2>like of the mountains.</v>

667
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain sound where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like all us isn't</v>

668
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.240
<v Speaker 1>really a sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just a very low frequency that we</v>

669
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:49.150
<v Speaker 1>can't tune into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if it just affects your everyday</v>

670
00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't realize it.</v>

671
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:56.400
<v Speaker 1>If your everyday consciousness just </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly pressured by all of these </v>

672
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.310
<v Speaker 1>vibrations that are around you all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

673
00:29:57.311 --> 00:30:02.311
<v Speaker 1>all these cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signals and fucking Wifi signals and </v>

674
00:30:02.311 --> 00:30:06.490
<v Speaker 1>satellite signals and radio signals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

675
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if that is really fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>our personalities.</v>

676
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you'd be a different person </v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least add.</v>

677
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Feel different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

678
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

679
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:17.140
<v Speaker 1>who knows how many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

680
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what all this shit is doing to </v>

681
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.190
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only been around for a few.</v>

682
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long it started with TV signals and </v>

683
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.050
<v Speaker 1>radio signals or radio furs than TV and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

684
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.670
<v Speaker 1>And it mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but within the last couple decades,</v>

685
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:35.130
<v Speaker 1>the amount of infiltration in our lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>by frequencies and</v>

686
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.320
<v Speaker 2>walkie talkies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

687
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.820

691
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.271
<v Speaker 1>they weren't encoded either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to have to manually encode </v>

692
00:30:52.271 --> 00:30:53.330
<v Speaker 1>their information because they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want people that were.</v>

693
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.490
<v Speaker 1>The enemy was tuning into their shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

694
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.450
<v Speaker 1>So everybody had to talk in code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrap your head around that like not only</v>

695
00:30:59.451 --> 00:31:03.290
<v Speaker 1>is there no email but you when you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>anybody can get that signal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're in the bottom of the summary.</v>

697
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.290

<v Speaker 2>It's crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As technology just snowballs.</v>

704
00:31:16.371 --> 00:31:20.630
<v Speaker 2>It's the more access we have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>instant information,</v>

705
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.340
<v Speaker 2>infinite information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more,</v>

706
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.250
<v Speaker 2>the more free we feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we can get.</v>

707
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Keep track of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

710
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.660
<v Speaker 2>break it down from your cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know what cell phone tower you hit,</v>

711
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.090
<v Speaker 2>they know exactly where you were from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cell phone towers.</v>

712
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.560
<v Speaker 2>They can go back and all the deleted </v>
<v Speaker 2>messages that you all shit you deleted.</v>

713
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:47.650

<v Speaker 2>there's some kind of imprint of this </v>

714
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:48.230
<v Speaker 2>shit somewhere like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck.</v>

715
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.310
<v Speaker 2>We think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

716
00:31:49.311 --> 00:31:50.930
<v Speaker 2>we're more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more connected.</v>

717
00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.080
<v Speaker 2>We're more under control that more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

718
00:31:54.081 --> 00:31:55.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every little move we make,</v>

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.020
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know exactly.</v>

720
00:31:57.021 --> 00:32:00.890
<v Speaker 2>If they needed a pinpoint somebody how </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy it is to fucking find somebody.</v>

721
00:32:00.891 --> 00:32:02.930
<v Speaker 2>You're going to live off the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long is that going to last?</v>

722
00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.800
<v Speaker 2>You better go to the Amazon jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

723
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:07.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the only place you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>

724
00:32:07.611 --> 00:32:08.270
<v Speaker 2>They'll find you.</v>

725
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Much more immersive than it's ever been </v>

727
00:32:14.211 --> 00:32:17.181
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been any at any point in </v>

728
00:32:17.181 --> 00:32:18.660
<v Speaker 1>time where people are so easy to get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with other people.</v>

729
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

730
00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you hear about that guy that are </v>

731
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:25.330
<v Speaker 1>around your neighborhood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

732
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.970
<v Speaker 1>he flew off the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a side of a cliff and there wasn't cell </v>

733
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:29.880
<v Speaker 1>phone service there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we couldn't use a cell phone and he,</v>

734
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.180
<v Speaker 1>him and he got in a car accident with </v>
<v Speaker 1>another person or something like that.</v>

735
00:32:33.181 --> 00:32:34.530
<v Speaker 1>And then both of their cars are down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

736
00:32:34.531 --> 00:32:39.531
<v Speaker 1>The other guy died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so his body was like everywhere and </v>

737
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 1>broke,</v>

738
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.780
<v Speaker 5>like every single bone in his body was </v>
<v Speaker 5>still alive and he tried to crawl out,</v>

739
00:32:44.781 --> 00:32:46.400
<v Speaker 5>but he couldn't move because everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>was broken.</v>

740
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.640
<v Speaker 5>And for 10 days he sat down there with </v>
<v Speaker 5>his dead guy living off of grass and </v>

741
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.890
<v Speaker 5>bugs and creek.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was like a little creek water,</v>

742
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:56.300
<v Speaker 5>I guess he would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would drink,</v>

743
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:01.330
<v Speaker 5>but for 10 days he lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then one day his love his son or </v>

744
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:01.330
<v Speaker 5>something like that was going down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>road,</v>

745
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:06.131
<v Speaker 5>like looking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's still kind of looking for them </v>

746
00:33:06.131 --> 00:33:08.021
<v Speaker 5>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he hurt his dad's help yell for </v>

747
00:33:08.021 --> 00:33:08.021
<v Speaker 5>help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they found his body,</v>

748
00:33:08.021 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't have cell phone service </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

749
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.290
<v Speaker 5>And if he would have had been able to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said he,</v>

750
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.640
<v Speaker 5>the whole time was just searching his </v>
<v Speaker 5>cell phone,</v>

751
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:18.670
<v Speaker 5>his cell phone died and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But can you imagine 10 days on the </v>

752
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:21.410
<v Speaker 5>bottom of a creek and there's not cell </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone service and it was just all fucked</v>

753
00:33:21.411 --> 00:33:22.580
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we couldn't walk out of there.</v>

754
00:33:22.581 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's alive now and he's,</v>

755
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:24.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's doing,</v>

756
00:33:24.551 --> 00:33:29.551
<v Speaker 5>he's recovering and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But imagine being 10 days at Brown and </v>

757
00:33:29.551 --> 00:33:30.850
<v Speaker 5>dead person too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also just think of</v>

758
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.200
<v Speaker 4>a how vulnerable your body is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you body breaks,</v>

759
00:33:34.201 --> 00:33:36.420
<v Speaker 4>you're just stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't move,</v>

760
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:41.610
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think most of us don't wrap our </v>

761
00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:41.610
<v Speaker 4>heads around that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body breaks,</v>

762
00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:45.230
<v Speaker 4>then you can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then being out in the woods so you </v>

763
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.111
<v Speaker 4>get to things that scare the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people being alone out in the uncharted </v>

764
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.750
<v Speaker 4>wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hearing cars drive</v>

765
00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:56.210
<v Speaker 5>you above you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyday it's on be is just a side of </v>

766
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.210
<v Speaker 5>the roads,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

767
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.970
<v Speaker 5>in some area that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

768
00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:02.060
<v Speaker 5>people drive by every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That might as well be uncharted </v>

769
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.060
<v Speaker 5>wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody goes.</v>

770
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>

771
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.910
<v Speaker 5>they said that people fly off of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>clips all the time and never get found </v>

772
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.130
<v Speaker 5>because it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who goes down there?</v>

773
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 5>No one goes down there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody goes looking to find cars down </v>

774
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 5>there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

778
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 5>Monterrey and all the way that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fuck the first time I did it,</v>

781
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.600
<v Speaker 4>I was 28 years old and I never took that</v>
<v Speaker 4>drug.</v>

782
00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.660
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in California,</v>

783
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:34.661
<v Speaker 4>and I never knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was one of the most beautiful states </v>

784
00:34:34.661 --> 00:34:35.990
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incredible scenery.</v>

785
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:41.050
<v Speaker 4>It's so cliffs in the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to even wrap your head </v>

786
00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's magnificent.</v>

787
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:46.181
<v Speaker 4>I kept pulling over the girl I was with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We took a little trip for a couple of </v>

788
00:34:46.181 --> 00:34:46.700
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He kept.</v>

789
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.510
<v Speaker 4>I kept pulling over just videotaping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe this was California.</v>

790
00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:51.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

791
00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:54.830
<v Speaker 4>I've never been up to northern </v>
<v Speaker 4>California before on the east coast.</v>

792
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of parts of that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>drive.</v>

00:34:56.931 --> 00:35:01.931
<v Speaker 4>Were you just counting on the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole on the other side to just be </v>

794

<v Speaker 4>cool?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd been together.</v>

795
00:35:01.931 --> 00:35:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Stay in your lane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't be texting.</v>

796
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.770
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it crazy how they put a big halt </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that satellite phone?</v>

797
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Remember it was big like six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven years ago.</v>

798
00:35:08.721 --> 00:35:09.950
<v Speaker 4>It was like the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

799
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:15.190
<v Speaker 4>and the commercial was dude was in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wilderness on a mountain and he was </v>

800
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 4>making a call like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the best shit,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they just shut it all down.</v>

802
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.850
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have satellite phones.</v>

803
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.890
<v Speaker 4>They still don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come it didn't blow up?</v>

804
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that efficient.</v>

805
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:25.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a world phone now,</v>

806
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:26.300
<v Speaker 4>didn't they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't they?</v>

807
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 4>Didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shut down the satellite phones </v>

808
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 4>because of the whole terrorism thing.</v>

809
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:32.140
<v Speaker 5>I think they briefly shut them down </v>
<v Speaker 5>around that time period,</v>

810
00:35:32.141 --> 00:35:33.700
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they still have,</v>

811
00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.550
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody had a satellite phone the other</v>

812
00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:37.820
<v Speaker 5>day or a.</v>

813
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was last.</v>

814
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they,</v>

815
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I think they use them on a sort of fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>

816
00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:47.830
<v Speaker 1>If we used to use them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to have to use satellite phones.</v>

817
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:50.780
<v Speaker 1>There were certain sets that we'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond,</v>

818
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.020
<v Speaker 1>but there was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing.</v>

819
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You didn't think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be huge.</v>

820
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I thought I thought they got shut down a</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive.</v>

821
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the sound quality's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>good either.</v>

822
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a big delay is a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

823
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say a big delay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>

824
00:36:04.711 --> 00:36:09.711
<v Speaker 1>It goes up to the sky and then back down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what reporters should have </v>

825
00:36:09.711 --> 00:36:12.621
<v Speaker 1>phones that like regular phones with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking nine g you got the </v>

826
00:36:12.621 --> 00:36:12.621
<v Speaker 1>satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need it,</v>

827
00:36:12.621 --> 00:36:17.361
<v Speaker 1>you just click on the little thing just </v>
<v Speaker 1>in case like these stories flag off </v>

828
00:36:17.361 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 1>cliffs and shed get lost in the woods.</v>

829
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:23.210
<v Speaker 1>You know how many movies have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone getting chased and their cell </v>

830
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.541
<v Speaker 1>phone signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now it's a good idea because now </v>

831
00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:29.421
<v Speaker 1>there's the t the chips are slowly </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrinking to the point where you could </v>

832
00:36:29.421 --> 00:36:33.501
<v Speaker 1>get all that in in one phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you ever look at the satellite </v>

833
00:36:33.501 --> 00:36:33.570
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason where there's big giant</v>

834
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:36.000
<v Speaker 1>bricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the receiver has to be completely</v>

835
00:36:36.001 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 1>different than a little tiny one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internal.</v>

836
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be the new pimp floss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's also nowadays cars.</v>

837
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Cars have it built in like my car has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature in it that you can turn on that </v>

838
00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:50.091
<v Speaker 1>if I can in a car accident and </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically texts my gps and sends it </v>

839
00:36:50.091 --> 00:36:50.091
<v Speaker 1>and calls nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One one.</v>

840
00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for does that right?</v>

841
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Saying somebody told me this and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know if it's true.</v>

842
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:56.960
<v Speaker 1>So twitter people fucking informed me.</v>

843
00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Tell me if this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said that the dude bought a </v>

844
00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:03.450
<v Speaker 1>corvette and it had that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the thing?</v>

845
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:07.800
<v Speaker 1>The onstar system on star guy was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the highway going 148 miles an hour</v>

846
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:12.801
<v Speaker 1>or something crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onstar shut off his car now called the </v>

847
00:37:12.801 --> 00:37:13.500
<v Speaker 1>police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not true.</v>

848
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.600
<v Speaker 1>You sure that's not true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent and that's not true.</v>

849
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.720
<v Speaker 1>No way that the onstar even is </v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring how fast or driving or do </v>

850
00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:21.660
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it saves information.</v>

851
00:37:21.661 --> 00:37:24.960
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a wreck they can find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your data might save it.</v>

852
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:29.961
<v Speaker 1>But there's so many cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have onstar and the fact that they </v>

853
00:37:29.961 --> 00:37:29.961
<v Speaker 1>actually have people sitting there will </v>
<v Speaker 1>go in.</v>

854
00:37:29.961 --> 00:37:30.660
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going 120 over here.</v>

855
00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:35.661
<v Speaker 1>You know there's no one monitoring that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be unless you get in a car </v>

856
00:37:35.661 --> 00:37:35.661
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the program itself.</v>

857
00:37:35.661 --> 00:37:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe onstar itself when it recognizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you hit a certain amount of miles </v>

858
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:44.480
<v Speaker 1>per hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shut your car off if you don't </v>

859
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.311
<v Speaker 1>think that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's possible that they could </v>

860
00:37:46.311 --> 00:37:46.311
<v Speaker 1>shut it off if someone's driving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

861
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Can't they shut her off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that called,</v>

862
00:37:48.841 --> 00:37:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Jack Something Jack?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've done that.</v>

863
00:37:52.081 --> 00:37:54.090
<v Speaker 1>The crux of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd done that to people before.</v>

864
00:37:54.091 --> 00:37:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Shut their cars off while they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving.</v>

865
00:37:55.261 --> 00:37:56.880
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

866
00:37:56.881 --> 00:37:59.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a car.</v>

867
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.130
<v Speaker 1>That was that one reality show where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people steal cars.</v>

868
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know the way things are going </v>

869
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.750
<v Speaker 1>to kill switches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like,</v>

870
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

871
00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like in the future,</v>

872
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:19.250
<v Speaker 1>like it's just going to be mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a law that the CHP or </v>

873
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.331
<v Speaker 1>the police department or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck they call the forest back then has </v>

874
00:38:23.331 --> 00:38:26.781
<v Speaker 1>gps on your shit and like the DMV and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just monitor every mile you drive,</v>

875
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:29.370
<v Speaker 1>so anytime you fuck up they just send </v>
<v Speaker 1>you tickets.</v>

876
00:38:29.371 --> 00:38:31.680
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have your gps fingerprint.</v>

877
00:38:31.681 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 1>You manage your gps record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine that shit?</v>

878
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in England they got cameras,</v>

879
00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:38.620
<v Speaker 1>they got better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>

880
00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 1>They take pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to need that.</v>

881
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:44.320
<v Speaker 1>The DMV just gonna Monitor your driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day you'll have a sheet.</v>

882
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he broke.</v>

883
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a ticket.</v>

884
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more hiding.</v>

885
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.230
<v Speaker 1>No more speeding.</v>

886
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.400
<v Speaker 1>You have to go to a track if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go fast than spots like that and we </v>

887
00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:59.530
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes speed limits.</v>

888
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the most part,</v>

889
00:39:02.211 --> 00:39:04.570
<v Speaker 1>it's speed limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably pretty smart to have a,</v>

890
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:10.290
<v Speaker 1>a decent number set and a lot of places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of places where it's </v>

891
00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 1>silly like the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out of here.</v>

892
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Will you see 55 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck outta here.</v>

893
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:18.130
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid way to move.</v>

894
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Fifty five miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

895
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:24.750
<v Speaker 1>What kind of car do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you're a fucking old jalopy </v>

896
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.511
<v Speaker 1>back when they instituted that speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>limit and it made sense because if </v>

897
00:39:27.511 --> 00:39:29.470
<v Speaker 1>you're going more than 55 miles an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>and old fucking Chevy Nova,</v>

898
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:34.210
<v Speaker 1>one of those six cylinder shit boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those break suck dude.</v>

899
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.940
<v Speaker 1>You know if you're actually going fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of those cars.</v>

900
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're awesome cars when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuild them,</v>

901
00:39:39.011 --> 00:39:44.011
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean in compared to today's </v>

902
00:39:44.011 --> 00:39:44.011
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology,</v>

903
00:39:44.011 --> 00:39:48.541
<v Speaker 1>those cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't handle well and they </v>

904
00:39:48.541 --> 00:39:50.131
<v Speaker 1>couldn't break well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had that much where you're </v>

905
00:39:50.131 --> 00:39:52.060
<v Speaker 1>breaking the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slamming on the brakes.</v>

906
00:39:52.061 --> 00:39:53.190
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a common.</v>

907
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.850
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we need to move to Texas.</v>

908
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:57.850
<v Speaker 1>I heard that they now have their voting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the speed limit.</v>

909
00:39:57.851 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Moved to 90 I think is what they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

910
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of parts of Texas I </v>

911
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:05.820
<v Speaker 1>fucking love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

912
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:06.820
<v Speaker 1>speaking of which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Texas this weekend.</v>

913
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Powerful Verizon Center this Friday </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

914
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.390
<v Speaker 1>and you haven't been to Houston so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still use the own Houston every time</v>

915
00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:16.480
<v Speaker 1>you went into town you would sell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

916
00:40:16.481 --> 00:40:21.481
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would sell out every single </v>

917
00:40:21.481 --> 00:40:22.981
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the biggest market and then </v>

918
00:40:22.981 --> 00:40:22.981
<v Speaker 1>they closed the comedy club that we love</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to.</v>

919
00:40:22.981 --> 00:40:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I went to the second member of boy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Houston,</v>

920
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember a boy in Houston.</v>

921
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.410
<v Speaker 1>He came out on the road with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

922
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:37.470
<v Speaker 1>red devil when he was in red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic.</v>

923
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.600
<v Speaker 1>He never came on the road with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were always going on the subject and </v>

924
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:45.600
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to know what the fuck I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

925
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you explain it.</v>

926
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a mic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got three hours but you otherwise.</v>

927
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:53.770
<v Speaker 1>But this place just about Toyota Toyota </v>
<v Speaker 1>Center or Verizon Center.</v>

928
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:56.240

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:02.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were on a radio station there the </v>

930
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:02.240
<v Speaker 1>other day and he said that radio was </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty ridiculous.</v>

931
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

932
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:03.850
<v Speaker 1>they were nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were cool.</v>

933
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.780
<v Speaker 1>They played that a supernanny song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They play your song all the time.</v>

934
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just quoting a bet that I did.</v>

935
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

936
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know that bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now after I got off the phone with </v>

937
00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:15.210
<v Speaker 1>them I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

938
00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:18.301
<v Speaker 1>I think he was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is a line in one of my old </v>

939
00:41:18.301 --> 00:41:18.970
<v Speaker 1>bits that I forgot because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking something about toe ring.</v>

940
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a jug about a toe ring.</v>

941
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.830
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do.</v>

942
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.320
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you high or drunk?</v>

943
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember a joke about a tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a line in one of my </v>

944
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:28.500
<v Speaker 1>old old jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

945
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.200
<v Speaker 1>if you play like I've played back my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit from like 1999 and it almost as if </v>

946
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 1>like it's someone else's</v>

947
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.620
<v Speaker 4>material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know it anymore,</v>

948
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:38.090
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I remember it.</v>

949
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:39.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of my jokes,</v>

950
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.380
<v Speaker 4>but I don't even know them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if like somebody quotes like a little</v>

951
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:47.381
<v Speaker 4>piece of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might not even know what the fuck </v>

952
00:41:47.381 --> 00:41:47.810
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems so weird for something that for</v>

953
00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:52.811
<v Speaker 4>years you're so intimately connected to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you have material and then you </v>

954
00:41:52.811 --> 00:41:53.300
<v Speaker 4>abandoned it and start on some new </v>
<v Speaker 4>material,</v>

955
00:41:53.301 --> 00:41:57.450
<v Speaker 4>you fucking forget every did when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>started smoking weed was at 30 to 30,</v>

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.280
<v Speaker 4>relationship jokes and chick jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cock blocking jokes and then right into </v>

958
00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.940
<v Speaker 4>your pyramid bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You started smoking.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.630
<v Speaker 4>it's like I just Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned to see things differently.</v>

965
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:34.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got some good classics before we'd </v>

<v Speaker 4>I had to let it go though.</v>

973
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:50.910
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>little fucking so real roar.</v>

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.400
<v Speaker 4>You had a better job too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>

979
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 4>Remember when the bear attack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the karate trainer.</v>

980
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:23.710
<v Speaker 4>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the guy who was a trainer and </v>

981
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:26.651
<v Speaker 4>he's dressed in a karate outfit and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a lady come onstage to them and the </v>

982
00:43:26.651 --> 00:43:29.951
<v Speaker 4>lady sat in the chair and the bear </v>
<v Speaker 4>turned and looked at the lady and just </v>

983
00:43:29.951 --> 00:43:31.550
<v Speaker 4>started fucking her up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just started fucking her up,</v>

984
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:36.790
<v Speaker 4>but it was just like the bear just woke </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and realized I'm a fucking bear and </v>

985
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:40.760
<v Speaker 4>then it just starts wailing like out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nowhere to dude that a karate outfit.</v>

986
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.580
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to protect the guy on </v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube.</v>

987
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.160
<v Speaker 4>That was way before you go debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

988
00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:46.430
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

989
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.430
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the story.</v>

990
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:48.710
<v Speaker 4>Actual store video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

991
00:43:48.711 --> 00:43:51.400
<v Speaker 4>I bet that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet somebody put it online down.</v>

992
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see because I heard so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much youtube.</v>

993
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:58.780
<v Speaker 4>I heard that joke so much is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never actually seen the real footage of </v>

994
00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:03.401
<v Speaker 4>air.</v>

995
00:44:03.401 --> 00:44:03.401
<v Speaker 4>her up for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She sat down.</v>

996
00:44:03.401 --> 00:44:04.850
<v Speaker 4>That's the weirdest thing about animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

997
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:07.310
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you don't realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

998
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:10.580
<v Speaker 4>like trained animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sometimes they're just tweaked like</v>

999
00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 4>they're tired of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to do this anymore.</v>

1000
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:17.411
<v Speaker 4>This is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be led around why you </v>

1001
00:44:17.411 --> 00:44:17.411
<v Speaker 4>fucking with me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on here?</v>

1002
00:44:17.411 --> 00:44:22.150
<v Speaker 4>And then it looks normal because they do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it every day and they don't know how to </v>

1003
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:25.571
<v Speaker 4>communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're a little tweet and so they </v>

1004
00:44:25.571 --> 00:44:29.021
<v Speaker 4>sit down and the fucking lady sits right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now next to him and he just decided to </v>

1005
00:44:29.021 --> 00:44:30.560
<v Speaker 4>fuck her up out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it looks like it's out of nowhere,</v>

1006
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:35.770
<v Speaker 4>but it's been built up all day because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you got this fucking stupid bear doing </v>

1007
00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:35.770
<v Speaker 4>somersaults.</v>

1008
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got this bear,</v>

1009
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:42.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of killing deers in eat and </v>

1010
00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 4>berries and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this bears running around on chairs.</v>

1011
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>playing musical chairs are porter,</v>

1012
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:47.910
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

1013
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:48.930
<v Speaker 4>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a big,</v>

1014
00:44:48.931 --> 00:44:53.931
<v Speaker 4>crazy unpredictable animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a video of a dude who is </v>

1015
00:44:53.931 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 4>training a bear and he was training </v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

1016
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.120
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was his brother or his </v>
<v Speaker 4>cousin,</v>

1017
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.520
<v Speaker 4>someone who is a close family member,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was his brother,</v>

1018
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:04.820
<v Speaker 4>and the bear just turns on the guy for </v>
<v Speaker 4>no reason and rips his throat out.</v>

1019
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.610
<v Speaker 4>It happens in 30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even 30 seconds,</v>

1020
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:12.210
<v Speaker 4>10 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe a maximum for no reason.</v>

1021
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.720
<v Speaker 4>They're all had this bear in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bed just turns on.</v>

1022
00:45:15.721 --> 00:45:20.721
<v Speaker 4>The guy goes right at his neck and rips </v>
<v Speaker 4>it out and the guy bled out and died </v>

1023
00:45:20.721 --> 00:45:22.170
<v Speaker 4>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it crazy that some when when these</v>

1024
00:45:22.171 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 4>trained animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them,</v>

1025
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:29.061
<v Speaker 4>when they attack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't kill him because it's like </v>

1026
00:45:29.061 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 4>they give them another chance.</v>

1027
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:34.100
<v Speaker 4>They might like the killer whale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't they get that killer whale like </v>

1028
00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 4>band this bear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't kill this bear.</v>

1029
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:37.680
<v Speaker 4>It's a why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just seems like it's costs more money</v>

1030
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:40.770
<v Speaker 4>to retrain another bear than to pay the </v>
<v Speaker 4>insurance policy on.</v>

1031
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gotTa.</v>

1032
00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.640
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>

1033
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>

1034
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:51.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand how anybody can </v>

1035
00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:51.620
<v Speaker 4>convince anybody that had a bear that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants,</v>

1036
00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:55.200
<v Speaker 4>that has already killed a person who </v>
<v Speaker 4>offered no threat whatsoever.</v>

1037
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:57.540
<v Speaker 4>That thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a person did that,</v>

1038
00:45:57.541 --> 00:46:02.541
<v Speaker 4>you would kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You give them the death penalty in a </v>

1039
00:46:02.541 --> 00:46:03.750
<v Speaker 4>right society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you saw someone run up to someone for</v>

1040
00:46:03.751 --> 00:46:06.150
<v Speaker 4>no reason to rip your throat out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would kill them.</v>

1041
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:11.300
<v Speaker 4>Why the fuck would you give a bear more </v>
<v Speaker 4>rights and you'd give up maybe not </v>

1042
00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.690
<v Speaker 4>killed a bear because I don't blame the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bear for doing that.</v>

1043
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:13.830
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1044
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.500
<v Speaker 4>throwing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1045
00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1046
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.760
<v Speaker 4>lock them away somewhere or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1047
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Don't continue to use them as a buffoon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going to attack again.</v>

1048
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.470
<v Speaker 4>Lock in a bear away would be cruel and </v>
<v Speaker 4>unusual punishment.</v>

1049
00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.860
<v Speaker 4>I'd say just put one in his fucking dome</v>
<v Speaker 4>and at them in the wild.</v>

1050
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give him a chance.</v>

1051
00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:30.280
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1052
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:35.340
<v Speaker 4>that you take and you train and you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>all that within it turns and eats your </v>

1053
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.180
<v Speaker 4>brother's fucking throat in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1054
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:41.540
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to kill that thing like </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy wild thing that you thought you </v>

1055
00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:41.760
<v Speaker 4>were in control of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fuck is wrong.</v>

1056
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:46.790
<v Speaker 4>If it was up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would take them up to the mountains </v>

1057
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.790
<v Speaker 4>and give him a check and now you </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably had another lose.</v>

1058
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.090
<v Speaker 4>No survival skills or anything good </v>
<v Speaker 4>luck,</v>

1059
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:49.740
<v Speaker 4>but at least you give them a chance.</v>

1060
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they could make it maybe,</v>

1061
00:46:52.141 --> 00:46:57.141
<v Speaker 4>but they're probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's terrible idea because then you </v>

1062
00:46:57.141 --> 00:46:58.230
<v Speaker 4>set an animal loose that's used to being</v>
<v Speaker 4>in contact with human beings and you set</v>

1063
00:46:58.231 --> 00:47:03.231
<v Speaker 4>them out in the woods and he will find </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings and it poses a direct </v>

1064
00:47:03.231 --> 00:47:03.930
<v Speaker 4>threat to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're really dangerous.</v>

1065
00:47:03.931 --> 00:47:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Once you have habitualized a bear to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1066
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.350
<v Speaker 4>they have to lock them up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to put them in cages in zoos.</v>

1067
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:15.590
<v Speaker 4>The zoos we went to in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned that there because they had </v>

1068
00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:16.800
<v Speaker 4>these bears and these bears had gotten </v>
<v Speaker 4>their big ass grizzlies man,</v>

1069
00:47:16.801 --> 00:47:21.801
<v Speaker 4>big ass brown bears and they um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were getting into people's garbage </v>

1070
00:47:21.801 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 4>and once they find this is where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people keep the food,</v>

1071
00:47:22.771 --> 00:47:24.480
<v Speaker 4>it's a source of food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They won't go away.</v>

1072
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.070
<v Speaker 4>You can't scare them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1073
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:31.071
<v Speaker 4>at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just get used to you and they just </v>

1074
00:47:31.071 --> 00:47:31.071
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So unless</v>

1075
00:47:31.071 --> 00:47:34.980
<v Speaker 3>you shoot them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to have someone come and </v>

1076
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:34.980
<v Speaker 3>capture them and they leave and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>take them away.</v>

1077
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.990
<v Speaker 7>You can't just let that bear,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I lose lose.</v>

1078
00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:39.490
<v Speaker 7>You'd find people in that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One time I did,</v>

1079
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:43.120
<v Speaker 7>I did five grams of mushrooms and I went</v>
<v Speaker 7>to the zoo.</v>

1080
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:46.120
<v Speaker 7>I thought it'd be a great idea and by </v>
<v Speaker 7>the time I got to the zoo,</v>

1081
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:49.210
<v Speaker 7>that's when it started kicking in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I blew up at the zoo.</v>

1082
00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.950
<v Speaker 7>That freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

1083
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:53.560
<v Speaker 7>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these animals are fucking sad as hell.</v>

1084
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:58.180
<v Speaker 7>They're all captured there in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I ran out of that.</v>

1085
00:47:58.181 --> 00:48:01.170
<v Speaker 7>Got Em zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's how those people are jumping into</v>

1086
00:48:01.171 --> 00:48:06.100
<v Speaker 7>the polar bear bear cages.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I bet they're always on shrooms or bear.</v>

1087
00:48:06.101 --> 00:48:11.101
<v Speaker 7>The polar bear was there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like a little fucking old school </v>

1088
00:48:11.101 --> 00:48:15.211
<v Speaker 7>little auditorium theater thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>got for this polar bear and there's a </v>

1089
00:48:15.211 --> 00:48:18.781
<v Speaker 7>door and I backstage and it just kept </v>
<v Speaker 7>walking through that door and then walk </v>

1090
00:48:18.781 --> 00:48:22.891
<v Speaker 7>away from the door like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 7>yards and walking back waiting for </v>

1091
00:48:22.891 --> 00:48:24.850
<v Speaker 7>someone to open that door and it was </v>
<v Speaker 7>just pacing back and forth nonstop.</v>

1092
00:48:24.851 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 7>This polar bear like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>

1093
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 7>I freaked the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was just hoping</v>

1094
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.320
<v Speaker 3>some asshole comes and opens the door </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he can bite them and drag them and </v>

1095
00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.600
<v Speaker 3>finish him off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1096
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:40.640
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just dying for someone to go in </v>

1097
00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:40.640
<v Speaker 3>there so they could track them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1098
00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.720
<v Speaker 3>That's why they you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen the video?</v>

1099
00:48:41.721 --> 00:48:43.470
<v Speaker 3>The lady getting her leg broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>

1100
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:48.570
<v Speaker 3>He bites down on her leg and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling her leg through the fucking </v>

1101
00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:50.370
<v Speaker 3>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's polar bears are motherfuckers,</v>

1102
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:53.390
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're real motherfuckers and you don't</v>

1103
00:48:53.391 --> 00:48:55.970
<v Speaker 3>ever really tame those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things are.</v>

1104
00:48:56.020 --> 00:49:01.020
<v Speaker 3>They're the craziest bears of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're the straight carnivore </v>

1105
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.001
<v Speaker 3>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the other bears eat fruits and </v>

1106
00:49:04.001 --> 00:49:06.161
<v Speaker 3>berries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no fucking fruits and berries with </v>

1107
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:06.161
<v Speaker 3>the polar bear lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just Coca Cola,</v>

1108
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:10.000
<v Speaker 3>just just seals and people and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck else he can eat whales,</v>

1109
00:49:11.361 --> 00:49:15.170
<v Speaker 3>the whales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they find a hole where a whale got stuck</v>

1110
00:49:15.171 --> 00:49:17.420
<v Speaker 3>under a giant sheet of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whale can't go anywhere,</v>

1111
00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.670
<v Speaker 3>so every time the whale comes up to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>some air,</v>

1112
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:20.720
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>polar bear.</v>

1113
00:49:20.721 --> 00:49:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Jackson takes a bite out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these whales,</v>

1114
00:49:23.331 --> 00:49:26.720
<v Speaker 3>like you see him and after a while </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the top of their back.</v>

1115
00:49:26.721 --> 00:49:29.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1116
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 3>From polar bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just biting them over and over and over </v>

1117
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.400
<v Speaker 3>and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then eventually they kill it.</v>

1118
00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:38.210
<v Speaker 3>So small whale or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets stuck in their pilot whale.</v>

1119
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:41.090
<v Speaker 3>They just slowly bite them to death.</v>

1120
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:46.280
<v Speaker 7>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you see the video that Mary Archie </v>

1121
00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.440
<v Speaker 7>Band playing a song music for?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it was a.</v>

1122
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.350
<v Speaker 7>What are the snow lions or something </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that?</v>

1123
00:49:52.351 --> 00:49:55.950
<v Speaker 7>Snow leopards snow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's big things as big blobby.</v>

1124
00:49:55.951 --> 00:50:00.951
<v Speaker 7>They almost like hippos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like what's the ones that are all seals </v>

1125
00:50:00.951 --> 00:50:03.330
<v Speaker 7>and sea lions?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe that,</v>

1126
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.590
<v Speaker 7>but it was so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were the.</v>

1127
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:09.030
<v Speaker 7>It looked like it was having a fun time </v>
<v Speaker 7>watching,</v>

1128
00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:11.400
<v Speaker 7>like it was going back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's explaining what you saw.</v>

1129
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:12.750
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here I'll show it to you.</v>

1130
00:50:12.751 --> 00:50:14.190

<v Speaker 7>I think it's on Google.</v>

1131
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.340
<v Speaker 7>Mariachi band,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mariachi band.</v>

1132
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:22.530
<v Speaker 7>A Sea lion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they're playing the music and the sea</v>

1133
00:50:22.531 --> 00:50:24.510
<v Speaker 7>lions dancing along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that what you're saying?</v>

1134
00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.150
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like tilt his head up and down and then </v>

1138
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.360
<v Speaker 1>would head up and down and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like it was having the time of </v>

1139
00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:40.571
<v Speaker 1>its life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the coolest videos I've </v>

1140
00:50:40.571 --> 00:50:40.571
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find it right now for the wonder.</v>

1141
00:50:40.571 --> 00:50:44.321
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder like what music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of an effect music would have </v>

1142
00:50:44.321 --> 00:50:47.501
<v Speaker 1>on animals because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the animal kingdom it's actually a </v>

1143
00:50:47.501 --> 00:50:50.921
<v Speaker 1>Beluga whale occasion at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why wouldn't music impact them the </v>

1144
00:50:50.921 --> 00:50:55.691
<v Speaker 1>same way it impacts us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't it be exciting and </v>

1145
00:50:55.691 --> 00:50:55.691
<v Speaker 1>interesting to them?</v>

1146
00:50:55.691 --> 00:50:56.620
<v Speaker 8>It's actually a Beluga whale and if you </v>
<v Speaker 8>look at it,</v>

1147
00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.630
<v Speaker 8>it's a on [inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's Mariachi Band serenades,</v>

1148
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.650
<v Speaker 8>that Beluga whale and it's just going </v>
<v Speaker 8>back and forth.</v>

1149
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Well that makes sense as well as a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than you realize.</v>

1150
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.500
<v Speaker 8>And they started.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is.</v>

1151
00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.420
<v Speaker 8>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't,</v>

1152
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:17.540
<v Speaker 8>I couldn't remember what it was.</v>

1153
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 1>They start playing more and more and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts really like nodding its head and </v>

1154
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:27.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's interesting about this,</v>

1155
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:32.840
<v Speaker 1>that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're amazed that this is intelligent </v>

1156
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:32.840
<v Speaker 1>because if that was a person and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1157
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:36.420
<v Speaker 1>look at my boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took my boy to see the Mariachi band.</v>

1158
00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Look how my boy nods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nods.</v>

1159
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.270
<v Speaker 1>He acknowledges them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they acknowledged him back.</v>

1160
00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:44.550
<v Speaker 1>My Boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

1161
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:48.900
<v Speaker 1>So far is not really doing anything but </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying to get better.</v>

1162
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:51.330
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why this is interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because it's not a human.</v>

1163
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.370
<v Speaker 1>If it's a person that's a drooling idiot</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to bad music.</v>

1164
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:00.630
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wait,</v>

1165
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:01.760
<v Speaker 8>let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

1166
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:02.870
<v Speaker 8>get to the good part</v>

1167
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:06.860
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just going,</v>

1168
00:52:06.861 --> 00:52:11.861
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are those hats?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or before they hear the nodding with </v>

1169
00:52:11.861 --> 00:52:12.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the music and stuff like that.</v>

1170
00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:18.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's like a breakthrough </v>

1171
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:18.240
<v Speaker 1>in science or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a cool video to watch.</v>

1172
00:52:18.241 --> 00:52:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I think you were saying it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough in science.</v>

1173
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that dolphins like you guys got </v>

1174
00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:25.300
<v Speaker 1>fish or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

1175
00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's bored as fuck.</v>

1176
00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Trapped in snack time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

1177
00:52:30.321 --> 00:52:32.250
<v Speaker 1>People are filming him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I chose assholes.</v>

1178
00:52:32.251 --> 00:52:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Make weird music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:52:33.991 --> 00:52:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Poor thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See in jail.</v>

1180
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Things in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No wonder he fucking stare at you when </v>

1181
00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:40.660
<v Speaker 1>it comes to the glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1182
00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1183
00:52:40.741 --> 00:52:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did a Freedom Day.</v>

1184
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that we have to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most concerned about with aliens,</v>

1185
00:52:46.921 --> 00:52:51.921
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the disrespect that we have </v>

1186
00:52:51.921 --> 00:52:52.410
<v Speaker 1>for everything even remotely dumber than</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1187
00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Even whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killer whales,</v>

1188
00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.010
<v Speaker 1>orcas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins.</v>

1189
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Those are thought to be really </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent animals.</v>

1190
00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.810
<v Speaker 1>We don't totally understand their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their languages.</v>

1191
00:53:00.811 --> 00:53:05.811
<v Speaker 1>We know that they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of them have dialects and </v>

1192
00:53:05.811 --> 00:53:05.811
<v Speaker 1>she'll like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

1193
00:53:05.811 --> 00:53:06.720
<v Speaker 1>They're really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both killer whales and dolphins.</v>

1194
00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:09.660
<v Speaker 1>They're like cousins of each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't understand what they say,</v>

1195
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.750
<v Speaker 1>so we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

1196
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck getting the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just forced them into prison for </v>

1197
00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.881
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We and we all go watch them perform and </v>

1198
00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:21.240
<v Speaker 1>fly through the air and splash as </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody claps.</v>

1199
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 1>We're watching slaves were watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies that stolen from</v>

1200
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:31.070
<v Speaker 3>their mothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from intelligent animals that miss them </v>

1201
00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:31.070
<v Speaker 3>and we don't care because we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what they're saying.</v>

1202
00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 3>La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>

1203
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:32.580
<v Speaker 3>la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not listening.</v>

1204
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.610
<v Speaker 3>What's the latest on deciphering the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dolphin or whale language?</v>

1205
00:53:36.611 --> 00:53:38.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean because we're trying to teach </v>
<v Speaker 3>them our words like jump.</v>

1206
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:40.020
<v Speaker 3>That's the tricky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1207
00:53:40.021 --> 00:53:41.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can recognize many,</v>

1208
00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:46.611
<v Speaker 3>many human words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can't understand a single thing </v>

1209
00:53:46.611 --> 00:53:47.700
<v Speaker 3>they're saying there's got to be someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the case trying to decipher that shit</v>

1210
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.580
<v Speaker 3>will be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leary was not timothy leary rather.</v>

1211
00:53:50.581 --> 00:53:53.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm the guy who created,</v>
<v Speaker 3>created the isolation tank.</v>

1212
00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there some new shit with the </v>

1213
00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:58.410
<v Speaker 3>isolation tank where they're sending </v>
<v Speaker 3>radio waves through it now?</v>

1214
00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Is there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that the latest thing or is that </v>

1215
00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:04.941
<v Speaker 3>still you laying in water at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperature or is there some </v>

1216
00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:06.310
<v Speaker 3>electromagnetic shit going on now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will they do have a John Lilly do?</v>

1217
00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:08.080
<v Speaker 3>They do have some where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1218
00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:13.180
<v Speaker 3>they play sound float lab has got some </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy new video screen that they're </v>

1219
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:18.291
<v Speaker 3>developing where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sits right in front of you and has </v>

1220
00:54:18.291 --> 00:54:21.270
<v Speaker 3>the lowest possible emission of light so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't see the machinery at all.</v>

1221
00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:26.271
<v Speaker 3>All you see is the image that's being </v>
<v Speaker 3>played on this DVD because you're in </v>

1222
00:54:26.271 --> 00:54:27.890
<v Speaker 3>total complete darkness in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the speakers are these,</v>

1223
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.100
<v Speaker 3>these sort of underwater waterproof </v>
<v Speaker 3>speakers that are beside each year.</v>

1224
00:54:32.101 --> 00:54:33.750
<v Speaker 3>They're fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fixed in place.</v>

1225
00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:37.560
<v Speaker 3>So you set yourself in between these two</v>
<v Speaker 3>speakers and then this video plays.</v>

1226
00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:39.960
<v Speaker 3>And in the sensory deprivation </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

1227
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:43.860
<v Speaker 3>when you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are weightless and body list and you</v>

1228
00:54:43.861 --> 00:54:48.861
<v Speaker 3>don't feel shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like you're flying through the </v>

1229
00:54:48.861 --> 00:54:48.861
<v Speaker 3>universe and then all of a sudden this </v>
<v Speaker 3>image appears right before you.</v>

1230
00:54:48.861 --> 00:54:51.480
<v Speaker 3>And the sound of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds pretty dope.</v>

1231
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tried it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1232
00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:55.700
<v Speaker 3>I like going in there and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to,</v>

1233
00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not looking to add anything.</v>

1234
00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking to figure out what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>is out there.</v>

1235
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I go into the tank,</v>

1236
00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:02.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm never thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1237
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.990
<v Speaker 3>how dope would this if I played a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of love while while I was in there.</v>

1238
00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:08.430
<v Speaker 3>Let's get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna get high as fuck.</v>

1239
00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:09.020
<v Speaker 3>And then um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1240
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:13.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be cool to do,</v>

1241
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.390
<v Speaker 3>but to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my time in there,</v>

1242
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.940
<v Speaker 3>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm,</v>

1243
00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:19.180
<v Speaker 3>what I gravitate towards is doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>with nothing.</v>

1244
00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1245
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like silence and I like seeing where </v>

1246
00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:25.740
<v Speaker 3>the fuck my crazy imagination takes me </v>
<v Speaker 3>or where,</v>

1247
00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:27.480
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the muse takes me,</v>

1248
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.890
<v Speaker 3>wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever happens.</v>

1249
00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:34.140
<v Speaker 7>Now imagine recording of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you see that thing where scientists </v>

1250
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:34.840
<v Speaker 7>can now record,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and this is scary.</v>

1251
00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 7>This is a thing they have on Gizmodo,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but where they had somebody watch a </v>

1252
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:44.851
<v Speaker 7>bunch of videos and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then they recorded the brain's </v>

1253
00:55:44.851 --> 00:55:45.790
<v Speaker 7>activity and they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they show on this video.</v>

1254
00:55:45.791 --> 00:55:50.620
<v Speaker 7>It compares what they actually saw and </v>
<v Speaker 7>what the brain sees the cats.</v>

1255
00:55:50.621 --> 00:55:53.200
<v Speaker 7>I've seen that they've recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so can you,</v>

1256
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:58.230
<v Speaker 7>can you imagine now that that like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 7>years from now they're going to be able </v>

1257
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:01.411
<v Speaker 7>to like record everything that you see.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not going to be able to lie </v>

1258
00:56:01.411 --> 00:56:05.011
<v Speaker 7>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not going to be able to do </v>

1259
00:56:05.011 --> 00:56:05.011
<v Speaker 7>anything where it's headed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ultimately they'll.</v>

1260
00:56:05.011 --> 00:56:08.550
<v Speaker 7>There'll be waterproof iphones that you </v>
<v Speaker 7>could swim with and that translates what</v>

1261
00:56:09.401 --> 00:56:14.401
<v Speaker 7>you're saying to dolphin language so </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you can just communicate with </v>

1262
00:56:14.401 --> 00:56:14.401
<v Speaker 7>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1263
00:56:14.401 --> 00:56:14.401
<v Speaker 7>it's getting crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1264
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.480
<v Speaker 7>I don't think they're ever going to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>able to figure out the dolphin thing.</v>

1265
00:56:16.481 --> 00:56:18.940
<v Speaker 7>They're so far off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dolphin APP never say never.</v>

1266
00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 7>Humans,</v>
<v Speaker 7>humans communicating with humans is </v>

1267
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 7>going to get real weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1268
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:24.300
<v Speaker 7>can figure that dolphin</v>

1269
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.510
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not close.</v>

1270
00:56:25.511 --> 00:56:30.511
<v Speaker 4>They're not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck the dolphins </v>

1271
00:56:30.511 --> 00:56:30.511
<v Speaker 4>are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what.</v>

1272
00:56:30.511 --> 00:56:33.450
<v Speaker 4>They can't talk the dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't send out a message to the </v>

1273
00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:33.450
<v Speaker 4>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hello Dolphin world.</v>

1274
00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:35.480
<v Speaker 4>We are friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what if they created some instrument</v>

1275
00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.580
<v Speaker 4>where they decide for some sounds and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

1276
00:56:37.581 --> 00:56:39.350
<v Speaker 4>let's see what this sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1277
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.080
<v Speaker 4>dissect the sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>edit them,</v>

1278
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:46.170
<v Speaker 4>put them together and then plan for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dolphin and maybe the dog because that </v>

1279
00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:46.170
<v Speaker 4>doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was kind of weird,</v>

1280
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They may slowly put words together like,</v>

1281
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got eat.</v>

1282
00:56:50.081 --> 00:56:52.840
<v Speaker 4>We got the one for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if they had like rewords down,</v>

1283
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.390
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they go,</v>

1284
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe we should research where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1285
00:56:58.011 --> 00:57:03.011
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Dolphin communication world is that </v>

1286
00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:03.011
<v Speaker 4>right now I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to.</v>

1287
00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:06.670
<v Speaker 4>I know that a mentoree John Lilly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was one of the reasons why I </v>

1288
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:09.841
<v Speaker 4>created a what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would he rather uses that he used </v>

1289
00:57:09.841 --> 00:57:12.751
<v Speaker 4>the tank for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to put a tank on isolation tank </v>

1290
00:57:12.751 --> 00:57:15.991
<v Speaker 4>right next to the dolphin tank and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>would drop acid and get into the tank </v>

1291
00:57:15.991 --> 00:57:19.860
<v Speaker 4>and communicate with the dolphins and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like this pioneer and interspecies </v>

1292
00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.360
<v Speaker 4>communication and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what does that mean?</v>

1293
00:57:22.361 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much have they figured out?</v>

1294
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:28.381
<v Speaker 4>As far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have figured out very little and I </v>

1295
00:57:28.381 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 4>think we're the whole dolphin language </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a mystery,</v>

1296
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:33.220
<v Speaker 4>but we do know that they have dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know that different dolphin pods have</v>

1297
00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:35.370
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if they're from a different place,</v>

1298
00:57:35.371 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 4>I'll have like a different twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they know that they can tell that the</v>

1299
00:57:38.801 --> 00:57:43.801
<v Speaker 4>different dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can decipher one little sound like </v>

1300
00:57:43.801 --> 00:57:44.290
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe something in the.</v>

1301
00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:47.740
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a matter of context.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you lived in a world,</v>

1302
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:52.750
<v Speaker 4>see we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live in a material world as as the </v>

1303
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:56.611
<v Speaker 4>ocean oceans and material world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's in a material world where </v>

1304
00:57:56.611 --> 00:57:58.330
<v Speaker 4>you're not stuck to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going all over the place,</v>

1305
00:57:58.331 --> 00:58:03.331
<v Speaker 4>your world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your you've are flying through your </v>

1306
00:58:03.331 --> 00:58:06.301
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone is flying through the world of </v>

1307
00:58:06.301 --> 00:58:08.851
<v Speaker 4>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a completely different experience </v>

1308
00:58:08.851 --> 00:58:09.250
<v Speaker 4>to not be able to alter your </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>

1309
00:58:09.251 --> 00:58:13.200
<v Speaker 4>to develop some sort of intelligence to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the level that dolphins have and,</v>

1310
00:58:13.201 --> 00:58:15.760
<v Speaker 4>and orcas have to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll help people.</v>

1311
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:18.010
<v Speaker 4>They recognize when people are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>trouble and they help them.</v>

1312
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.700
<v Speaker 4>Like killer whales will like help people</v>
<v Speaker 4>get to boats.</v>

1313
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:23.410
<v Speaker 4>I want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to read something on that twitter</v>

1314
00:58:23.411 --> 00:58:28.270
<v Speaker 4>people I want some like documented </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's happened where and exactly what's</v>

1315
00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:33.271
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how the hell bent more than one </v>

1316
00:58:33.271 --> 00:58:35.881
<v Speaker 4>instance of guys capsizing boats and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Orcas helping them help them back into </v>

1317
00:58:35.881 --> 00:58:39.520
<v Speaker 4>the boat to amazing how they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack humans.</v>

1318
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:44.780
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People swim with like a pod of Orca </v>

1319
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:44.780
<v Speaker 4>where they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

1320
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:49.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they will let you do </v>

1321
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:49.480
<v Speaker 4>that man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they have children.</v>

1322
00:58:49.481 --> 00:58:54.481
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't seem to be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you know people have been bitten </v>

1323
00:58:54.481 --> 00:58:58.441
<v Speaker 4>or nudged or bumped and shit before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think they're pretty fucking easy </v>

1324
00:58:58.441 --> 00:58:59.470
<v Speaker 4>going with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was something I read online a long</v>

1325
00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:00.880
<v Speaker 4>time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it turned out to be horseshit.</v>

1326
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:06.170
<v Speaker 4>It was that people used to get killed by</v>
<v Speaker 4>killer whales all the time until a </v>

1327
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.220
<v Speaker 4>fighter pilots in world war two started </v>
<v Speaker 4>using orchids for target practice,</v>

1328
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:11.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they don't do shit like that.</v>

1329
00:59:11.411 --> 00:59:16.411
<v Speaker 4>I mean they would use like killer whales</v>
<v Speaker 4>or sharks or something like that for </v>

1330
00:59:16.411 --> 00:59:16.750
<v Speaker 4>target practice when they're dry fly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I heard that,</v>

1331
00:59:16.751 --> 00:59:20.140
<v Speaker 4>and then all of a sudden killer whales </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop killing people.</v>

1332
00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:21.700
<v Speaker 4>They had like some kind of committee and</v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

1333
00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 4>you know</v>

1334
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.560
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

1335
00:59:22.561 --> 00:59:26.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a good idea for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the existence of our species.</v>

1336
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:31.001
<v Speaker 2>Don't fuck with these humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These pink monkeys with their bang </v>

1337
00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:31.001
<v Speaker 2>sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be fucking with them.</v>

1338
00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:35.531
<v Speaker 2>They can do some damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can get out in our world that we </v>

1339
00:59:35.531 --> 00:59:35.840
<v Speaker 2>can't go to their world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just get in big wooden boats and</v>

1340
00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:38.240
<v Speaker 2>go out to our world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as long as the boat's big enough,</v>

1341
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:40.550
<v Speaker 2>you get in one of those giant ocean </v>
<v Speaker 2>liner type things.</v>

1342
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:42.440
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck's killer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do that.</v>

1343
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:44.330
<v Speaker 2>You can just go around and jacking up </v>
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>

1344
00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:47.420
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible environment they live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1345
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:52.510
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how the dolphins and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Caribbean or in the Gulf of Mexico or </v>

1346
00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:54.650
<v Speaker 2>the Bahamas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not area,</v>

1347
00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:59.980
<v Speaker 2>the ones they study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did a documentary on it and it's a </v>

1348
00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.300
<v Speaker 2>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they capture females,</v>

1349
01:00:02.301 --> 01:00:05.180
<v Speaker 2>they capture them either to males.</v>

1350
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:10.570
<v Speaker 2>It's either two males and they captured </v>
<v Speaker 2>one female at a time for like a month </v>

1351
01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:13.901
<v Speaker 2>and then they jacker or it's a big group</v>
<v Speaker 2>of males like 15 to 20 and they capture </v>

1352
01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:19.061
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of females and make sure they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't swim off the pot and they're just </v>

1353
01:00:19.061 --> 01:00:21.920
<v Speaker 2>taking turns on them and it's funny is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the girls want to leave.</v>

1354
01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:24.290
<v Speaker 2>They want to take off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be captured,</v>

1355
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:29.380
<v Speaker 2>not because they don't want to have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because they want to have sex with </v>

1356
01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.430
<v Speaker 2>as many males in that region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when they have their baby,</v>

1357
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:32.850
<v Speaker 2>if they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a.</v>

1358
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:38.020
<v Speaker 2>A woman female dolphin had sex with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred male dolphins when she gives </v>

1359
01:00:38.721 --> 01:00:42.860
<v Speaker 2>birth and she asked to watch over her </v>
<v Speaker 2>child for the first three or four years.</v>

1360
01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:46.280
<v Speaker 2>If she runs into and she's by herself </v>
<v Speaker 2>with her child,</v>

1361
01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:48.710
<v Speaker 2>they're just swimming around when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>run into males.</v>

1362
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:51.530
<v Speaker 2>If those males have had sex with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll leave her alone.</v>

1363
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.320
<v Speaker 2>If those males that run into a didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have sex with her,</v>

1364
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:59.510
<v Speaker 2>they will kill that baby and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>capture her and bring her into their </v>

1365
01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:01.130
<v Speaker 2>little Harem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will kill the baby boy,</v>

1366
01:01:01.131 --> 01:01:02.600
<v Speaker 2>that's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they run into them,</v>

1367
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:06.590
<v Speaker 2>so that's so the female has to have as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much sex as possible.</v>

1368
01:01:06.591 --> 01:01:11.591
<v Speaker 2>She's down with the sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she wants to leave and go find some </v>

1369
01:01:11.591 --> 01:01:12.500
<v Speaker 2>more guys before the baby hatches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>

1370
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:14.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

1371
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.720
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's the same because people think </v>

1372
01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:19.720
<v Speaker 2>of dolphins as being these fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving,</v>

1373
01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:23.891
<v Speaker 2>whimsical fairies of the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are cousins that are fairies in </v>

1374
01:01:23.891 --> 01:01:28.611
<v Speaker 2>the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all loving because you know </v>

1375
01:01:28.611 --> 01:01:28.611
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're cool as fuck to us.</v>

1376
01:01:28.611 --> 01:01:32.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever in a boat and you're </v>

1377
01:01:32.591 --> 01:01:32.591
<v Speaker 2>swimming by some dolphins are robots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins,</v>

1378
01:01:32.591 --> 01:01:33.920
<v Speaker 2>they'll jump up and play with you.</v>

1379
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>

1380
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.150
<v Speaker 2>but in the dolphin world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when things get hard,</v>

1381
01:01:38.151 --> 01:01:39.230
<v Speaker 2>shit gets crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1382
01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.240
<v Speaker 2>I know when it's a big group of males </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they run into a couple of dudes who </v>

1383
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.540
<v Speaker 2>have captured a check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will jack those dudes.</v>

1384
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.570
<v Speaker 2>And steel is steel there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl like that.</v>

1385
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:53.060
<v Speaker 2>This is our girl now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy evil bitches.</v>

1386
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>So dolphins are just like people a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ways.</v>

1387
01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Everything intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I was saying,</v>

1388
01:01:57.930 --> 01:01:59.780
<v Speaker 2>things in that region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all dolphins,</v>

1389
01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think all Davao,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all have their own special,</v>

1390
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.360
<v Speaker 2>but every mating rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1391
01:02:05.361 --> 01:02:10.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killer whales killed dolphins all the </v>

1392
01:02:10.361 --> 01:02:12.131
<v Speaker 2>time and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killer whales got their name not from </v>

1393
01:02:12.131 --> 01:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>being killers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from killing whales.</v>

1394
01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:17.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where they came up with the name </v>

1395
01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:17.920
<v Speaker 2>of killer whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killer whales.</v>

1396
01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Fuck whales up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some horrible videos of killer </v>

1397
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:21.660
<v Speaker 2>whales</v>

1398
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>biting a whale's face off like a blue </v>
<v Speaker 1>whale or something.</v>

1399
01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a big,</v>

1400
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:28.460
<v Speaker 1>big ass whale and just jack and his face</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the wheels trying to swim away and </v>

1401
01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>they're just fucking this whale up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1402
01:02:29.341 --> 01:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>it makes you really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think like,</v>

1403
01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:35.601

<v Speaker 1>thing that does tricks at the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a murdering monster that lives in</v>

1405
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:41.931
<v Speaker 1>the ocean and they're smart and think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what we do to them.</v>

1406
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just we don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't understand them.</v>

1407
01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>So we just put them in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get in there,</v>

1408
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're saying.</v>

1409
01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.070
<v Speaker 7>They're going,</v>

1410
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.750

1413
01:02:57.250 --> 01:03:02.250
<v Speaker 7>All we hear is what if they have the </v>
<v Speaker 7>answers to the universe?</v>

1414
01:03:02.581 --> 01:03:04.800
<v Speaker 7>They know all the answers where we came </v>

<v Speaker 7>they've been trying to tell us,</v>

1416
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:09.780
<v Speaker 7>but they just can't communicate when we </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't listen,</v>

1417
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:10.750
<v Speaker 7>logged in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're just,</v>

1418

<v Speaker 7>Federation.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Father was like ones and Zeros.</v>

1422
01:03:20.221 --> 01:03:22.920
<v Speaker 7>It was all like modem sounds and we just</v>
<v Speaker 7>haven't been able to.</v>

1423
01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:25.120
<v Speaker 7>People are so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1424
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.350
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1425
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:30.200
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:33.890
<v Speaker 1>People are so fucking toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't just ruin our world.</v>

1427
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>We ruined the ocean world too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pollute the ocean world and we eat </v>

1428
01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:41.180
<v Speaker 1>everything that's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you think about the two worlds</v>

1429
01:03:41.181 --> 01:03:43.820
<v Speaker 1>that exist right next to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1430
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:46.580
<v Speaker 1>There's the world of land and in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of the ocean,</v>

1431
01:03:46.581 --> 01:03:49.220
<v Speaker 1>in the world of land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to fly,</v>

1432
01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.160
<v Speaker 1>but unless you get in tubes and metal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit like that,</v>

1433
01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:57.161
<v Speaker 1>but you do get to manipulate matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to use your thumbs and make </v>

1434
01:03:57.161 --> 01:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>things and create things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world of the ocean,</v>

1435
01:03:59.151 --> 01:04:02.330
<v Speaker 1>you can fly all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't manipulate matter.</v>

1436
01:04:02.331 --> 01:04:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

1437
01:04:03.171 --> 01:04:08.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones who get manipulate matter to </v>

1438
01:04:08.171 --> 01:04:10.161
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to make tools and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a vehicles to fly over to where you live</v>

1439
01:04:10.371 --> 01:04:13.130
<v Speaker 1>and fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what we're doing,</v>

1440
01:04:13.131 --> 01:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>we don't think about we are at war with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean and we're.</v>

1441
01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:19.520
<v Speaker 1>We're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an ocean of oxygen.</v>

1442
01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:22.320
<v Speaker 1>We're just like crabs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just can't sweat around.</v>

1443
01:04:22.321 --> 01:04:24.020
<v Speaker 1>We're just the bottom feeders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1444
01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:27.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of motherfuckers flying </v>
<v Speaker 1>around birds and shit.</v>

1445
01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:30.750
<v Speaker 1>It's an ocean of oxygen that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around and yeah,</v>

1446
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:32.000
<v Speaker 1>but in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ocean,</v>

1447
01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very true.</v>

1448
01:04:33.111 --> 01:04:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we are the,</v>

1449
01:04:33.921 --> 01:04:36.320
<v Speaker 1>the crabs of the outer world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1450
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Because there are animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the water.</v>

1451
01:04:39.441 --> 01:04:42.250
<v Speaker 1>There's water and then there's oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just crap.</v>

1452
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point because cramps can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking swim.</v>

1453
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:47.630
<v Speaker 1>They just stuck there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're down there to clean things.</v>

1454
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Hate those fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cleanup.</v>

1455
01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1456
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>That's the when sharks run around Jack </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people and a foot falls to the </v>

1457
01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:57.560
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the crabs,</v>

1458
01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>crabs go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That football?</v>

1459
01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and crabs.</v>

1460
01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Always known for the term crabs in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucket.</v>

1461
01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're around people and they're fucking</v>

1462
01:05:08.961 --> 01:05:13.961
<v Speaker 1>holding each other down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do people still get cramps but people </v>

1463
01:05:13.961 --> 01:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>still getting cramps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not still around 70,</v>

1464
01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:16.760
<v Speaker 1>79.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1465
01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I heard of crabs in years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure it's out there.</v>

1466
01:05:18.911 --> 01:05:23.911
<v Speaker 1>You just gotTa look for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then high school they used to say </v>

1467
01:05:23.911 --> 01:05:23.911
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1468
01:05:23.911 --> 01:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I got the crabs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crabs like the wrong dirty,</v>

1469
01:05:26.111 --> 01:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty bitch.</v>

1470
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippies.</v>

1471
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Hippies really can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have crabs if you shaved your pussy </v>

1472
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>and they've really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder.</v>

1473
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:40.230
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why girls started </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaving their policies.</v>

1474
01:05:40.231 --> 01:05:41.800
<v Speaker 1>It was always the form checks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1475
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:44.630
<v Speaker 1>They gotta do we gotTa fucking shave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a chemo thing,</v>

1476
01:05:44.631 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at first.</v>

1477
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>But then it became cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1478
01:05:46.481 --> 01:05:47.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like a,</v>

1479
01:05:47.451 --> 01:05:52.451
<v Speaker 1>a run of people who thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive to ask women to shave their </v>

1480
01:05:52.451 --> 01:05:52.740
<v Speaker 1>pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like a big,</v>

1481
01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day when women had bushes.</v>

1482
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I remember like the debates when it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like porn was starting to alter people's</v>

1483
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:03.370
<v Speaker 1>perceptions of what sexual organs could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should look like.</v>

1484
01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>And I've read some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some thing about this where they were </v>

1485
01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>discussing how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1486
01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:12.030
<v Speaker 1>women are upset that their husbands want</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to shave their pussies and make it </v>

1487
01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:13.150
<v Speaker 1>look like the porn girls.</v>

1488
01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's offensive and it's </v>

1489
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>objectifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now everyone shapes.</v>

1490
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 1>The only thing about a hairy pussy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I used to like,</v>

1491
01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I used to prefer hairy pussies in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>early twenties,</v>

1492
01:06:24.221 --> 01:06:29.221
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not because girls had </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaved sometimes if they didn't shave </v>

1493
01:06:29.221 --> 01:06:29.221
<v Speaker 1>and they have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1494
01:06:29.221 --> 01:06:33.001
<v Speaker 1>that roughness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're fucking sandpaper </v>

1495
01:06:33.001 --> 01:06:33.001
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they're,</v>

1496
01:06:33.001 --> 01:06:36.510
<v Speaker 1>if they have like a bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all mushy gushy and machines soft.</v>

1497
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why it's there specifically.</v>

1498
01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an eyelash there because people </v>

1499
01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.260
<v Speaker 1>usually fuck missionary and it's to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect that area.</v>

1500
01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:52.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hair is a good way to send off </v>

1501
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:54.010
<v Speaker 1>your sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the hair and then wind blows on the</v>

1502
01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:55.300
<v Speaker 1>hair and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1503
01:06:55.301 --> 01:06:57.870
<v Speaker 1>so that's why it's around your asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1504
01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.790
<v Speaker 1>So you can send out the asshole Sunday </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1505
01:06:59.791 --> 01:07:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Apparently farts are aphrodisiacs or </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were cavemen whites.</v>

1506
01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was awesome that this guy got</v>

<v Speaker 1>I take that brontosaurus down.</v>

1511
01:07:15.491 --> 01:07:18.760

<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of Americans?</v>

1512

<v Speaker 1>like a lot of girls like to do the laser</v>

1515
01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:30.541
<v Speaker 1>now down there and get all their pubic </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair taken away and then they buy </v>

1516
01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Merkins if they ever want pubic hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They were like a pubic hair.</v>

1518
01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Tupac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tupac fashion ones that they use.</v>

1519
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Who would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

1520
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my gosh.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1523

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would say that people at </v>

1524
01:07:47.011 --> 01:07:47.011
<v Speaker 1>burning man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like the craziest shit.</v>

1525
01:07:47.011 --> 01:07:48.670
<v Speaker 1>You know Japanese can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to show pubic hair.</v>

1526
01:07:48.671 --> 01:07:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1527
01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>

1528
01:07:51.030 --> 01:07:53.770
<v Speaker 1>They don't shave their fucking pews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>

1529
01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I think you're not need the Japanese if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're listening out there,</v>

1530
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:01.780
<v Speaker 1>you guys shaved that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1531
01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.580
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one likes that.</v>

1532
01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:07.510
<v Speaker 1>But he would sell so much more porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relatively unherald compared to a lot of</v>

1533
01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.690
<v Speaker 1>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very Japanese are hairless,</v>

1534
01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:12.340
<v Speaker 1>but fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden it all,</v>

1535
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you know what it all takes place in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy.</v>

1536
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>They don't have enough hair to</v>

1537
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>go around for the legs and the arms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1538
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.280
<v Speaker 2>It all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1539
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:22.410
<v Speaker 2>You haven't seen Japanese porn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have seen a very little shit.</v>

1540
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the Japanese girls are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypersexual?</v>

1541
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:25.830
<v Speaker 5>Can I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1542
01:08:25.831 --> 01:08:27.740
<v Speaker 5>I think redheads are in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's,</v>

1543
01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.920
<v Speaker 5>here's why I've been doing some </v>
<v Speaker 5>research.</v>

1544
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:31.650
<v Speaker 5>Redheads have thinner skin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They also are very,</v>

1545
01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:36.610
<v Speaker 5>a lot more sensitive to a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 5>like when you get put out as a ginger,</v>

1546
01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:40.440
<v Speaker 5>like you have to have more a shit to put</v>
<v Speaker 5>you out.</v>

1547
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.560
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they actually have different.</v>

1548
01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:47.790
<v Speaker 5>When you go outside you need sunscreen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying would they have </v>

1549
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.541
<v Speaker 5>thinner skin and they have a few things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are different than normal people </v>

1550
01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:52.140
<v Speaker 5>and so they're like overly sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they bruise easier.</v>

1551
01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:57.120
<v Speaker 5>They the sunlight shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's also like when they're,</v>

1552
01:08:57.130 --> 01:09:01.990
<v Speaker 5>when they're in hospitals they have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>use more medicine to knock them out too.</v>

1553
01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:03.930
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's weird.</v>

1554
01:09:03.931 --> 01:09:07.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't know a bunch of it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you think there are separate species?</v>

1555
01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:08.100
<v Speaker 5>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1556
01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:10.530
<v Speaker 5>they're the closest to being different </v>
<v Speaker 5>than,</v>

1557
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.880
<v Speaker 5>than like Asian people.</v>

1558
01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:17.640
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think that the Asian Asian people </v>

1559
01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:17.700
<v Speaker 5>don't have thinner skin than us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have.</v>

1560
01:09:17.730 --> 01:09:19.770
<v Speaker 5>They're not more sensitive to skin and </v>
<v Speaker 5>light.</v>

1561
01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.960
<v Speaker 5>They also like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of like if you look at red</v>

1562
01:09:22.961 --> 01:09:27.240
<v Speaker 5>heads and that true ginger's compared to</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a regular white person,</v>

1563
01:09:27.241 --> 01:09:32.241
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of differences that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>would never even think of for some </v>

1564
01:09:32.241 --> 01:09:32.241
<v Speaker 5>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

1565
01:09:32.241 --> 01:09:32.241
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What else?</v>

1566
01:09:32.241 --> 01:09:34.830
<v Speaker 5>Their eyes are usually more prone to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to wear sunglasses.</v>

1567
01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.840
<v Speaker 5>Like it hurts their eyes more than where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they supposed to be from or they like </v>

1568
01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.450
<v Speaker 5>northern people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea.</v>

1569
01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.750
<v Speaker 2>You know what's crazy about Japan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went there about a year ago,</v>

1570
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:49.200
<v Speaker 2>a year and a half ago this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

1571
01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:54.350
<v Speaker 2>they're so down like they're number one </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsession as far as girls go.</v>

1572
01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Our school girls in the school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl outfits,</v>

1573
01:09:58.021 --> 01:09:59.130
<v Speaker 2>you know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's number one,</v>

1574
01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:04.160
<v Speaker 2>but everybody knows that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But number two is school girls in French</v>

1575
01:10:04.171 --> 01:10:09.171
<v Speaker 2>maid outfits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's school girl and then French </v>

1576
01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:09.171
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a bar out.</v>

1577
01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:12.530
<v Speaker 2>There were 15 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 year old girls dress up like friends,</v>

1578
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.270
<v Speaker 2>like they're in the laundry and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>serving ice cream.</v>

1579
01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Like it's totally okay in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

1580
01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

1581
01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:27.380
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're obsessed with school girls and </v>

1582
01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.160
<v Speaker 2>little girls and French maid outfits and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just those two.</v>

1583
01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.930
<v Speaker 2>There's not even a third.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1584
01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:33.780
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking backstreet boys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you in sync?</v>

1585
01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:35.250
<v Speaker 2>You got to choose sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1586
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:37.370
<v Speaker 5>and you have to have tentacles coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of you.</v>

1587
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:40.910
<v Speaker 5>What's all that about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got some crazy animals.</v>

1588
01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.180
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a loophole to go and get </v>
<v Speaker 5>around there.</v>

1589
01:10:43.181 --> 01:10:45.530
<v Speaker 5>There are laws of insertion of canvases </v>
<v Speaker 5>and stuff.</v>

1590
01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 5>Crazy cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that pipe before back in the day,</v>

1591
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:53.660
<v Speaker 5>Roger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rabbit kidding me.</v>

1592

1659
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.910
<v Speaker 4>humor and that he'd be joking around </v>

<v Speaker 4>Ari would joke around and pretend to be </v>

1663
01:13:42.181 --> 01:13:45.961
<v Speaker 4>a fucking action hero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you say it about a guy who </v>

01:13:45.961 --> 01:13:46.870
<v Speaker 4>really wants a legitimate career in </v>

<v Speaker 4>Avery's like knocking on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roger Ray.</v>

1667
01:13:51.261 --> 01:13:56.261
<v Speaker 4>We had some sort of a TV show and he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in it right before Roger Avery </v>

1668
01:13:56.261 --> 01:13:59.030
<v Speaker 4>got arrested for drunk driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was like in with like,</v>

1669
01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.570
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to be a movie star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if Ron,</v>

1670
01:14:01.571 --> 01:14:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy just says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>

1672
01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:09.500

<v Speaker 2>And then he gets into fucking beasel </v>

1673
01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 2>shape if he got</v>

1676
01:14:15.821 --> 01:14:16.690
<v Speaker 4>The whole appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ron.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're all in denial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everybody's doing.</v>

1685
01:14:32.241 --> 01:14:35.650
<v Speaker 4>And do you know that the NFL is trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to test for human growth hormone now?</v>

1686
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:37.460
<v Speaker 4>There was a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching the.</v>

1687
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:41.380
<v Speaker 4>I never watched sports shows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were talking to the head guy,</v>

1688
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:43.930
<v Speaker 4>whoever the fucking head guy the NFL is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>well we had.</v>

1690
01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:50.130
<v Speaker 4>That was a part of the bargaining that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to test for human growth </v>

1691
01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:50.290
<v Speaker 4>hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the players representatives,</v>

1692
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:50.860
<v Speaker 4>there's still a.</v>

1693
01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:55.860
<v Speaker 4>they're still debating the science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the science of testing for human growth </v>

1694
01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:55.860
<v Speaker 4>hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We believe the science is there.</v>

01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:57.820
<v Speaker 4>And like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about?</v>

<v Speaker 4>totally get steroids out of NFL.</v>

1698

<v Speaker 4>So you could be a 190 pounds and fucking</v>

1699
01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:11.080

01:15:27.450 --> 01:15:32.100
<v Speaker 4>moves fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fucking moves fast and doubles </v>

1708
01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:32.100
<v Speaker 4>fastest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

1709
01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:35.080
<v Speaker 4>What if he went to boxing and became the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world heavyweight champion in boxing?</v>

1710
01:15:35.081 --> 01:15:36.250
<v Speaker 4>There's nobody out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1711
01:15:36.251 --> 01:15:37.090
<v Speaker 4>I bet he could do it.</v>

1712
01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:37.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man,</v>

1713
01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:39.280
<v Speaker 4>if he'd have to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Klitschkos,</v>

1714
01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:44.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think he's one of those guys that </v>

1715
01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.130
<v Speaker 4>there's a few guys with their.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their mind is so fucking strong.</v>

1716
01:15:45.131 --> 01:15:50.131
<v Speaker 4>Their work ethic is so strong and their </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to pull shit off like Cain has </v>

1717
01:15:50.321 --> 01:15:53.080
<v Speaker 4>got this fucking wicked belief in </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>

1718
01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:58.081
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could see it in that dude's eyes </v>

1719
01:15:58.081 --> 01:15:58.081
<v Speaker 4>before he goes out there and fights and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got that big ink and head,</v>

1720
01:15:58.081 --> 01:15:59.770
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's a fucking super athlete,</v>

1721
01:15:59.771 --> 01:16:00.310
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1722
01:16:00.311 --> 01:16:01.900
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't look like,</v>

1723
01:16:01.901 --> 01:16:03.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your standard super athlete.</v>

1724
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:08.430
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't have like super low body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't have like a ridiculous six </v>

1725
01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:10.060
<v Speaker 4>pack and veins everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't look like a Kevin Randleman.</v>

1726
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:12.970
<v Speaker 4>But that's also one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 4>the motherfucker never gets tired.</v>

1727
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:14.560
<v Speaker 4>That guy never gets tired.</v>

1728
01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:19.560
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's got conditioning like Cain </v>

1729
01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:19.560
<v Speaker 4>Velasquez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1730
01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:19.560
<v Speaker 4>I think that God could do anything he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants.</v>

1731
01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1732
01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:24.130
<v Speaker 4>we're lucky to have him as a UFC </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight champion,</v>

1733
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:26.230
<v Speaker 4>but he would be whatever the fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to be.</v>

1734
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:28.420
<v Speaker 4>If he wanted to play football,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd be playing football.</v>

1735
01:16:28.421 --> 01:16:33.421
<v Speaker 4>If you wanted to play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want it to be a heavyweight </v>

1736
01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:35.341
<v Speaker 4>boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd be a bad ass fucking heavyweight </v>

1737
01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:35.341
<v Speaker 4>boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy's just,</v>

1738
01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:38.100
<v Speaker 4>he's just a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certain dudes that are just </v>

1739
01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:38.100
<v Speaker 4>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He should do like the cover of espn,</v>

1740
01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:42.630
<v Speaker 4>like in a chill outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just rare that Mexicans are taking </v>

1741
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:44.110
<v Speaker 4>this ride with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go with it.</v>

1742
01:16:44.111 --> 01:16:45.550
<v Speaker 4>With that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a baseball cap,</v>

1743
01:16:45.551 --> 01:16:48.250
<v Speaker 4>with the front flipped all the way up </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a suicidal tendency.</v>

1744
01:16:48.251 --> 01:16:49.360
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 4>his fucking head and he would just Jack </v>

1759
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:40.870
<v Speaker 4>the closest third world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Latin country to Vegas.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1762
01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.590
<v Speaker 4>because really Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guatemalans,</v>

1763
01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 4>El Salvadorians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Colombians felt the same shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Vegas and La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1767
01:17:55.001 --> 01:17:59.410
<v Speaker 4>I'd love Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Mexican in case you guys were all </v>

1768
01:17:59.410 --> 01:17:59.830

<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

1771
01:18:03.201 --> 01:18:08.201
<v Speaker 4>But the Mexicans figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in boxing a way to be super </v>

1772
01:18:08.201 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 4>fucking successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1776
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:18.550

<v Speaker 4>in particular have been really </v>

1777
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.860
<v Speaker 4>successful at boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1778
01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:19.420
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1779
01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:24.450
<v Speaker 4>they've brought up some incredible </v>
<v Speaker 4>boxers out of Mexico and they have the </v>

1780
01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:27.020
<v Speaker 4>most loyal fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Mexican fans are fucking not nuts.</v>

1781
01:18:27.021 --> 01:18:29.570
<v Speaker 4>Erik Morales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when that dude was on top,</v>

1782
01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:34.980
<v Speaker 4>God damn they go for the most Mexican </v>
<v Speaker 4>tick is when Julio Cesar Chavez was at </v>

1783
01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:36.230
<v Speaker 4>his prime when he fought Oscar de la </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hoya.</v>

1784
01:18:36.231 --> 01:18:41.231
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was actually falling off as a little </v>

1785
01:18:41.231 --> 01:18:42.410
<v Speaker 4>bit and Oscar Delgado is rising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to choose a side you want.</v>

1786
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.260
<v Speaker 4>They all went with the most Mexican and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Mexican Julio,</v>

1787
01:18:45.261 --> 01:18:50.261
<v Speaker 4>Cesar Chavez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't even speak a word of </v>

1788
01:18:50.261 --> 01:18:50.261
<v Speaker 4>English.</v>

1789
01:18:50.261 --> 01:18:50.261
<v Speaker 4>He was a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1790
01:18:50.261 --> 01:18:53.650
<v Speaker 4>he was a fucking beast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would just body punch the fucking </v>

1791
01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:54.860
<v Speaker 4>shit out of you who just stay on top of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you until you eventually just broke you.</v>

1792
01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.580
<v Speaker 4>I was a giant boxing fan before the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1793
01:18:58.770 --> 01:19:03.770
<v Speaker 4>I was just a fanatic with boxing because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was for mma and UFC and I loved them </v>

1794
01:19:04.301 --> 01:19:05.510
<v Speaker 4>both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw Oscar de la Hoya,</v>

1795
01:19:05.511 --> 01:19:08.210
<v Speaker 4>his first pro fight at the La Forum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a huge fan,</v>

1796
01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:10.250
<v Speaker 4>but I had to make a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

1797
01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.600
<v Speaker 4>I chose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I chose Julio.</v>

1798
01:19:11.601 --> 01:19:14.570
<v Speaker 4>Cesar Chavez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to see a Berrera fight live.</v>

1799
01:19:14.571 --> 01:19:17.450
<v Speaker 4>I saw him fight live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was in la somewhere.</v>

1800
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:22.510
<v Speaker 4>I want to say it's a stable center,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it might've been before the staples </v>

1801
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.510
<v Speaker 4>center even existed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where the fuck I saw him,</v>

1802
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:24.980
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw him fight some other dudes,</v>

1803
01:19:24.981 --> 01:19:26.270
<v Speaker 4>some black dude that was pretty good.</v>

1804
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:29.780
<v Speaker 4>But Berrera beat his ass and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were all hanging out with Mexicans.</v>

1805
01:19:29.781 --> 01:19:34.781
<v Speaker 4>It's me and my friend Terry clay bond as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a boxing coach and we're all watching </v>

1806
01:19:34.781 --> 01:19:38.291
<v Speaker 4>this date.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were going fucking bananas when </v>

1807
01:19:38.291 --> 01:19:39.650
<v Speaker 4>Barrera was going off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were going fucking bananas.</v>

1808
01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:44.670
<v Speaker 4>It's boxing is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when the racism just fucking </v>

1809
01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:46.160
<v Speaker 4>comes out and it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's okay to be racist if there's boxing</v>

1810
01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:49.460
<v Speaker 4>going on because when I met anytime of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexican fought,</v>

1811
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:52.220
<v Speaker 4>anybody else I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always went for the Mexican.</v>

1812
01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.790
<v Speaker 4>Even if it wasn't Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he was Honduran and he was fighting a</v>

1813
01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 4>white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going with a Latin guy.</v>

1814
01:19:57.681 --> 01:19:59.450
<v Speaker 4>That's the closest thing to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>

1815
01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.550
<v Speaker 4>It was okay with my best friend growing </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1816
01:20:01.551 --> 01:20:02.480
<v Speaker 4>James.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was black.</v>

1817
01:20:02.481 --> 01:20:05.390
<v Speaker 4>We were both into boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He always went for the black guy.</v>

1818
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:07.470
<v Speaker 4>I always went for the Mexican guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always.</v>

1819
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.830
<v Speaker 4>He never went for the Mexican guy and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>went for the black guy that would and it</v>

1820
01:20:10.831 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 4>was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1821
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:15.210
<v Speaker 4>but NMA job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally different.</v>

1822
01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:18.940
<v Speaker 4>I can in MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can care less if the guys Mexican,</v>

1823
01:20:18.941 --> 01:20:22.230
<v Speaker 4>what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Style style is way thicker than blood.</v>

1824
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:24.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Jujitsu guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always going.</v>

1825
01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:26.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm always pulling for the Jujitsu guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always.</v>

1826
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:31.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if it's a black Jujitsu guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>against a kick boxer from Mexico from </v>

1827
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:33.470
<v Speaker 4>where my mom was born.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1828
01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:36.500
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going for the Black Jujitsu guy.</v>

1829
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:41.900
<v Speaker 4>It's always Jujitsu style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to think that your Jujitsu </v>

1830
01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.230
<v Speaker 4>instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's styles way thicker than blood,</v>

1831
01:20:43.231 --> 01:20:48.231
<v Speaker 4>but boxing shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people think that I pulled for </v>

1832
01:20:48.231 --> 01:20:48.231
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1833
01:20:48.231 --> 01:20:48.900
<v Speaker 4>but most of my favorite fighters are </v>
<v Speaker 4>strikers.</v>

1834
01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:54.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pull for a pool for extra </v>

1835
01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:56.160
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I pulled for.</v>

1836
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't pull for like individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1837
01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.130
<v Speaker 4>I pull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to.</v>

1838
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.020
<v Speaker 4>I want to see some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1839
01:21:01.021 --> 01:21:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's a guy who I thought was </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good before,</v>

1840
01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.780
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden they pull something</v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

1841
01:21:06.781 --> 01:21:08.640
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes you look at them differently.</v>

1842
01:21:08.641 --> 01:21:10.530
<v Speaker 4>That's what my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my favorite shit.</v>

1843
01:21:10.531 --> 01:21:15.531
<v Speaker 4>I like watching two guys push it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just watched like watching guys </v>

1844
01:21:15.531 --> 01:21:16.530
<v Speaker 4>improve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys that are really good.</v>

1845
01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like just the best submission guys.</v>

1846
01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Those are always my friend Aoki.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's always like that too.</v>

1847
01:21:23.611 --> 01:21:26.290
<v Speaker 4>But I still like watching Anderson man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like watching it.</v>

1848
01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:27.900
<v Speaker 4>You can't deny that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely.</v>

1849
01:21:27.901 --> 01:21:31.020
<v Speaker 4>I love knockouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who Doesn't love a great knockout.</v>

1850
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:36.140
<v Speaker 4>I love that shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm always pulling for cool new </v>

1851
01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.250
<v Speaker 4>submissions because there's so much room</v>
<v Speaker 4>for improvement and Jitsu and mma.</v>

1852
01:21:38.251 --> 01:21:39.180
<v Speaker 4>There's so much room.</v>

1853
01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:41.340
<v Speaker 4>It's still at its infancy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1854
01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:45.270
<v Speaker 4>there's something special to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's sounds kind of fucked up,</v>

1855
01:21:45.271 --> 01:21:50.271
<v Speaker 4>but there's something special to me when</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy has reached the extraordinary </v>

1856
01:21:50.271 --> 01:21:54.411
<v Speaker 4>heights that like Anderson Silva has </v>
<v Speaker 4>that word and he's standing right in </v>

1857
01:21:54.411 --> 01:21:54.740
<v Speaker 4>front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chanel calming,</v>

1858
01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.700
<v Speaker 4>standing right in front of him with his </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands down,</v>

1859
01:21:56.850 --> 01:21:59.460
<v Speaker 4>his fist balled up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you just realize like,</v>

1860
01:21:59.461 --> 01:22:04.461
<v Speaker 4>this poor fucking mouse is in a box with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Cobra and it's going to get jacked up.</v>

1861
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:09.830
<v Speaker 4>It's going to get jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You realize that you was trapped in </v>

1862
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.960
<v Speaker 4>there with Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't.</v>

1863
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:14.990
<v Speaker 4>He was no longer competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a moment after he had kicked </v>

1864
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.780
<v Speaker 4>him at the end of the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fucking blasting and with a headache.</v>

1865
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.360
<v Speaker 4>And from that moment on you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was not competitive.</v>

1866
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.400
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anderson knew it too.</v>

1867
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:22.680
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you take one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>head kicks and be okay.</v>

1868
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean you might look okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fall down,</v>

1869
01:22:24.661 --> 01:22:26.040
<v Speaker 4>you get back up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look okay,</v>

1870
01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:28.770
<v Speaker 4>but your shit is done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1871
01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Anderson just got in front of them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>started moving around on him and it was </v>

1872
01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:35.400
<v Speaker 4>just when you watch someone have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>skill level,</v>

1873
01:22:35.401 --> 01:22:36.900
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what they're doing,</v>

1874
01:22:36.901 --> 01:22:39.090
<v Speaker 4>if they're doing boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're doing Jujitsu,</v>

1875
01:22:39.091 --> 01:22:40.850
<v Speaker 4>if they're just kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1876
01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:45.860
<v Speaker 4>that's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like watching someone is just hitting </v>

1877
01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.370
<v Speaker 4>those rare heights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about t j grant pulling guard with a</v>

1878
01:22:47.371 --> 01:22:52.371
<v Speaker 4>good team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude pops his head out and switches to </v>

1879
01:22:52.371 --> 01:22:52.371
<v Speaker 4>that beautiful and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was amazing.</v>

1880
01:22:52.371 --> 01:22:53.610
<v Speaker 4>Even though there's controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1881
01:22:53.611 --> 01:22:54.150
<v Speaker 4>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1882
01:22:54.151 --> 01:22:56.430
<v Speaker 4>he didn't tap it all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some controversy there though.</v>

1883
01:22:56.431 --> 01:23:01.431
<v Speaker 4>But the fact that tj grant was so </v>
<v Speaker 4>confident in his guard that he pulled </v>

1884
01:23:01.431 --> 01:23:06.351
<v Speaker 4>guard with a good team because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys don't like pulling guard with a </v>

1885
01:23:06.351 --> 01:23:06.351
<v Speaker 4>good thing because if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the guy pops his</v>

1886
01:23:06.351 --> 01:23:06.760
<v Speaker 2>head out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1887
01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:09.550
<v Speaker 2>and he gets out of the good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh you're on your back and he's on top.</v>

1888
01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:14.940
<v Speaker 2>But when clearly did it in a sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy was defending with his left arm </v>

1889
01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:15.520
<v Speaker 2>and he knew he was going to get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>arm.</v>

1890
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.770
<v Speaker 2>He knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as the guys defending shit,</v>

1891
01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.710
<v Speaker 2>it lets it go and goes to the arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so confident of.</v>

1892
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:24.880
<v Speaker 2>So few fighters are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just not confident I'll fighting</v>

1893
01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:25.950
<v Speaker 2>off their backs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1894
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.890
<v Speaker 2>there's so many Brazilian black belts </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there moon our champion too.</v>

1895
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 2>They just refused to pull guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

1896
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:35.060
<v Speaker 2>they don't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1897
01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:40.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me it just seems like they don't </v>

1898
01:23:40.710 --> 01:23:41.920
<v Speaker 2>have enough confidence in the guard had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing Jujitsu for a long time.</v>

1899
01:23:41.921 --> 01:23:44.130
<v Speaker 2>And it's refreshing to see someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tj grants.</v>

1900
01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1901
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm having trouble taking this guy down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just pull guard and attack off my</v>

1902
01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:48.400
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1903
01:23:48.401 --> 01:23:50.270
<v Speaker 2>he almost got him with an arm bar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1904
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:55.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first round he had locked up an arm </v>

1905
01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:55.600
<v Speaker 2>bar and went belly down at the very last</v>
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

1906
01:23:55.601 --> 01:24:00.601
<v Speaker 2>So the first roundup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a beast man at one thing that kids </v>

1907
01:24:00.601 --> 01:24:02.330
<v Speaker 2>a killer t j grant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew he was talented when I first used</v>

1908
01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:06.310
<v Speaker 2>fought real tony and his UFC debut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough fight for UFC debut.</v>

1909
01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Anyone want a decision?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1910
01:24:08.111 --> 01:24:10.360
<v Speaker 2>this fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about Paul Sas?</v>

1911
01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.150
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't fought in like a year and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1912
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:18.510
<v Speaker 2>the first I've ever heard of Paul Sassy </v>
<v Speaker 2>was finding on the undercard in an </v>

1913
01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:21.751
<v Speaker 2>England show over a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a headline on the underground</v>

1914
01:24:21.971 --> 01:24:24.580
<v Speaker 2>and said the headline was I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall up,</v>

1915
01:24:24.581 --> 01:24:25.780
<v Speaker 2>fight off my back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1916
01:24:25.781 --> 01:24:29.350
<v Speaker 2>you never have seen that as a headline </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a fighter in some interview.</v>

1917
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I liked to fight off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My back is so dangerous.</v>

1918
01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Offers back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>

1923
01:24:41.891 --> 01:24:42.670
<v Speaker 2>pulls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guard,</v>

1924
01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.530
<v Speaker 2>attacks off his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy stands up,</v>

1925
01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:45.520
<v Speaker 2>pulls away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>runs away.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he shoots deep,</v>

1927
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:50.410

<v Speaker 2>pulls guard,</v>

1928
01:24:50.411 --> 01:24:55.411
<v Speaker 2>attack some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy pulls out of Inova bladder or </v>

1929
01:24:55.411 --> 01:24:55.411
<v Speaker 2>triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go again.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Third time he shoots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulls,</v>

1931
01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:56.920

<v Speaker 2>goes after like a leg lock.</v>

1932
01:24:56.921 --> 01:24:58.000
<v Speaker 2>He just misses it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

1933
01:24:58.001 --> 01:25:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instill in the first round.</v>

1934
01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:05.190
<v Speaker 2>He shot again for a fourth time shot the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude sprawled.</v>

1935
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:10.200
<v Speaker 2>He pulled guard and then he got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got them like there's a guy out there</v>

1936
01:25:10.751 --> 01:25:15.751
<v Speaker 2>named Paul Sas who so confident on </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting his back and he's people don't </v>

1937
01:25:15.751 --> 01:25:17.740
<v Speaker 2>want anything to do with his guard.</v>

1938
01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.480
<v Speaker 2>He sits on his ass and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

1939
01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:20.770
<v Speaker 2>get on top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm spotting you.</v>

1940
01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm spotting.</v>

1941
01:25:21.821 --> 01:25:24.880
<v Speaker 2>You guys will refuse to get in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>guard.</v>

1942
01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:25.870
<v Speaker 2>You would think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1943
01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:27.340
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is going to go on his back.</v>

1944
01:25:27.341 --> 01:25:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go on top and just mash them.</v>

1945
01:25:28.931 --> 01:25:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe he's just submitting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going on his back.</v>

1946
01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:36.900
<v Speaker 2>His guard is so dangerous guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hard part is getting guys to agree </v>

1947
01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.770
<v Speaker 2>to get into his guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's unique.</v>

1948
01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.410
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love seeing that.</v>

1949
01:25:41.411 --> 01:25:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Paul says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tj Grant,</v>

1950
01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:46.140
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm huge fans of those guys.</v>

1951
01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:51.141
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what what it is is that people are </v>

1952
01:25:51.141 --> 01:25:52.921
<v Speaker 2>realizing that there's a level that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible to achieve that hasn't been </v>

1953
01:25:52.921 --> 01:25:57.001
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated yet and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people in straight Jujitsu and </v>

1954
01:25:57.001 --> 01:25:58.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street submission grappling,</v>

1955
01:25:58.421 --> 01:26:01.810
<v Speaker 2>but in an mma when you add in all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>

1956
01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:03.860
<v Speaker 2>we haven't seen anybody pull it off.</v>

1957
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:09.220
<v Speaker 4>We haven't ever ever seen like the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marcello Garcia went through all those </v>

1958
01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:12.280
<v Speaker 4>competitors in Abu Dhabi in 2003 when we</v>
<v Speaker 4>first saw Marcello in person.</v>

1959
01:26:12.490 --> 01:26:15.110
<v Speaker 4>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy is like a speed demon.</v>

1960
01:26:15.111 --> 01:26:20.111
<v Speaker 4>The way he was going through people like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the banality to his technique was so </v>

1961
01:26:20.111 --> 01:26:20.500
<v Speaker 4>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1962
01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.950
<v Speaker 4>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1963
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:27.040
<v Speaker 4>it's a different world when you add in </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling and when you add in punching </v>

1964
01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.910
<v Speaker 4>and you had a nice and kicks and this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a different world.</v>

1965
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:32.140
<v Speaker 4>We haven't quite seen someone hit those </v>
<v Speaker 4>heights of submission.</v>

1966
01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:33.920
<v Speaker 4>We're starting to see it though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are.</v>

1967
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:38.950
<v Speaker 4>There are a handful of fighters that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have zero problem pulling guard and </v>

1968
01:26:39.141 --> 01:26:41.880
<v Speaker 4>Vinny Maga classes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One he used to fight in the UFC.</v>

1969
01:26:41.881 --> 01:26:45.680
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't one of the seasons of tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He pulls guard like he doesn't mind.</v>

1970
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:50.860
<v Speaker 4>His guard is so dangerous that he will </v>
<v Speaker 4>pull garden and attack you and you know </v>

1971
01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:51.000
<v Speaker 4>that again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's Paul Sassy.</v>

1972
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.930
<v Speaker 4>Paul South fought last week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did the exact same thing.</v>

1973
01:26:53.931 --> 01:26:57.620
<v Speaker 4>He pulled guard guy pulled out of an arm</v>
<v Speaker 4>bar or a triangle and then you switch it</v>

1974
01:26:57.621 --> 01:26:59.550
<v Speaker 4>to a leg lock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a beautiful leg lock.</v>

1975
01:26:59.551 --> 01:27:04.551
<v Speaker 4>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then like Aoki will pull guard </v>

1976
01:27:04.551 --> 01:27:05.210
<v Speaker 4>anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you see Matt Wyman and Mac Dancer.</v>

1977
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:06.440
<v Speaker 4>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

1978
01:27:06.441 --> 01:27:09.520
<v Speaker 4>why am I got Mac dancing and a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>serious arm bar.</v>

1979
01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:11.570
<v Speaker 4>He didn't tap him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm like whoa.</v>

1980
01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.930
<v Speaker 4>That was quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had hit a nice arm bar for his back.</v>

1981
01:27:14.931 --> 01:27:16.910
<v Speaker 4>If Mac Danzig didn't have such good </v>
<v Speaker 4>defense,</v>

1982
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:22.030
<v Speaker 4>he woulda got that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're starting to see more and more </v>

1983
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:23.360
<v Speaker 4>fighters beat active once they get put </v>
<v Speaker 4>on their back,</v>

1984
01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:26.300
<v Speaker 4>like if they got put on their back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't want to be there.</v>

1985
01:27:26.301 --> 01:27:28.670
<v Speaker 4>Like Miguel Torres,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he gets put on his back,</v>

1986
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.560
<v Speaker 4>he will attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just not going to sit there.</v>

1987
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:32.960
<v Speaker 4>Havi Vasquez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just not going to sit there.</v>

1988
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:35.170
<v Speaker 4>He says he's going to attack you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the,</v>

1989
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:36.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you got guys like,</v>

1990
01:27:36.981 --> 01:27:37.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1991
01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:41.240
<v Speaker 4>rumble Johnson who wants to be on top of</v>
<v Speaker 4>rumble.</v>

1992
01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Johnson had a guard to rumbled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnson's frightening.</v>

1993
01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.980
<v Speaker 4>And you see that fight with Charlie </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brennan.</v>

1994
01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:48.740
<v Speaker 4>He's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His eyes look orange.</v>

1995
01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:51.740
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if he's wearing contacts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's had surgery on his eyes.</v>

1996
01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.060
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Poked.</v>

1997
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:58.090
<v Speaker 4>He got poked really bad by Kevin Burns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember Kevin Burns could not close his</v>

1998
01:27:58.161 --> 01:28:03.161
<v Speaker 4>lefthand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Burns broke his left hand so many </v>

1999
01:28:03.161 --> 01:28:03.161
<v Speaker 4>times that he literally couldn't close </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2000
01:28:03.161 --> 01:28:07.450
<v Speaker 4>So he would like Paul with his left and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then throw his right and he poked the </v>

2001
01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:10.790
<v Speaker 4>fucking shit out of his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Johnson's a Jesus.</v>

2002
01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:12.490
<v Speaker 4>He's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

2003
01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 4>he's a true super athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2004
01:28:14.481 --> 01:28:19.481
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all the idea that that guy can </v>

2005
01:28:19.481 --> 01:28:19.481
<v Speaker 4>get the 70.</v>

2006
01:28:19.481 --> 01:28:21.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like it defies logic defies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It defies reason.</v>

2007
01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at them and you go,</v>

2008
01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.190
<v Speaker 4>you see them in between fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's a heavyweight,</v>

2009
01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.370
<v Speaker 4>that's a goddamn heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then somehow or another it makes one</v>

2010
01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:33.380
<v Speaker 4>70 and he looks fucking great the day of</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever he's doing and he's doing it </v>

2011
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:33.380
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2012
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:35.800
<v Speaker 4>I just wonder if it takes so much out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>him that it would.</v>

2013
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what he does at one 70,</v>

2014
01:28:37.791 --> 01:28:42.791
<v Speaker 4>he could probably do it one 85 to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he might even feel better if it </v>

2015
01:28:42.791 --> 01:28:44.060
<v Speaker 4>was doing it at 1:35,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might feel healthier.</v>

2016
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2017
01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:49.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm only just taking wild stabs </v>

2018
01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:52.961
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I don't think it's so good </v>

2019
01:28:52.961 --> 01:28:52.961
<v Speaker 4>to cut that much weight for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's terrible for your body,</v>

2020
01:28:52.961 --> 01:28:54.350
<v Speaker 4>but whatever the fuck he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2021
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:55.980
<v Speaker 4>when he gets in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2022
01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:58.490
<v Speaker 4>very few guys move as quick as that guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>

2023
01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.020
<v Speaker 4>Very few guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he's like,</v>

2024
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:02.310
<v Speaker 4>when we were siting Charlie Brennan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2025
01:29:02.311 --> 01:29:04.380
<v Speaker 4>he didn't respect Brennaman standup that</v>
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

2026
01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:09.381
<v Speaker 4>She was worried about his wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he knew that he had a big standup </v>

2027
01:29:09.381 --> 01:29:12.141
<v Speaker 4>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could tell he was in the confidence </v>

2028
01:29:12.141 --> 01:29:12.141
<v Speaker 4>that he had when he moved forward and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was watching.</v>

2029
01:29:12.141 --> 01:29:12.450
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is terrifying.</v>

2030
01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.460
<v Speaker 4>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he's confident,</v>

2031
01:29:14.461 --> 01:29:16.560
<v Speaker 4>when he's confident and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's real,</v>

2032
01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:21.770
<v Speaker 4>real short is going to tag you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was the finals of tough when he </v>

2033
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:25.071
<v Speaker 4>fought that Tommy spirits kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he's real confident that his </v>

2034
01:29:25.071 --> 01:29:25.470
<v Speaker 4>standup is way better than you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so dangerous.</v>

2035
01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:29.720
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the scariest guys at one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even scarier than Tiago thiago.</v>

2036
01:29:29.721 --> 01:29:31.740
<v Speaker 4>Alves is probably the best technical </v>
<v Speaker 4>striker,</v>

2037
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.510
<v Speaker 4>but Anthony Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he gets you hurt,</v>

2038
01:29:33.511 --> 01:29:36.120
<v Speaker 4>he's the scariest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a scariest.</v>

2039
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:41.290
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's got like a gnarly </v>

2040
01:29:41.290 --> 01:29:41.290
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>

2041
01:29:41.290 --> 01:29:41.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what you've seen now,</v>

2042
01:29:41.290 --> 01:29:42.360
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy's going to get better.</v>

2043
01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.370
<v Speaker 4>He's getting better already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just,</v>

2044
01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:47.550
<v Speaker 4>he's just a freak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking awesome athlete.</v>

2045
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's racialist.</v>

2046
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:50.910
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just reality,</v>

2047
01:29:50.911 --> 01:29:51.600
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he was white,</v>

2048
01:29:51.601 --> 01:29:54.060
<v Speaker 4>I'd say the same goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever he's doing,</v>

2049
01:29:54.090 --> 01:29:55.680
<v Speaker 4>he's doing awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

2050
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:58.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard work and discipline for sure.</v>

2051
01:29:58.590 --> 01:30:03.060
<v Speaker 4>Go into all any recipe for success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that guy is a,</v>

2052
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:04.310
<v Speaker 4>he's a special athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

2053
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.510
<v Speaker 4>he's built the fuck people up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2054
01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:08.190
<v Speaker 4>this is a good sport for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2055
01:30:08.191 --> 01:30:13.191
<v Speaker 4>there's certain guys like John Jones </v>
<v Speaker 4>always says that he can't fucking throw </v>

2056
01:30:13.191 --> 01:30:13.260
<v Speaker 4>a football.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not,</v>

2057
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:15.360
<v Speaker 4>he's not good at basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't dunk,</v>

2058
01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:19.050
<v Speaker 4>but Goddamn as he designed perfect for </v>
<v Speaker 4>mma,</v>

2059
01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:24.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jon Jones has the literally the perfect </v>

2060
01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:24.380
<v Speaker 4>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2061
01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:28.140
<v Speaker 4>that that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at all the people that are </v>

2062
01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:28.140
<v Speaker 4>fighting right now and all the different</v>
<v Speaker 4>equations,</v>

2063
01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how would you get to this guy?</v>

2064
01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:31.370
<v Speaker 4>How would you beat that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do?</v>

2065
01:30:31.630 --> 01:30:32.870
<v Speaker 4>You get to John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

2066
01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.290
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>

2067
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:38.250
<v Speaker 4>And I love the fact that the navy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not a striker,</v>

2068
01:30:38.251 --> 01:30:39.560
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of striking.</v>

2069
01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:42.120
<v Speaker 4>It was a big boxing fan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

2070
01:30:42.121 --> 01:30:47.121
<v Speaker 4>More and more fighters are starting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>implement taekwondo and Kung Fu kinks.</v>

2071
01:30:47.911 --> 01:30:49.250
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2072
01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.870
<v Speaker 4>and guys like John Jones and Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 4>Silva,</v>

2073
01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:55.020
<v Speaker 4>they're doing Kung Fu there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're throwing wing Chung kicks,</v>

2074
01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:59.850
<v Speaker 4>that taekwondo kicks and that one got 45</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it.</v>

2075
01:30:59.851 --> 01:31:03.240
<v Speaker 4>Dustin Dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy was just an awesome kicker.</v>

2076
01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:07.890
<v Speaker 4>Dustin Dennis Doonas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

2077
01:31:08.730 --> 01:31:09.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's at 45.</v>

2078
01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:14.550
<v Speaker 4>He fought hoodie fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He Find Florian.</v>

2079
01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:15.990
<v Speaker 4>Kenny Florian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2080
01:31:15.991 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 4>Diego Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Diego knew he's a sales guy.</v>

2081
01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Watch him over one young guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2082
01:31:22.621 --> 01:31:27.621
<v Speaker 4>That guy can kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got great kick Nova and Y'all guys </v>

2083
01:31:27.621 --> 01:31:28.950
<v Speaker 4>married.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of those guys are wicked kickers.</v>

2084
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:33.950
<v Speaker 4>I would say a good 80 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>85 percent of of MMA fighters today are </v>

2085
01:31:35.221 --> 01:31:37.170
<v Speaker 4>just throwing the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2086
01:31:37.210 --> 01:31:40.440
<v Speaker 4>tight leg kick and then a head kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally.</v>

2087
01:31:40.441 --> 01:31:44.140
<v Speaker 4>Maybe a spinning back kick or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love guys to just throw it all,</v>

2088
01:31:44.190 --> 01:31:44.940
<v Speaker 4>throw it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2089
01:31:44.941 --> 01:31:48.610
<v Speaker 4>usually those guys have a taekwondo or </v>
<v Speaker 4>karate background because in in,</v>

2090
01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:50.550
<v Speaker 4>in normal mma training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2091
01:31:50.551 --> 01:31:55.551
<v Speaker 4>it's way harder to teach someone how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>throw a sidekick then as how to teach </v>

2092
01:31:55.551 --> 01:31:55.551
<v Speaker 4>them and throw a round kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:31:55.551 --> 01:32:00.110
<v Speaker 4>I could teach you to throw a low kick </v>
<v Speaker 4>and throw it correctly in a couple of </v>

2094
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:02.140
<v Speaker 4>and in any normal athlete football </v>
<v Speaker 4>player,</v>

2095
01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:04.330
<v Speaker 4>a baseball player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any normal athlete can perform that,</v>

2096
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:06.400
<v Speaker 4>but if I say or I do a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll kick.</v>

2097
01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:09.490
<v Speaker 4>I want you to do a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll kick with power like Jesus Christ.</v>

2098
01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:12.640
<v Speaker 4>That takes a long time to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're.</v>

2099
01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.170
<v Speaker 4>Even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a super athlete,</v>

2100
01:32:14.171 --> 01:32:17.200
<v Speaker 4>it's going to take a while to pick up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let Jon Jones is throwing it.</v>

2101
01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:18.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course with John Jones,</v>

2102
01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:23.940
<v Speaker 4>he's training for quite awhile now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is it's like it's not </v>

2103
01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.360
<v Speaker 4>easy to pick up those certain techniques</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sidekicks.</v>

2104
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:27.820
<v Speaker 4>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John's got a wicked sidekick now too,</v>

2105
01:32:27.821 --> 01:32:28.720
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got a front leg.</v>

2106
01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:31.690
<v Speaker 4>Scientificky hops forward to he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was throwing,</v>

2107
01:32:31.691 --> 01:32:33.210
<v Speaker 4>Spinning back X.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He.</v>

2108
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:36.910
<v Speaker 4>He threw a hopping sidekick against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cage and they'll just a warm up.</v>

2109
01:32:36.911 --> 01:32:38.110
<v Speaker 4>Like I was using warming up and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2110
01:32:38.111 --> 01:32:40.120
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's doing it perfectly.</v>

2111
01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:42.220
<v Speaker 4>Knee up high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turning the hip.</v>

2112
01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:44.740
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] pretty much proved that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2113
01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:49.960
<v Speaker 4>all of those Kung Fu kicks or to work </v>
<v Speaker 4>Connolly's got the best threesixty </v>

2114
01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:52.300
<v Speaker 4>turning side kick in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2115
01:32:52.301 --> 01:32:57.301
<v Speaker 4>and that's one of his sidekicks or one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the things that makes his fight with </v>

2116
01:32:57.301 --> 01:33:01.050
<v Speaker 4>vandelay so interesting because when </v>
<v Speaker 4>American kickboxer started fighting tie </v>

2117
01:33:01.050 --> 01:33:02.160
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they found two things out.</v>

2118
01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.930
<v Speaker 4>The one they found out how difficult it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is to deal with leg kicks.</v>

2119
01:33:04.931 --> 01:33:06.760
<v Speaker 4>They were getting fucked up by leg </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicks,</v>

2120
01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:10.610
<v Speaker 4>but guys like Don Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a he,</v>

2121
01:33:10.611 --> 01:33:14.200
<v Speaker 4>he learned leg kicks early on and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>fought a lot of leg kick fights.</v>

2122
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:17.800
<v Speaker 4>He realized how good the front leg side </v>
<v Speaker 4>kick was.</v>

2123
01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:20.190
<v Speaker 4>The front leg roundhouse kick it kicks </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2124
01:33:20.191 --> 01:33:22.870
<v Speaker 4>The ties weren't that good at ties would</v>
<v Speaker 4>throw the team,</v>

2125
01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:24.340
<v Speaker 4>but they would get close enough to each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

2126
01:33:24.341 --> 01:33:27.550
<v Speaker 4>Jack each other's legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you fight that style,</v>

2127
01:33:27.551 --> 01:33:32.551
<v Speaker 4>where you kick the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't necessarily develop the </v>

2128
01:33:32.551 --> 01:33:33.250
<v Speaker 4>techniques like the karate techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the chronic techniques,</v>

2129
01:33:33.251 --> 01:33:35.260
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're coming up through the ranks,</v>

2130
01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:40.380
<v Speaker 4>they kind of get shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know by a lot of the Thai </v>

2131
01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:41.200
<v Speaker 4>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you learn karate before you learn</v>

2132
01:33:41.201 --> 01:33:46.201
<v Speaker 4>more tie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have all that crazy dexterity </v>

2133
01:33:46.201 --> 01:33:46.480
<v Speaker 4>for acs kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll kicks and all that shit.</v>

2134
01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:51.480
<v Speaker 4>That may be one work as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If guys were kicking your legs so you </v>

2135
01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:51.970
<v Speaker 4>might have a more conservative game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2136
01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:53.860
<v Speaker 4>some guys that come up through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo ranks,</v>

2137
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:57.070
<v Speaker 4>those are the ones who do wild,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy shit because you can't get punched</v>

2138
01:33:57.071 --> 01:33:59.680
<v Speaker 4>in the face and taekwondo tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those guys,</v>

2139
01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:02.380
<v Speaker 4>when those guys get into Moitai,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's Diego Nunez.</v>

2140
01:34:02.381 --> 01:34:05.660
<v Speaker 4>That's Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's also Edson Barboza.</v>

2141
01:34:05.690 --> 01:34:07.210
<v Speaker 4>They got all that shit in their back </v>
<v Speaker 4>pocket.</v>

2142
01:34:07.211 --> 01:34:08.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Edson Barboza Guy.</v>

2143
01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:13.840
<v Speaker 4>So you would say you would say that it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>for kids.</v>

2144
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:18.870
<v Speaker 4>They're dreaming about being UFC </v>
<v Speaker 4>champions to do some taekwondo for a few</v>

2145
01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:20.110
<v Speaker 4>years just to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get all that.</v>

2146
01:34:20.130 --> 01:34:25.130
<v Speaker 4>The crazy kicks down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And stay balanced and maybe not even do </v>

2147
01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:28.561
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but incorporate a couple of days of </v>

2148
01:34:28.561 --> 01:34:32.221
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo training into your training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say if you were a new kid and you </v>

2149
01:34:32.221 --> 01:34:35.590
<v Speaker 4>were trying to become an mma fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you should do is at least one day a</v>

2150
01:34:35.591 --> 01:34:40.591
<v Speaker 4>week work on kicks because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things you could do by working on these </v>

2151
01:34:40.591 --> 01:34:42.510
<v Speaker 4>wild kicks is forget about the sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forget whatever.</v>

2152
01:34:42.511 --> 01:34:47.511
<v Speaker 4>Then you just want to work on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>technique and a kick and learn how to </v>

2153
01:34:47.511 --> 01:34:49.771
<v Speaker 4>kick things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Learn how to stretch out that front leg </v>

2154
01:34:49.771 --> 01:34:49.771
<v Speaker 4>side kick learned to wheelchair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn the ax kick.</v>

2155
01:34:49.771 --> 01:34:54.270
<v Speaker 4>Once you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do it with someone who's really </v>

2156
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:56.131
<v Speaker 4>good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see like the high level techniques </v>

2157
01:34:56.131 --> 01:34:56.740
<v Speaker 4>you see when someone and then that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you mirror and your mind and that's</v>

2158
01:34:56.741 --> 01:34:57.920
<v Speaker 4>what you try to recreate</v>

2159
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:59.690
<v Speaker 3>and that's how you get really good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

2160
01:34:59.810 --> 01:35:04.810
<v Speaker 3>When you add in kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those techniques go out the </v>

2161
01:35:04.810 --> 01:35:04.810
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you add in punches,</v>

2162
01:35:04.810 --> 01:35:05.840
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

2163
01:35:05.841 --> 01:35:07.910
<v Speaker 3>allows techniques go out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You add in punches,</v>

2164
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:09.380
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those techniques go out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>

2165
01:35:09.381 --> 01:35:14.381
<v Speaker 3>You had to take downs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those techniques go go out the </v>

2166
01:35:14.381 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 3>window in less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how to check kicks,</v>

2167
01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:18.230
<v Speaker 3>block takedowns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have good boxing,</v>

2168
01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:20.330
<v Speaker 3>so you have to have all those other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2169
01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:25.480
<v Speaker 3>Then you can use the taekwondo again </v>
<v Speaker 3>because then you have all these other </v>

2170
01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:29.081
<v Speaker 3>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's just another tool for the </v>

2171
01:35:29.081 --> 01:35:31.181
<v Speaker 3>arsenal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unless you have a fully rounded </v>

2172
01:35:31.181 --> 01:35:34.391
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those tools become problems like the </v>

2173
01:35:34.391 --> 01:35:37.751
<v Speaker 3>kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You rely on them too much and you drop </v>

2174
01:35:37.751 --> 01:35:39.821
<v Speaker 3>your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get punched in the face because </v>

2175
01:35:39.821 --> 01:35:39.821
<v Speaker 3>you're not used to being punched in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>

2176
01:35:39.821 --> 01:35:42.340
<v Speaker 3>so you have to develop good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good timing and distance for punches as </v>

2177
01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:42.890
<v Speaker 3>well as kicks.</v>

2178
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:45.590
<v Speaker 3>You have to change your game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you do change your game,</v>

2179
01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:50.800
<v Speaker 3>so that's the beauty of adding it in as </v>
<v Speaker 3>like one day a week or two days a week </v>

2180
01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:53.510
<v Speaker 3>where you just constantly work on only </v>
<v Speaker 3>those techniques.</v>

2181
01:35:53.670 --> 01:35:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Then you're doing all that other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

2182
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:57.800
<v Speaker 3>so you might actually be able to pull </v>
<v Speaker 3>them off.</v>

2183
01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:01.010
<v Speaker 3>I think eventually what we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to have is there's going to be like</v>

2184
01:36:01.011 --> 01:36:01.970
<v Speaker 3>a system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2185
01:36:01.971 --> 01:36:03.800
<v Speaker 3>when they train football players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2186
01:36:03.801 --> 01:36:04.260
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2187
01:36:04.261 --> 01:36:06.920
<v Speaker 3>they don't just just take a lucky guess </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2188
01:36:06.921 --> 01:36:09.080
<v Speaker 3>today we're going to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2189
01:36:09.081 --> 01:36:14.081
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that it's going to help </v>

2190
01:36:14.081 --> 01:36:15.611
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but today I want you to chop wood with </v>

2191
01:36:15.611 --> 01:36:15.611
<v Speaker 3>an ax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2192
01:36:15.611 --> 01:36:18.070
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it'll help if you pick up bags of </v>

2193
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.070
<v Speaker 3>sand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2194
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.070
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2195
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.190
<v Speaker 3>they don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2196
01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.810
<v Speaker 3>they know what the fuck they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're training football players,</v>

2197
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:23.330
<v Speaker 3>they know what they're doing when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're preparing plays,</v>

2198
01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:24.500
<v Speaker 3>they know what they're doing.</v>

2199
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:25.860
<v Speaker 3>You know when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when guys are,</v>

2200
01:36:25.930 --> 01:36:27.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're monitoring guys performances and</v>

2201
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:29.420
<v Speaker 3>measuring their time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their distance,</v>

2202
01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:34.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're running the 40 are running </v>

2203
01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:35.940
<v Speaker 3>100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were there trying to figure out </v>

2204
01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:37.660
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the best way to optimize </v>

2205
01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:40.241
<v Speaker 3>athleticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The eventually that's going to happen </v>

2206
01:36:40.241 --> 01:36:41.210
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to be a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach to mma training.</v>

2207
01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:42.800
<v Speaker 3>And there's gonna be a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different approaches.</v>

2208
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:48.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's gonna have their own little </v>

2209
01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:48.010
<v Speaker 3>style to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's gonna.</v>

2210
01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:51.070
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get to a point where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know exactly how many hours you're </v>

2211
01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:52.550
<v Speaker 3>supposed to train in a day before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's detrimental.</v>

2212
01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:55.270
<v Speaker 3>We know that even though you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2213
01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.290
<v Speaker 3>five hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't do it five hours a day.</v>

2214
01:36:57.291 --> 01:36:59.870
<v Speaker 3>It fucks you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know what's the right amount,</v>

2215
01:36:59.871 --> 01:37:02.660
<v Speaker 3>what is the exact program you should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>on as far as striking,</v>

2216
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:05.030
<v Speaker 3>what does he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the exact lessons you should be</v>

2217
01:37:05.031 --> 01:37:07.250
<v Speaker 3>learning every day because that's how it</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be treated.</v>

2218
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:12.250
<v Speaker 3>It should be treated as something you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to develop like a project you're </v>

2219
01:37:12.250 --> 01:37:13.790
<v Speaker 3>developing and it should be micromanage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should manage every single aspect of</v>

2220
01:37:13.791 --> 01:37:15.310
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should manage all the hold.</v>

2221
01:37:15.311 --> 01:37:18.110
<v Speaker 3>You should objective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>analyze all the different techniques,</v>

2222
01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:20.990
<v Speaker 3>all your vulnerabilities and sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would body types,</v>

2223
01:37:20.991 --> 01:37:22.700
<v Speaker 3>give you problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that shit.</v>

2224
01:37:22.710 --> 01:37:26.870
<v Speaker 3>It has to be treated like a science in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to really truly optimize it.</v>

2225
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Then you add in creativity and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to improvise,</v>

2226
01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:35.800
<v Speaker 3>improvise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the ability to fight hard and the </v>

2227
01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:35.800
<v Speaker 3>ability to be disciplined and get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>shape,</v>

2228
01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.360
<v Speaker 3>but eventually we're going to get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that point where people are getting so </v>

2229
01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:40.360
<v Speaker 3>good like these rory Mcdonald's of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

2230
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.250
<v Speaker 3>these young kids that are coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so fucking good.</v>

2231
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:45.140
<v Speaker 3>You see them improving every time you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see them,</v>

2232
01:37:45.141 --> 01:37:45.980
<v Speaker 3>they're way better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2233
01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.200
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually it's going to be.</v>

2234
01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:53.260
<v Speaker 3>It's going to have to be down to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>science because you're going to deal </v>

2235
01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:56.351
<v Speaker 3>with the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The abilities that people are going to </v>

2236
01:37:56.351 --> 01:37:56.351
<v Speaker 3>have are going to be so fucking high</v>

2237
01:37:56.351 --> 01:38:01.160
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know at the very top we're going to </v>

2238
01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 4>see guys that we can't even imagine </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we haven't seen them yet.</v>

2239
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:06.830
<v Speaker 4>We haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to look back on even like </v>

2240
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:08.340
<v Speaker 4>Vito Belfort or guys of this era that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are devastating.</v>

2241
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:10.380
<v Speaker 4>We're going to look back on them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2242
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:12.840
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if they fought the guise of 2030,</v>

2243
01:38:12.841 --> 01:38:17.841
<v Speaker 4>they'd probably get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the same way people look at </v>

2244
01:38:17.841 --> 01:38:18.880
<v Speaker 4>Rocky Marciano and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is Rocky Marciano?</v>

2245
01:38:18.881 --> 01:38:23.881
<v Speaker 4>And you're going to do the Vitaly </v>
<v Speaker 4>Klitschko fatality Klitschko seven feet </v>

2246
01:38:23.881 --> 01:38:27.201
<v Speaker 4>fucking tall is he's got a telephone </v>
<v Speaker 4>pole for a job and it would just blast </v>

2247
01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:29.100
<v Speaker 4>that poor little dude in the head all </v>
<v Speaker 4>day until he fell unconscious.</v>

2248
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.840
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what we're going to look back</v>

2249
01:38:30.841 --> 01:38:31.260
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2250
01:38:31.261 --> 01:38:33.480
<v Speaker 4>We're going to look back on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The greats like GSP.</v>

2251
01:38:33.481 --> 01:38:34.830
<v Speaker 4>We're going to look back on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2252
01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:40.100
<v Speaker 4>one day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know in the future where there's </v>

2253
01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:41.940
<v Speaker 4>going to be some super fucking freak </v>
<v Speaker 4>athlete who you think would probably </v>

2254
01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.230
<v Speaker 4>beat GSP fairly easily.</v>

2255
01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.550
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna Happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2256
01:38:44.850 --> 01:38:49.850
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen in all the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>classes were in the middle of the </v>

2257
01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:50.610
<v Speaker 4>fucking stream right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We haven't even come close to the dam.</v>

2258
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:54.150
<v Speaker 4>We're not even close to the full limits </v>
<v Speaker 4>of human potential.</v>

2259
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:57.420
<v Speaker 4>You think about the kind of freak </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletes that they have in basketball.</v>

2260
01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:00.720
<v Speaker 4>We wait until those all guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those all start fighting MMA fights.</v>

2261
01:39:01.090 --> 01:39:06.090
<v Speaker 4>Think about some of the amazing </v>
<v Speaker 4>specimens that choose to play baseball </v>

2262
01:39:06.090 --> 01:39:06.240
<v Speaker 4>because they're good sprinters and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>could run around,</v>

2263
01:39:06.290 --> 01:39:06.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2264
01:39:06.931 --> 01:39:07.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2265
01:39:07.711 --> 01:39:08.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2266
01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:13.200
<v Speaker 4>the basis real quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if those guys decided to start </v>

2267
01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:13.200
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2268
01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:14.190
<v Speaker 4>those are the,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2270
01:39:16.051 --> 01:39:19.610
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing Jujitsu a long time and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you trained,</v>

2271
01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:21.720
<v Speaker 4>you get to even a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2272
01:39:21.730 --> 01:39:24.070
<v Speaker 4>if you're going against a wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2273
01:39:24.190 --> 01:39:25.380
<v Speaker 4>you role with someone,</v>

<v Speaker 4>strength and you know,</v>

2279

<v Speaker 4>average unflexible person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>couple of years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2319
01:41:21.991 --> 01:41:22.210
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year later,</v>

2320
01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Sean ballinger is one of my black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the one who certified that school.</v>

2321
01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:28.540
<v Speaker 2>He gave him a purple belt after one </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2322
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:29.560
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2324
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:35.470
<v Speaker 2>So I invited him in all his breakdancers</v>
<v Speaker 2>over to headquarters,</v>

2325
01:41:35.471 --> 01:41:37.740

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a purple belt.</v>

2327
01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:41.380
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>

2330
01:41:46.271 --> 01:41:47.730
<v Speaker 2>I'd never felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2331
01:41:47.731 --> 01:41:49.990
<v Speaker 2>if a guy told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrestled his whole life and he's been</v>

2332
01:41:49.991 --> 01:41:54.580
<v Speaker 2>doing Jujitsu a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have a way easier time with that</v>

2333
01:41:54.581 --> 01:41:57.370
<v Speaker 2>guy than I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when he weighs 140,</v>

2334
01:41:57.371 --> 01:41:58.420
<v Speaker 2>100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 pounds.</v>

2335
01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.720
<v Speaker 2>It was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never felt anything like this and </v>

2336
01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:05.170
<v Speaker 2>even the guys that were on a squad that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were training eight months,</v>

2337
01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:09.730
<v Speaker 2>10 months size turbo and ozone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'd never felt anything like this.</v>

2338
01:42:09.731 --> 01:42:12.310
<v Speaker 2>It was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would you say turbo and ozone.</v>

2339
01:42:12.370 --> 01:42:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So what that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's from the movie breaking.</v>

2340
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Those were two.</v>

2341
01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:19.420
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these exercises that they do,</v>

2342
01:42:19.421 --> 01:42:24.421
<v Speaker 2>it's like at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing one handed handstands </v>

2343
01:42:24.421 --> 01:42:24.780
<v Speaker 2>getting into flying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>double loaded.</v>

2344
01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:27.280
<v Speaker 2>They're balancing on their head without </v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning.</v>

2345
01:42:27.281 --> 01:42:32.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old school break dancers would spin </v>

2346
01:42:32.281 --> 01:42:34.031
<v Speaker 2>and then they would balance like a top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just get on their head and their </v>

2347
01:42:34.031 --> 01:42:34.900
<v Speaker 2>balance is so extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>

2348
01:42:34.901 --> 01:42:36.680
<v Speaker 2>They do like cirque Cirque du Solei </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2349
01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Cirque du Solei is the only time that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can ever remember as a man feeling low.</v>

2350
01:42:41.410 --> 01:42:46.410
<v Speaker 2>I went with a chick and as I was in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience watching and I felt inadequate,</v>

2351
01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys like,</v>

2352
01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:52.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2353
01:42:52.681 --> 01:42:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I think of myself as being a guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in good shape.</v>

2354
01:42:55.091 --> 01:42:57.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work out all the time and I'm watching</v>

2355
01:42:57.401 --> 01:42:58.360
<v Speaker 2>these guys move around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2356
01:42:58.361 --> 01:43:03.361
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy just is doing a one handed </v>

2357
01:43:03.361 --> 01:43:03.361
<v Speaker 2>handstand.</v>

2358
01:43:03.361 --> 01:43:06.000
<v Speaker 2>His legs are going that way and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding another man up in the air above </v>

2359
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:06.000
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Huggies is fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the craziest thing ever.</v>

2361
01:43:08.171 --> 01:43:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that someone can be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically strong,</v>

2362
01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 2>they're doing one hand in hand stands </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got this on video,</v>

2363
01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:14.740
<v Speaker 2>video taped everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those guys.</v>

2364
01:43:14.741 --> 01:43:17.470
<v Speaker 2>It was unbelievable that they get on one</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand,</v>

2365
01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:18.970
<v Speaker 2>handstands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into flying,</v>

2366
01:43:18.971 --> 01:43:21.100
<v Speaker 2>double load is and start jumping and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopping.</v>

2367
01:43:21.101 --> 01:43:26.101
<v Speaker 2>On one hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible when you feel like how </v>

2368
01:43:26.101 --> 01:43:27.630
<v Speaker 2>strong they are and I'm convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 2>come,</v>

2369
01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:33.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people separate balance </v>

2370
01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:35.251
<v Speaker 2>exercises and then core exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something about </v>

2371
01:43:35.251 --> 01:43:40.050
<v Speaker 2>combining core extreme core training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're doing all these handstands </v>

2372
01:43:40.050 --> 01:43:41.350
<v Speaker 2>and balancing and then combining extreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

2373
01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:46.530
<v Speaker 2>You put them together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that really does create a whole </v>

2374
01:43:46.530 --> 01:43:46.530
<v Speaker 2>new animal because I've never felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like this.</v>

2375
01:43:46.530 --> 01:43:49.810
<v Speaker 2>It's combining core exercises and </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme balance.</v>

2376
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:53.210
<v Speaker 2>At the same time turns your body into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something different.</v>

2377
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:55.340
<v Speaker 2>It totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something about it,</v>

2378
01:43:55.390 --> 01:44:00.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to manipulate your body at </v>

2379
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:02.171
<v Speaker 2>an extreme in an extreme way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga alone makes you better at </v>

2380
01:44:02.511 --> 01:44:07.511
<v Speaker 2>everything you do athletically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you much more control and much </v>

2381
01:44:07.511 --> 01:44:07.550
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2382
01:44:07.551 --> 01:44:09.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just you have,</v>

2383
01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:13.760
<v Speaker 2>you have a finer degree of movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can,</v>

2384
01:44:13.761 --> 01:44:16.040
<v Speaker 2>you can balance yourself better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have more,</v>

2385
01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:18.420
<v Speaker 2>but that's way harder than yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2386
01:44:18.490 --> 01:44:19.430
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

2387
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:23.180
<v Speaker 2>It's extreme yoga because there's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of yoga.</v>

2388
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:28.990
<v Speaker 2>There's their style is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a combination of everything they're </v>

2389
01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:33.731
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're bringing Kung Fu and they're </v>

2390
01:44:33.731 --> 01:44:33.731
<v Speaker 2>bringing break dance and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing yoga,</v>

2391
01:44:33.731 --> 01:44:36.500
<v Speaker 2>putting it all together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like Cirque du Solei.</v>

2392
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:38.960
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys,</v>

2393
01:44:38.961 --> 01:44:43.961
<v Speaker 2>these guys are incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have seen some break dancers do some </v>

2394
01:44:43.961 --> 01:44:44.650
<v Speaker 2>wild ass fucking Kung Fu kicks.</v>

2395
01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:46.700
<v Speaker 2>They call themselves the freak show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2396
01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I've seen breakdancers do those flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>flip kicks where they flipped through </v>

2397
01:44:51.730 --> 01:44:52.190
<v Speaker 2>the air and throw kicks at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2398
01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Obviously the way I look at is you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot more bass in wrestling than you do</v>

2399
01:44:57.231 --> 01:45:02.231
<v Speaker 2>in Jujitsu and Jujitsu's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The level of basis that's required is </v>

2400
01:45:02.231 --> 01:45:06.461
<v Speaker 2>not nearly as much as wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrestling is all about getting that top </v>

2401
01:45:06.461 --> 01:45:06.461
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about balance.</v>

2402
01:45:06.461 --> 01:45:11.141
<v Speaker 2>It's all about base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this style of breakdancing requires </v>

2403
01:45:11.141 --> 01:45:13.850
<v Speaker 2>like 10 times more base than a rustler </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do all these crazy things.</v>

2404
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:18.500
<v Speaker 2>The base and the balances it's required.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2405
01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:20.900
<v Speaker 2>So when they come back down and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

2406
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.960
<v Speaker 2>like the hardest part in Jujitsu is </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the base and the balance.</v>

2407
01:45:23.961 --> 01:45:25.730
<v Speaker 2>The movies are actually fairly easy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn.</v>

2408
01:45:25.731 --> 01:45:29.240
<v Speaker 2>You could show a nine year old girl a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rear naked choke and they could learn it</v>

2409
01:45:29.241 --> 01:45:30.620
<v Speaker 2>in like five minutes or less.</v>

2410
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:35.830
<v Speaker 2>It's the balance and putting it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and the coordination and the </v>

2411
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:37.130
<v Speaker 2>dexterity and man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they come down.</v>

2412
01:45:37.131 --> 01:45:42.131
<v Speaker 2>And did you get so once they learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the basic object of the game and a </v>

2413
01:45:42.131 --> 01:45:43.250
<v Speaker 2>couple passes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's extraordinary.</v>

2414
01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:45.080
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2415
01:45:45.110 --> 01:45:50.110
<v Speaker 2>What W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that turns out to be the the </v>

2416
01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:51.821
<v Speaker 2>workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme gymnastics or stream </v>

2417
01:45:51.821 --> 01:45:52.550
<v Speaker 2>breakdancing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm infusing that they're going to be so</v>

2418
01:45:52.551 --> 01:45:54.710
<v Speaker 2>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2419
01:45:54.711 --> 01:45:57.140
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like choreographed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the beginning of.</v>

2420
01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:02.160
<v Speaker 2>This is the beginning of the infusion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this style of exercise into the 10th </v>

2421
01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:02.750
<v Speaker 2>planet system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely.</v>

2422
01:46:02.751 --> 01:46:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2423
01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the gym weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing Jujitsu for 17 years and</v>

2424
01:46:07.041 --> 01:46:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing squats and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>weightlifting.</v>

2425
01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2426
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:11.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stronger than if I wasn't doing it.</v>

2427
01:46:11.601 --> 01:46:16.601
<v Speaker 2>But when you roll with a guy that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing Jujitsu a year and he just feels </v>

2428
01:46:16.601 --> 01:46:18.020
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got 20 pounds on him,</v>

2429
01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.280
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty extraordinary.</v>

2430

<v Speaker 2>Everybody like respond first told me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well with them.</v>

2435
01:46:29.991 --> 01:46:32.180
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible and it's not just him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2436
01:46:32.181 --> 01:46:37.181
<v Speaker 2>the other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were small dudes too that we're </v>

2437
01:46:37.181 --> 01:46:37.190
<v Speaker 2>been doing Jujitsu eight months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 months and yeah,</v>

2438
01:46:37.191 --> 01:46:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I was getting them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dude,</v>

2439
01:46:38.421 --> 01:46:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I was going 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should have been really,</v>

2440
01:46:40.881 --> 01:46:42.440
<v Speaker 2>really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't really easy.</v>

2441
01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.000
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible,</v>

2442
01:46:44.001 --> 01:46:44.890
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm.</v>

2443
01:46:44.891 --> 01:46:46.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2444
01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:49.350
<v Speaker 2>my balance is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do handstands,</v>

2445
01:46:49.351 --> 01:46:50.430
<v Speaker 2>but I'm practicing</v>

2446
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:53.970
<v Speaker 3>against walls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to slowly infuse that into the</v>

2447
01:46:53.971 --> 01:46:55.560
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make that my workout.</v>

2448
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:57.930
<v Speaker 3>You don't also heard is really good too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is polities.</v>

2449
01:46:58.230 --> 01:47:03.230

<v Speaker 3>grapplers who doesn't want to loiter </v>

<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2453
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:11.480
<v Speaker 3>but I read something about plays online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some athlete.</v>

2454
01:47:11.481 --> 01:47:15.000
<v Speaker 3>It was looking to do something relaxing </v>
<v Speaker 3>in between seasons.</v>

2455
01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:20.240
<v Speaker 3>He started doing pilates and who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about how ridiculously hard it </v>

2456
01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:21.710
<v Speaker 3>is and people think it's easy because </v>
<v Speaker 3>chicks are doing it but polite,</v>

2457
01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.630
<v Speaker 3>especially for a man to carry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2458
01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.640
<v Speaker 3>carrying a different amount of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2459
01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Palantir is supposed to be super awesome</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

2460
01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:30.190
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of different things you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do.</v>

2461
01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:34.950
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how like pliable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>developable,</v>

2462
01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:39.860
<v Speaker 3>developable engineerable the body is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2463
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:42.390
<v Speaker 3>you can force it to do certain things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2464
01:47:42.391 --> 01:47:44.630
<v Speaker 3>think of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2465
01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like growing up doing taekwondo and my </v>

2466
01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:50.280
<v Speaker 3>body's still can do all that crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2467
01:47:50.281 --> 01:47:52.380
<v Speaker 3>even if I took years off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to pee.</v>

2468
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Your body adapts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body adapting.</v>

2469
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:05.490
<v Speaker 1>It fits into a couch perfectly when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>

2470
01:48:05.491 --> 01:48:07.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about being worried about your health as</v>

2471
01:48:07.461 --> 01:48:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you get older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2472
01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:10.910
<v Speaker 1>why don't you stop smoking cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's awesome.</v>

2473
01:48:10.911 --> 01:48:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really that good.</v>

2474
01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:17.320
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you try cigars that's worse </v>

2475
01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:17.320
<v Speaker 1>for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

2476
01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think seeing all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer into your mouth and throat and </v>

2477
01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:21.170
<v Speaker 1>gums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is.</v>

2478
01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2479
01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it gives you a little nicotine </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix.</v>

2480
01:48:24.201 --> 01:48:25.250
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phil Hartman quit.</v>

2481
01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Quit smoking cigarettes or smoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigars and I go to Jeff's smoke all day.</v>

2482
01:48:29.281 --> 01:48:29.630
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2483
01:48:29.631 --> 01:48:32.090
<v Speaker 1>I smoked one or two a day at the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

2484
01:48:32.091 --> 01:48:37.091
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just gives you a little fix and then </v>

2485
01:48:37.091 --> 01:48:37.190
<v Speaker 1>you can slowly wean yourself off of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what you're really hooked on,</v>

2486
01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:41.480
<v Speaker 1>according to people online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's true,</v>

2487
01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:44.000
<v Speaker 1>what you're really hooked on is not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tobacco,</v>

2488
01:48:44.001 --> 01:48:47.870
<v Speaker 1>but the 599 additives that the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got it engineered.</v>

2489
01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:51.410
<v Speaker 1>If you can still get tobacco into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and nicotine into your system,</v>

2490
01:48:51.411 --> 01:48:53.840
<v Speaker 1>you can slip away from the grips of </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction slowly.</v>

2491
01:48:54.190 --> 01:48:56.360
<v Speaker 1>They say it takes 10 years off your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

2492
01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:56.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2493
01:48:56.961 --> 01:49:01.961
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who wants to live the extra 10 years of </v>

2494
01:49:01.961 --> 01:49:01.961
<v Speaker 1>your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what it is.</v>

2495
01:49:01.961 --> 01:49:01.961
<v Speaker 1>It makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes.</v>

2496
01:49:01.961 --> 01:49:03.500
<v Speaker 1>When you're 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're 60,</v>

2497
01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:05.600
<v Speaker 1>you're 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're 70.</v>

2498
01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:07.490
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just take 10 years off your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2499
01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:10.880
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel really old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty.</v>

2500
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.900
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2501
01:49:11.901 --> 01:49:13.610
<v Speaker 1>you're cooking your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy it.</v>

2502
01:49:13.611 --> 01:49:15.170
<v Speaker 1>If you like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say you love it,</v>

2503
01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:20.680
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you take vitamins and try to </v>

2504
01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:20.680
<v Speaker 1>counteract the cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2505
01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:21.950
<v Speaker 1>I've been juicing and I've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the juice thing.</v>

2506
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Wake up and do how many cigarettes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>

2507
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Pack a whole pack now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Son,</v>

2508
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:31.250
<v Speaker 1>you were only about 10 cigarettes a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a while,</v>

2509
01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:33.590
<v Speaker 1>but that was right after I quit when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started back up again.</v>

2510
01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Because when you start back up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't go right to the full pack.</v>

2511
01:49:35.890 --> 01:49:40.890
<v Speaker 1>He slowly go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only smoking 10 a day and then next </v>

2512
01:49:40.890 --> 01:49:42.530
<v Speaker 1>thing I know you're smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should go and do that Ibogaine Shit.</v>

2513
01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I began for treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that work for from supposed</v>

2514
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:50.380
<v Speaker 2>to be amazing for any addictions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them.</v>

2515
01:49:50.410 --> 01:49:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Does their certain pills that have done </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it doesn't work on Benzos.</v>

2516
01:49:53.770 --> 01:49:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2517
01:49:54.341 --> 01:49:59.341
<v Speaker 2>There's certain things like I for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason it has something to do with </v>

2518
01:49:59.621 --> 01:50:01.180
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in Brazil,</v>

2519
01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.310
<v Speaker 2>the people that are part of the IOWASCA </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions,</v>

2520
01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:08.640
<v Speaker 2>they give their kids at 14 Iowasca to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent them from being an alcoholic.</v>

2521
01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:12.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So would that make sense?</v>

2522
01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's because it's insightful </v>

2523
01:50:17.970 --> 01:50:20.460
<v Speaker 3>because it lets you see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lets you experience a deep spiritual </v>

2524
01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:21.340
<v Speaker 3>connection with the mother earth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you don't.</v>

2525
01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:23.710
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be a fucking loser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you,</v>

2526
01:50:23.711 --> 01:50:26.470
<v Speaker 3>when you're in the presence of some form</v>
<v Speaker 3>of divinity,</v>

2527
01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:29.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck the spirit of the Iowa</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2528
01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:32.350
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is that when you have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like crazy experience,</v>

2529
01:50:32.530 --> 01:50:34.030
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the presence of you,</v>

2530
01:50:34.050 --> 01:50:39.050
<v Speaker 3>that that presence affects you forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's essentially what these </v>

2531
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.070
<v Speaker 3>people are saying that as John Hopkins </v>
<v Speaker 3>University study,</v>

2532
01:50:39.071 --> 01:50:41.110
<v Speaker 3>it changes their personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes them money.</v>

2533
01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:46.650
<v Speaker 2>And when you had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that Graham Hancock podcast and </v>

2534
01:50:46.650 --> 01:50:48.340
<v Speaker 2>when you guys were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca,</v>

2535
01:50:48.490 --> 01:50:53.490
<v Speaker 2>you guys were talking about how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit of Iowasca or whatever it is,</v>

2536
01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:57.940
<v Speaker 2>is female and you guys were into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2537
01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:01.090
<v Speaker 2>whatever you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spirit world or,</v>

2538
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:06.510
<v Speaker 2>or whatever that Iowasca dimension is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that is?</v>

2539
01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Thank</v>

2540
01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:14.480
<v Speaker 3>you know when you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's information around us all the </v>

2541
01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:17.211
<v Speaker 3>time and if we could have goggles that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could see all the fucking ones and </v>

2542
01:51:17.211 --> 01:51:20.151
<v Speaker 3>zero's flying through the air and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cellular signals and all the Wifi </v>

2543
01:51:20.151 --> 01:51:24.861
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's very likely that we are</v>
<v Speaker 3>just at a stop on the dial and that the </v>

2544
01:51:27.031 --> 01:51:32.031
<v Speaker 3>reality of infinity is that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>unlimited number of frequencies to tune </v>

2545
01:51:32.821 --> 01:51:36.080
<v Speaker 3>into and it's not as simple as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we live in one.</v>

2546
01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:40.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean we know according to quantum </v>
<v Speaker 3>physicists and I don't understand it,</v>

2547
01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:43.500
<v Speaker 3>but I'll repeat what they say is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are 11 dimensions,</v>

2548
01:51:43.501 --> 01:51:48.501
<v Speaker 3>11 known dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>provable somehow or another by some </v>

2549
01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:49.860
<v Speaker 3>mathematics that I'll never understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that's the case,</v>

2550
01:51:49.861 --> 01:51:54.861
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we know that we have time and space </v>

2551
01:51:54.861 --> 01:51:56.160
<v Speaker 3>and we know that the basic dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're comfortable with,</v>

2552
01:51:56.161 --> 01:51:57.900
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are these other ones?</v>

2553
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:59.220
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

2554
01:51:59.250 --> 01:52:04.250
<v Speaker 3>what are those and how do we know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just one sort of discovery on </v>

2555
01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:05.730
<v Speaker 3>the way to discovering that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

2556
01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:10.880
<v Speaker 3>this is a part of another fractal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are infinite numbers of different </v>

2557
01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:13.530
<v Speaker 3>dimensions because that to me seems just</v>
<v Speaker 3>as likely as it's more than one.</v>

2558
01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:16.530
<v Speaker 3>I have a feeling that there's just an </v>
<v Speaker 3>unlimited number of them,</v>

2559
01:52:16.531 --> 01:52:21.531
<v Speaker 3>but we exist in one dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand the other ones.</v>

2560
01:52:21.661 --> 01:52:26.220
<v Speaker 3>We can't tune into them and part of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain can and part of our brain,</v>

2561
01:52:26.221 --> 01:52:31.221
<v Speaker 3>Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we sleep and part of our brain can </v>

2562
01:52:31.221 --> 01:52:33.801
<v Speaker 3>and we think of we think of traveling as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a physical act of moving your tissue and</v>

2563
01:52:34.111 --> 01:52:37.920
<v Speaker 3>your cells and your bones from one space</v>
<v Speaker 3>to another space,</v>

2564
01:52:38.130 --> 01:52:41.520
<v Speaker 3>but that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is imagination?</v>

2565
01:52:41.521 --> 01:52:42.930
<v Speaker 3>What are thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are ideas?</v>

2566
01:52:42.930 --> 01:52:47.930
<v Speaker 3>What are language?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are all things that are in the </v>

2567
01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:49.731
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are all things that travel from </v>

2568
01:52:49.731 --> 01:52:50.960
<v Speaker 3>people to people in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they create things and things become</v>

2569
01:52:50.961 --> 01:52:55.961
<v Speaker 3>of them and in empires get built because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of using words and all this stuff comes </v>

2570
01:52:55.961 --> 01:52:59.870
<v Speaker 3>from the human imagination and the human</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination is what tunes in when you're</v>

2571
01:52:59.871 --> 01:53:04.871
<v Speaker 3>sleeping and it's where all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic compounds that are all </v>

2572
01:53:04.871 --> 01:53:08.201
<v Speaker 3>created by your own body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd all interacts with all that shit </v>

2573
01:53:08.201 --> 01:53:11.620
<v Speaker 3>and that's how things get done and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is why there is creativity that that is </v>

2574
01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:14.150
<v Speaker 3>the source of all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The human imagination,</v>

2575
01:53:14.151 --> 01:53:18.110
<v Speaker 3>the human mind is the source of all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>craziness that we say good and bad</v>

2576
01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.940
<v Speaker 2>based on all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all that craziness.</v>

2577
01:53:22.630 --> 01:53:24.400
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you guess?</v>

2578
01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's another.</v>

2579
01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:27.550
<v Speaker 2>When you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think happened?</v>

2580
01:53:27.551 --> 01:53:29.230
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd go right to that DMT </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

2581
01:53:29.231 --> 01:53:31.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think your soul is eternal triggered</v>

2582
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.940
<v Speaker 2>guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you.</v>

2583
01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:34.540
<v Speaker 2>If you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had to guess,</v>

2584
01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:36.580
<v Speaker 2>you would think the soul is eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I think</v>

2585
01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:39.940
<v Speaker 3>the idea of you dis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just stops,</v>

2586
01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:43.540
<v Speaker 3>stops it ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the only reason why you and I or</v>

2587
01:53:43.541 --> 01:53:45.220
<v Speaker 3>I and all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody listening,</v>

2588
01:53:45.250 --> 01:53:50.250
<v Speaker 3>the only reason why we think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves as one is because of our ego </v>

2589
01:53:50.250 --> 01:53:53.530
<v Speaker 3>and it's because of our desire to </v>
<v Speaker 3>protect our biology and to breed.</v>

2590
01:53:53.710 --> 01:53:57.400
<v Speaker 3>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are programmed to seek out a breeding</v>

2591
01:53:57.401 --> 01:54:02.401
<v Speaker 3>partner and reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all natural and it's all chemical </v>

2592
01:54:02.401 --> 01:54:05.671
<v Speaker 3>and then there's all sorts of roles that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we play in society to ensure that the </v>

2593
01:54:05.671 --> 01:54:09.121
<v Speaker 3>best genetics and the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving forward the most are the ones </v>

2594
01:54:09.121 --> 01:54:12.301
<v Speaker 3>that get to breed the most and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>like simple and scientific and it all </v>

2595
01:54:12.301 --> 01:54:16.510
<v Speaker 3>seems to me to be a part of some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>an engineered system,</v>

2596
01:54:16.690 --> 01:54:20.280
<v Speaker 3>an engineered system that's guaranteed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to produce certain certain</v>

2597
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:21.120
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2598
01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:23.420
<v Speaker 2>bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have their job in.</v>

2599
01:54:23.530 --> 01:54:25.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every cell has its job,</v>

2600
01:54:25.561 --> 01:54:28.170
<v Speaker 2>but they don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not really.</v>

2601
01:54:28.290 --> 01:54:33.290
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't think the bacteria is </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious of what it's doing to our </v>

2602
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:33.290
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very important.</v>

2603
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Do you think like in this dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going around with their own lives,</v>

2604
01:54:36.630 --> 01:54:37.950
<v Speaker 2>watching tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing our own thing,</v>

2605
01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:40.890
<v Speaker 2>but on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in another dimension,</v>

2606
01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:44.610
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our our energy,</v>

2607
01:54:44.850 --> 01:54:49.850
<v Speaker 2>our frequency is important to what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on the other side.</v>

2608
01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:55.340
<v Speaker 3>We might be a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might be a cold for another </v>

2609
01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:55.470
<v Speaker 3>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2610
01:54:55.500 --> 01:55:00.500
<v Speaker 3>that's what we might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might be the negative energy that </v>

2611
01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:01.650
<v Speaker 3>creeps through the cracks and Fox with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their world because we're polluting our.</v>

2612
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.070
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just sounds like super old drug.</v>

2613
01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Crazy sophisticated and complicated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so complex.</v>

2614
01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Well organized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2615
01:55:11.621 --> 01:55:14.380
<v Speaker 2>it's just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sounds very intelligent,</v>

2616
01:55:14.381 --> 01:55:15.010
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2617
01:55:15.011 --> 01:55:16.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say intelligent,</v>

2618
01:55:16.421 --> 01:55:19.510
<v Speaker 2>but I would definitely say it follows a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very specific direction,</v>

2619
01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:22.090
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean whether or not it's aware of that</v>

2620
01:55:22.091 --> 01:55:27.091
<v Speaker 2>direction is another question entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's really </v>

2621
01:55:27.091 --> 01:55:30.421
<v Speaker 2>debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that I don't think fucking </v>

2622
01:55:30.421 --> 01:55:33.200
<v Speaker 2>caterpillars aware that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a butterfly and I don't think a </v>

2623
01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.650
<v Speaker 2>human being isn't necessarily aware of </v>
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck all what all we're doing is</v>

2624
01:55:35.651 --> 01:55:38.140
<v Speaker 2>we're moving towards a certain direction</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing we're not knowing it,</v>

2625
01:55:38.530 --> 01:55:41.650
<v Speaker 2>so I wouldn't say it's intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's a direction.</v>

2626
01:55:41.651 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a very specific direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time</v>

2627
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:49.040
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a contact with intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like real divine intelligence is </v>

2628
01:55:49.290 --> 01:55:54.290
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the only time I feel humbled </v>

2629
01:55:54.290 --> 01:55:57.891
<v Speaker 3>by something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What however the fuck it is way smarter </v>

2630
01:55:57.891 --> 01:56:00.801
<v Speaker 3>than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's just some sort of a </v>

2631
01:56:00.801 --> 01:56:00.801
<v Speaker 3>chemical reaction in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

2632
01:56:00.801 --> 01:56:03.450
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate wisdom displayed by that </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical reaction is not just tangible,</v>

2633
01:56:03.451 --> 01:56:08.451
<v Speaker 3>but it it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You carry it with you the rest of your </v>

2634
01:56:08.451 --> 01:56:08.451
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You carry those thoughts and what you've</v>

2635
01:56:08.451 --> 01:56:10.110
<v Speaker 3>learned from those experiences the rest </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your life,</v>

2636
01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:13.560
<v Speaker 3>and that's what they found is John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopkins study on Siliciden mushrooms and</v>

2637
01:56:13.561 --> 01:56:15.000
<v Speaker 3>that's what you've experienced in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2638
01:56:15.001 --> 01:56:20.001
<v Speaker 3>That's what I've experienced in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell me it's not happening </v>

2639
01:56:20.001 --> 01:56:20.001
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2640
01:56:20.001 --> 01:56:20.760
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're tuning into some other.</v>

2641
01:56:20.830 --> 01:56:22.920
<v Speaker 3>In incredible intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're going,</v>

2642
01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:24.210
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2643
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Like I was taking myself seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was being ridiculous.</v>

2644
01:56:26.491 --> 01:56:28.530
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking that was important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking I was special.</v>

2645
01:56:28.531 --> 01:56:29.520
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2646
01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone's wrong.</v>

2647
01:56:30.670 --> 01:56:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know Jack Shit and you have a </v>

2648
01:56:35.670 --> 01:56:37.110
<v Speaker 3>few of those and you feel that I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>this crazy dream a couple of weeks ago.</v>

2649
01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2650
01:56:38.970 --> 01:56:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and my girlfriend were at the house I</v>

2651
01:56:42.421 --> 01:56:45.190
<v Speaker 2>grew up in and she's in the back yard </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming.</v>

2652
01:56:45.191 --> 01:56:45.980
<v Speaker 2>It's nighttime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2653
01:56:46.010 --> 01:56:47.610
<v Speaker 2>it's late at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's screaming,</v>

2654
01:56:47.611 --> 01:56:48.920
<v Speaker 2>come back here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back here.</v>

2655
01:56:48.930 --> 01:56:50.700
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like something was wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the baby or something.</v>

2656
01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.870
<v Speaker 2>So I run out in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

2657
01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:57.900
<v Speaker 2>in the backyard and she's looking up at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sky and then I look up in the sky </v>

2658
01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:00.600
<v Speaker 2>and then you see all these intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting stars like,</v>

2659
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:04.800
<v Speaker 2>like it was full disclosure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all these low beams of light,</v>

2660
01:57:04.801 --> 01:57:09.801
<v Speaker 2>like with Algorithms and equations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chem trails in this fancy hand writing </v>

2661
01:57:10.291 --> 01:57:15.270
<v Speaker 2>and chem trails in like hieroglyphics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the answers.</v>

2662
01:57:15.271 --> 01:57:17.910
<v Speaker 2>And we're just standing there going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2663
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:20.880
<v Speaker 2>all the equations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just came out like,</v>

2664
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:21.980
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2665
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:25.440
<v Speaker 2>what the hell on what were you on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was dreaming.</v>

2666
01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:25.920
<v Speaker 2>But what?</v>

2667
01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Did you take anything before you went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bed?</v>

2668
01:57:27.690 --> 01:57:28.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2669
01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean I smoked weed but I didn't take </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alpha brain.</v>

2670
01:57:31.711 --> 01:57:36.711
<v Speaker 2>Eddie will give you a crazy lucid dream </v>
<v Speaker 2>alpha brain commercial right there.</v>

2671
01:57:38.041 --> 01:57:40.860
<v Speaker 2>And Alpha brain gives you crazy lucid </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut that shit.</v>

2672
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:45.970
<v Speaker 2>And Howard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you take an Alpha brand when you </v>

2673
01:57:45.970 --> 01:57:45.970
<v Speaker 2>have that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2674
01:57:45.970 --> 01:57:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I've been taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to have an extra bottle of </v>

2675
01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:49.040
<v Speaker 2>wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want.</v>

2676
01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I want your honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbiased opinion about.</v>

2677
01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

2678
01:57:51.210 --> 01:57:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

2679
01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:57.810
<v Speaker 2>what would fucking happen if like there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just full disclosure,</v>

2680
01:57:57.811 --> 01:58:01.620
<v Speaker 2>like you just hear like aliens from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next star system just said,</v>

2681
01:58:01.621 --> 01:58:02.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going down.</v>

2682
01:58:02.971 --> 01:58:04.680
<v Speaker 2>You've been part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2683
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:06.600
<v Speaker 2>breeding or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

2684
01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:09.540
<v Speaker 2>You're part of this galactic federation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 2012,</v>

2685
01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:14.720
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the whole history of us was just </v>

2686
01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:19.250
<v Speaker 2>thrust upon us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well imagine if our entire civilization </v>

2687
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:23.121
<v Speaker 2>was just the interstellar version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>seaworld were seaworld for aliens.</v>

2688
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you find this out and they tell you,</v>

2689
01:58:26.670 --> 01:58:28.980
<v Speaker 2>they tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not only want to get into it because</v>

2690
01:58:29.470 --> 01:58:33.510
<v Speaker 2>it's just you don't want to get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

2691
01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:36.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just I don't want to get into it,</v>

2692
01:58:36.271 --> 01:58:37.620
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2693
01:58:37.621 --> 01:58:42.621
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen will happen </v>

2694
01:58:42.621 --> 01:58:42.621
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said you don't want to get into it.</v>

2695
01:58:42.621 --> 01:58:42.621
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

2696
01:58:42.621 --> 01:58:44.560
<v Speaker 4>a long story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy came in the room and he started</v>

2697
01:58:44.561 --> 01:58:46.210
<v Speaker 4>taking off his clothes and I started </v>
<v Speaker 4>slowly.</v>

2698
01:58:46.230 --> 01:58:48.880
<v Speaker 4>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how would people react if,</v>

2699
01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:53.650
<v Speaker 4>because if the entire truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if it wasn't even aliens?</v>

2700
01:58:53.651 --> 01:58:54.940
<v Speaker 4>What if like our government said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2701
01:58:54.941 --> 01:58:59.941
<v Speaker 4>this is what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the history of the solar system </v>

2702
01:58:59.941 --> 01:58:59.941
<v Speaker 4>is the history of the Galactic </v>
<v Speaker 4>Federation.</v>

2703
01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:02.260
<v Speaker 4>We're actually part of this giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>federation.</v>

2704
01:59:02.530 --> 01:59:07.530
<v Speaker 4>We were just left alone for a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred thousand years to get to a </v>

2705
01:59:07.530 --> 01:59:07.530
<v Speaker 4>certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we're part of this.</v>

2706
01:59:07.530 --> 01:59:11.650
<v Speaker 4>Now we need to move everybody to another</v>
<v Speaker 4>planet because asteroids coming,</v>

2707
01:59:11.651 --> 01:59:15.400
<v Speaker 4>so we need to get on some fucking God </v>
<v Speaker 4>damn ships and you know what I mean?</v>

2708
01:59:15.401 --> 01:59:20.401
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could you imagine if [inaudible] </v>

2709
01:59:20.401 --> 01:59:22.120
<v Speaker 4>actually came from the ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if they all come from the ocean?</v>

2710
01:59:22.150 --> 01:59:24.490
<v Speaker 4>What if we don't know it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Use teligent.</v>

2711
01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:29.520
<v Speaker 4>There's an intelligent species that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>like way older than us that figured out </v>

2712
01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:33.010
<v Speaker 4>the best way to exist is to dig trenches</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep into the ocean.</v>

2713
01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:38.010
<v Speaker 4>They have these deep underwater </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization so they're completely cut </v>

2714
01:59:38.010 --> 01:59:39.640
<v Speaker 4>off from all the rest of the fish and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the wildlife,</v>

2715
01:59:39.641 --> 01:59:41.470
<v Speaker 4>so they got completely removed from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>food chain,</v>

2716
01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:45.250
<v Speaker 4>much like we did by not living in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>jungles and we moved in the cities.</v>

2717
01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:50.340
<v Speaker 4>They just built these fucking things </v>
<v Speaker 4>down under ground and they became super </v>

2718
01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:53.701
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated and they control their </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment like no other animal in the </v>

2719
01:59:53.701 --> 01:59:55.330
<v Speaker 4>ocean and they built fucking ships and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot those ships out.</v>

2720
01:59:56.890 --> 01:59:59.740
<v Speaker 4>Another actually octopus and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>octopus that we see,</v>

2721
01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:04.600
<v Speaker 4>the ones that got away with spongebob.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If something came from another planet,</v>

2722
02:00:04.601 --> 02:00:06.910
<v Speaker 4>if something was so smart that it came </v>
<v Speaker 4>from another planet,</v>

2723
02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:08.950
<v Speaker 4>you would think that it would be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hide itself.</v>

2724
02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:14.220
<v Speaker 4>You would think we're going to figure </v>
<v Speaker 4>that out before we figure out </v>

2725
02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:17.790
<v Speaker 4>interplanetary travel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to figure out cloaking </v>

2726
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:17.790
<v Speaker 4>because if you pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're pretty close to clogging.</v>

2727
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:20.800
<v Speaker 4>They figured out a way to make a tank </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the broadcast something,</v>

2728
02:00:20.801 --> 02:00:24.520
<v Speaker 4>it projects it on the side of the tank </v>
<v Speaker 4>so it looks like the walls behind it.</v>

2729
02:00:24.670 --> 02:00:27.820
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy shit.</v>

2730
02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:30.340
<v Speaker 4>So they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty close to figuring out how</v>

2731
02:00:30.341 --> 02:00:34.120
<v Speaker 4>to do that and make it look really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you think about the first one</v>

2732
02:00:34.121 --> 02:00:36.070
<v Speaker 4>megapixel camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had one dude,</v>

2733
02:00:36.071 --> 02:00:41.071
<v Speaker 4>it was a brick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a one megapixel digital camera and </v>

2734
02:00:41.071 --> 02:00:44.431
<v Speaker 4>it was a brick and now your phone has an</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight megapixel camera or more about </v>

2735
02:00:44.431 --> 02:00:49.080
<v Speaker 4>when they master your thoughts and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>dreams and you could sell your dreams </v>

2736
02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.910
<v Speaker 4>and like bad ass dudes that are lucid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lucid dreamers and they create amazing.</v>

2737
02:00:51.911 --> 02:00:54.820
<v Speaker 4>It's like fuck watching movies like </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies or from moving.</v>

2738
02:00:54.850 --> 02:00:58.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like watching a martial arts movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you want to mma now.</v>

2739
02:00:58.001 --> 02:00:59.700
<v Speaker 4>Why are we going to watch Jeff Speakman?</v>

2740
02:00:59.770 --> 02:01:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Why are we going to watch Steven Seagal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got the real shit.</v>

2741
02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.810
<v Speaker 4>And then when you start watching real </v>
<v Speaker 4>dreams,</v>

2742
02:01:04.811 --> 02:01:06.790
<v Speaker 4>like you just download them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

2743
02:01:06.791 --> 02:01:09.250
<v Speaker 4>Here's my shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that movie that Juliette Lewis would,</v>

2744
02:01:09.251 --> 02:01:12.530
<v Speaker 4>if it was a dude was completely crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you run,</v>

2745
02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:16.120
<v Speaker 4>you run the risk of becoming crazy by </v>
<v Speaker 4>following his dreams.</v>

2746
02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:21.320
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a few dudes who are just </v>

2747
02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:21.320
<v Speaker 4>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their dreams are so awesome.</v>

2748
02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:25.020
<v Speaker 4>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll fucking risk it and you want to </v>

2749
02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:25.020
<v Speaker 4>ride dragons through the fucking cosmos </v>
<v Speaker 4>and share.</v>

2750
02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:30.000
<v Speaker 4>This guy has these ridiculous vivid </v>
<v Speaker 4>multicolor sorcerer.</v>

2751
02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:35.320
<v Speaker 4>When that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when that technology has changed as the </v>

2752
02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:35.320
<v Speaker 4>Australian shades,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's similar to that.</v>

2753
02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:40.200
<v Speaker 4>When you got that technology like </v>
<v Speaker 4>mastering your thoughts and your dreams </v>

2754
02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:40.200
<v Speaker 4>into DVD</v>

2755
02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>combined with virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

2756
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>we're now you could get inside someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else's dream and then they'll do real </v>

2757
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>time like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Web Cam Dreams,</v>

2758
02:01:51.021 --> 02:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>like you go into their dreams as they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreaming.</v>

2759
02:01:54.210 --> 02:01:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Whether I should on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about from Gizmodo where </v>

2760
02:01:59.210 --> 02:01:59.210
<v Speaker 1>they recorded the dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very close to that.</v>

2761
02:01:59.210 --> 02:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's going to be.</v>

2762
02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>They've already done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they have.</v>

2763
02:02:02.150 --> 02:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what the fuck that looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

2764
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>What about when they figured out a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to actually force you to dream?</v>

2765
02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:11.840
<v Speaker 1>What if they figured out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger dreaming or if they figure out a</v>

2766
02:02:11.841 --> 02:02:16.841
<v Speaker 1>way to somehow or another they activate </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in your mind and whatever </v>

2767
02:02:16.841 --> 02:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>chemicals that are released in whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation becomes artificial,</v>

2768
02:02:18.561 --> 02:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>like instantaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2769
02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>they can make you dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2770
02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>this video is showing what they recorded</v>
<v Speaker 1>from some from brain activity on the </v>

2771
02:02:29.121 --> 02:02:31.460
<v Speaker 1>right side while they're watching it.</v>

2772
02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the image of the fucking guy on the </v>

2773
02:02:36.771 --> 02:02:41.771
<v Speaker 1>right side is what the brain is seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left side is what the person's </v>

2774
02:02:41.771 --> 02:02:42.710
<v Speaker 1>watch and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

2775
02:02:42.711 --> 02:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on Gizmodo.</v>

2776
02:02:45.630 --> 02:02:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It's under A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are worried</v>

2777
02:02:48.291 --> 02:02:49.540
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gizmodo,</v>

2778
02:02:49.590 --> 02:02:54.590
<v Speaker 1>scientists reconstruct brains visions </v>
<v Speaker 1>into digital video and that's a lot of </v>

2779
02:02:54.590 --> 02:02:58.991
<v Speaker 1>people are worried about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about this ultimate conversion </v>

2780
02:02:58.991 --> 02:03:01.811
<v Speaker 1>of people in machine and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening way quicker than we think it </v>

2781
02:03:01.811 --> 02:03:01.811
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when,</v>

2782
02:03:01.811 --> 02:03:06.101
<v Speaker 1>when when you look up and you realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff like that has taken place </v>

2783
02:03:06.101 --> 02:03:06.320
<v Speaker 1>right under your nose and you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about it.</v>

2784
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:07.700
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2785
02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:09.980
<v Speaker 1>like what is next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is next?</v>

2786
02:03:09.981 --> 02:03:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to read each other's minds.</v>

2787
02:03:13.261 --> 02:03:18.261
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go right into each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other's brains and we're all going to </v>

2788
02:03:18.261 --> 02:03:18.261
<v Speaker 1>become one organism.</v>

2789
02:03:18.261 --> 02:03:21.050
<v Speaker 1>We're going to really recognize </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves as one and talking is going to</v>

2790
02:03:21.051 --> 02:03:23.240
<v Speaker 1>be fucking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for idiots.</v>

2791
02:03:23.530 --> 02:03:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Just going to be telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telepathy,</v>

2792
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:30.830
<v Speaker 1>one-on-one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to run into people that </v>

2793
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:32.741
<v Speaker 1>still talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be like Shannon ahead of </v>

2794
02:03:32.741 --> 02:03:32.741
<v Speaker 1>them living in the bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Australia,</v>

2795
02:03:32.741 --> 02:03:37.340
<v Speaker 1>we like talking my and that all people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without any facial expressions,</v>

2796
02:03:37.341 --> 02:03:42.341
<v Speaker 1>you just laughing your head and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time we could talk to the dolphins </v>

2797
02:03:42.341 --> 02:03:42.341
<v Speaker 1>and the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I be Dr doolittle.</v>

2798
02:03:42.341 --> 02:03:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's what aliens stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>

2799
02:03:43.281 --> 02:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>The archetype of the alien with the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant head and the big eyes and the the,</v>

2800
02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>the emotionless face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that emotion outside is all just </v>

2801
02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:56.171
<v Speaker 1>necessarily only because we're shitty at</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating and once we were able to </v>

2802
02:03:56.171 --> 02:03:58.590
<v Speaker 1>communicate completely through the mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>will need anything anymore out there.</v>

2803
02:03:58.710 --> 02:04:01.310
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think that represents?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It represents are inevitable.</v>

2804
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Future are encoded end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be.</v>

2805
02:04:03.710 --> 02:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's just the way it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology marches on and it makes </v>

2806
02:04:08.710 --> 02:04:10.490
<v Speaker 1>staggering pace if you look at us </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to champs,</v>

2807
02:04:10.491 --> 02:04:11.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2808
02:04:11.121 --> 02:04:12.590
<v Speaker 1>we're not done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very,</v>

2809
02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:15.350
<v Speaker 1>it's very clear that human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a work in progress.</v>

2810
02:04:15.590 --> 02:04:17.270
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at us compared to </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

2811
02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>the big mystery in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fossil record is the doubling of </v>

2812
02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:24.440
<v Speaker 1>the human brain size that it doubled </v>
<v Speaker 1>over a period of 2 million years.</v>

2813
02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:26.150
<v Speaker 1>And they don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know what it was.</v>

2814
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>But beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old days,</v>

2815
02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:29.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

2816
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't tell I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was too.</v>

2817
02:04:36.330 --> 02:04:37.340
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2818
02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:38.090
<v Speaker 1>if you</v>

2819
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:42.480
<v Speaker 4>think about what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we became from the monkey origin,</v>

2820
02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:44.030
<v Speaker 4>the original,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2821
02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:46.050
<v Speaker 4>lower prime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we became with our bigger head,</v>

2822
02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:51.200
<v Speaker 4>well if it's going to keep moving in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that same direction were going to have </v>

2823
02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:53.630
<v Speaker 4>big giant heads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you look at the muscles that are </v>

2824
02:04:53.630 --> 02:04:55.971
<v Speaker 4>on champs and then you look at a scrawny</v>
<v Speaker 4>ass average American male who doesn't </v>

2825
02:04:55.971 --> 02:04:58.170
<v Speaker 4>exercise and just works on a fucking in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a cubicle all day,</v>

2826
02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:03.400
<v Speaker 4>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're scrawny body is very much like </v>

2827
02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:04.140
<v Speaker 4>the scrawny body of an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you keep going in that direction,</v>

2828
02:05:04.170 --> 02:05:09.170
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what they come out like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You come out like some fucking giant </v>

2829
02:05:09.170 --> 02:05:11.610
<v Speaker 4>brainiac with little twig limbs that </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't get anything done,</v>

2830
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.000
<v Speaker 4>no Jujitsu at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no everything you've ever happened you </v>

2831
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.220
<v Speaker 4>can get with without a facial expression</v>
<v Speaker 4>and let that a sound without a peep.</v>

2832
02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:21.330
<v Speaker 4>You can get all that.</v>

2833
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:24.800
<v Speaker 4>You have so much fun just in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just go into other people's head and</v>

2834
02:05:24.801 --> 02:05:29.801
<v Speaker 4>you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know going to go into a trance and </v>

2835
02:05:29.801 --> 02:05:30.900
<v Speaker 4>you just get all this information and go</v>
<v Speaker 4>through all their memories.</v>

2836
02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:32.850
<v Speaker 4>You look at someone else and go through </v>
<v Speaker 4>their child and go,</v>

2837
02:05:32.851 --> 02:05:34.620
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love hanging out with you,</v>

2838
02:05:34.621 --> 02:05:39.621
<v Speaker 4>but in telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just going through everyone's life </v>

2839
02:05:39.621 --> 02:05:39.621
<v Speaker 4>window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's darkness,</v>

2840
02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:45.140
<v Speaker 4>you learn to block your thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like the best restoration site </v>

2841
02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:48.810
<v Speaker 4>to Eddie's and just wonder if that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what aliens on a wonder.</v>

2842
02:05:48.811 --> 02:05:52.410
<v Speaker 4>If aliens have figured out what they are</v>
<v Speaker 4>as real things that we're never going to</v>

2843
02:05:52.411 --> 02:05:57.411
<v Speaker 4>have real evidence about because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't exist in this dimension and they </v>

2844
02:05:57.411 --> 02:06:01.191
<v Speaker 4>interdimensional travel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just figured out how to tune into </v>

2845
02:06:01.191 --> 02:06:01.191
<v Speaker 4>different dimensions so they can come </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

2846
02:06:01.191 --> 02:06:03.150
<v Speaker 4>hang for a little while and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vamos,</v>

2847
02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:07.480
<v Speaker 4>but they do it in a way that almost as </v>
<v Speaker 4>undetectable or that our our,</v>

2848
02:06:07.490 --> 02:06:10.470
<v Speaker 4>our instruments can't really pick up </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're not even from here,</v>

2849
02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:15.030
<v Speaker 4>so they'll show up as ghosts of disks </v>
<v Speaker 4>flying through the sky and we,</v>

2850
02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:17.320
<v Speaker 4>we barely registered because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2851
02:06:17.321 --> 02:06:18.810
<v Speaker 4>we're getting is like static.</v>

2852
02:06:18.810 --> 02:06:23.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're watching one station on </v>
<v Speaker 4>TV and it's not quite tuned in and </v>

2853
02:06:23.810 --> 02:06:24.330
<v Speaker 4>another one comes in and it's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexican.</v>

2854
02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:26.070
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting like some,</v>

2855
02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:31.100
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some bleed over from another dimension </v>

2856
02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:32.010
<v Speaker 4>and that's what Ufo is our.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does Bob have a twitter?</v>

2857
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:34.050
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't that be cool to have one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your shows?</v>

2858
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:37.200
<v Speaker 4>I think he's full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might be.</v>

2859
02:06:37.201 --> 02:06:38.530
<v Speaker 4>He knows a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows a lot.</v>

2860
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:43.550
<v Speaker 4>He's fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I almost wonder if that guy's </v>

2861
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.980
<v Speaker 4>working for the government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he's disinflation agent because he,</v>

2862
02:06:43.981 --> 02:06:46.020
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he lied about going to mit.</v>

2863
02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:48.210
<v Speaker 4>He lied to that shit that's like really </v>
<v Speaker 4>traceable,</v>

2864
02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:50.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then he says that,</v>

2865
02:06:50.191 --> 02:06:51.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government,</v>

2866
02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:56.500
<v Speaker 4>his records,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not true because they found </v>

2867
02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:58.720
<v Speaker 4>school books from people who went to </v>
<v Speaker 4>school with him supposedly that were in </v>

2868
02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:02.580
<v Speaker 4>those classes and there's no bibles are </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's old versions of the mean</v>

2869
02:07:02.590 --> 02:07:02.850
<v Speaker 4>the west.</v>

2870
02:07:02.850 --> 02:07:05.750
<v Speaker 4>They went back in time and altered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2871
02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:08.760
<v Speaker 4>every single one of the areas that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government is not going to do,</v>

2872
02:07:08.761 --> 02:07:12.570
<v Speaker 4>that they would get hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he didn't say anything like that.</v>

2873
02:07:12.571 --> 02:07:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said he was like,</v>

2874
02:07:14.191 --> 02:07:15.840
<v Speaker 4>he said he saw like that could have </v>
<v Speaker 4>easily.</v>

2875
02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.900
<v Speaker 4>We already know that there's like German</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ufo is,</v>

2876
02:07:17.901 --> 02:07:19.620
<v Speaker 4>there's probably some American one that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he saw,</v>

2877
02:07:19.621 --> 02:07:21.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't mean that it was alien as</v>

2878
02:07:21.721 --> 02:07:24.180
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd like some of US Air Force Ufo.</v>

2879
02:07:24.181 --> 02:07:25.850
<v Speaker 4>That's not what he's saying though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he's saying.</v>

2880
02:07:25.851 --> 02:07:28.080
<v Speaker 4>This is absolutely alien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the way when they were,</v>

2881
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:30.430
<v Speaker 4>they were hired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were hired to back engineer it.</v>

2882
02:07:30.810 --> 02:07:33.410
<v Speaker 4>His whole story is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't know who Robert is,</v>

2883
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:35.130
<v Speaker 4>Robert was our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a guy,</v>

2884
02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 4>claimed to have worked</v>

2885
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:39.880
<v Speaker 3>for area 51.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His story is he had this job there.</v>

2886
02:07:39.881 --> 02:07:44.881
<v Speaker 3>I became fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a scientist and they started </v>

2887
02:07:44.881 --> 02:07:45.010
<v Speaker 3>helping him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started helping them work with their.</v>

2888
02:07:45.020 --> 02:07:48.230
<v Speaker 3>They're they're aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had these or these alien spacecraft</v>

2889
02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:50.200
<v Speaker 3>that they had and they were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconstruct them,</v>

2890
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:53.140
<v Speaker 3>but while this all was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they have to know everything you're</v>

2891
02:07:53.141 --> 02:07:55.210
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they monitor all your phone calls and</v>

2892
02:07:55.211 --> 02:07:58.170
<v Speaker 3>they found out that his wife was </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheating on him and so they like,</v>

2893
02:07:58.171 --> 02:08:03.171
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker is going to be </v>

2894
02:08:03.171 --> 02:08:04.231
<v Speaker 3>emotionally unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to kick them out of the </v>

2895
02:08:04.231 --> 02:08:04.231
<v Speaker 3>program because he's got turmoil in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2896
02:08:04.231 --> 02:08:09.060
<v Speaker 3>So they fired him abruptly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't understand why they wouldn't </v>

2897
02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:12.721
<v Speaker 3>explain to him why they fired him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the guy started bringing his </v>

2898
02:08:12.721 --> 02:08:15.511
<v Speaker 3>friends around to watch the UFOS get </v>
<v Speaker 3>launched and that's when he got </v>

2899
02:08:15.511 --> 02:08:15.511
<v Speaker 3>arrested.</v>

2900
02:08:15.511 --> 02:08:16.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's when he started telling a </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

2901
02:08:16.810 --> 02:08:21.810
<v Speaker 3>He started telling a story about how he </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked there and they hired him to </v>

2902
02:08:21.810 --> 02:08:24.151
<v Speaker 3>baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds awesome when you listen to </v>

2903
02:08:24.151 --> 02:08:26.281
<v Speaker 3>them talk and when he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he breaks down science and all </v>

2904
02:08:26.281 --> 02:08:27.310
<v Speaker 3>these equations and using it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2905
02:08:27.311 --> 02:08:28.710
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an amazing liar.</v>

2906
02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:30.010
<v Speaker 3>If he doesn't know what the fuck he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

2907
02:08:30.011 --> 02:08:35.011
<v Speaker 3>but he's gone off with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sends some incredible shit about </v>

2908
02:08:35.011 --> 02:08:38.101
<v Speaker 3>antigravity and all this crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It almost makes me think that he's a </v>

2909
02:08:38.101 --> 02:08:42.541
<v Speaker 3>plant and that he's hired to do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it makes us look silly because </v>

2910
02:08:43.181 --> 02:08:48.181
<v Speaker 3>when you look into the guy and he says </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these fantastic things and then you </v>

2911
02:08:48.181 --> 02:08:51.481
<v Speaker 3>find out that he actually never really </v>
<v Speaker 3>went to mit and he lied about his past </v>

2912
02:08:51.481 --> 02:08:55.051
<v Speaker 3>and they can't find any record of him </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere and maybe he worked at Los </v>

2913
02:08:55.051 --> 02:08:55.051
<v Speaker 3>Alamos for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2914
02:08:55.051 --> 02:08:57.190
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows what he did there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't involved in any area.</v>

2915
02:08:57.190 --> 02:08:58.650
<v Speaker 3>50 one bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2916
02:08:58.750 --> 02:09:01.600
<v Speaker 3>this is of course obviously what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government says with it,</v>

2917
02:09:01.610 --> 02:09:03.640
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes him look ridiculous.</v>

2918
02:09:03.641 --> 02:09:06.190
<v Speaker 3>It makes them look silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he lied about where he went to school</v>

2919
02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:10.390
<v Speaker 3>and so maybe if you wanted to end </v>
<v Speaker 3>speculation about,</v>

2920
02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:15.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at any particular area whether or not </v>

2921
02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:17.281
<v Speaker 3>Ufos were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have some guy tell some crazy story </v>

2922
02:09:17.281 --> 02:09:17.281
<v Speaker 3>about it and then make sure that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>full of shit.</v>

2923
02:09:17.530 --> 02:09:19.180
<v Speaker 3>Make sure he's full of shit about other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2924
02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:24.580
<v Speaker 3>So the people investigate when a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastical story they have to </v>

2925
02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:24.580
<v Speaker 3>investigate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2926
02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:29.520
<v Speaker 3>and they investigate and they find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's full of shit and it makes the </v>

2927
02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:29.520
<v Speaker 3>whole thing seemed silly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we know for a fact they,</v>

2928
02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:34.311
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they definitely test weapons there and </v>

2929
02:09:34.311 --> 02:09:34.540
<v Speaker 3>there's videos that people have shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>back before they,</v>

2930
02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:37.620
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they extended the range of where it's,</v>

2931
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:39.400
<v Speaker 3>you're prohibited to travel.</v>

2932
02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:41.590
<v Speaker 3>They used to be able to get much closer </v>
<v Speaker 3>to area 51,</v>

2933
02:09:41.591 --> 02:09:46.591
<v Speaker 3>but people would go to the certain Ridge</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would film all these different </v>

2934
02:09:46.591 --> 02:09:48.130
<v Speaker 3>things flying through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the fucking crazy things taken.</v>

2935
02:09:48.131 --> 02:09:50.500
<v Speaker 3>All these right angle turns in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of the sky.</v>

2936
02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:55.800
<v Speaker 3>And what most people think is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where they were initially </v>

2937
02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:57.820
<v Speaker 3>practicing with drones and that those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that were glowing in the sky,</v>

2938
02:09:57.821 --> 02:10:02.821
<v Speaker 3>the reason why they look like Ufo shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like this is the reason why they </v>

2939
02:10:02.821 --> 02:10:02.821
<v Speaker 3>moved so haphazardly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>threw this guy,</v>

2940
02:10:02.821 --> 02:10:04.630
<v Speaker 3>these roll radio controlled and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>really hadn't,</v>

2941
02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:08.500
<v Speaker 3>didn't have it down yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know now they have drones down to</v>

2942
02:10:08.501 --> 02:10:10.030
<v Speaker 3>a science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2943
02:10:10.031 --> 02:10:12.730
<v Speaker 3>And now the drone technology has gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the point.</v>

2944
02:10:12.731 --> 02:10:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they killed that guy,</v>

2945
02:10:14.201 --> 02:10:19.201
<v Speaker 3>that American born a couple of them I </v>
<v Speaker 3>guess lot drones move like they like </v>

2946
02:10:21.311 --> 02:10:24.440
<v Speaker 3>those lights did a that they captured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2947
02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:30.240
<v Speaker 3>They seem to think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They seem to be just like model </v>

2948
02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:30.240
<v Speaker 3>airplanes.</v>

2949
02:10:31.570 --> 02:10:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Well let's think about what these drones</v>
<v Speaker 3>are for these drones carrying missiles.</v>

2950
02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:38.150
<v Speaker 3>They will just the weight alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have something that it's,</v>

2951
02:10:38.290 --> 02:10:40.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you have something and it's,</v>

2952
02:10:40.610 --> 02:10:45.610
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're flying around some magnetic </v>

2953
02:10:45.610 --> 02:10:49.180
<v Speaker 3>device,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some new next level antigravity fucking </v>

2954
02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:53.290
<v Speaker 3>ball of steel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we figured out how to pilot this </v>

2955
02:10:53.290 --> 02:10:53.290
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that accurate.</v>

2956
02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:56.030
<v Speaker 3>It works on magnetic waves when it's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking nutty,</v>

2957
02:10:56.180 --> 02:10:59.450
<v Speaker 3>but it glows and it flies all around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one in it.</v>

2958
02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:01.820
<v Speaker 3>So can take crazy g force turns in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky.</v>

2959
02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:05.090
<v Speaker 3>It's very possible that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different thing,</v>

2960
02:11:05.091 --> 02:11:08.450
<v Speaker 3>but that they learn from that and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they apply specific,</v>

2961
02:11:08.630 --> 02:11:13.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that they learned from that into </v>

2962
02:11:13.630 --> 02:11:14.921
<v Speaker 3>these other drones to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other drones that they make are </v>

2963
02:11:14.921 --> 02:11:14.921
<v Speaker 3>often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just based on,</v>

2964
02:11:14.921 --> 02:11:14.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2965
02:11:14.921 --> 02:11:17.600
<v Speaker 3>artificially powered planes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they've had forever.</v>

2966
02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:22.600
<v Speaker 3>They've had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the part of operation </v>

2967
02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:24.341
<v Speaker 3>northwoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were going to blow up a drone </v>

2968
02:11:24.341 --> 02:11:24.341
<v Speaker 3>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They already had the ability to launch a</v>

2969
02:11:24.341 --> 02:11:27.110
<v Speaker 3>fucking plane into the sky just using a </v>
<v Speaker 3>remote control.</v>

2970
02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:28.940
<v Speaker 3>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2971
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:29.550
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2972
02:11:29.551 --> 02:11:34.551
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's entirely possible that all that </v>

2973
02:11:34.551 --> 02:11:36.281
<v Speaker 3>shit that people saw around Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like things that the government </v>

2974
02:11:36.281 --> 02:11:38.921
<v Speaker 3>experiment not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that you have a guy like Robert </v>

2975
02:11:38.921 --> 02:11:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Lozar who comes in and says all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit about Ufo goes and turns out </v>

2976
02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:45.641
<v Speaker 3>he's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it makes the whole idea of Ufo </v>

2977
02:11:45.641 --> 02:11:48.691
<v Speaker 3>is being there to be nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then people just want to leave it </v>

2978
02:11:48.691 --> 02:11:48.691
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2979
02:11:48.691 --> 02:11:48.691
<v Speaker 7>I think it's more of a place where they </v>
<v Speaker 7>are.</v>

2980
02:11:48.691 --> 02:11:50.050
<v Speaker 7>They keep seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>keep certain.</v>

2981
02:11:50.051 --> 02:11:51.430
<v Speaker 7>Like animals.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Almost like a.</v>

2982
02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:54.400
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a civilization.</v>

2983
02:11:54.430 --> 02:11:58.410
<v Speaker 7>Why do you think that they have to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>that the government has to do now?</v>

2984
02:11:58.450 --> 02:12:01.660
<v Speaker 7>I mean don't you think they have like </v>
<v Speaker 7>they've already bought like seeds.</v>

2985
02:12:01.661 --> 02:12:05.590
<v Speaker 7>Why's that government has already bought</v>
<v Speaker 7>like almost every single possible,</v>

2986
02:12:05.770 --> 02:12:07.480
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's to keep it,</v>

2987
02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:10.660
<v Speaker 7>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to keep it like pure to like always have</v>

2988
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:12.220
<v Speaker 7>heard this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Were you getting this information?</v>

2989
02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:17.880
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw something online about how the </v>

2990
02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:17.880
<v Speaker 7>government bought all the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all the seeds.</v>

2991
02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:22.741
<v Speaker 7>So I'll have huge companies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Noah's Ark situation or one company </v>

2992
02:12:22.741 --> 02:12:26.380
<v Speaker 7>bought all these seeds and they got </v>
<v Speaker 7>billions of seeds that they got stored.</v>

2993
02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:31.440
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's like a news they got got Norway </v>

2994
02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:33.340
<v Speaker 7>to seed storage giant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they preparing for the end of the.</v>

2995
02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:37.150
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's probably what it is.</v>

2996
02:12:37.151 --> 02:12:42.151
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like just to be in the middle of </v>

2997
02:12:42.151 --> 02:12:44.401
<v Speaker 7>the United States currently,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Norway has the biggest underground </v>

2998
02:12:44.401 --> 02:12:47.260
<v Speaker 7>bunkers to over 33 square miles.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the rumor.</v>

2999
02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:50.470
<v Speaker 7>Norway's the biggest ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How's the rumor?</v>

3000
02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:54.400
<v Speaker 7>I can house a million.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A million for two years.</v>

3001
02:12:54.401 --> 02:12:55.070
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

3002
02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Well I know there's some place in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>palm springs desert.</v>

3003
02:12:57.801 --> 02:13:02.801
<v Speaker 3>There's some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had them on TV and he was talking </v>

3004
02:13:02.801 --> 02:13:05.111
<v Speaker 3>about and they've set up apartments </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and people buy them a quarter </v>

3005
02:13:05.111 --> 02:13:06.610
<v Speaker 3>million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you own an apartment under ground.</v>

3006
02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:07.380
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they have that.</v>

3007
02:13:07.381 --> 02:13:12.381
<v Speaker 7>You can find that shit on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did abandoned missile silos that they're</v>

3008
02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:15.900
<v Speaker 7>making like communities and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they won't let just anybody.</v>

3009
02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:19.740
<v Speaker 7>I have a friend who actually looked into</v>
<v Speaker 7>it and wants to spend the money.</v>

3010
02:13:20.130 --> 02:13:25.130
<v Speaker 7>The problem is is you get there how you </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to get there when like a fucking </v>

3011
02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:30.500
<v Speaker 7>tidal wave comes or even if you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even if you could get there like you </v>

3012
02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:34.851
<v Speaker 7>bought.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's like the communities that </v>

3013
02:13:34.851 --> 02:13:34.851
<v Speaker 7>they're building</v>

3014
02:13:34.851 --> 02:13:35.520
<v Speaker 4>and do you have to have some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>skill to have to even buy one?</v>

3015
02:13:35.521 --> 02:13:37.800
<v Speaker 4>Like how are you going to contribute to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this community?</v>

3016
02:13:37.801 --> 02:13:39.630
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to pass all these tests </v>
<v Speaker 4>and these interviews.</v>

3017
02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:44.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they take like 50 grand or </v>

3018
02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:46.581
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when Shit goes down and I'm at the </v>

3019
02:13:46.581 --> 02:13:50.391
<v Speaker 4>front door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you going to open the Goddamn door </v>

3020
02:13:50.391 --> 02:13:50.391
<v Speaker 4>for me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3021
02:13:50.391 --> 02:13:54.201
<v Speaker 4>How do I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way that would work is if </v>

3022
02:13:54.201 --> 02:13:55.530
<v Speaker 4>everyone had their own private entrance </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you add your own key to it,</v>

3023
02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:58.290
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But fuck,</v>

3024
02:13:58.350 --> 02:14:01.440
<v Speaker 4>you open up the door and then the horde </v>
<v Speaker 4>of zombies came in behind you and killed</v>

3025
02:14:01.441 --> 02:14:02.670
<v Speaker 4>everybody in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Shit went down.</v>

3028
02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:08.090
<v Speaker 4>Complex is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember when you lived.</v>

3029
02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:13.100
<v Speaker 4>If you ever Linda apartment complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone leaves the door open and people </v>

3030
02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:13.100
<v Speaker 4>get in and break into people's houses </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what happens.</v>

3031
02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:13.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3032
02:14:13.730 --> 02:14:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Like that wouldn't trust that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>take your money.</v>

3033
02:14:15.541 --> 02:14:18.450
<v Speaker 4>Now that seems too sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you live in it.</v>

3034
02:14:18.690 --> 02:14:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Last year a compound guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you got a house,</v>

3035
02:14:21.150 --> 02:14:21.960
<v Speaker 4>like do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3036
02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:27.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you heard about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a house in Italy and they </v>

3037
02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:29.361
<v Speaker 4>suspected this guy of having some sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of an underground military bunker </v>

3038
02:14:29.361 --> 02:14:32.730
<v Speaker 4>because he had moved a bunch of dirt out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of there and it had been years and years</v>

3039
02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:35.520
<v Speaker 4>of construction and so the Italian </v>
<v Speaker 4>government threatened him.</v>

02:14:35.521 --> 02:14:36.060
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

3046
02:14:48.751 --> 02:14:50.310
<v Speaker 4>When I say artistically designed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

3047
02:14:50.311 --> 02:14:52.010
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like by happenstance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:14.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are always trying to build things</v>

3056
02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:18.180
<v Speaker 4>and hide from people because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>worried about the inevitable collapse.</v>

3057
02:15:18.330 --> 02:15:20.700
<v Speaker 4>Just get a nice spot down in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the earth.</v>

3058
02:15:21.590 --> 02:15:26.550
<v Speaker 4>Air is pumped up through a straw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It definitely building bigger and bigger</v>

3059
02:15:26.551 --> 02:15:28.860
<v Speaker 4>bunkers and they're turning into cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just natural.</v>

3060
02:15:28.861 --> 02:15:31.050
<v Speaker 4>If I had all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I was the ruler of the world,</v>

3061
02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:33.150
<v Speaker 4>I would just have people on the case </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonstop.</v>

3062
02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:35.970
<v Speaker 4>Keep building that shit deeper and </v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper and deeper.</v>

3063
02:15:35.970 --> 02:15:37.410
<v Speaker 4>Keep building it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3064
02:15:37.411 --> 02:15:41.760
<v Speaker 4>Because if you're running shit and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the power and unlimited resource to</v>

3065
02:15:41.761 --> 02:15:45.840
<v Speaker 4>build some safety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course it's natural human behavior.</v>

3066
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:49.230
<v Speaker 4>It's the human condition to dig </v>
<v Speaker 4>underground and be safe.</v>

3067
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:54.350
<v Speaker 4>If you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could have had all the money </v>

3068
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.350
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just literally,</v>

3069
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:57.840
<v Speaker 4>if you're doing that though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you literally might be some of the last </v>

3070
02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:00.561
<v Speaker 4>people on Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a crazy responsibility that would </v>

3071
02:16:00.561 --> 02:16:01.440
<v Speaker 4>feel if you knew that the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 4>got wiped out,</v>

3072
02:16:01.441 --> 02:16:04.230
<v Speaker 4>but you were inside some fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3073
02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:05.790
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3074
02:16:05.791 --> 02:16:07.860
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had a 90 percent chance and once you</v>

3075
02:16:07.861 --> 02:16:12.861
<v Speaker 4>got out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the radiation had died down enough so </v>

3076
02:16:12.861 --> 02:16:12.861
<v Speaker 4>that you can survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just got it.</v>

3077
02:16:12.861 --> 02:16:13.440
<v Speaker 4>We got to survive two years under there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

3078
02:16:13.441 --> 02:16:15.510
<v Speaker 4>if the government came up to and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

3079
02:16:15.810 --> 02:16:20.470
<v Speaker 4>we need you to keep your mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You and your family can all come back to</v>

3080
02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:21.480
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to pass.</v>

3081
02:16:21.481 --> 02:16:24.270
<v Speaker 4>We got the asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the asteroid gets comment,</v>

3082
02:16:24.271 --> 02:16:26.940
<v Speaker 4>but you just gotTa shut up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's can we just can't see it?</v>

3083
02:16:26.941 --> 02:16:28.860
<v Speaker 4>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't fit everybody in.</v>

3084
02:16:28.861 --> 02:16:30.310
<v Speaker 4>You and your family just just</v>

3085
02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:31.780
<v Speaker 7>pipe down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never thought of it that way.</v>

3086
02:16:31.781 --> 02:16:34.510
<v Speaker 7>Like if you just do it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you were creating wonder who you want</v>

3087
02:16:34.511 --> 02:16:36.700
<v Speaker 7>to live with,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you were creating a union family,</v>

3088
02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:39.810
<v Speaker 3>it might be better to just die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be better to find out where the</v>

3089
02:16:39.811 --> 02:16:41.150
<v Speaker 3>asteroid's gonna hit and drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There</v>

3090
02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:47.750
<v Speaker 7>might be the movement living underground</v>
<v Speaker 7>with a bunch of fucking other second.</v>

3091
02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:51.190
<v Speaker 7>Naturally where we have that drive we </v>
<v Speaker 7>want to live.</v>

3092
02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:53.280
<v Speaker 7>I hope we're always reaching out no </v>
<v Speaker 7>matter what.</v>

3093
02:16:53.281 --> 02:16:55.920
<v Speaker 7>We're trying to learn responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 7>keep this race going.</v>

3094
02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:58.740
<v Speaker 7>I never thought about it like involving,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're creating a noah's Ark,</v>

3095
02:16:58.770 --> 02:17:01.320
<v Speaker 7>what animals you would eat because you </v>
<v Speaker 7>wouldn't do every single animal.</v>

3096
02:17:01.321 --> 02:17:03.030
<v Speaker 7>You would keep the ones that were the </v>
<v Speaker 7>most important,</v>

3097
02:17:03.210 --> 02:17:06.880
<v Speaker 7>like chickens do nothing but buttons and</v>
<v Speaker 7>just ran.</v>

3098
02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:08.930
<v Speaker 7>It'd be chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 7>cows.</v>

3099
02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:14.160
<v Speaker 3>The idea of being able to actually hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the animals in one place is </v>

3100
02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:14.770
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

3101
02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:19.860
<v Speaker 3>the idea of being able to hold the </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic information for all the animals </v>

3102
02:17:19.860 --> 02:17:23.041
<v Speaker 3>in one place is absolutely doable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what if there was ever a </v>

3103
02:17:23.041 --> 02:17:25.090
<v Speaker 3>noah's Ark and the real life past of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity,</v>

3104
02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:30.360
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably a DNA bank and that at one </v>

3105
02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:30.360
<v Speaker 3>point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3106
02:17:30.370 --> 02:17:35.370
<v Speaker 3>there was a high level of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was when the Graham Hancock was on.</v>

3107
02:17:35.381 --> 02:17:36.310
<v Speaker 3>It was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3108
02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:37.840
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3109
02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:42.860
<v Speaker 3>the must have reached very high levels </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then got wiped out by some huge </v>

3110
02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:46.381
<v Speaker 3>natural disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then people were sort of left to </v>

3111
02:17:46.381 --> 02:17:46.381
<v Speaker 3>fend for themselves and kind of refigure</v>
<v Speaker 3>things out.</v>

3112
02:17:46.381 --> 02:17:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Some things never get figured out again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3113
02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:53.460
<v Speaker 3>Some people reached a certain direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain level and they reached it in </v>

3114
02:17:53.460 --> 02:17:57.751
<v Speaker 3>Egypt and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and 3000 BC and we still haven't hit </v>

3115
02:17:57.751 --> 02:17:57.751
<v Speaker 3>that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3116
02:17:57.751 --> 02:17:58.930
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3117
02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:01.150
<v Speaker 3>that makes a lot of sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3118
02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:06.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know that my genes would want </v>

3119
02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:06.240
<v Speaker 3>to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would want to keep going.</v>

3120
02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:10.531
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to put man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of a life with that being the </v>

3121
02:18:10.531 --> 02:18:11.180
<v Speaker 3>post apocalyptic life that would suck </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3122
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:13.150
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would want to.</v>

3123
02:18:13.151 --> 02:18:14.790
<v Speaker 3>I would try to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3124
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:16.450
<v Speaker 3>I think I would too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would to,</v>

3125
02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:17.800
<v Speaker 3>but fuck it would suck.</v>

3126
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:20.300
<v Speaker 7>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You were just supposed to try to make as</v>

3127
02:18:20.301 --> 02:18:22.670
<v Speaker 7>many babies as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you just had to find any girl.</v>

3128
02:18:22.671 --> 02:18:25.220
<v Speaker 7>You candidates come in and just like </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

3129
02:18:25.221 --> 02:18:25.880
<v Speaker 7>That'd be awesome.</v>

3130
02:18:27.250 --> 02:18:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it amazing that our terror </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified world.</v>

3131
02:18:30.341 --> 02:18:33.520
<v Speaker 3>What's the terror of the terrified world</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we would lose all of this.</v>

3132
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:37.720
<v Speaker 3>We lose everything that we can bang on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could lose a houses and we'd be stuck</v>

3133
02:18:37.721 --> 02:18:41.020
<v Speaker 3>with just needing to forage for food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't go to stores.</v>

3134
02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:43.060
<v Speaker 3>We don't have trucks and start over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

3135
02:18:43.061 --> 02:18:43.800
<v Speaker 3>Start over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start over.</v>

3136
02:18:43.850 --> 02:18:48.850
<v Speaker 3>We're terrified of starting over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every other animal starts over every </v>

3137
02:18:48.850 --> 02:18:49.840
<v Speaker 3>fucking day of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're terrified of it.</v>

3138
02:18:49.841 --> 02:18:50.260
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3139
02:18:50.261 --> 02:18:55.261
<v Speaker 3>we are so connected to devices and </v>
<v Speaker 3>inventions and technology that the idea </v>

3140
02:18:56.531 --> 02:19:00.490
<v Speaker 3>of being alone in nature forever is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking horrific.</v>

3141
02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:02.530
<v Speaker 3>That's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's jail.</v>

3142
02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:07.620
<v Speaker 3>He'd rather go to jail and get fed four </v>
<v Speaker 3>square meals a day and at least if your </v>

3143
02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:07.630
<v Speaker 3>bunkie he's a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3144
02:19:07.631 --> 02:19:09.610
<v Speaker 3>he can play chess together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know</v>

3145
02:19:10.180 --> 02:19:11.170
<v Speaker 7>what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you were allowed,</v>

3146
02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:13.540
<v Speaker 7>like if the government said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

3147
02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:15.820
<v Speaker 7>we got one year,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this motherfucker is going to hit us.</v>

3148
02:19:15.850 --> 02:19:20.850
<v Speaker 7>Everybody build your own bunker in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>backyard and just everyone just started </v>

3149
02:19:20.850 --> 02:19:20.850
<v Speaker 7>building.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll go,</v>

3150
02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:24.010
<v Speaker 7>you know how you know how rich Mexicans </v>
<v Speaker 7>would be?</v>

3151
02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:27.070
<v Speaker 7>That'd be charged in a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

3152
02:19:27.530 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

3153
02:19:28.430 --> 02:19:33.430
<v Speaker 4>Because that would be the ones doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd be the ones that'd be charging </v>

3154
02:19:33.430 --> 02:19:36.590
<v Speaker 4>150 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd want their own bunker man.</v>

3155
02:19:36.591 --> 02:19:37.400
<v Speaker 4>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>

3156
02:19:37.401 --> 02:19:39.290
<v Speaker 4>money doesn't mean anything with an </v>
<v Speaker 4>asteroid's coming,</v>

3157
02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:40.910
<v Speaker 4>and they tell you how deep it's gotta </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

3158
02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:41.960
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3159
02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:44.600
<v Speaker 4>they already have their tunnels 30 yards</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep.</v>

3160
02:19:45.150 --> 02:19:45.890
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's common.</v>

3161
02:19:45.891 --> 02:19:48.140
<v Speaker 4>You got one year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would be digging,</v>

3162
02:19:48.141 --> 02:19:49.910
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd have instructions.</v>

3163
02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:52.670
<v Speaker 4>Everyone has their instructions from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

3164
02:19:52.671 --> 02:19:54.170
<v Speaker 4>Build your own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a year.</v>

3165
02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:59.200
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>underground and everyone's locked down </v>

3166
02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:02.291
<v Speaker 4>and you're all waiting as a countdown </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know that it's supposed to </v>

3167
02:20:02.291 --> 02:20:02.570
<v Speaker 4>happen within the minute video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cameras,</v>

3168
02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:04.040
<v Speaker 4>video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cameras.</v>

3169
02:20:04.041 --> 02:20:07.230
<v Speaker 4>You're in a bunker and underground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just bump.</v>

3170
02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:09.650
<v Speaker 4>You're waiting for the impact of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>

3171
02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Just feel the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine what you say that the </v>

3172
02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:21.020
<v Speaker 4>one that killed the dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it hit the earth,</v>

3173
02:20:21.050 --> 02:20:25.190
<v Speaker 4>it was five miles deep in the first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>second and a half,</v>

3174
02:20:26.210 --> 02:20:31.210
<v Speaker 4>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>second and a half and went five miles </v>

3175
02:20:31.210 --> 02:20:33.611
<v Speaker 4>deep into the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and these are the same people that </v>

3176
02:20:33.611 --> 02:20:34.510
<v Speaker 4>measured the brain from that long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the caveman timer.</v>

3177
02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:40.060
<v Speaker 4>No regular done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those totally different types of </v>

3178
02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:41.940
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fuckhead they just talk about how,</v>

3179
02:20:41.941 --> 02:20:44.180
<v Speaker 4>what an impact that must have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3180
02:20:44.190 --> 02:20:45.800
<v Speaker 4>and if you were right there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>

3181
02:20:45.980 --> 02:20:48.950
<v Speaker 4>But if you will on the other side and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your three mile deep bunker,</v>

3182
02:20:49.010 --> 02:20:50.200
<v Speaker 4>five miles deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

3183
02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:51.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

3184
02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:53.890
<v Speaker 4>How much oxygen would you need for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3185
02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:56.690
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to have plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but would that even work?</v>

3186
02:20:56.840 --> 02:21:01.820
<v Speaker 4>Could you like have an environment </v>
<v Speaker 4>underground where you had plants and you</v>

3187
02:21:01.821 --> 02:21:05.030
<v Speaker 4>generated electricity so that you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>give the light sun,</v>

3188
02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.140
<v Speaker 4>artificial sunlight to the plants and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the plants cleaned up the carbon dioxide</v>

3189
02:21:09.141 --> 02:21:11.030
<v Speaker 4>that you breathed out and gave you </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxygen.</v>

3190
02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:16.240
<v Speaker 4>Would that be possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you develop an environment like </v>

3191
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:16.240
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3192
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:18.350
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if they could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they could figure out a way,</v>

3193
02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:19.720
<v Speaker 4>if there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3194
02:21:19.730 --> 02:21:22.460
<v Speaker 4>some method of power that they could </v>
<v Speaker 4>harness,</v>

3195
02:21:22.461 --> 02:21:24.650
<v Speaker 4>like say if they had some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>underground reactor.</v>

3196
02:21:24.890 --> 02:21:29.890
<v Speaker 4>So they got this underground reactor and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got this up for the fact that will </v>

3197
02:21:29.890 --> 02:21:30.620
<v Speaker 4>work for x amount of years and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah blah.</v>

3198
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:33.890
<v Speaker 4>And they have a whole artificial world </v>
<v Speaker 4>down there.</v>

3199
02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:36.680
<v Speaker 4>And this reactor runs these lights and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3200
02:21:36.681 --> 02:21:41.681
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make it rain on these plants and </v>

3201
02:21:41.681 --> 02:21:41.681
<v Speaker 4>the plants breathe in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathe out oxygen,</v>

3202
02:21:41.681 --> 02:21:44.400
<v Speaker 4>and we breathe out carbon dioxide and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they live off that chapter one.</v>

3203
02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:48.560
<v Speaker 4>Everyone makes their own underground </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunker and we've figured out a way like,</v>

3204
02:21:48.561 --> 02:21:49.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we have a power source.</v>

3205
02:21:49.731 --> 02:21:52.160
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna last for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for two years or whatever.</v>

3206
02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:55.460
<v Speaker 4>We could communicate with other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>on like these walkie talkies and shared.</v>

3207
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:59.240
<v Speaker 4>And then you start digging to them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you make like little tunnels to them and</v>

3208
02:21:59.241 --> 02:22:04.241
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other people try to Jackie with their </v>

3209
02:22:04.241 --> 02:22:04.241
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3210
02:22:04.241 --> 02:22:04.241
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you in my life.</v>

3211
02:22:04.241 --> 02:22:04.460
<v Speaker 4>Do just go back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

3212
02:22:04.660 --> 02:22:06.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens when they get like rabbits,</v>

3213
02:22:06.291 --> 02:22:08.610
<v Speaker 4>Jack and tunnels when people's towels </v>
<v Speaker 4>cross.</v>

3214
02:22:09.310 --> 02:22:10.610
<v Speaker 4>Put Gates on your toes.</v>

3215
02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:15.590
<v Speaker 4>Where does all the poop go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People just show up and tell him,</v>

3216
02:22:15.591 --> 02:22:15.920
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3217
02:22:15.921 --> 02:22:20.090
<v Speaker 4>I live in a totally gay bars and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>guard gated tunnel.</v>

3218
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:21.800
<v Speaker 4>That could be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3219
02:22:22.650 --> 02:22:23.600
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's possible.</v>

3220

<v Speaker 4>your shit all the time from underneath.</v>

3221
02:22:26.850 --> 02:22:28.860

3222
02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:30.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3274
02:24:52.371 --> 02:24:55.791
<v Speaker 4>skateboard stunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The kid fell on his head and he's in </v>

3275
02:24:55.791 --> 02:24:55.791
<v Speaker 4>critical condition.</v>
