<v Speaker 1>Pow Wow.</v>

17
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.290

18
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Jody having sex chicks are just coming over and eat her now.</v>

19
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.083
<v Speaker 1>Come on over.</v>

20
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I come get something poached egg and come on,</v>

21
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.051

00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll be a fly on the wall.</v>

23
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>She um,</v>

25
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

26
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>She have a baby or anything or boyfriend,</v>

27
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend,</v>

28
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>married or any of those things.</v>

29
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.530
<v Speaker 1>She is she out of the closet now?</v>

30
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>So she speaks fluent.</v>

31
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny that that's like a big issue?</v>

32
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Like whether a check is a lesbian?</v>

33
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

35
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>You can tell just by the way she talks or something where its smell.</v>

36
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is a woman like here's the issue.</v>

37
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Here's the legitimate shoe for real.</v>

38
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>A woman like Jodie foster can come out of the closet and still play someone's</v>

39
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:05.484
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>

40
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

41
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>And no one has a problem with it.</v>

42
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>If Tom Cruise,</v>

43
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying Tom Cruise's gay,</v>

44
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.710
<v Speaker 1>but if Tom Cruise was gay and he came out of the closet and um,</v>

45
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>then wanted to do a movie where he was making out with the chairs over,</v>

46
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:18.774
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

47
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

48
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>that's reality.</v>

49
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean that I believe,</v>

50
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

51
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say it's reality because I'm basing it on my own personal feelings</v>

52
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>of how it would know they would go down.</v>

53
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>It might go down differently,</v>

54
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>but I think that,</v>

55
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

57
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>the people that do polling for politicians and stuff like that,</v>

58
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.193
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>you'd be amazed at how irrational voters are.</v>

60
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.521
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

61
00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

62
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>how finding out one little thing about somebody's past can really sway an</v>

63
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:44.791
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>

64
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>So people are very,</v>

65
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:46.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:47.701
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

67
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>people are pretty conservative in their ideologies.</v>

68
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be an issue when you're women that are coming out.</v>

69
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like we don't really have that much of a problem with that.</v>

70
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>There's no like there's not a trace trace and I really think it's a high,</v>

71
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you're bumping muffs and you're making out neediness to cock</v>

72
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.073
<v Speaker 1>needing,</v>

73
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>so there's also that stigma of disease and all that,</v>

74
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>so that comes with it too,</v>

75
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.243
<v Speaker 1>With the gay side.</v>

77
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>What if they're just in a jerking off each other?</v>

78
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.931
<v Speaker 1>Completely different.</v>

79
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I never got clean.</v>

80
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Those clubs are staring each other in the head.</v>

81
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:22.151
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at,</v>

82
00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:22.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>look it away.</v>

84
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>What are you worried about over here for a second as a Goof,</v>

85
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to jerk it off.</v>

86
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I've been shaving around my dick because they say it makes my dick look bigger,</v>

87
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not convinced.</v>

88
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Can you give me an opinion?</v>

89
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Wants you to be objective here?</v>

90
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Let me give it a look.</v>

91
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd give it a look.</v>

92
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it looks any big.</v>

93
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>That looks a lot bigger.</v>

94
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling Ya,</v>

95
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look good.</v>

96
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:44.581
<v Speaker 1>I be honest with you,</v>

97
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.281
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even live there.</v>

98
00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>You can choke you with this.</v>

99
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>You look like you should have a hold of this right now.</v>

100
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm just suck it.</v>

101
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>And it wouldn't even feel bad.</v>

102
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It would just go all the way in your mouth.</v>

103
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:53.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

104
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm betting.</v>

105

<v Speaker 1>You mean you don't think you could feel it?</v>

108
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.700
<v Speaker 1>We need to try.</v>

109
00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:02.690
<v Speaker 1>You need to do another Mikey and Tony in the basement.</v>

110
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>This was the character's names.</v>
