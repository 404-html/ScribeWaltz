00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.601
<v Speaker 1>Trey,</v>

2
00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Speaker 1>my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all day while we get that champion Joe Jose</v>

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:05.581
<v Speaker 1>Aldo.</v>

4
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>That seems weird to me.</v>

5
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.983
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>

6
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 1>It seems weird to me.</v>

7
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>And then Max Holloway interim champion,</v>

8
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>like what is going on when you have a champion who didn't win the title in a</v>

9
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>fight in the,</v>

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>in the octagon,</v>

11
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>he was awarded it after he won an interim title against Frankie Edgar,</v>

12
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>which is a beautiful performance on his part.</v>

13
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>And then Max Holloway.</v>

14
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Where's an interim like who's within?</v>

15
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Think about how Max Holloway gotta I love Max Holloway says nine fights in a row</v>

16
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>that he won,</v>

17
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.750
<v Speaker 1>but then he beats Anthony Pettis who's never fought at that weight for weight</v>

18
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>once before cell phones Oliveira but really not a top contender.</v>

19
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.231
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

20
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Not Realistically not.</v>

21
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>And then leaves the weight class and was at 55 and you won your belt off that.</v>

22
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

23
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking strange.</v>

24
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how everyone has belts.</v>

25
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Well do you think that this is just a part of the transition between [inaudible]</v>

26
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>and WME and that is going to be like this transitionary period where everything</v>

27
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>about powerful watch,</v>

28
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Tyron Woodley Champs got good taste in Washington.</v>

29
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Is there a Rolex?</v>

30
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.321
<v Speaker 1>It's a fat one,</v>

31
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:04.711
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

32
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>it looks good.</v>

33
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>But the thing being like that bad boy,</v>

34
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>it could be an Invicta,</v>

35
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.100
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is it's like,</v>

36
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

37
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

38
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>you know there's obviously some sort of a transition going on.</v>

39
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>80 people have been fired,</v>

40
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>including Goldberg,</v>

41
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

44
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy time.</v>

45
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>So I think they're scrambling for stars and I think belts brings along some sort</v>

46
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:24.901
<v Speaker 1>of ratings.</v>

47
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>I just think they're in this feeling out pair,</v>

48
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>this transition period that they're,</v>

49
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>they're just trying to figure it out.</v>

50
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's why Dana's entertaining this Conor McGregor fight because</v>

51
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>what else would we talk about?</v>

52
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Name some,</v>

53
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>they named something else big going on in the UFC right now what's interesting</v>

54
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>is is does WME,</v>

55
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.141
<v Speaker 1>are they really,</v>

56
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:43.591
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

57
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:44.490
<v Speaker 1>this organization,</v>

58
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>have they really been involved in anything where the outcome is totally</v>

59
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable?</v>

60
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Like combat sports because like the promotion for the Holly,</v>

61
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:54.241
<v Speaker 1>or excuse me,</v>

63
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>the Rhonda fight was a perfect example of something like,</v>

64
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>well we really hadn't seen it that way before.</v>

65
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>We're really hadn't seen it go 100% heavy towards the superstar.</v>

66
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.291
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

67
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent heavy.</v>

68
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's like,</v>

69
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:07.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>you would see a promo piece like say if it's like Woodley versus Wonderboy,</v>

71
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>you would see Wonderboy highlights,</v>

72
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you would see Woodley highlights,</v>

73
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>you would see ass kicking on both sides.</v>

74
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>You were like Holy Shit,</v>

75
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:17.851
<v Speaker 1>what a fight.</v>

76
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:18.684
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait.</v>

77
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do that at all.</v>

78
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>They get is the way they would do a movie.</v>

79
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

80
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>they did it the way they are promoted TV show,</v>

81
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>they did it the way they promote a new Kiefer Sutherland series on Netflix.</v>

82
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.831
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

83
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Only the star but,</v>

84
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but that shouldn't say Netflix,</v>

85
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I should say like Fox.</v>

86
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what scares me because Dana white when it comes to this is a genius.</v>

87
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>He would never,</v>

88
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you would allow that to happen.</v>

89
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just wondering how involved he is.</v>

90
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Cause Without Dana.</v>

91
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>If you just have WME running it,</v>

92
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.690
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

93
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.673
<v Speaker 1>Look dope though.</v>

94
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.301
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

95
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with the fact that they ignore,</v>

96
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

97
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm a purist in a lot of ways when it comes to combat sports.</v>

98
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>And I think you have to respect the hierarchy of the champion.</v>

99
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck who was the famous person.</v>

100
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>This championship thing is so important.</v>

101
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.621
<v Speaker 1>When you have the,</v>

102
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to have champions,</v>

103
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you've got to respect the champion.</v>

104
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Like whoever the fuck it is.</v>

105
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.091
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

106
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>it's super important to make a big deal out of the fact that person's champion.</v>

107
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And they made like almost no deal out of the fact that she was a champion.</v>

108
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>It was this weird situation,</v>

109
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>but it was really well done in terms of like getting me amp,</v>

110
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>

111
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

112
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.853
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

113
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.813
<v Speaker 1>I can see,</v>

114
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>but for me it was for me.</v>

115
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

116
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I can get re you're the one doing the fucking,</v>

117
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

118
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

119
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

120
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Most of that was not me.</v>

121
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Most of that was like you open up the fucking curtain,</v>

122
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.911
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

124
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>the garage door and he see her hitting the pads.</v>

125
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>I had almost nothing in that.</v>

126
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that I said is,</v>

127
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine she's not going to come back and,</v>

128
00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:39.270
<v Speaker 1>and be a,</v>

129
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.670
<v Speaker 1>what are motivated,</v>

131
00:03:40.671 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>are pumped up or whatever.</v>

132
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

133
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the stuff they use in those promos.</v>

134
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Totally out of context.</v>

135
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was saying that she's the best ever,</v>

136
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>there's no one even close.</v>

137
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>There's hurt.</v>

138
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>And is everybody else was a long time ago.</v>

139
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>That was a long time.</v>

140
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

141
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I did not say that for this fight.</v>

142
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.841
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

143
00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:58.040
<v Speaker 1>it didn't say this for this place.</v>

144
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>But you said that for the,</v>

145
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I think you said that for the batch go.</v>

146
00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:00.881
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

147
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>a fight.</v>

148
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.691
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

149
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>so see like when they're making these promos,</v>

150
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>patching stuff they're taking,</v>

151
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>

152
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with that because this is not what I would say.</v>

153
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

154
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.651
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

155
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:16.651
<v Speaker 1>you're using like an old quote when she was dominating people versus a new quote</v>

156
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>post head kick,</v>

157
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>knock out post the emergence of Amanda Nunez after she stopped staring McMahon.</v>

158
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>You verged is a,</v>

159
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're seeing now in this division,</v>

160
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>which is all this new blood coming up.</v>

161
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.130
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing this division percolate and change and evolve and you're seeing</v>

162
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>like higher level fighters come in like Valentino Shift Chanko like Amanda</v>

163
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.211
<v Speaker 1>Nunez,</v>

164
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:40.981
<v Speaker 1>like Holly Home.</v>

165
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Like you're seeing all this stuff take place in front of you.</v>

166
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Seeing this change in the women's division the same way you saw a change in the</v>

167
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:53.251
<v Speaker 1>men's division from 97 to 2017 you're seeing that now take place at an</v>

168
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 1>accelerated pace and the women in the women's division,</v>

169
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>so who is dominant two years ago,</v>

170
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 1>like to use a quote from two years ago is really not fair.</v>

171
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

172
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>That's really not fair for them.</v>

173
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Kind of,</v>

174
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.090
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

175
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

176
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>but it builds the fight up,</v>

177
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:07.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

178
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>It builds the fight up but it's not the way to do it.</v>

179
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:10.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

180
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.451
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

181
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm appears to.</v>

182
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is if you understand this sport and you look at,</v>

183
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>let's say you want to copy the NFL,</v>

184
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>the NFL would never just focus on Tom Brady because there's a good fucking</v>

185
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>chance Roethlisberger wins next week.</v>

186
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine if they just did all promos on New England.</v>

187
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.841
<v Speaker 1>People were like,</v>

188
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

189
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:27.761
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>

190
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>This is some bullshit fucking good man.</v>

191
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Worse than that,</v>

192
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about,</v>

193
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>all promos that aren't the champion.</v>

194
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Which is worse than that,</v>

196
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.681
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

197
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Because you're talking about someone who just lost by brutal knockout.</v>

198
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>They're getting a shot right away at the title.</v>

199
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that even though they lost,</v>

200
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.911
<v Speaker 1>they lost,</v>

201
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:46.990
<v Speaker 1>but it was some bullshit.</v>

202
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.311
<v Speaker 1>She's now,</v>

203
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>she's best back now.</v>

204
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:50.450
<v Speaker 1>She's Bafta for 11 days.</v>

205
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>She back fucking 411 it's just a bad business plan.</v>

206
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of talk by people that don't know,</v>

207
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>but I was listening to people talk about it like I don't know who they are,</v>

208
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 1>executive type people.</v>

209
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:02.511
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

210
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:02.781
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

211
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you guys have this idea of how this is gonna go down.</v>

212
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.561
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

213
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:06.791
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

214
00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>they were just super,</v>

215
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>super connected to this idea and I don't know who they were.</v>

216
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're friends.</v>

217
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

218
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>But there was a lot of people that we're talking then had this idea that she was</v>

219
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:19.300
<v Speaker 1>just going to go in and storm the castle and take back her.</v>

220
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with a high up exec that a big time corporation and we're</v>

221
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>talking to him and I'm like,</v>

222
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>oh my,</v>

223
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea.</v>

224
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.933
<v Speaker 1>What did he say to you?</v>

225
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.520
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

226
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

227
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.100
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about Connor and Rhonda and he was neither one e less than</v>

228
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>mountain had that one hiccup.</v>

229
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>She will never lose again and like that's not true.</v>

230
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Lots is a good deals.</v>

231
00:06:37.141 --> 00:06:38.150
<v Speaker 1>None of them no did.</v>

232
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 1>She would never lose getting.</v>

233
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>She goes and he goes and Conner not a chance.</v>

234
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

235
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

236
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Two of these people were talking backstage.</v>

237
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Gods are like skews me.</v>

238
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.590
<v Speaker 1>These people were talking about stage and one of them didn't know Newton.</v>

239
00:06:49.591 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 1>It's his name.</v>

240
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

241
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.130
<v Speaker 1>They were calling her cannon fodder boy and I was like nine.</v>

242
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.043
<v Speaker 1>They don't know anything.</v>

243
00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.391
<v Speaker 1>They could be,</v>

244
00:06:59.391 --> 00:06:59.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

245
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who they were.</v>

246
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they could be people who are friends of people who know some people that</v>

247
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:08.640
<v Speaker 1>work at William Morris and they're backstage dressed in fucking $2,000 suits,</v>

248
00:07:08.641 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 1>so they look classy.</v>

249
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

250
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Willie Moore.</v>

251
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be doing anything without going through Dana light first.</v>

252
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 1>They should not be doing anything.</v>

253
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

254
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Been in the game way too long for you guys to make any decisions without having</v>

255
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>some sort of influence from a guy who's come from the ground up from it.</v>

256
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.651
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

257
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

258
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.160
<v Speaker 1>our fan base is going to yell bullshit on this man and if we,</v>

259
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:31.480
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

260
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 1>if Rhonda doesn't win,</v>

261
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>we are going to get fucking rained.</v>

262
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Connor cannon fodder.</v>

263
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

264
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.711
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>

265
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

266
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

267
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>That was the word that someone used.</v>

268
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that at this stage that there should be some sort of clearly</v>

269
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:49.751
<v Speaker 1>established protocol as far as who fight who and why you have to otherwise</v>

270
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you're no different than the WWE.</v>

271
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

272
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Then people won't take a lot of the interim titles and the championship fights</v>

273
00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 1>serious.</v>

274
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Here's my argument against that.</v>

275
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson and Michael Bisping.</v>

276
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see that fight.</v>

277
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:03.210
<v Speaker 1>It was goddamn touch.</v>

278
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Cause we love Dan.</v>

279
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

280
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Love Dan and I love Mike and I love,</v>

281
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I know Mike wanted it back.</v>

282
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.650
<v Speaker 1>He finally got the title and he's like,</v>

283
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

284
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I know that guy knocked me out.</v>

285
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>He's got his fucking picture of him flying through the air.</v>

286
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

287
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>touching me in the head.</v>

288
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 1>That's as long.</v>

289
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 1>How cold the everybody knows what that logo is.</v>

290
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

291
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.660
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

292
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.411
<v Speaker 1>fuck him.</v>

293
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>He landed it twice.</v>

294
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:23.354
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm in the fight.</v>

295
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:23.781
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

296
00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 1>don't me wrong.</v>

297
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Matt might be fight of the year.</v>

298
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.001
<v Speaker 1>It's up there,</v>

299
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 1>but I think you have to have some sort of structure where people can see what's</v>

300
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:30.764
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

301
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.761
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

302
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's like a Usada exemption exemption.</v>

303
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar,</v>

304
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>he got away with that for month.</v>

305
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I promise.</v>

306
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.941
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

307
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:38.301
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

308
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:41.760
<v Speaker 1>You'll miss out on this really fun kind of revenge pass.</v>

309
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.613
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

310
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 1>But then you can't say,</v>

311
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:43.911
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

312
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:45.200
<v Speaker 1>we want to be in the next NFL.</v>

313
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:45.621
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you,</v>

314
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 1>the NBA,</v>

315
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 1>do you think,</v>

316
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean outside of like promote who see?</v>

317
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.640
<v Speaker 1>You see the thing is he can't deny.</v>

318
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:52.431
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

319
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like are you a sport where someone has a very clear,</v>

320
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 1>you know like the,</v>

321
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>like the world series.</v>

322
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't,</v>

323
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>like someone can't lose a game and then all of a sudden be in the world series.</v>

324
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.041
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

325
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:02.620
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

326
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>It's just like there's a,</v>

327
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a protocol like you have to go through that protocol,</v>

328
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that there's a possibility you could have something like that</v>

329
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>some established set up but then they could throw it to the Internet for like a</v>

330
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.803
<v Speaker 1>wildcard</v>

331
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 1>cannot have that now and then maybe the UFC gets three wild cards a year.</v>

332
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

333
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

334
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Drama is the people who have been answered in that thing.</v>

335
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 1>But here's the other thing.</v>

336
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if an MNA young Jamie shaking his head</v>

337
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 1>for the all star teams and shit.</v>

338
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And then that's how y'all Ming is the number one vote getter every year.</v>

339
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Why is it because Chinese people is more of them?</v>

340
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

341
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.613
<v Speaker 1>technically yes,</v>

342
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 1>but let me ask,</v>

343
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 1>what does he do it online?</v>

344
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.531
<v Speaker 1>The Guy Right now,</v>

345
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:45.660
<v Speaker 1>that's the number one forward for the warriors,</v>

346
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 1>but like no one knows even how to say his name.</v>

347
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.563
<v Speaker 1>Is he from China?</v>

348
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:48.721
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

349
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:49.920
<v Speaker 1>his name is Josh shop with Trulia,</v>

350
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>but he's gonna.</v>

351
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 1>He's the leading vote getter.</v>

352
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Lin to,</v>

353
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:53.543
<v Speaker 1>where's he from?</v>

354
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

355
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

356
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

357
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.873
<v Speaker 1>Lithuanian maybe.</v>

358
00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this question about it.</v>

359
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.233
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question.</v>

360
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.201
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>

361
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I wonder about MMA,</v>

362
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>whether being champion in most of the divisions is even that important to the</v>

363
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>fans?</v>

364
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.933
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

365
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.760
<v Speaker 1>what's important to people is Conor Mcgregor,</v>

366
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

367
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.021
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda Rousey,</v>

368
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:13.990
<v Speaker 1>the people that have the co,</v>

369
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 1>there's something colorful about them.</v>

370
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.313
<v Speaker 1>Complicated people.</v>

371
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who speaks well.</v>

372
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:17.671
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

373
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:18.780
<v Speaker 1>we watched those guys,</v>

374
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not so sure that because Michael Bisbing is champion,</v>

375
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.010
<v Speaker 1>that his viewership goes up as your mom,</v>

376
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.320
<v Speaker 1>clinically proven that championship fight.</v>

377
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Terrible,</v>

378
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.021
<v Speaker 1>terrible point.</v>

379
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

380
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I need you to take a break after that.</v>

381
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.473
<v Speaker 1>But to your point,</v>

382
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.020
<v Speaker 1>you can say Rhonda was the bigger stuff,</v>

383
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>but Ronald was a different force and the reason she got so big as,</v>

384
00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:42.210
<v Speaker 1>because she was champions Rondo's never champion.</v>

385
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 1>We're not even,</v>

386
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.720
<v Speaker 1>but also like what she was just,</v>

387
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 1>she was winning and losing one.</v>

388
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:51.030
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what she did to indulge that whole popularity thing was very</v>

389
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:53.880
<v Speaker 1>different than Connor's approach of Connor decided to take that exact same</v>

390
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 1>approach and go do a ton of movies and go do a ton of talk shows and go do a ton</v>

391
00:10:57.721 --> 00:10:58.020
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

392
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 1>do one commercial Budweisers and entourage and all this different shit.</v>

393
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 1>If he started doing that same shit,</v>

394
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:09.351
<v Speaker 1>his star would rise proportionally to weigh her star rose and his performances</v>

395
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 1>inside the octagon was suffer right proportionately to wear.</v>

396
00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Hers did and he didn't do it and he's still bigger.</v>

397
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about that guy that did that interview.</v>

398
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:19.420
<v Speaker 1>He's a sports guy and he was talking about,</v>

399
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:19.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

400
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:19.991
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

401
00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:20.431
<v Speaker 1>The other guy,</v>

402
00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>the black guy who was with him,</v>

403
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.953
<v Speaker 1>is that his name?</v>

404
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>And he had a great point.</v>

405
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Shannon Sharpe had a great point and he said,</v>

406
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda cheated on MMA.</v>

407
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:28.950
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

408
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.030
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be all in and says you can't go and do a bunch of other shit and think</v>

409
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.610
<v Speaker 1>you're just so much better than everybody else that it's never going to catch</v>

410
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:35.780
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

411
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.780
<v Speaker 1>He comes from another 1% or athlete knows exactly how all this kind of tempting</v>

412
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>shall Shannon Sharpe stuck to the game to set it.</v>

413
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:45.061
<v Speaker 1>When he said it,</v>

414
00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:45.421
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

415
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:45.991
<v Speaker 1>this guy's dead.</v>

416
00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

417
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I think this business model though,</v>

418
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.630
<v Speaker 1>the only problem with the business model is that with MMA it's really hard to</v>

419
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>invest in the champion because of the nature of the sport.</v>

420
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 1>The the belt.</v>

421
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 1>We'll chant like especially when you're investing for one fights,</v>

422
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

423
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.211
<v Speaker 1>But still you're,</v>

424
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>but you're investing because all the time,</v>

425
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 1>but you're not investing for in the champion.</v>

426
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 1>You're investing in the organization and the fact that they have the best</v>

427
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:08.734
<v Speaker 1>fighters in the world.</v>

428
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing with each fight is promoting a fight.</v>

429
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that you have to respect the hierarchy of the championship.</v>

430
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Above all,</v>

431
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 1>the champion is the champion.</v>

432
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:21.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't respect the hierarchy of the champion of your somehow or</v>

433
00:12:21.851 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>another saying that this champion ain't shit unless this champion is fighting</v>

434
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Mike fucking Tyson when Tyson was 20 years old and just smashed and everybody</v>

435
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>and you knew all my God,</v>

436
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be the youngest ever heavyweight champion,</v>

437
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>then you focus on that guy with the same amount of fervor that it demands.</v>

438
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

439
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the case here.</v>

440
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:38.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

441
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:42.280
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about an insanely like in that particular Ronda Rousey fight and</v>

442
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 1>insanely dangerous champion.</v>

443
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

444
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Who just smashed me,</v>

445
00:12:45.571 --> 00:12:46.321
<v Speaker 1>said Tate and,</v>

446
00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 1>and you're talking about an x factor.</v>

447
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.341
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

448
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:51.610
<v Speaker 1>we really don't know what we're going to kit exactly with Ron bess and put all</v>

449
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:52.430
<v Speaker 1>the money in the,</v>

450
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

451
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.200
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

452
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.033
<v Speaker 1>So you've got,</v>

453
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>

454
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 1>but also you have an insanely marketable champion.</v>

455
00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:58.751
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

456
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:02.970
<v Speaker 1>the first ever openly gay women's MMA champion and man's l.</v>

457
00:13:02.971 --> 00:13:05.200
<v Speaker 1>It should be never been an openly gay MMA champion.</v>

458
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

459
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So you have the whole Lgbtq,</v>

460
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are now a is username as about APA plot.</v>

461
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.903
<v Speaker 1>People that,</v>

462
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.990
<v Speaker 1>but you have also a bunch of people that respect that in a progressive people</v>

463
00:13:16.991 --> 00:13:17.261
<v Speaker 1>that say,</v>

464
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:17.411
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

465
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:18.071
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

466
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:18.521
<v Speaker 1>Like look,</v>

467
00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:20.140
<v Speaker 1>it shows how diverse the UFC is.</v>

468
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:20.974
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

469
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:21.850
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

470
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:21.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

471
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:24.190
<v Speaker 1>and the stupid shit that Meryl Streep said the other day,</v>

472
00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 1>like one of the reasons why she probably said it is because she's seeing Ronda</v>

473
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Rousey's face plastered all over the place.</v>

474
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.900
<v Speaker 1>The face,</v>

475
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 1>the place and she's saying,</v>

476
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

477
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.760
<v Speaker 1>you know you take women of foreigners out of Hollywood,</v>

478
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be left with football and MMA.</v>

479
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't understand the full MMA like you saw tonight was Gil Rodriguez is</v>

480
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:40.430
<v Speaker 1>80% foreigners.</v>

481
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It's so wrong about that.</v>

482
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's also art.</v>

483
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.410
<v Speaker 1>That's that jumping,</v>

484
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 1>spinning back kick would be art.</v>

485
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh come on that you tell me that three 60 round kick.</v>

486
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking dance but harder cheese.</v>

487
00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 1>You got to hit somebody with it.</v>

488
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:53.241
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

489
00:13:53.241 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

490
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 1>it's just like rhythmic gymnastics.</v>

491
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 1>She just doesn't know what she's on educated.</v>

492
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean if dance is an art than gymnastics in competition is also an art because</v>

493
00:14:01.751 --> 00:14:02.501
<v Speaker 1>it's very similar.</v>

494
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Speaker 1>It's just under more pressure.</v>

495
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:04.451
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

496
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:05.800
<v Speaker 1>So of gymnastics is an art.</v>

497
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.130
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck is how our three 60 round kicks?</v>

498
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

499
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.503
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

500
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

501
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.880
<v Speaker 1>that guy on the ground is,</v>

502
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 1>it was a bad motherfucker.</v>

503
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:14.981
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

504
00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:15.551
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

505
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 1>She used her lifetime achievement award to talk shit about MMA and football.</v>

506
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I think she was making a clumsy larger point,</v>

507
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.100
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

508
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:24.461
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

509
00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Celebrate what you,</v>

510
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.301
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

511
00:14:26.301 --> 00:14:27.960
<v Speaker 1>it was Nina and saw the crime.</v>

512
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:29.231
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

513
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:31.090
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't start off one whoa.</v>

514
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Rear naked around three.</v>

515
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a Amanda Nunez girlfriend hollow.</v>

516
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
