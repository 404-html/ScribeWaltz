<v Speaker 2>is now.</v>

11
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.620

<v Speaker 1>How that can just like that in an</v>

12
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>instant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just never know.</v>

13
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>What does that feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you wake up in the</v>

14
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.473
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go,</v>

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>P diddy</v>

17
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

18
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

19
00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enlightening.</v>

20
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:46.874
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

21
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.310
<v Speaker 2>it's great to be the champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

22
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely different thing.</v>

23
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:51.711
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

24
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 2>a year ago I was so frustrated because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

25
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:57.280
<v Speaker 2>when I lost her onto the last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I had a lot,</v>

26
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 2>a long road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

27
00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.630
<v Speaker 2>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work my way back up.</v>

28
00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:01.910
<v Speaker 2>But I thought I had done that and when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat Jessica,</v>

29
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was announced like,</v>

30
00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:04.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be then the number one</v>

31
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 2>contender eliminator fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then afterwards they're like,</v>

32
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 2>yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to fight Ronda.</v>

33
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Then I felt like the carpet was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pulled out from under my feet</v>

34
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 2>because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kidding.</v>

35
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Holly's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.400
<v Speaker 2>holly's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they announced it without telling</v>

37
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I was so upset because I</v>

38
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't take that shit lightly,</v>

39
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

40
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was training my ass off already.</v>

41
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I had already reached out to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a girl in France.</v>

42
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I can't say her name right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like [inaudible],</v>

43
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know some French name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she beat Ronda and judo.</v>

44
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 2>So I had already like been making plans</v>
<v Speaker 2>with her to train with her and fire over</v>

45
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 2>here and she was changing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I was like,</v>

46
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 2>I feel like such an ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I feel like an idiot.</v>

47
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look like an idiot because here the</v>

48
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:41.990
<v Speaker 2>announcement was made and I didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

49
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 2>So I was kind of upset about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

50
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:45.940
<v Speaker 2>we talked about it and we smooth things</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and,</v>

51
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.460
<v Speaker 2>and I took it personally at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it was meant</v>

52
00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 2>personally and it was a business</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision and I understand that that at</v>

53
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day that's what it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it all worked out.</v>

54
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

55
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>the UFC is in a weird position because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both a promoter and sort of a</v>

56
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>sanctioning body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

57
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's really rare and matter of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

58
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of any other sport where</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists.</v>

59
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>they have just this ability to decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they'll dealt us decide like this</v>

61
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:14.360
<v Speaker 1>person gets a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole conor mcgregor situation</v>

62
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>is a perfect example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all of a sudden if he had beaten</v>

63
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:21.850
<v Speaker 1>nate diaz or if he had beaten dos Anjos</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dos Anjos didn't get injured and he</v>

64
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>beat beat Dos Anjos you fucking know for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure they were going to have him fight</v>

65
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Robbie lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Like for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were just going to like figure</v>

67
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>out a way to do something with 145 Palm</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tata.</v>

68
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>And why wouldn't they do it if they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>business people because that's where the</v>

69
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>money is.</v>

70
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would've been if he had beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>those on Joe's and then when on and</v>

71
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>fought Robbie law or Jesus Christ when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk to like a 5 million paper view</v>

72
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>by event it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd have to do it.</v>

73
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>It would be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if that was like a sanctioning body,</v>

74
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>like you've seen it before in like</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing,</v>

75
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>like someone won't take a mandatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenger and they get stripped even</v>

76
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>when they just won the title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens all the time.</v>

77
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Like we're a phytol would just win the</v>
<v Speaker 1>title and then they have this mandatory</v>

78
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>challenger who nobody knows and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

79
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>fuck that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go fight Canelo Alvarez,</v>

80
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fight this guy or that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he gets stripped.</v>

81
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there's like five different</v>

82
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>sanctioning bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like boxing is way more of a mess.</v>

83
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>So there's like pros and cons to doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it the way the UFC does it.</v>

84
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>But from a point of view of someone like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

85
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.640
<v Speaker 1>it's probably much more frustrated.</v>

86
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just never know what to expect.</v>

87
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get curve balls all the time in the</v>

88
00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:26.120
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know what to expect.</v>

89
00:03:26.121 --> 00:03:28.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people were so pissed off</v>

90
00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:30.350
<v Speaker 2>at me for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Holly Holm,</v>

91
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.050
<v Speaker 2>not having the rematch right away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

92
00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:34.850
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not my choice.</v>

93
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this of you,</v>

94
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they think that I like turned it</v>

95
00:03:38.901 --> 00:03:42.710
<v Speaker 2>down or I should have went in there like</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns a blazing for holly and like put</v>

96
00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:43.790
<v Speaker 2>myself out of my shield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

97
00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:45.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to have the holly rematch.</v>

98
00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:47.210
<v Speaker 2>You guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand.</v>

99
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.010
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

100
00:03:49.011 --> 00:03:49.880
<v Speaker 2>they call me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

101
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>July 9th.</v>

102
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.813
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

103
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did he notice UFC 200 how the fuck</v>

104
00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:57.620
<v Speaker 2>do you say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no you don't.</v>

105
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.180
<v Speaker 2>You can't say no if that's what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with you like I'm in and now you</v>

106
00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:02.690
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

107
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.320
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relax.</v>

108
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't get immediate</v>
<v Speaker 2>rematches in their career.</v>

109
00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you are conor mcgregor or Rhonda</v>

110
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.001
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

111
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:11.930
<v Speaker 2>someone that's really got a presence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get an immediate rematch.</v>

112
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Like I did when I went back and strike</v>
<v Speaker 2>force when,</v>

113
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.770
<v Speaker 2>when I lost to Ronda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get into media.</v>

114
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I've never gotten immediate rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My career,</v>

115
00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:19.880
<v Speaker 2>I would love to immediately rematch cat</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I lost to her.</v>

116
00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:22.400
<v Speaker 2>But you don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you got to work your way back</v>

117
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:24.170
<v Speaker 2>up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hope for the best,</v>

118
00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:26.420
<v Speaker 2>but we will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it will fight each other again.</v>

119
00:04:26.421 --> 00:04:30.950
<v Speaker 2>She's fighting a volunteer mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shanko now just say I have to laugh when</v>

120
00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:33.710
<v Speaker 2>people say like that we're scared to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight someone.</v>

121
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people were like,</v>

122
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.800
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're scared to fight holly again.</v>

123
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't listen to those people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are scared is not a relative.</v>

124
00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not a term that I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters really,</v>

125
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.710
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have scared the way normal</v>

126
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.720
<v Speaker 2>people have scared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

127
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a normal person would be scared to,</v>

128
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.160
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get off their couch and go to the</v>

129
00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:52.851
<v Speaker 2>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:53.990
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to spar or something.</v>

131
00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we do.</v>

132
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Like we live like what most people would</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit their pants to do on a day</v>

133
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 1>fool to not know that it's a dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

134
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a matter of not being aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the danger.</v>

135
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a matter of managing the</v>

136
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>consequences are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he did a fantastic job with the</v>

137
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>holly fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally you did in that fight</v>

138
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.350
<v Speaker 1>other than the fifth round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the most amazing part of it.</v>

139
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>But you did everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when we were talking about like</v>

140
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do to beat her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

141
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.780
<v Speaker 1>she's gotta stay on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a very her rhythm and she's got</v>

142
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>to let holly come to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she can't rush in because if you</v>

143
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>rush into holly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Russian into Machida are</v>

144
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>rushing to anyone who's a great counter</v>
<v Speaker 1>striker and you saw the Rhonda fight.</v>

145
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Ronda just came bulldog and honor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to out bulldogger and you just,</v>

146
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that with holly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's too fast.</v>

147
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Footwork to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her striking is so precise.</v>

148
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her counters are so clean and our</v>

149
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 1>movements</v>

150
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 2>very hard to read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's very unpredictable.</v>

151
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 2>I remember what a couple times I tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>to maybe come forward and get her to get</v>

152
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 2>to the fence and I couldn't tell whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was going to jet out to the right to</v>

153
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:56.270
<v Speaker 2>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she,</v>

154
00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:58.350
<v Speaker 2>she's like two steps back left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

155
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.421
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

156
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 2>like I couldn't even tell like she had</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave no indication of which way she was</v>

157
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:02.910
<v Speaker 2>going to go.</v>

158
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you just did a fantastic job of</v>

159
00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:08.520
<v Speaker 1>varying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your approach to your speed was</v>

160
00:06:08.521 --> 00:06:09.390
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

161
00:06:09.391 --> 00:06:11.370
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did a lot of fainting,</v>

162
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you varied things up a lot and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell like,</v>

163
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.950
<v Speaker 1>she was like almost like waiting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>these moments to happen when you're</v>

164
00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:19.180
<v Speaker 1>going to come forward and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't come forward.</v>

165
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.360
<v Speaker 1>And then it becomes like a test of</v>
<v Speaker 1>patience.</v>

166
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Like who's going to get outside of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort zone?</v>

167
00:06:23.881 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to take chances?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to,</v>

168
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:29.520
<v Speaker 1>who's going to engage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she also has that weird stance too</v>

169
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.150
<v Speaker 1>when she kind of halfway stands like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxer and halfway stands like a karate</v>

170
00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:35.880
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She throws like a lot of sidekicks and</v>

171
00:06:35.881 --> 00:06:37.750
<v Speaker 1>on the front leg techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

172
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.641
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

173
00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:42.390
<v Speaker 1>she's a tricky one but we put together a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good game plan and I was happy</v>

174
00:06:42.391 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

175
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.260
<v Speaker 1>He did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the fifth round,</v>

176
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.720
<v Speaker 1>fifth round was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

177
00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:52.170
<v Speaker 1>when you grabbed a hold of her and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually got her back and got her to</v>

178
00:06:52.171 --> 00:06:56.850
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so crazy because every aspect of</v>

179
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.870
<v Speaker 1>from your initial entrance to the take</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to getting her back,</v>

180
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.560
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing 100% about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all touch and go.</v>

181
00:07:04.561 --> 00:07:07.680
<v Speaker 1>It was all scramble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like you had complete total</v>

182
00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:10.980
<v Speaker 1>control over like maybe like Damien Maia</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus Rick Story.</v>

183
00:07:10.981 --> 00:07:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damien Maia gets rick stories back.</v>

184
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.380
<v Speaker 1>He's got them locked up and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>anacondas and squeeze some and then it</v>

185
00:07:16.381 --> 00:07:17.850
<v Speaker 1>gets them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like that.</v>

186
00:07:17.851 --> 00:07:22.020
<v Speaker 1>It was like you were fighting for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking life and you knew there was no</v>

187
00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:23.310
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no time.</v>

188
00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:26.820
<v Speaker 1>You were likely down by like at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>one round and you were headed into the</v>

189
00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.700
<v Speaker 1>fifth and final round and maybe if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>won that round you could've got the</v>

190
00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:30.090
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

191
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.590
<v Speaker 1>But fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting the champ.</v>

192
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's going to happen.</v>

193
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.800
<v Speaker 1>You take our back and then when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to shake you off the top and you</v>

194
00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:40.530
<v Speaker 1>hang in there and you hang in there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see if you like,</v>

195
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.090
<v Speaker 1>and I would watch them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

196
00:07:42.091 --> 00:07:44.610
<v Speaker 1>she's going to go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when she went out and you climbed</v>

197
00:07:44.611 --> 00:07:47.340
<v Speaker 1>off her and she was unconscious like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

198
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a moment.</v>

199
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.770
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't gonna ratable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was incredible.</v>

200
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.510
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the best moments in all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's championship fighting as far as</v>

201
00:07:57.511 --> 00:07:59.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an extreme,</v>

202
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>extremely dramatic moment where your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to accomplish something.</v>

203
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.030
<v Speaker 1>She's fighting tooth and claw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither one of you are exhausted.</v>

204
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like anyone's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically compromised.</v>

205
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fucking mad scramble between</v>
<v Speaker 1>two killers and you get her and you got</v>

206
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:18.720
<v Speaker 1>her back and then you get it back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd sink the choking.</v>

207
00:08:18.721 --> 00:08:22.020
<v Speaker 1>And she's trying to fucking shake you</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and you hung in the APP and when she</v>

208
00:08:22.021 --> 00:08:25.950
<v Speaker 1>rolled and you're on top of her and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hung onto it and you realize like,</v>

209
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.870
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going out.</v>

210
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And she just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't even tap,</v>

211
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.510
<v Speaker 1>she was throwing punches in the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you were choking her unconscious.</v>

212
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.370
<v Speaker 2>I think to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

213
00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:37.530
<v Speaker 2>when is she going to tap?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't in my,</v>

214
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.710
<v Speaker 2>in that instinctual moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so used to in training you get</v>

215
00:08:40.711 --> 00:08:42.080
<v Speaker 2>people in a choke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know they tapped.</v>

216
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:43.590
<v Speaker 2>So I'm waiting for that tap and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

217
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.170
<v Speaker 2>good God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when is this girl going to tap?</v>

218
00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Like I know I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what does she hit tab and then,</v>

219
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 2>then I felt her like I saw her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

220
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.160
<v Speaker 2>from my peripherals kind of do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something.</v>

221
00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't quite sure if she was tapping</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what she was until I watched the</v>

222
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:57.870
<v Speaker 2>video later and then I felt him pull me</v>
<v Speaker 2>off and I'm like,</v>

223
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 2>that's the feeling that we fight for is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling that that feeling of like I</v>

224
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 2>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I established my dominance.</v>

225
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:04.841
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

226
00:09:04.841 --> 00:09:05.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.280
<v Speaker 2>it's a prideful sport in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 2>hand to hand combat with someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

229
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

230
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I did it tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was better.</v>

231
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It has to be prideful because otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just certain sacrifices into</v>

232
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.180
<v Speaker 1>certain fires that you're just not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to walk through.</v>

233
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have every fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

234
00:09:21.641 --> 00:09:24.040
<v Speaker 1>You have to be Zahn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to have an ego.</v>

235
00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:28.390
<v Speaker 1>There's to be so many things going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do achieve that highest level of</v>

236
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>greatness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like walking on a tight rope,</v>

237
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

238
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.800
<v Speaker 2>we'll let her just like that perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

239
00:09:33.801 --> 00:09:35.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking between buildings that are,</v>

240
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of stories high or,</v>

241
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's like,</v>

242
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.670
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like that.</v>

243
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have the perfect balance and</v>

244
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:44.810
<v Speaker 2>everything has to meet perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that moment,</v>

245
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.640
<v Speaker 2>including the training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not overtraining.</v>

246
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever hear of that video that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the video is not that good,</v>

247
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:52.430
<v Speaker 2>but the audio is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is awesome.</v>

248
00:09:52.431 --> 00:09:55.400
<v Speaker 2>It's between the fourth and fifth round</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's my corners.</v>

249
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.680
<v Speaker 2>What they're telling me between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth and fifth round.</v>

250
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.800
<v Speaker 2>It's such an emotional video for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I watched it,</v>

251
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:04.850
<v Speaker 2>it makes me relive that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Brian came in there and essentially</v>

252
00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:06.380
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Misha,</v>

253
00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:07.820
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you got to,</v>

254
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.160
<v Speaker 2>you have got to put your chin down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson,</v>

255
00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:11.900
<v Speaker 2>this chick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that basically means just get after</v>

256
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:13.270
<v Speaker 2>her like get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get in there,</v>

257
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.450
<v Speaker 2>get after it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the risk,</v>

258
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.910
<v Speaker 2>risk getting knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go for broke.</v>

259
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.560
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes,</v>

260
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plays into the round and,</v>

261
00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:23.000
<v Speaker 2>and basically it was just telling me</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking Mike Tyson,</v>

262
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:24.410
<v Speaker 2>her like get after her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:25.910
<v Speaker 2>bulldog or do whatever you've got to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

264
00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:29.210
<v Speaker 2>cause you're running out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember in that fifth round still</v>

265
00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:32.510
<v Speaker 2>trying to get out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mindset of like,</v>

266
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I have to find the perfect opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to be patient because the whole</v>

267
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:37.900
<v Speaker 2>training camp was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

268
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.220
<v Speaker 2>patient but persistent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

269
00:10:40.221 --> 00:10:42.320
<v Speaker 2>patient but persistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one run into anything cause you,</v>

270
00:10:42.321 --> 00:10:43.790
<v Speaker 2>you know you get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get knocked out,</v>

271
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:44.930
<v Speaker 2>you'll get need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get kicked,</v>

272
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:47.390
<v Speaker 2>you'll get punched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't do that.</v>

273
00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:50.090
<v Speaker 2>But you got to look for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opening when it's the right timing.</v>

274
00:10:50.091 --> 00:10:53.030
<v Speaker 2>It's all about timing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And after I took her down in that second</v>

275
00:10:53.031 --> 00:10:57.110
<v Speaker 2>round and I just beat her up that round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was so,</v>

276
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm so cautious and the third and fourth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so perfect.</v>

277
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her game plan was perfect.</v>

278
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Do to beat me to stay just far enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the range and keep me from not</v>

279
00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:08.540
<v Speaker 2>wanting to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't find a perfect opening,</v>

280
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.090
<v Speaker 2>couldn't like get in on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't mistakes that she was</v>

281
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:14.210
<v Speaker 2>making and in the fifth round I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided,</v>

282
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to,</v>

283
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.830
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to take the chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting knocked out.</v>

284
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.780
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what it's boiling down to now.</v>

285
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Speaker 2>You've got like three minutes left on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the clock and now it's do or die.</v>

286
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.260
<v Speaker 2>It's either you go in there you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go for it,</v>

287
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:29.810
<v Speaker 2>you do Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she catches you,</v>

288
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.980
<v Speaker 2>you get knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

289
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:34.580
<v Speaker 2>you gave it everything you got or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to make something happen.</v>

290
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.460
<v Speaker 2>You finish the fight.</v>

291
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.220
<v Speaker 1>The question was really like whether the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second round was a 10,</v>

292
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:39.960
<v Speaker 1>eight round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:41.670
<v Speaker 1>on all three judges score cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

294
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean watching it,</v>

295
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.320
<v Speaker 1>that's what the judges said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it should have been but,</v>

296
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.720
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I meant was the question watching.</v>

297
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It was like I want like when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were headed into the fifth</v>

298
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 1>round with my question was was I wonder</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she got a ten eight round for that</v>

299
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:58.340
<v Speaker 1>second round because if she did then</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like a,</v>

300
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 1>this is an even fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening right now?</v>

301
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

302
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.180
<v Speaker 1>how the judge is looking at it going</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the fifth round.</v>

303
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:05.610
<v Speaker 1>It was even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Does another time.</v>

306
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.340

<v Speaker 1>when you're there and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the power of it.</v>

323
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had visualized that moment so many</v>

324
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 1>times that it felt like I was confused</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that it was hard for me to</v>

325
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:02.210
<v Speaker 1>distinguish that that was the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment I would go.</v>

326
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it was so intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so surreal.</v>

327
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine my to this day it</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably seems fake.</v>

328
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Hat's really what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

329
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.490

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:14.200
<v Speaker 1>that really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really happened.</v>

331
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.640
<v Speaker 1>It really happened right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was topped Jay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank yeah,</v>

333
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.400
<v Speaker 1>that excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had like if Auras were real,</v>

334

<v Speaker 1>you know like fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had ci it was coming off your</v>

335
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:30.380
<v Speaker 1>body for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did a photo</v>

336
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.970
<v Speaker 1>falling over and been shaking papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cups,</v>

337
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.460
<v Speaker 1>foreign to the air and carpet would rip</v>
<v Speaker 1>gracious</v>

338
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.710
<v Speaker 1>moments in my life for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could only imagine you could only am,</v>

339
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean and anyone that watches that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport,</v>

340
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.750
<v Speaker 1>that moment when you choked her out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the whole exchange of the fee.</v>

341
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Well even like that really the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight because a fight is like,</v>

342
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we call this martial arts and</v>

343
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with that.</v>

344
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.760
<v Speaker 1>But in my mind that there is an art to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you guys did in that fight.</v>

345
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.450
<v Speaker 1>And even what holly did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because up until that fifth round,</v>

346
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

347
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 1>especially the third and fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was doing what she wanted to do.</v>

348
00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.510
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

349
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.100
<v Speaker 1>and there was a display going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like a,</v>

350
00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 1>there was a performance going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of this being a competition to</v>

351
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:25.060
<v Speaker 1>watch it as someone sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it and calling it,</v>

352
00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:28.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a work of art and to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in that way,</v>

353
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a masterful performance.</v>

354
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.870
<v Speaker 1>It was such a masterpiece moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is like one of the best</v>

355
00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:39.871
<v Speaker 1>moments in mma because it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hard thing to achieve to become</v>

356
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:43.090
<v Speaker 1>a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for someone like you had tried and</v>

357
00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:45.240
<v Speaker 1>tried again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he won the title in strike force and</v>

358
00:14:45.241 --> 00:14:48.940
<v Speaker 1>you're trying and trying again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make this happen and you know,</v>

359
00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 1>you think you're getting boxed out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rhonda fight didn't happen after you</v>

360
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:57.980
<v Speaker 1>beat Jessica I and then all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this opportunity and they comes</v>

361
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:02.720
<v Speaker 1>to together in one of the most powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways we've ever seen inside the octagon.</v>

362
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.553
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

363
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>

364
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.030
<v Speaker 2>that was quite a great narration of</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's had to happen to make</v>

365
00:15:10.031 --> 00:15:10.691
<v Speaker 2>this come true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

366
00:15:10.691 --> 00:15:11.381
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

367
00:15:11.381 --> 00:15:12.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy because,</v>

368
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 10 the same month,</v>

369
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.730
<v Speaker 2>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the like the month,</v>

370
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I had had my first fight.</v>

371
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been 10 years.</v>

372
00:15:23.171 --> 00:15:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's crazy because you think 10 years</v>

373
00:15:26.531 --> 00:15:28.500
<v Speaker 2>ago there wasn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

374
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.060
<v Speaker 2>women's MMA was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was,</v>

375
00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one to me it wasn't obviously,</v>

376
00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:34.780
<v Speaker 2>but to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to most people it was a spectacle at</v>

377
00:15:34.781 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

378
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Something they kind of threw on the card</v>
<v Speaker 2>is kind of like,</v>

379
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.471
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ha ha.</v>

380
00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:39.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch the chicks fight.</v>

381
00:15:39.941 --> 00:15:42.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it'll pop out.</v>

382
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:47.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so true because they didn't respect</v>

383
00:15:49.841 --> 00:15:51.070
<v Speaker 2>us as athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

384
00:15:51.071 --> 00:15:52.060
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we,</v>

385
00:15:52.061 --> 00:15:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

386
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.070
<v Speaker 2>that's the honest truth.</v>

387
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the uphill battle that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nobody took it seriously.</v>

388
00:15:56.681 --> 00:15:59.470
<v Speaker 2>We didn't make any money.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

435
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.190
<v Speaker 1>and she doesn't fit the mold either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like both of you guys are really</v>

436
00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:20.960
<v Speaker 1>interesting representatives of MMA and</v>
<v Speaker 1>great representatives because you break</v>

437
00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:21.750
<v Speaker 1>that mold.</v>

438
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.220
<v Speaker 2>You know a fan of her manager though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

439
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Who is your why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

440
00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:27.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if I've ever met him</v>
<v Speaker 2>in person.</v>

441
00:17:27.311 --> 00:17:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I probably haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I have.</v>

442
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.950
<v Speaker 2>If I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't memorable.</v>

443
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.180
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

444
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I guess he went like Dana went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Tina Dana told me this,</v>

445
00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Dana went down to albuquerque before</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fight ever came together of her and</v>

446
00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:39.874
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

447
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.920
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

448
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.740
<v Speaker 2>you guys need to wait for Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

449
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.600
<v Speaker 2>That's the big money fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fight.</v>

450
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:47.860
<v Speaker 2>You want to wait for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went down there.</v>

451
00:17:47.861 --> 00:17:48.641
<v Speaker 2>He told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my face.</v>

452
00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:51.260
<v Speaker 2>He went down to tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fight me,</v>

453
00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.540
<v Speaker 2>tate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they didn't want to give me the UC</v>

454
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.210
<v Speaker 2>did not want that fight to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

455
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 2>They wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

456
00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.960
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rematch to be the first fight.</v>

457
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.480
<v Speaker 2>And Holly's manager told him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want me Shantae and Dana said he</v>

458
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 2>threw up his hands and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking kidding me?</v>

459
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:06.750
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's been the baddest,</v>

460
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than Ronda for years now.</v>

461
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:11.720
<v Speaker 2>And you want to take her lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you're just gonna walk there?</v>
