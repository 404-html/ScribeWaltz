<v Speaker 1>I got hooked up with John Dudley early</v>

29
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>before I developed target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Panic is the master and he explained to</v>

<v Speaker 2>friends out there in life.</v>

34
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 2>The clusterfuck to omniscience is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we aspire to.</v>

35
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.850
<v Speaker 2>A maximum level of awareness on all</v>
<v Speaker 2>fronts.</v>

36
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Our curfew or a welder or a podcast or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guitar player,</v>

37
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.600
<v Speaker 2>a butcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

38
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Maximum efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being the best that you can be,</v>

39
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.640
<v Speaker 2>clear mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear conscience,</v>

40
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 2>true north compass in the world of</v>
<v Speaker 2>archery because it does consume you.</v>

41
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.130
<v Speaker 2>And here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 years clean and sober because I'm</v>

42
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 2>currently an forever consumed with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mystical flight of the era,</v>

43
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Speaker 2>which is the origins of Zen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Japanese religion of not shooting an</v>

44
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being an arrow,</v>

45
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.740
<v Speaker 2>but being the path of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you use the gifts from God to the</v>

46
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 2>ultimate application of efficiency and</v>
<v Speaker 2>effectiveness,</v>

47
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 2>you can put that fucking Arrow right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

48
00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 2>What you want it to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the baggage that all humans have to</v>

49
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 2>deal with and it's most painfully</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifested in the pursuit of archery is</v>

50
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 2>too many minds.</v>

51
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 2>You can't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you got to think about playing Wang</v>

52
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Dang sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poon Tang ain't going to play it.</v>

53
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.410
<v Speaker 2>It better just be you and unleash and</v>
<v Speaker 2>with an Arrow because you want to let</v>

54
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 2>that Arrow go because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're shooting an arrow.</v>

55
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Archery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to put that out down there in</v>

56
00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 2>that bullseye or on that pump station or</v>
<v Speaker 2>that crease of the Buffalo,</v>

57
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 2>and so you want it to go because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're here for is to let the Arrow</v>

58
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got to tell yourself,</v>

59
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 2>you can't let the Arrow go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to shoot so many arrows</v>

60
00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 2>throughout your life that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

61
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Too many minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subconscious physics,</v>

62
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 2>spirituality ingrained deep within your</v>
<v Speaker 2>origins and aboriginal ancestry.</v>

63
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.763
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

64
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 2>If ever there was an aim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small Ms. Small perfection.</v>

65
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 2>It's archery and let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to monologue here.</v>

66
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so much of my life.</v>

67
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what you do,</v>

68
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 2>and I've done this since the sixties</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the hippies were trying to get me</v>

69
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 2>stone and I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

70
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 2>that's not what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you want to do is get a bone arrow.</v>

71
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Would you want to do is escape what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to escape,</v>

72
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 2>the pressures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pressures,</v>

73
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 2>fuck those pressures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You be the source of pressure,</v>

74
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 2>not the receiver of pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my dad raised me.</v>

75
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.250
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was a drill sergeant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God blessed that son of a bitch is</v>

76
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated them.</v>

77
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>

78
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>

79
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 2>especially at the archery range and so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned archery and when I'm playing</v>

80
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 2>guitar and I'm playing all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>outrageous,</v>

81
00:03:58.991 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 2>chuck berry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bo Diddley,</v>

82
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 2>a little richard stuff and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting high and drunk and they're</v>

83
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 2>really great musicians and the more high</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the more drunk they got.</v>

84
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 2>They became less great musicians until</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where they weren't even</v>

85
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>musicians anymore and so I would escape</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I as 1112 and there was no</v>

86
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 2>hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was beatniks and I'd get back to my</v>

87
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 2>little house in Redford on the Rouge</v>
<v Speaker 2>River in Detroit and I get that little</v>

88
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 2>bone Arrow and I go down to skunk hallow</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a river rat.</v>

89
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 2>And even as a stupid mushy brained idiot</v>
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>

90
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I was able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>little the Longbow.</v>

91
00:04:39.741 --> 00:04:41.210
<v Speaker 2>No recurves yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

92
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 2>I could shoot a rat in the eye because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had no baggage yet.</v>

93
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I haven't developed any social baggage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that has served me.</v>

94
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:56.700
<v Speaker 2>So the many minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many.</v>

95
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine's the baggage.</v>

96
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too many miles.</v>

97
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's a thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't shoot arrows when you start</v>

98
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 2>talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really understand what you're</v>

99
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly what you're saying.</v>

100
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 2>But for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a very misunderstood subject,</v>

101
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.773
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

102
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 2>That did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is a meditation.</v>

103
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a meditation involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute meditation.</v>

104
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's out of body.</v>

105
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the ultimate guitar lick,</v>

106
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I suspect a comedian on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I qualify it.</v>

107
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 2>You can't be thinking of your routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a flow.</v>

108
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the presence of Sam Kinison for</v>

109
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 spontaneous performances and Robin</v>

110

00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 2>available to mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hunted with Fred fucking bear.</v>

119
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 2>When did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have five or six.</v>

120
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 2>I met him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was started the brand new archery</v>

121
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:03.801
<v Speaker 2>shopping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grayling,</v>

122
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was already a follower before I</v>

123
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 2>was exploring to people who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are uninitiated.</v>

124
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Powerful story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like the Richard Pryor of archery.</v>

125
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I was expecting his afro to catch fire</v>
<v Speaker 2>any moment.</v>

126
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>So I'm already into bows and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who fred bear was.</v>

127
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I really was just getting baptized by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chuck Berry,</v>

128
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Bo Diddley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>electronic guitar or g,</v>

129
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 2>and in that late forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early fifties.</v>

130
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 2>It was a firestorm of defiance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>rebellion musically manifested,</v>

131
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 2>but Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether b was going beyond the 30 slash</v>

132
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which everybody used for deer hunting</v>

133
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 2>and it was a good hundred yard and for</v>
<v Speaker 2>real marchmen real zen marksman could</v>

134
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 2>shoot a 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3,200 plus yards whether open sites or</v>

135
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.590
<v Speaker 2>scope and marksmanship and sniper</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline was a powerful force in a</v>

136
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 2>hunting family and in all families.</v>

137
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Every family I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all shot every weekend,</v>

138
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 2>pistols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shotguns,</v>

139
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 2>rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 twos,</v>

140
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>woodchucks and Freiberg,</v>

141
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania with the target master</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remington single shot bolt,</v>

142
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 2>20 to 22 shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twenty five cents a box at the dry goods</v>

143
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

144
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 2>And with my dad taught me to shoot him</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the eye.</v>

145
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Aim Small Miss Small breathe site</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquisition.</v>

146
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 2>You have a responsibility to kill that</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal outright if you're going to</v>

147
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:26.831
<v Speaker 2>utilize that precious gift of flesh and</v>
<v Speaker 2>for body fluids and bone,</v>

148
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 2>you better kill him clean because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reasoning predator.</v>

149
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.650
<v Speaker 2>You have a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual and spiritual obligation to</v>

150
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:41.260
<v Speaker 2>kill your dinner humanely and cleanly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duh.</v>

151
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.780
<v Speaker 2>And so that marksmanship routine was</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing with ballistic Ted nugent,</v>

152
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.880
<v Speaker 2>ballistically maximized firepower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Roy stands for,</v>

153
00:07:51.881 --> 00:07:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I thought it said bad motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

154
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:58.030
<v Speaker 2>that has a ring to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's maybe that's what it good.</v>

155
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Fred Threadbare,</v>

156
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Fred Beck.</v>

157
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 2>So Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether be was extending long range</v>

158
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 2>marksmanship and developing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous,</v>

159
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 2>whether it be magnums with more powder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more efficient burning powder.</v>

160
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm better primers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better designed ballistic bullets that</v>

161
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 2>would cut air better and go flatter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer,</v>

162
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:22.100
<v Speaker 2>better trajectory and velocity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it was fun to shoot that deer or</v>

163
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 2>a bullseye at 100 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That takes a lot of trigger control and</v>

164
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now roy,</v>

165
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.640
<v Speaker 2>whether it be was creating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be magnums,</v>

166
00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:31.210
<v Speaker 2>the 300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be magnum shout,</v>

167
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 2>100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years,</v>

168
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 2>80 grain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullet it 32,</v>

169
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:37.190
<v Speaker 2>3,400 feet a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was unheard of,</v>

170
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 2>and so you could aim small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms. Small,</v>

171
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 2>and if you really got that really</v>
<v Speaker 2>intricate,</v>

172
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 2>meticulous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>triggered a smoothness,</v>

173
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 2>you could shoot thousand yards once you</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn the trajectory of your gun.</v>

174
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1911,</v>

175
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.960
<v Speaker 2>the last of the Yani Indians issue was</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered in Oroville.</v>

176
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I remember all this in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oroville,</v>

177
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>northern California,</v>

178
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 2>and there was a bounty on Indians back</v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

179
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 2>You could shoot a man Indian and get 25</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks.</v>

180
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 2>You shoot until 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

181
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 2>They had bounties on him instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting this,</v>

182
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Yani,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this last Indian,</v>

183
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.310
<v Speaker 2>they called the local sheriff and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>took him into custody and they called,</v>

184
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some scientists.</v>

185
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.610
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pellant theologists,</v>

186
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm from California University by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>name of our Saxton Pope,</v>

187
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 2>and Saxton pope came and studied egg as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

188
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 2>as a aboriginal last pope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pope and young that's right.</v>

189
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 2>And then he contacted his buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>art young,</v>

190
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.720
<v Speaker 2>who also studied in that genre and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered ecg and they were fascinated</v>

191
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 2>by his stealthy awareness of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wilderness in his archery control,</v>

192
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 2>with his funny little style of shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bull with his thumb and getting</v>

193
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:06.171
<v Speaker 2>close and doing an ice cold river</v>
<v Speaker 2>bathing before the hunt to cleanse</v>

194
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:11.871
<v Speaker 2>himself to be worthy of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Fred bear witnessed the film that</v>

195
00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:17.661
<v Speaker 2>Pope and young eventually made of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming consumed with the mystical</v>

196
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:19.404
<v Speaker 2>flight of the Arrow.</v>

197
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Now this was in the twenties and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties,</v>

198
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 2>and they put a newsreel out when all</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the country and showed this</v>

199
00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 2>newsreel of hunting with the bone Arrow</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Saxton Pope in art,</v>

200
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 2>young shooting grizzly bears in Yosemite</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going to Africa,</v>

201
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:33.290
<v Speaker 2>filling lines full of arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't really as good as he.</v>

202
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.960
<v Speaker 2>She said they'd fling arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these animals pretty relaxed,</v>

203
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 2>almost tame because they'd never been</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunted like that before.</v>

204
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.960
<v Speaker 2>And so fred bear come from Pennsylvania</v>
<v Speaker 2>around that time to work at the palm oil</v>

205
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>building cabinets for the new radio.</v>

206
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:52.500
<v Speaker 2>They just invented in the wood</v>
<v Speaker 2>dashboards for the Ford Motor Company.</v>

207
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 2>And he was also making bows a handmade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't,</v>

208
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:01.610
<v Speaker 2>or osage orange bows in his little</v>
<v Speaker 2>archery shop with nels grumbly.</v>

209
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:05.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I remembered Nell's</v>
<v Speaker 2>grumbling one of the greatest boyers of</v>

210
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:09.840
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my dad got the archery bug because</v>

211
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Fred defied the trend of easier hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier,</v>

212
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:16.260
<v Speaker 2>long range.</v>

213
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.480
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have to be very stealthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue to dear 500 yards.</v>

214
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:21.000
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to do is be a discipline</v>

215
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Marchmen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a discipline and a great</v>

216
00:11:23.461 --> 00:11:27.780
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment unto itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a new challenge for long</v>

217
00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 2>range ballistic capability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will Pope and young and a handful,</v>

218
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:37.790
<v Speaker 2>fred bear knows grumbly went and saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>this newsreel of these guys,</v>

219
00:11:38.371 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 2>these doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

220
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professors hunting all over the world</v>

221
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:45.090
<v Speaker 2>with these handmade bows and fed was</v>
<v Speaker 2>already into it.</v>

222
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.380
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be damn this,</v>

223
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now people after seeing the pope</v>

224
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:58.710
<v Speaker 2>and young newsreel started asking Fred</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make bows and it's spread.</v>

225
00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.620
<v Speaker 2>So we started the bear archery company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>late twenties,</v>

226
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 2>early thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he moved to grayling up in the</v>

227
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 2>northern part of Michigan with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wilderness was,</v>

228
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 2>and they had cut down all the trees.</v>

229
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.480
<v Speaker 2>So there was this new growth of ideal</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife habitat because not many</v>

230
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 2>animals can live in an old growth forest</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our tool,</v>

231
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.840
<v Speaker 2>but you need low level escape sanctuary</v>
<v Speaker 2>and browse that the animals can access.</v>

232
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.280
<v Speaker 2>And so fred was now promoting our tree</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Michigan won all the,</v>

233
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

234
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.570
<v Speaker 2>national field archery championship</v>
<v Speaker 2>championships along with an Marston.</v>

235
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my dad was a follower because</v>

236
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:39.520
<v Speaker 2>he'd come back from World War II and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed that escape.</v>

237
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.600
<v Speaker 2>He needed that cleansing to get away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from that horror,</v>

238
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.980
<v Speaker 2>which is why they never talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we go up north every year,</v>

239
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 2>October first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new gene family and the Ford station</v>

240
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 2>wagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had my little bone Arrow with the</v>

241
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:54.160
<v Speaker 2>suction cups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd shoot stuffed animals off the</v>

242
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:56.380
<v Speaker 2>couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my dad would walk the woods with his</v>

243
00:12:56.381 --> 00:13:01.381
<v Speaker 2>real bowl and we'd stop at this little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a brick shack that said bear archery.</v>

244
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 2>And I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was already into bows and</v>

245
00:13:04.631 --> 00:13:06.640
<v Speaker 2>arrows shooting all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was obsessed.</v>

246
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I was under the river every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No baseball,</v>

247
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:10.840
<v Speaker 2>no football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no hockey bows and arrows,</v>

248
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:11.530
<v Speaker 2>bows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murals,</v>

249
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 2>critters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I had the songbird world slammed</v>

250
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:16.270
<v Speaker 2>by the time I was eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

251
00:13:16.271 --> 00:13:18.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so now I'm meeting this tall,</v>

252
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:22.570
<v Speaker 2>lanky gentleman named Fred Bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't register with me until I</v>

253
00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:27.571
<v Speaker 2>started seeing him on the cover of true</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine and sporting magazines and in</v>

254
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 2>life magazine with a Grizzly bear and an</v>
<v Speaker 2>elephant and a tiger and a lion in the</v>

255
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 2>newsreels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going,</v>

256
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm shooting river rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so thrilling.</v>

257
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I can't even describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's this long,</v>

258
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:39.010
<v Speaker 2>lanky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tall,</v>

259
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:42.770
<v Speaker 2>lanky guy that was building bows in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>rustic,</v>

260
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.240
<v Speaker 2>rustic shop in northern Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On my way to my favorite thing in life,</v>

261
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 2>October,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first opening day of archery season as a</v>

262
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:49.811
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

263
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 2>eight year old boy and we'd have</v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate milk and Cherry Pie with this</v>

264
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 2>fred bear guy.</v>

265
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Now it's registering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the Chuck Berry of bonding.</v>

266
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.130
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the guy.</v>

267
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 2>So I became a namerd with him and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind to me and he'd show me stuff,</v>

268
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 2>but I got to hang out with them as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>grew.</v>

269
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.120
<v Speaker 2>By the time I was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we moved to Chicago was my dad got</v>

270
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.580
<v Speaker 2>transferred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got to visit with Fred bear at</v>

271
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:16.120
<v Speaker 2>least every other October.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never hunted with them and I'm now.</v>

272
00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I started amboy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dukes.</v>

273
00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:19.870
<v Speaker 2>I'd already had a great band when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>battle of the bands in Michigan with the</v>

274
00:14:19.871 --> 00:14:22.000
<v Speaker 2>lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We opened up for the supreme and the</v>

275
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Bulb Romas at Cobo Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

276
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.690
<v Speaker 2>And so now I'm in Chicago shooting my</v>
<v Speaker 2>boner all the time.</v>

277
00:14:25.691 --> 00:14:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Started the amboy dukes playing like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>madman,</v>

278
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 2>graduated in 67,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went back to Michigan that two years</v>

279
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.240
<v Speaker 2>later and immediately went up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>grading.</v>

280
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:38.080
<v Speaker 2>We're now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this huge cathedral bear archery</v>

281
00:14:38.081 --> 00:14:43.081
<v Speaker 2>and fred bear is like that dude is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sporting dude because he taught the</v>

282
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 2>long range marksman that there's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimacy,</v>

283
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a a better learning process and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more lesson to not kill the animal,</v>

284
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.200
<v Speaker 2>but to understand your relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal and to try to use those God</v>

285
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:01.910
<v Speaker 2>given gifts.</v>

286
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.910
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned a moment ago to penetrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>the otherwise impenetrable defense</v>

287
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:12.461
<v Speaker 2>system of game because they are sneaky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elusive crafty.</v>

288
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 2>God made them to get away from guitar</v>
<v Speaker 2>players with sharp sticks and so this</v>

289
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 2>caught on because people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

290
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I killed my deer every year with my 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 now with the 30 odd six and Roy Beth</v>

291
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.300
<v Speaker 2>rather be long range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if I'm a bad ass enough to get</v>

292
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.790
<v Speaker 2>close to a deer with a bow and arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it caught on like wildfire and they</v>

293
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:36.890
<v Speaker 2>made the first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fred got the first legal season in</v>

294
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Alagan state park on November first</v>

295
00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:41.510
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>47.</v>

296
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.760
<v Speaker 3>George Nichols,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my buddy got the first legal buck and</v>

297
00:15:44.761 --> 00:15:46.390
<v Speaker 3>Michigan with a bone Arrow on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>

298
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.730
<v Speaker 3>and so I knew these are the guys I hang</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

299
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.340
<v Speaker 3>These were the founders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These were like you were.</v>

300
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.110
<v Speaker 3>I was at the concord bridge of our tree</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so fred had embraced me.</v>

301
00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:59.620
<v Speaker 3>It was real suspicious of the long</v>
<v Speaker 3>haired Hippie looking,</v>

302
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rock and Maniac Motor City Madman,</v>

303
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.080
<v Speaker 3>but all of his friends would not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

304
00:16:05.081 --> 00:16:06.790
<v Speaker 3>he's not into drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in fact,</v>

305
00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:10.030
<v Speaker 3>he's anti-drug and he's always promoting</v>
<v Speaker 3>our trash out my bone,</v>

306
00:16:10.031 --> 00:16:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Arizona state forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like shoot flaming arrows at skulls and</v>

307
00:16:13.691 --> 00:16:15.700
<v Speaker 3>a big illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a felony,</v>

308
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.370
<v Speaker 3>a big Turkey vulture I stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it looked great.</v>

309
00:16:18.371 --> 00:16:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Backlit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

310
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.520
<v Speaker 3>and I'd shoot that fucker off this amps</v>
<v Speaker 3>at night.</v>

311
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.910
<v Speaker 3>People didn't know whether to shit or go</v>
<v Speaker 3>blind is this wild man screen,</v>

312
00:16:24.911 --> 00:16:29.911
<v Speaker 3>the bird lands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it all this outrageous racket.</v>

313
00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:33.040
<v Speaker 3>I come up with a bow and Arrow and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>flaming Arrow and blow up a Turkey</v>

314
00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:35.320
<v Speaker 3>vulture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What more do you want?</v>

315
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:40.590
<v Speaker 3>And so fred got looked past the insanity</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the fear factor of rock and roll,</v>

316
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.130
<v Speaker 3>and he finally admitted to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

317
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 2>sporting good show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to Ted.</v>

318
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.610
<v Speaker 2>All the young people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody under 30,</v>

319
00:16:49.611 --> 00:16:51.920
<v Speaker 2>all they want to know is if I know Ted</v>
<v Speaker 2>nugent,</v>

320
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.500
<v Speaker 2>because that was the first time they</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever saw bone arrow.</v>

321
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.760
<v Speaker 2>And they read my you my interviews about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the spirit,</v>

322
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.770
<v Speaker 2>the cleansing of escaping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the insanity of whatever your job</v>

323
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:06.320
<v Speaker 2>description might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine being maniacal rock and roll.</v>

324
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I need to shut the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a deep breath,</v>

325
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:18.610
<v Speaker 2>get my bone Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let my guitars breed head back to the</v>

326
00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:24.311
<v Speaker 2>woods</v>
<v Speaker 2>and live and remember who I am and what</v>

327
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I never killed a deer as little too</v>

328
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.320
<v Speaker 2>uppity and we didn't know what we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing back then.</v>

329
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.630
<v Speaker 2>You were too uppity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think?</v>

330
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

331
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm high energy.</v>

332
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.050
<v Speaker 3>So you had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be too loud.</v>

333
00:17:43.051 --> 00:17:43.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could walk through.</v>

334
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.330
<v Speaker 3>I learned from Fred Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned</v>

335
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:50.140
<v Speaker 2>to walk toe first and I learned to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything you</v>

336
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 1>instead of stepping over and to stay in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shadows so I knew the maneuvers,</v>

337
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.500
<v Speaker 1>but coming out of a tour and playing 350</v>
<v Speaker 1>nights a year and then you get a couple</v>

338
00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 1>of days after in November and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bone marrow.</v>

339
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.200
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to go from that to total</v>
<v Speaker 1>silence,</v>

340
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.270
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've mastered it.</v>

341
00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I know yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally.</v>

342
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you might take a long time by</v>

343
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:16.230
<v Speaker 1>the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about masters.</v>

344
00:18:16.231 --> 00:18:19.190
<v Speaker 1>You'll never master it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've mastered transition.</v>

345
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.810
<v Speaker 1>What do you say when people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

346
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.750
<v Speaker 1>One of the arguments about hunting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people bring up is why would you use a</v>

347
00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:28.380
<v Speaker 1>bow and arrow bone is not as effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to kill somebody issues at</v>

348
00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:30.510
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that don't hunt that</v>

349
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 1>think that hunting should only be one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and it should only be killing the</v>

350
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.404
<v Speaker 1>animal from me.</v>

351
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I think that someone who hunts</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely kills the animal from me.</v>

352
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.360
<v Speaker 1>There's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more to the whole thing.</v>

353
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen me expound on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun sport meet trophy.</v>

354
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't hunt without having fun or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't do it.</v>

355
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.230
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to challenge yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to get up and some people will</v>

356
00:18:54.231 --> 00:18:58.620
<v Speaker 1>have a problem with that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can kiss my ass if it wasn't fun.</v>

357
00:18:58.621 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 1>None of us would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand your,</v>

358
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:03.120
<v Speaker 1>your your take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can kicks kiss your ass,</v>

359
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.450
<v Speaker 1>but you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means something to you.</v>

360
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:08.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not as simple as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

361
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.510
<v Speaker 1>This is just how I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deep Fun is being the greatest</v>

362
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:14.580
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three point shooter.</v>

363
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that fun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Must be discipline.</v>

364
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.050
<v Speaker 1>He will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

365
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.780
<v Speaker 1>It's always fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's invigorating and the</v>

366
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:25.480
<v Speaker 1>bow hunting is more invigorated because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so difficult.</v>

367
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Borderline impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun sport it.</v>

368
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think sport hunting is good.</v>

369
00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:34.350
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you hunt without sport,</v>

370
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that there's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many of these words are poisoned.</v>

371
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 1>There's like trophy hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't hunt without a trophy.</v>

372
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.800
<v Speaker 1>You know what I have on my wall in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern cabin?</v>

373
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:46.620
<v Speaker 1>You're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already are inclined to love me,</v>

374
00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:49.470
<v Speaker 1>but now you're really going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fuck me right here on</v>

375
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:51.180
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not loved.</v>

376
00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a metaphorically speaking is for</v>

377
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:55.530
<v Speaker 1>some of my buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyhow,</v>

378
00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.510
<v Speaker 1>so on the wall of my cabin in northern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michigan is my first kill.</v>

379
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:01.830
<v Speaker 1>November 15th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

380
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:03.210
<v Speaker 1>69.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad's priest.</v>

381
00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Sixty seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck button.</v>

382
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Buck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you hear the story?</v>

383
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I took it to the taxidermist and I</v>

384
00:20:08.851 --> 00:20:11.580
<v Speaker 1>said I want this mind what he said here</v>
<v Speaker 1>to mount this,</v>

385
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.140
<v Speaker 1>but button button.</v>

386
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Buck is a font of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has little buttons on his</v>

387
00:20:15.811 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 1>forehead which is illegal deer with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>doe tag.</v>

388
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:21.420
<v Speaker 1>And I had that year and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a buck feel.</v>

389
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.460
<v Speaker 1>You have to feel on the to make sure it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a buck is it's such a little guy and</v>

390
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.270
<v Speaker 1>it's illegal dear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a delicious deer.</v>

391
00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:28.650
<v Speaker 1>The deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the year is a fond.</v>

392
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.350
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have this hunting season</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fall because now they're</v>

393
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:33.290
<v Speaker 1>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not there had been weaned.</v>

394
00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:35.160
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're independent animals.</v>

395
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.050
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

396
00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.390
<v Speaker 1>the button bucks are there assets get</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked by their mother to throw him out</v>

397
00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:41.340
<v Speaker 1>of the herd and get the hell out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way for more breeding,</v>

398
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.370
<v Speaker 1>which is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

399
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.320
<v Speaker 1>and so I have that button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buck mounted.</v>

400
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to tell me that's not a</v>

401
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:48.724
<v Speaker 1>trophy?</v>

402
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:49.770
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

403
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experiences,</v>

404
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 2>the memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the clothes,</v>

405
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:54.550
<v Speaker 2>the bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day,</v>

406
00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:56.380
<v Speaker 2>the sunrise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crows,</v>

407
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.930
<v Speaker 2>the sandhill cranes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the birds,</v>

408
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.900
<v Speaker 2>the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anticipation.</v>

409
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.770
<v Speaker 2>And I got backstraps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had fun.</v>

410
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Ultimate discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge,</v>

411
00:21:07.931 --> 00:21:10.450
<v Speaker 2>sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate meet,</v>

412
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.730
<v Speaker 2>ultimate protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The purest,</v>

413
00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:17.731
<v Speaker 2>most organic before it was even hip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you could I dare you to tell me</v>

414
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:19.870
<v Speaker 2>that button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buck is not a trophy.</v>

415
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have woodchucks mounted.</v>

416
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I got a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would chuck in the eye with my</v>

417
00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:29.440
<v Speaker 2>grandson when I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have squirrels.</v>

418
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Mount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always a trophy mounts.</v>

419
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The squirrels are,</v>

420
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:34.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

421
00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:36.540
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you first start out and you killed</v>

422
00:21:36.541 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 2>that first squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exciting stuff.</v>

423
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.270
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

424
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 2>it's always put a squirrel that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>mounted on a,</v>

425
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:47.230
<v Speaker 2>on a limb at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the cabin along with Rocco and my son</v>

426
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 2>out here is first one we'd duck that.</v>

427
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.830
<v Speaker 2>He got very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

428
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.290
<v Speaker 2>with much effort and we have that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>duck mounted.</v>

429
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.410
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a love affair with our</v>

430
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.800
<v Speaker 2>instinctual stewardship duties to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife to harvest the surplus,</v>

431
00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:05.620
<v Speaker 2>to make room for next spring's</v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity because there's going to be</v>

432
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 2>more animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's not going to be more</v>

433
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:12.070
<v Speaker 2>habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence sustain yield successful wildlife</v>

434
00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:14.440
<v Speaker 2>management model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so perfect.</v>

435
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Speaker 2>It defies criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless your alliance sack of Shit.</v>

436
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had to have a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with someone who's anti</v>

437
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 2>hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever like sat down?</v>

438

439
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to the man and woman,</v>

440
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.860

<v Speaker 2>well vague and I like that Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Vegan,</v>

442
00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:34.880
<v Speaker 2>whatever is in Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even pronounce it much less</v>

443
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.510
<v Speaker 2>really comes out of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Figure it out.</v>

444
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.740
<v Speaker 2>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

445
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:40.660
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my son Rocco,</v>

446
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.810
<v Speaker 2>who I love beyond description Vegan.</v>

447
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.950
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

448
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.540
<v Speaker 2>he has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He needs to eat more</v>

449
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.670
<v Speaker 2>when he's asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to shove up backstrap up his ass,</v>

450
00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 2>but he's got more muscles that I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyhow.</v>

451
00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.630
<v Speaker 2>My point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that how that.</v>

452
00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.630
<v Speaker 2>How did he become Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't died yet.</v>

453
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.330
<v Speaker 2>He has a digest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a great hunter.</v>

454
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.670
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like to hunt anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's decided not to.</v>

455
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.650
<v Speaker 2>He's killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great dear.</v>

456
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Great Hogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them on your TV.</v>

457
00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:08.141
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ducks.</v>

458
00:23:08.141 --> 00:23:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great hunter,</v>

459
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.970
<v Speaker 2>but he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He decided he does not want to take part</v>

460
00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 2>in the harvest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect it completely,</v>

461
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.070
<v Speaker 2>but if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to kill the most</v>

462
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:25.480
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a vegan because the farmers who</v>

463
00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:30.481
<v Speaker 2>protect your beans kill everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kill one animal per arrow.</v>

464
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.660
<v Speaker 2>In order to grow Tofu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to kill every ground.</v>

465
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Squirrel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every role,</v>

466
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.600
<v Speaker 2>every shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every snake,</v>

467
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.400
<v Speaker 2>every turtle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every frog,</v>

468
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.440
<v Speaker 2>every bird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every rabbit,</v>

469
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.740
<v Speaker 2>anything that gets in that bean field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm either going to plow and dismember,</v>

470
00:23:45.741 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>which is</v>

471
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.820
<v Speaker 3>why the corrosion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seagulls follow the,</v>

472
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.900
<v Speaker 3>the combines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It combines every year,</v>

473
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 3>and then if anything does survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first slaughter,</v>

474
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to come in with man's Santa</v>
<v Speaker 3>when poisoned the shit out of everything</v>

475
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.670
<v Speaker 3>so you can have a tofu salad and not be</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for any death.</v>

476
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good point and it has to</v>

477
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of people ignore and avoid</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's.</v>

478
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:12.410
<v Speaker 3>It's uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't life full of uncomfort and thing</v>

479
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:15.110
<v Speaker 3>and you shouldn't be uncomfortable to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill.</v>

480
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:20.111
<v Speaker 3>Game to feed mankind is perfect to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>cows and pigs to feed mankind.</v>

481
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.990
<v Speaker 3>It's the system is often less than</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect,</v>

482
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 3>but until someone comes up with a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

483
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:34.690
<v Speaker 3>I salute and genuflect at the altar of</v>
<v Speaker 3>farmers and ranchers and people who kill</v>

484
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:39.560
<v Speaker 3>animals to sustain my fellow man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

485
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.400
<v Speaker 3>I think you and I would probably both</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with factory farming when you</v>

486
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:46.370
<v Speaker 3>see animals stuffed into pitches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have come up with a better</v>

487
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:46.790
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

488
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 3>I killed a lot of deer and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feed more people than any.</v>

489
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Any hunter ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I killed so many much game of years.</v>

490
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 3>I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to hire sharp shooters.</v>

491
00:24:56.481 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I killed the animals on my beautiful</v>

492
00:24:59.091 --> 00:25:02.390
<v Speaker 3>swamp and Michigan and my Texas property</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have to die.</v>

493
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.440
<v Speaker 3>They have to get out of there to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>room for the next year's funds,</v>

494
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.910
<v Speaker 3>so I've soup kitchens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homeless.</v>

495
00:25:07.911 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally give tons and I'm a</v>

496
00:25:11.151 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 3>sweetheart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not an idiot.</v>

497
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I keep the backstraps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I give tons of venison to soup</v>

498
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:18.680
<v Speaker 3>kitchens and homeless shelters and</v>
<v Speaker 3>veterans.</v>

499
00:25:18.681 --> 00:25:21.680
<v Speaker 3>We make jerky and send it over to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>troops overseas.</v>

500
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have to adjust my halo or just</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get in the room.</v>

501
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:29.830
<v Speaker 3>So what I do is literally perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the problem is what you do.</v>

502
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can do like everybody's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have.</v>

503
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.280
<v Speaker 3>You're kind of warn people could though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More people could.</v>

504
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you would definitely.</v>

505
00:25:37.431 --> 00:25:41.780
<v Speaker 3>I know the hunters for the hungry</v>
<v Speaker 3>distributed a ton of $250.</v>

506
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred $50 million Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred and $50 million meals every</v>

507
00:25:46.851 --> 00:25:49.040
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A venison in.</v>

508
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:52.400
<v Speaker 3>There are people that would ban that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shame on you?</v>

509
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

510
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:58.520
<v Speaker 3>I just think there's a lot of films and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of documentaries that portray</v>

511
00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:02.390
<v Speaker 3>veganism is being this perfect way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>living that doesn't have any death or</v>

512
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.400
<v Speaker 3>any habitat loss associated with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they look at the extreme of</v>

513
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:09.530
<v Speaker 3>mediating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the worst aspects of it.</v>

514
00:26:09.531 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Factory farming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of these disgusting pig farms,</v>

515
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.600
<v Speaker 3>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusting,</v>

516
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.770
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrifying.</v>

517
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:20.060
<v Speaker 3>The upgrade goes on because more alarms</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been sounded not by paid and not by</v>

518
00:26:20.061 --> 00:26:24.170
<v Speaker 3>the humane society of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just scam artist by people who</v>

519
00:26:24.171 --> 00:26:29.171
<v Speaker 3>are coming to realize that we do not</v>
<v Speaker 3>only have a responsibility to kill</v>

520
00:26:29.931 --> 00:26:31.760
<v Speaker 3>critters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to feed mankind,</v>

521
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.230
<v Speaker 3>but it can be done in an environmentally</v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial way.</v>

522
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watch my great late friend</v>

523
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bourdain on his shows and Andrew</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zimmern on the travel channel,</v>

524
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:48.230
<v Speaker 3>you watch their shows and the emphasis</v>
<v Speaker 3>on environmentally friendly</v>

525
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 3>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More and more organic farming.</v>

526
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.450
<v Speaker 3>More and more conscientious waste</v>
<v Speaker 3>dispersal,</v>

527
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:55.550
<v Speaker 3>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

528
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 3>pig guts and a read we utilize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are in Las Vegas.</v>

529
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 3>They get all this wasted food and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>feed the pigs so it's good food going</v>

530
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:03.900
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The port tastes better,</v>

531
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:09.050
<v Speaker 3>so there is upgrade taking place and</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the ultimate inescapable fact of</v>

532
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.480
<v Speaker 3>upgrade environmentalist</v>
<v Speaker 3>environmentalism.</v>

533
00:27:10.481 --> 00:27:15.481
<v Speaker 3>When I was grown up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Lake Erie would catch fire because</v>

534
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:18.240
<v Speaker 3>of the pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't.</v>

535
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Environmentalist are greenies that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounded the alarm.</v>

536
00:27:21.031 --> 00:27:24.120
<v Speaker 3>It was the duck hunters that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're polluting this area so bad.</v>

537
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:26.550
<v Speaker 3>There's no ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no wild salary.</v>

538
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.710
<v Speaker 3>There's no wall eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no fish,</v>

539
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 3>there's no muskrats for the trappers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hunters,</v>

540
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 3>fishermen and trappers have sounded the</v>
<v Speaker 3>alarm more often than not,</v>

541
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 3>about environmental irresponsibility and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now lake Erie,</v>

542
00:27:39.031 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 3>they would spontaneously combust when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was growing up,</v>

543
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.240
<v Speaker 3>is now the number one walleye and small</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth bass fishery in the world and it's</v>

544
00:27:47.581 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Speaker 3>still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're still producing and still got the</v>

545
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.240
<v Speaker 3>industrial revolution going on there.</v>

546
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.720
<v Speaker 3>But conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher responsible level of awareness is</v>

547
00:27:58.321 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 3>spreading like wildfire across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

548
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:05.570
<v Speaker 3>And I believe that there's no mutual</v>
<v Speaker 3>exclusivity whatsoever to productivity</v>

549
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 3>and environmental responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that they both benefit each</v>

550
00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:10.470
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've got so many,</v>

551
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unlimited examples where that worked</v>

552
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.740
<v Speaker 3>from farms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It mean people who live downwind of a</v>

553
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:20.850
<v Speaker 3>pink pig farmers are going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest squawker is rightly so.</v>

554
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

555
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.990
<v Speaker 3>and so I see a lot of upgrade going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more organic,</v>

556
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.970
<v Speaker 3>more conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less waste.</v>

557
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

558
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.460
<v Speaker 3>it's not as a regular operating</v>
<v Speaker 3>procedures.</v>

559
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:33.870
<v Speaker 3>That should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I see upgrade.</v>

560
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

561
00:28:35.041 --> 00:28:38.670
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thought process behind all these</v>

562
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:41.820
<v Speaker 3>people that are upset about factory</v>
<v Speaker 3>farming people even that go Vegan,</v>

563
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.240
<v Speaker 3>the thought process behind it is in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right place.</v>

564
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.570
<v Speaker 3>I just think there's a lot of misguided</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy there because they don't really</v>

565
00:28:48.571 --> 00:28:50.430
<v Speaker 3>understand where the food is coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

566
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.030
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand large scale</v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture that understand when you.</v>

567
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:58.930
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of large scale agriculture is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to grow food to feed animals that</v>

568
00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.800
<v Speaker 3>essential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

569
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also wheat and is also a lot of</v>

570
00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:06.690
<v Speaker 3>grain that people consume and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>displaces thousands and thousands of</v>

571
00:29:06.691 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 3>acres of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the process is not a clean process.</v>

572
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:14.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not clean in terms of there's no</v>
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>

573
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.950
<v Speaker 3>there's no harm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cruelty free.</v>

574
00:29:16.951 --> 00:29:21.951
<v Speaker 3>This crazy as if you can possibly go</v>
<v Speaker 3>through a day without having blood on</v>

575
00:29:22.771 --> 00:29:24.990
<v Speaker 3>your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you drive on the highways?</v>

576
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.960
<v Speaker 3>Does any of your sustenance come on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>highways?</v>

577
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Because billions of animals are</v>
<v Speaker 3>slaughtered on the highways every day</v>

578
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:38.330
<v Speaker 3>and if you are on planet earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of that blood is on your hands.</v>

579
00:29:38.331 --> 00:29:40.560
<v Speaker 3>You got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who doesn't know this?</v>

580
00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to admit this,</v>

581
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.740
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see an upgrade in level of awareness</v>

582
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:49.000
<v Speaker 3>and responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the charge began in the hunting,</v>

583
00:29:49.001 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 3>fishing and trapping community because</v>
<v Speaker 3>where does,</v>

584
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:52.900
<v Speaker 3>where does quality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>air,</v>

585
00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 3>soil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and water come from?</v>

586
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 3>I'll go ahead and answer that wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 3>habitat out of the people that are out</v>

587
00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:01.540
<v Speaker 3>there every day to recognize it in more</v>
<v Speaker 3>and more.</v>

588
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:02.381
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to,</v>

589
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:05.500
<v Speaker 3>I still get death threats because I am</v>
<v Speaker 3>murder innocent animals,</v>

590
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.920
<v Speaker 3>but now I get those too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the hell?</v>

591
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 3>So it's just so absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think their heart like right</v>

592
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.010
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just don't know what they're</v>

593
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:16.540
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just haters.</v>

594
00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.900
<v Speaker 3>They're just a bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 2018,</v>

595
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:25.260
<v Speaker 3>do you not acknowledged barbecue?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How in 2018 do you not acknowledge</v>

596
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 3>there's a few dead Turkeys on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanksgiving?</v>

597
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.850
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean you going to be brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead?</v>

598
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 3>I think they're so consumed with hate</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they fight.</v>

599
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.790
<v Speaker 3>Ignorance is acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a grownup.</v>

600
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.560
<v Speaker 3>When I go to the indy 500,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't turn a cogsworth.</v>

601
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm ignorant about cogsworth.</v>

602
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:45.130
<v Speaker 3>Ignorance is acceptable because you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>remedy it with knowledge and research.</v>

603
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 3>Stupidity is when you guard your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ignorance,</v>

604
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:54.060
<v Speaker 3>if you think that were murdering</v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent animals to feed our families</v>

605
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 3>with the purest protein available to</v>
<v Speaker 3>mankind.</v>

606
00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Balancing the herds with more deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more elk,</v>

607
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:01.210
<v Speaker 3>more bison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more turkeys,</v>

608
00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:03.580
<v Speaker 3>more waterfowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more cougars,</v>

609
00:31:03.581 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 3>more bears than ever in recorded history</v>
<v Speaker 3>except for the bison,</v>

610
00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:09.880
<v Speaker 3>but we're way back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have as many bisons we can sustain in</v>

611
00:31:09.881 --> 00:31:12.730
<v Speaker 3>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the native American tribes are</v>

612
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.750
<v Speaker 3>desperate to get more harvested in an</v>
<v Speaker 3>efficient and responsible manner.</v>

613
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:21.900
<v Speaker 3>So wildlife is thriving because hunters</v>
<v Speaker 3>implemented regulations for sustained</v>

614
00:31:22.871 --> 00:31:24.760
<v Speaker 3>yield.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many ducks can we kill?</v>

615
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 3>How many will they reproduce?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's their habitat determines their</v>

616
00:31:28.721 --> 00:31:31.810
<v Speaker 3>reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We must safeguard that Delta waterfowl,</v>

617
00:31:31.811 --> 00:31:33.130
<v Speaker 3>ducks unlimited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see,</v>

618
00:31:33.131 --> 00:31:36.220
<v Speaker 3>this information is universally</v>
<v Speaker 3>available,</v>

619
00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.620
<v Speaker 3>but the fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>academia,</v>

620
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and half of our government is stone</v>

621
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.060
<v Speaker 3>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with political correctness and</v>

622
00:31:46.061 --> 00:31:47.120
<v Speaker 3>denial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

623
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.680
<v Speaker 3>so I do what I do and our spirit of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild showed been number one.</v>

624
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.710
<v Speaker 3>An outer challenges is 29 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

625
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:56.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting old because we say it like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

626
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 3>We don't play around fun sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meet trophy,</v>

627
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.710
<v Speaker 3>sacred beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prayer for the wild things.</v>

628
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Resource Stewardship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation wise,</v>

629
00:32:04.121 --> 00:32:06.160
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walk the wild ground.</v>

630
00:32:06.161 --> 00:32:09.290
<v Speaker 3>Before you comment on the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grown the.</v>

631
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.550
<v Speaker 3>Well this is what I'm talking about when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about that last Indian,</v>

632
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.930
<v Speaker 3>but they found the guy who started river</v>
<v Speaker 3>study issue.</v>

633
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.580
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will write it down.</v>

634
00:32:18.581 --> 00:32:20.790
<v Speaker 3>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you suppose I s h I.</v>

635
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.470
<v Speaker 3>You have to learn this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to send you a bunch of stuff.</v>

636
00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:25.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get your contacts and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to send you stuff.</v>

637
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:31.110
<v Speaker 3>It will expand your horizons like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know was available.</v>

638
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The history of modern bowhunting at the</v>

639
00:32:35.321 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 3>hands of Fred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bear and and Saxton Pope and young and</v>

640
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 2>the families that wanted to get closer</v>
<v Speaker 2>to game,</v>

641
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily kill because 90 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the time you don't kill squat with a</v>

642
00:32:46.491 --> 00:32:48.200
<v Speaker 2>bone Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you do,</v>

643
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:52.880
<v Speaker 2>it's because you dedicate yourself to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher reasoning level,</v>

644
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Predator awareness and you put your</v>
<v Speaker 2>gifts from God to the maximum efficiency</v>

645
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.150
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's welding and carpentry,</v>

646
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.740
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately you're going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

647
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:09.070
<v Speaker 2>You better kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean and being human and failing</v>

648
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:14.950
<v Speaker 2>overall to be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be perfect and put that Arrow</v>

649
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:19.100
<v Speaker 2>when you learned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read the wild signals,</v>

650
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:19.471
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

651
00:33:19.471 --> 00:33:20.960
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attitude,</v>

652
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 2>and the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bird indicators.</v>

653
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:26.150
<v Speaker 2>When the deals come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you use the light,</v>

654
00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:27.740
<v Speaker 2>the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the camel,</v>

655
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.570
<v Speaker 2>stealthy movements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>silence and learned time that shot.</v>

656
00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:38.170
<v Speaker 2>My average deer dies in five seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the top of the heart taken off.</v>

657
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Both lungs are penetrated at deer falls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asleep on his feet and there's never</v>

658
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:47.270
<v Speaker 2>been a beef steak ever had it.</v>

659
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.490
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The also,</v>

660
00:33:49.491 --> 00:33:54.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a connection to what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that's different than almost any</v>

661
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:55.730
<v Speaker 2>other connection to food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

662
00:33:55.731 --> 00:33:58.940
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that's reasonably close</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's pretty far off is when you grow</v>

663
00:33:58.941 --> 00:34:01.070
<v Speaker 2>it yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you grow your own vegetables,</v>

664
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.310
<v Speaker 2>you get a connection to that food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but absolutely it's not the same</v>

665
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:05.480
<v Speaker 2>connection as you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

666
00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 2>because you're just going to send an</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow through an animal.</v>

667
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.100
<v Speaker 2>You look in his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look in that size,</v>

668
00:34:10.101 --> 00:34:12.380
<v Speaker 2>but also the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how difficult it is and when</v>

669
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:14.750
<v Speaker 2>you pull it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this powerful connection between</v>

670
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:18.260
<v Speaker 2>you and that animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You earn and you earn burn and when you</v>

671
00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:20.000
<v Speaker 2>eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel that you earned it.</v>

672
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you way out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Anthony Bourdain came to my place,</v>

673
00:34:23.901 --> 00:34:26.030
<v Speaker 2>he was still a little squeamish with</v>
<v Speaker 2>killer stuff.</v>

674
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Even though he ate dead stuff on every</v>
<v Speaker 2>show and got his paycheck for me.</v>

675
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Dead stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hunted with him.</v>

676
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did Ya know it was greg manning.</v>

677
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.220
<v Speaker 2>It was a great man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible loss,</v>

678
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.920
<v Speaker 2>terrible loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we talked about it and I,</v>

679
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.890
<v Speaker 2>I shared my knowledge with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

680
00:34:42.891 --> 00:34:45.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't have an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an animal.</v>

681
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:49.790
<v Speaker 2>It's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You either revered or you don't utilize</v>

682
00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:53.630
<v Speaker 2>it with respect or you pretend you</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have anything to do with it.</v>

683
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.460
<v Speaker 2>It's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're eating it.</v>

684
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:59.840
<v Speaker 2>You should have been closer to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and the hunters,</v>

685
00:34:59.841 --> 00:35:04.580
<v Speaker 2>fishermen and trappers in this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>still carry on the definitive physics of</v>

686
00:35:04.581 --> 00:35:08.720
<v Speaker 2>spirituality that the native and</v>
<v Speaker 2>aboriginal peoples called the great</v>

687
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.280
<v Speaker 2>spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence the spirit of the wild.</v>

688
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.690
<v Speaker 2>The prayer for the wild things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a weird place,</v>

689
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.210
<v Speaker 2>ted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with cities,</v>

690
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

691
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.250
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were.</v>

692
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you got lucky and that your</v>

693
00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 2>father was interested in bowhunting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it gave him an escape,</v>

694
00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:29.600
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives a lot of veterans today.</v>

695
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:33.930
<v Speaker 2>A lot of veterans and good friends of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine have finding the Lt great relief in</v>

696
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.220
<v Speaker 2>bow hunting as a discipline after</v>
<v Speaker 2>combat.</v>

697
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to a guy that's shared mini camp</v>

698
00:35:39.881 --> 00:35:42.090
<v Speaker 2>fires with those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a rare last night.</v>

699
00:35:42.091 --> 00:35:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Great transition for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's consuming.</v>

700
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Fred bear uses the phrase coined the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phrase,</v>

701
00:35:48.301 --> 00:35:53.301
<v Speaker 2>and I use it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cleanses the soul when you leave the</v>

702
00:35:54.271 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 2>pavement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I leave the pavement and I make</v>

703
00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:01.320
<v Speaker 2>that transition from modern concrete</v>
<v Speaker 2>jungle,</v>

704
00:36:01.321 --> 00:36:05.700
<v Speaker 2>hand to hand combat city guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's where my rock and roll</v>

705
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:10.020
<v Speaker 2>career is the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you take that deep breath.</v>

706
00:36:10.021 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 2>You literally go back to the year one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a high we nearby and I</v>

707
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:17.380
<v Speaker 2>know I can hear trucks off in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>distance and the train whistle,</v>

708
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:22.320
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of titillated unto itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I get in my swamp and Michigan</v>

709
00:36:22.321 --> 00:36:24.120
<v Speaker 2>or my woodland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas</v>

710
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.830
<v Speaker 2>to quote Jimi Hendrix and no live</v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere,</v>

711
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.010
<v Speaker 2>I am the aborigine.</v>

712
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:37.700
<v Speaker 2>It's me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my resources and the beast and it's a.</v>

713
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a religious experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the spirit of that natives called</v>

714
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:46.320
<v Speaker 2>it the great spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thethe considered the buffalo.</v>

715
00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:51.321
<v Speaker 2>They're brother and it is so consuming</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I don't care what kind of stress</v>

716
00:36:51.551 --> 00:36:54.450
<v Speaker 2>you could be going through the ugliest</v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce in the world and I have.</v>

717
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 2>You could be fighting against people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think that America should be first</v>

718
00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:03.720
<v Speaker 2>and you don't need secure borders and</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't need to earn your own way.</v>

719
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:06.150
<v Speaker 2>You're able bodied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want somebody else's income.</v>

720
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.290
<v Speaker 2>It just crazy shit and all of a sudden I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out there and I'm telling you,</v>

721
00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:15.291
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's perfect and I'm,</v>

722
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally intoxicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

723
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stoned trying to pick up all the</v>

724
00:37:23.821 --> 00:37:26.280
<v Speaker 2>signals and I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do a pretty good job.</v>

725
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I've learned over the years because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>need that so much to play my music like</v>

726
00:37:30.871 --> 00:37:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I play it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it cleanses my soul and I've been</v>

727
00:37:35.131 --> 00:37:40.050
<v Speaker 2>contacted since the sixties with vets</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have gone through just absolute</v>

728
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:46.130
<v Speaker 2>torture in their military careers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I get them at a campfire and we go</v>

729
00:37:47.311 --> 00:37:52.311
<v Speaker 2>out and sit before the sun comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you how many times they've</v>

730
00:37:53.101 --> 00:37:55.230
<v Speaker 2>cried because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

731
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a great morning.</v>

732
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.040
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgot all about that bullshit when I</v>

733
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:04.680
<v Speaker 2>thought I heard the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when I saw the deer,</v>

734
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:09.570
<v Speaker 2>it was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've expressed that and I thank you</v>

735
00:38:09.571 --> 00:38:13.050
<v Speaker 2>for that because you're new to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport and uh,</v>

736
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.960
<v Speaker 2>for you to be an advocate and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate,</v>

737
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.300
<v Speaker 2>you learn because you're already a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mature man.</v>

738
00:38:18.301 --> 00:38:21.210
<v Speaker 2>When you entered it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a dirtball mushy brain kid,</v>

739
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.030
<v Speaker 2>but thank God I learned about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit.</v>

740
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I learned about the discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned about stewardship,</v>

741
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:31.530
<v Speaker 2>callings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and responsibility course pounded by my</v>

742
00:38:31.531 --> 00:38:32.390
<v Speaker 2>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless him.</v>

743
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm in my brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sister.</v>

744
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:35.763
<v Speaker 2>We all</v>

745
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.870
<v Speaker 1>are happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

746
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.800
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardworking,</v>

747
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocky,</v>

748
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 1>loving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving people because of that discipline</v>

749
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:49.380
<v Speaker 1>that revolved around my family hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>seasons or discipline is one of the big</v>

750
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 1>word that that was one of the really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important aspects of it because I</v>

751
00:38:53.381 --> 00:38:56.770
<v Speaker 1>recognize the importance of discipline</v>
<v Speaker 1>and always have pretty much my whole</v>

752
00:38:56.771 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A as a martial artist especially.</v>

755
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.930
<v Speaker 1>You were ahead of the curve yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I recognized it,</v>

756
00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

757
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a different thing.</v>

758
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:09.940
<v Speaker 1>This is not what everybody thinks it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a,</v>

759
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:14.320
<v Speaker 1>this is a spiritual experience because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were around the masters.</v>

760

<v Speaker 1>irresponsibly and dishonestly promoted</v>

766
00:39:33.821 --> 00:39:36.670
<v Speaker 1>aspect of the drunk and hill billy</v>
<v Speaker 1>science shooter hunter.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

768
00:39:37.451 --> 00:39:39.970
<v Speaker 1>that stereotype is so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

769
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:44.700
<v Speaker 1>my friends like guys like Cameron Hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a Goddamn ultra marathon runner and</v>

<v Speaker 1>board,</v>

774
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.300
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an incredibly disciplined.</v>

775
00:39:58.301 --> 00:40:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is his life.</v>

777
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:06.340
<v Speaker 1>he does all the working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so he can be at his best in the</v>

778
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:10.760
<v Speaker 1>mountains as a bowhunter that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>considers his true spiritual call and I</v>

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling</v>

808
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.023
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

809
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.240
<v Speaker 3>but anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys that you've hunted with,</v>

810
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.380
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about great human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men of integrity and discipline and</v>

811
00:41:46.251 --> 00:41:51.251
<v Speaker 3>productivity and a drive to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>asset column misunderstood because of</v>

812
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:53.340
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very rarely I.</v>

813
00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:57.010
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was about to say I shared campfires</v>

814
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:01.460
<v Speaker 3>with lots of newcomers because they see</v>
<v Speaker 3>it as rock and roll guy that they loved</v>

815
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:05.030
<v Speaker 3>the music and we share the appreciation</v>
<v Speaker 3>for my American rhythm and blues rock</v>

816
00:42:05.031 --> 00:42:08.690
<v Speaker 3>and roll Jihad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they want to try hunting and they</v>

817
00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:12.800
<v Speaker 3>come to my hunt with me or they make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>donation for a military or children's</v>

818
00:42:12.801 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 3>charity and they've never hunted and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell them what to buy and they show up</v>

819
00:42:16.131 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 3>and it's natty bumppo man who natty</v>
<v Speaker 3>bumppo.</v>

820
00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.320
<v Speaker 3>No need to get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

821
00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.660
<v Speaker 3>I'll write that down too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I'm going to sell.</v>

822
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:27.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to send it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>James Fenimore Cooper.</v>

823
00:42:27.651 --> 00:42:30.120
<v Speaker 3>He was a character in his last of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mohicans.</v>

824
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.330
<v Speaker 3>It's a new hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>natty Bumppo,</v>

825
00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 3>like a novice of rookie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyhow,</v>

826
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I get a lot of these people and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

827
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.880
<v Speaker 3>I've never met anybody at any of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>campfires that wasn't honest,</v>

828
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:50.330
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't successful to some degree,</v>

829
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a teacher on a teacher</v>
<v Speaker 3>salary,</v>

830
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.220
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are teacher that's successful</v>

831
00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 3>who care deeply about the wildlife and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wild grounds.</v>

832
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.930
<v Speaker 3>So when you hear about wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that drunk and bombs,</v>

833
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.380
<v Speaker 3>just shooting everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

834
00:43:06.381 --> 00:43:08.480
<v Speaker 3>nobody has spent more time with more</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters than I have.</v>

835
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that even</v>
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>

836
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.830
<v Speaker 3>It exists sort of priests that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But fuck kids,</v>

837
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:17.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the priesthood,</v>

838
00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:19.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>

839
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:22.130
<v Speaker 3>There's always going to be Aberman dip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

840
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:25.160
<v Speaker 3>demonic behavior by our fellow man</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere somehow.</v>

841
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:29.920
<v Speaker 3>But it is so rare in the hunting world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I,</v>

842
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.823
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

843
00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:31.971
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all.</v>

844
00:43:31.971 --> 00:43:34.730
<v Speaker 3>I do seven months a year as hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

845
00:43:34.731 --> 00:43:37.070
<v Speaker 3>I haven't hunted as much as you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've been around a lot of great</v>

846
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:38.150
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great people.</v>

847
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it goes right back to fred</v>

848
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:42.470
<v Speaker 3>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the start off of our dialogue</v>

849
00:43:42.471 --> 00:43:43.880
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great man.</v>

850
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:48.850
<v Speaker 3>We hunted until 1987 together in October</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was on oxygen.</v>

851
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Then he passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard the song?</v>

852
00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Song.</v>

853
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 3>And then that song happened with a life</v>
<v Speaker 3>of its own because of my love and</v>

854
00:43:56.811 --> 00:44:00.260
<v Speaker 3>admiration for the man and what he</v>
<v Speaker 3>represented,</v>

855
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.500
<v Speaker 3>someone like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just carries that torch further</v>

856
00:44:03.501 --> 00:44:07.370
<v Speaker 3>than everyone that at times we were so</v>
<v Speaker 3>important at time where there was no</v>

857
00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:10.730
<v Speaker 3>indication that you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The animal rights thing hadn't really</v>

858
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:12.240
<v Speaker 3>started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

859
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:14.120
<v Speaker 3>meaningfully yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

860
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 3>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which wasn't even coined.</v>

861
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:20.660
<v Speaker 3>There was no fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was the beginning of the attack on</v>

862
00:44:20.661 --> 00:44:22.920
<v Speaker 3>hunting from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

863
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.470
<v Speaker 3>ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>citified,</v>

864
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:28.490
<v Speaker 3>people that somehow believed that their</v>
<v Speaker 3>food didn't die or they're not</v>

865
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 3>responsible for any death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they would play the holier</v>

866
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:37.130
<v Speaker 1>than now dishonesty move by attacking</v>
<v Speaker 1>those of us that actually took part in</v>

867
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:42.471
<v Speaker 1>the process of feeding our families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Fred was such a gentleman and he was</v>

868
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:47.601
<v Speaker 1>so clever and he so efficiently promoted</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenge and the intimacy of man</v>

869
00:44:49.861 --> 00:44:54.630
<v Speaker 1>and wild connection that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will live in infamy.</v>

870
00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the hunting world knows</v>

871
00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:01.350
<v Speaker 1>that he was a force to reckon with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always there and as the song says</v>

872
00:45:01.351 --> 00:45:05.290
<v Speaker 1>in the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he still alive and it's powerful that a</v>

873
00:45:05.291 --> 00:45:07.350
<v Speaker 1>lot of people know of him because of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>

874
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot people.</v>

875
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.180
<v Speaker 1>More people have learned about Fred from</v>
<v Speaker 1>me than from the archery industry.</v>

876
00:45:11.181 --> 00:45:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

877
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.490
<v Speaker 1>do you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this conversation you've been having</v>

878
00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:16.410
<v Speaker 1>this conversation about hunting forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

879
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I've heard a lot of these things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying today before from you.</v>

880
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Does this the ever get tired of seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this evangelist?</v>

881
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.983
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

882
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I love it so much and the other side is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so dishonest that I know I make inroads.</v>

883
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Yoda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my facebook,</v>

884
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you think they're ignorant.</v>

885
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:37.230
<v Speaker 1>They know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that there's going to be new</v>

886
00:45:37.231 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 1>funds next year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not gonna be any new ground.</v>

887
00:45:39.601 --> 00:45:42.750
<v Speaker 1>They know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that venison is good food,</v>

888
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:47.430
<v Speaker 1>but they don't think of it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I continue to do this because</v>

889
00:45:47.431 --> 00:45:52.431
<v Speaker 1>I caused them to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you thousands of examples</v>

890
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:58.100
<v Speaker 1>since the sixties where people thought I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a coward for murdering innocent</v>

891
00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:00.230
<v Speaker 1>animals that can't shoot back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

892
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.980
<v Speaker 1>what does that sentence even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it mean to catch you back and left</v>

893
00:46:04.981 --> 00:46:09.620
<v Speaker 1>trigger fingers yet jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have taken this on and you notice</v>

894
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smiled throughout that whole thing.</v>

895
00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so.</v>

896
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:17.790
<v Speaker 1>I know that by continuing to promote in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absence of any education and our</v>

897
00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:18.980
<v Speaker 1>education system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

898
00:46:18.981 --> 00:46:21.780
<v Speaker 1>it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animal rights gets more time in our</v>

899
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 1>education system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our anti-education is the media lion,</v>

900
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.900
<v Speaker 1>sons of bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood goofy,</v>

901
00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:33.690
<v Speaker 1>half of the government out to lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you guys like you and me that know</v>

902
00:46:33.811 --> 00:46:36.630
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should never give up because there is</v>

903
00:46:36.631 --> 00:46:39.210
<v Speaker 1>a scourge of political correctness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dishonesty,</v>

904
00:46:39.211 --> 00:46:40.790
<v Speaker 1>and that's what political correctness</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

905
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Denial and dishonesty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know we're making inroads.</v>

906
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:48.240
<v Speaker 1>You should see the bombardment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got Joseph big hunter now.</v>

907
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:50.670
<v Speaker 1>He's really a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He speak cleverly,</v>

908
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.280
<v Speaker 1>speaks accurately and and passionately</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

909
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Hallelujah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of us out there with the</v>

910
00:46:56.131 --> 00:46:58.250
<v Speaker 1>advent of the outdoor channel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sportsmans channel,</v>

911
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:59.770
<v Speaker 1>the pursuit network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

912
00:46:59.771 --> 00:47:02.000
<v Speaker 1>more and more people are getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

913
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.680
<v Speaker 1>wind of what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it from the Internet to</v>

914
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:07.960
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monster communication people,</v>

915
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I think people understand that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>more to it than they thought.</v>

916
00:47:10.801 --> 00:47:13.380
<v Speaker 1>And if they're willing to just look a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit further,</v>

917
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.300
<v Speaker 1>look a little bit further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized like,</v>

918
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:16.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially western hunting.</v>

919
00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are running hills and</v>

920
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.190
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

921
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:23.700
<v Speaker 1>they're backpacking with heavy weights</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their back discipline for hours and</v>

922
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.400
<v Speaker 1>hours everyday just to build up their</v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance and they can hike out with,</v>

923
00:47:26.401 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 1>meet these western hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man that are going.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

925
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 2>bow hunting elk and then packing them</v>
<v Speaker 2>out by themselves over the course of</v>

926
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 2>five days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Credible job.</v>

927
00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I went to Alaska first time when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 something,</v>

928
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:43.390
<v Speaker 2>I guess I must've been 28,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first Alaska trip 77 and I was out</v>

929
00:47:43.391 --> 00:47:45.220
<v Speaker 2>there for two weeks in a soggy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wet,</v>

930
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:49.020
<v Speaker 2>nasty cold tent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little pup tent with George Fairbury</v>

931
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:52.990
<v Speaker 2>and I got a giant Caribou,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great black bear in a big old moose</v>

932
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:57.700
<v Speaker 2>and boy humping them quarters in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Tundra,</v>

933
00:47:58.210 --> 00:47:58.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

934
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was a superman athletic</v>
<v Speaker 2>amplifier,</v>

935
00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:02.740
<v Speaker 2>jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rock and roll.</v>

936
00:48:02.741 --> 00:48:05.500
<v Speaker 2>So new muscle boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ass kicked,</v>

937
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:09.170
<v Speaker 2>carrying a moose shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>$100 a quarter.</v>

938
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Just one big moose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see one in real life.</v>

939
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:14.290
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to believe that that's a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

940
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.360
<v Speaker 2>And that goes back to what you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying earlier,</v>

941
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:21.540
<v Speaker 2>that when you dine on that and you put</v>
<v Speaker 2>that effort forth and you spent all</v>

942
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 2>those days skunked and wet and cold and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty,</v>

943
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:28.570
<v Speaker 2>enjoying it for what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was also a pain in the ass.</v>

944
00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:30.910
<v Speaker 2>You can't get wait to get back to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>place with a wood burner,</v>

945
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 2>but when you've packed it out yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you take that sacred flesh off that</v>

946
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:39.310
<v Speaker 2>grill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you even finished the first</v>

947
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 2>knife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slice all those memories and it just</v>

948
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.530
<v Speaker 2>tastes better and it really does taste</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

949
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:52.150
<v Speaker 2>but with that effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a spiritual moment that this</v>

950
00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.240
<v Speaker 2>linkedin native say you don't kill the</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

951
00:48:55.450 --> 00:49:00.160
<v Speaker 2>You accept the gift if you put your</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart and soul into your reasoning</v>

952
00:49:00.161 --> 00:49:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Predator ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's always been my mantra and my</v>

953
00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:08.230
<v Speaker 2>kids were all raised on Venison at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just don't buy meat.</v>

954
00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:11.890
<v Speaker 2>That's all we eat is the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kill a pheasants and quail and Doug's</v>

955
00:49:11.891 --> 00:49:15.520
<v Speaker 2>and woodcock and grouse and rabbits and</v>
<v Speaker 2>squirrels and ducks and geese and</v>

956
00:49:15.521 --> 00:49:20.521
<v Speaker 2>galloon mules and snipe and beavers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer and elk and antelope and bear and</v>

957
00:49:23.051 --> 00:49:23.884
<v Speaker 2>Cougar.</v>

958
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:28.270
<v Speaker 2>That's the greatest food in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 70 years old and I'm forced to</v>

959
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:33.271
<v Speaker 2>reckon with because of my discipline</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet of the ultimate rocket fuel</v>

960
00:49:33.551 --> 00:49:34.450
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unplanned.</v>

961
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.700
<v Speaker 2>You really do look good for 17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking fantastic.</v>

962
00:49:37.701 --> 00:49:39.700
<v Speaker 2>If I had some sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be downright handsome,</v>

963
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:43.300
<v Speaker 2>but you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the average person that's been</v>

964
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:46.140
<v Speaker 2>eating the average American diet for 70</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

965
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.610
<v Speaker 2>by the time they're your age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're deteriorating,</v>

966
00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 2>rapidly poisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fruit toast to the chemicals,</v>

967
00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:53.590
<v Speaker 2>the preservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

968
00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Here's if I may on the Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

969
00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.960

<v Speaker 2>Get rid of the goddamn sugar.</v>

970
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:05.020
<v Speaker 2>If you can't pronounce it on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>package,</v>

971
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:10.350
<v Speaker 2>do not buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do not feed your children high fruit</v>

972
00:50:11.621 --> 00:50:15.160
<v Speaker 2>toast poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>

<v Speaker 2>people get the poisons out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>blubbering lives.</v>

974
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Good food is so simple by what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catch a fish or buy</v>

975
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 3>a fish by some fresh or grow some fresh</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables.</v>

976
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Put real butter and use the real fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't take the skin off the chicken.</v>

977
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 3>That's where all the good fat is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where all the flavor is and eat</v>

978
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:42.980
<v Speaker 3>real food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

979
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.880
<v Speaker 3>We can't afford that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

980
00:50:43.881 --> 00:50:48.881
<v Speaker 3>You can't afford not to everything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>says diet on it or no sugar is poison</v>

981
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.380
<v Speaker 3>and it's not my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a chemical reality and when you,</v>

982
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 3>when you died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you attempt to digest fructose and</v>

983
00:50:58.071 --> 00:50:59.360
<v Speaker 3>preservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're body goes,</v>

984
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't recognize this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't process this,</v>

985
00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 3>and it turns into blubber and here's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little update.</v>

986
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Blubber is for sperm whales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not people.</v>

987
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:17.930
<v Speaker 3>If you have to lift up slabs to dry off</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the shower,</v>

988
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.910
<v Speaker 3>your diet sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw you in an interview once,</v>

989
00:51:22.911 --> 00:51:24.780
<v Speaker 3>a long time ago before I started</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching.</v>

990
00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I've done a bunch of them.</v>

991
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.100
<v Speaker 3>I know you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I saw you I was like,</v>

992
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 3>how's this guy have so much fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy?</v>

993
00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.240
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is so fired up,</v>

994
00:51:32.241 --> 00:51:34.540
<v Speaker 3>and then he started talking about your</v>
<v Speaker 3>diet started talking about.</v>

995
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.590
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all I eat is venison.</v>

996
00:51:36.591 --> 00:51:40.030
<v Speaker 3>You start going off about backstraps and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I started thinking like what?</v>

997
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:45.130
<v Speaker 3>Like think about the dark red meat of</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild game before you became 100.</v>

998
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.210
<v Speaker 3>Quite a few years before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I flirted with it for several years,</v>

999
00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.930
<v Speaker 3>he flirted with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have anybody to take get a swan</v>

1000
00:51:53.931 --> 00:51:57.440
<v Speaker 3>dive into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got lucky Steve to me with a mask on</v>

1001
00:51:57.441 --> 00:51:59.450
<v Speaker 3>his show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Steve doesn't like me,</v>

1002
00:51:59.451 --> 00:52:01.550
<v Speaker 3>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1003
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.910
<v Speaker 3>Why say he doesn't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard comments with is attacking me</v>

1004
00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:08.210

<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't be much better if I just</v>

1005
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:11.690
<v Speaker 3>butchered them and slaughtered them</v>
<v Speaker 3>because semantics is so important.</v>

1006
00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.350

1012
00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:28.580
<v Speaker 3>behavior or somehow detrimental to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>movement of acceptance?</v>

1013
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Stupid people do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the people who come and join the</v>

1017
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:42.530
<v Speaker 3>They're masters of their craft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have caused more young people to</v>

1018
00:52:42.531 --> 00:52:46.130
<v Speaker 3>become hunters than all other forces in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Bows and arrows don't kill something.</v>

1022
00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:00.590
<v Speaker 3>They absolutely come to it because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fund.</v>

1023
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:05.000
<v Speaker 3>Then they hear about the discipline and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear about the quality diet and they</v>

1024
00:53:05.001 --> 00:53:08.000
<v Speaker 3>hear about their spiritual trophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether antlers or not,</v>

1025
00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:13.540
<v Speaker 3>that has guided my passionate life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>manifest itself in these killer songs</v>

1026
00:53:15.021 --> 00:53:18.620
<v Speaker 3>and killer guitar licks and outrageous</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire-breathing concerts and they go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but found thousands and thousands of</v>

1031
00:53:29.251 --> 00:53:34.251
<v Speaker 1>young people that would be inclined to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be anti hunting or no gun Ho hunters</v>

1032
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:39.690

1035
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:44.250
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that they don't get.</v>

1036
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:47.400
<v Speaker 1>When they hear your enthusiasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they go,</v>

1037
00:53:47.401 --> 00:53:48.990
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I haven't had this perspective</v>

1038
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:50.910
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their perspective on hunting that I've</v>

1039
00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:53.850
<v Speaker 1>gotten before is that these are cruel</v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes that go out there and shoot</v>

1040
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:57.120
<v Speaker 1>animals and they don't care and or worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>or worse.</v>

1041
00:53:57.121 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that my critics,</v>

1042
00:53:58.591 --> 00:54:00.780
<v Speaker 1>and I won't mention any names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1043
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 1>when they're on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a hunting TV shows and they're</v>

1044
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:07.530
<v Speaker 1>so ultra cautious not to ruffle any</v>
<v Speaker 1>feathers.</v>

1045
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.910
<v Speaker 1>They kind of come off like Mr Rogers</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a Lawrence welk soundtrack.</v>

1046
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And young people think you're a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole if that's all you've got in a</v>

1047
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:18.450
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that boring?</v>

1048
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll just smoke some dope and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1049
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:22.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruzen tonight,</v>

1050
00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:25.140
<v Speaker 1>which I know you like to smoke dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1051
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:27.820
<v Speaker 1>and I'll call it dope and go nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you call it?</v>

1052
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a cop.</v>

1053
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

1054
00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got buddies for that.</v>

1055
00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that comfortably numb</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the way to go.</v>

1056
00:54:39.601 --> 00:54:41.490
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a solid song I ever.</v>

1057
00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know a better song on my new record.</v>

1058
00:54:44.311 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 1>It's called uncomfortably dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is,</v>

1059
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.900
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you a father?</v>

1060
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want your babysitter high?</v>

1061
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1062
00:54:52.441 --> 00:54:54.760
<v Speaker 1>How about your doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No pilot.</v>

1063
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my babysitter sleeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

1064
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't her what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping.</v>

1065
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I want them paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1066
00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't mean that you shouldn't</v>

1067
00:55:02.461 --> 00:55:04.350
<v Speaker 1>get high ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means you shouldn't get high</v>

1068
00:55:04.351 --> 00:55:07.080
<v Speaker 1>when you're watching kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

1069
00:55:07.081 --> 00:55:07.861
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Or when you're flying my plane or I play</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bass Guitar.</v>

1071
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:13.350
<v Speaker 1>The only compromise me doing anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicate.</v>

1072
00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:15.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only guy want high who?</v>

1073
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.660
<v Speaker 1>My comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1074
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 1>it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like steroids.</v>

1075
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I was there when Richard Pryor and Robin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Williams and Sam Kinison,</v>

1076
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:26.993
<v Speaker 1>God knows.</v>

1077
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and snort anything you got</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker because I need to laugh.</v>

1078
00:55:30.811 --> 00:55:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Delay Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to come out.</v>

1079
00:55:32.771 --> 00:55:36.390
<v Speaker 1>But that shit sober</v>
<v Speaker 1>every night.</v>

1080
00:55:36.391 --> 00:55:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm a funny son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta come see my show.</v>

1081
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I have so much fun on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

1082
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that perceptions about pot are</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar to the perceptions about.</v>

1083
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that abused pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they abused alcohol abuse.</v>

1084
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:48.420
<v Speaker 1>People will abuse every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1085
00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.400
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you can't use it</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibly.</v>

1086
00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:51.570
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1087
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:56.630
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately in my 60 years of pursuing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chuck Berry Soundtrack of Ultra</v>

1088
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:04.250
<v Speaker 1>James Brown type music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have never seen anything but</v>

1089
00:56:04.531 --> 00:56:07.620
<v Speaker 1>heartbreak from drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the drug use.</v>

1090
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Even in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a new council by the way of</v>

1091
00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.720
<v Speaker 1>working with President trump to legalize</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana nationwide.</v>

1092
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.230
<v Speaker 1>We don't want you to know that and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>all for that.</v>

1093
00:56:18.231 --> 00:56:18.990
<v Speaker 1>That was awesome.</v>

1094
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I deal with a lot of terminally ill kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing that's off limits.</v>

1095
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Take away that suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I need to fight for that.</v>

1096
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great for people with epilepsy as</v>

1097
00:56:27.521 --> 00:56:28.800

<v Speaker 1>tortured gassed on stage every night.</v>

1102
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:47.760

<v Speaker 1>they got to drink some of that shit.</v>

1103
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you've had some problems with</v>

<v Speaker 1>I never knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard the word meniscus still.</v>

1107
00:56:56.951 --> 00:57:00.070
<v Speaker 1>My doctor said I had none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a tear on mine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>severe undercard underdog.</v>

1155
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:16.450
<v Speaker 1>And he came out and the place went nuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he says it all to here,</v>

1158
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.470

<v Speaker 2>I've been smoking for so long.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The connection between rock and roll.</v>

1163
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Guitarist and bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For most people it's like a big stretch</v>

1164
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:42.050
<v Speaker 2>to stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what are those different</v>

1165
00:59:42.051 --> 00:59:43.700
<v Speaker 2>galaxies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different universities,</v>

1166
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:47.000
<v Speaker 2>except for the most important elements</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that is discipline.</v>

1167
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the focus to create an.</v>

1168
00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:55.520
<v Speaker 2>I've been so blessed beyond words to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the greatest musicians at my side</v>

1169
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:58.880

<v Speaker 2>And the Amboy dukes and even the Damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yankees with Tommy and Jack and Michael.</v>

1176
01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had literally the,</v>

1177

<v Speaker 2>a list of musicians at my side from</v>

1182
01:00:37.251 --> 01:00:38.810
<v Speaker 2>player in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a weird connection,</v>

1183
01:00:38.811 --> 01:00:40.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like most people don't think of rock and</v>

1184
01:00:40.911 --> 01:00:45.000
<v Speaker 2>roll and bow hunting at the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

1185

<v Speaker 2>You're the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there I was geographically in</v>

<v Speaker 2>the best musicians in the world.</v>

1188
01:00:53.991 --> 01:00:56.930
<v Speaker 2>They'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come out of Detroit from Motown,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that and then you see him on tv and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ed Sullivan show it.</v>

1204
01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't care who you are.</v>

<v Speaker 2>On Ed Sullivan and I had a guitar plus</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Michigan and I every kid was</v>

<v Speaker 2>little bone Arrow of some kind.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I live right next to the rouge river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was always down there,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the bowhunting music in the bowhunting.</v>

1215
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I met Fred Bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got these great musicians,</v>

1216
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:17.020
<v Speaker 2>the music and the bowhunting music and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book.</v>

1217
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a life,</v>

1218
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:25.170
<v Speaker 2>what a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a firestorm of cravings and</v>

1219
01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:28.350
<v Speaker 2>fulfillment of those cravings everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here it is.</v>

1220
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Last night mares my 6680th concert and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes all the way back to Stockholm.</v>

1221
01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:36.120
<v Speaker 2>All counter to all the way back to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 fifties,</v>

1222
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.520
<v Speaker 2>60,600.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You write them down now.</v>

1223
01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I did for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took out all the books and start</v>

1224
01:02:40.851 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>adding them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But from the,</v>

1225
01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:43.510
<v Speaker 2>from my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1226
01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.660
<v Speaker 2>a musical review with the Royal School</v>
<v Speaker 2>of music in 1958.</v>

1227
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.500
<v Speaker 2>And then with Joe [inaudible] from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Capital School of music at the Detroit</v>

1228
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:54.810
<v Speaker 2>fairgrounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we started playing sock hops</v>

1229
01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:57.390
<v Speaker 2>and pool parties and malt shops and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>

1230
01:02:57.391 --> 01:02:58.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basement parties.</v>

1231
01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I counted those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are gigs.</v>

1232
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:03.600
<v Speaker 2>And then when the amboy dukes started in</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 65,</v>

1233
01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.250
<v Speaker 2>we'd do 300 concerts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three plus 300 a year for many,</v>

1234
01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:10.110
<v Speaker 2>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then even with the Damn Yankees and</v>

1235
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:13.410
<v Speaker 2>the early nineties we did over 200</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerts a year.</v>

1236
01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:18.590
<v Speaker 2>So I added them all up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And last year was 6,679 in Okinawa for</v>

1237
01:03:19.231 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 2>the US Marine Corps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty intense.</v>

1238
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:25.470
<v Speaker 2>And then last night at the coach house</v>
<v Speaker 2>in San Juan Capistrano,</v>

1239
01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.800
<v Speaker 2>6,680 to 96,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six 81.</v>

1240
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1241
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I look tired.</v>

1242
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:36.210
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of things in remedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you have the time?</v>

1243
01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Because I always figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to figure out how I have the</v>

1244
01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:41.370
<v Speaker 2>time to do what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you do more than I do.</v>

1245
01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can both agree.</v>

1246
01:03:43.141 --> 01:03:47.130
<v Speaker 2>The greatest philosopher of all times</v>
<v Speaker 2>was dirty Harry when he said a good man</v>

1247
01:03:47.131 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 2>knows his limitations</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the [inaudible] with the Amboy</v>

1248
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Dukes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do over 300 concerts a year and I was</v>

1249
01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 2>still craving my hunting.</v>

1250
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:57.450
<v Speaker 2>So I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd carve out a weekend in October and a</v>

1251
01:03:57.451 --> 01:04:00.420
<v Speaker 2>weekend in November with my dad and we'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out there and hunt.</v>

1252
01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:03.780
<v Speaker 2>But that wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about practice time with the</v>

1253
01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:07.380
<v Speaker 2>archery?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ida Bone Arrow on the road block target.</v>

1254
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Met in a parking lot somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morel targets for morale and it's got a</v>

1255
01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 2>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1256
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I've shot my bow and Arrow on stage with</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of contracts and then I always</v>

1257
01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:21.690
<v Speaker 2>have it with me and I always have</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends that have bows and arrows.</v>

1258
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.920
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had brought it today because I</v>

1259
01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 2>could show you some this zen of mystical</v>
<v Speaker 2>flight of the Arab maneuvers.</v>

1260
01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.600
<v Speaker 2>They had a really lightweight bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only 50 pounds.</v>

1261
01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:35.240
<v Speaker 2>That new matthews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shoot the new triax manager.</v>

1262
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:38.200
<v Speaker 2>There's not a bad bill out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Anymore.</v>

1263
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.430
<v Speaker 2>The competition is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anybody listening to the most</v>

1264
01:04:41.431 --> 01:04:44.180
<v Speaker 2>important thing you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe and I love the mystical flight of</v>

1265
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:49.190
<v Speaker 2>the Arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go get you a bow and Arrow shop fire</v>

1266
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 2>hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find a bowl that fits you and make sure</v>

1267
01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:55.460
<v Speaker 2>it's graceful enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't struggle when you're starting to.</v>

1268
01:04:55.461 --> 01:04:56.820
<v Speaker 2>We've got to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mushy.</v>

1269
01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Archery is grace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not power and get that bow so it settles</v>

1270
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 2>back here for hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eye Coordination,</v>

1271
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.350
<v Speaker 2>and you don't have to struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People should start with a 25,</v>

1272
01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.440
<v Speaker 2>30 pound bow to get that archery thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

1273
01:05:10.441 --> 01:05:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Preferably an old recover long boy if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can and find out where you're</v>

1274
01:05:14.071 --> 01:05:16.560
<v Speaker 2>pointing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's that Arrow going and you will be</v>

1275
01:05:16.561 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 2>consumed with it</v>

1276
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.460
<v Speaker 1>and then work your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can really teach you if you have to</v>

1277
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:24.720
<v Speaker 1>have a mentor because if you do it wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start with a bad,</v>

1278
01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.610
<v Speaker 1>bad habits will plague you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you could target panic.</v>

1279
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

1280
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem with martial arts too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to start off with</v>

1281
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>a good instructor if you learn things</v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly first and then try to fix it,</v>

1282
01:05:36.191 --> 01:05:38.920
<v Speaker 1>but you're still kind of wired</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrectly.</v>

1283
01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult and archery as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1284
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why America is in trouble because</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are learning at schools.</v>

1285
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really learning the wrong stuff.</v>

1286
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is what's going on.</v>

1287
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get taught that life is boring,</v>

1288
01:05:53.711 --> 01:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>droning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention to the rules.</v>

1289
01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Show me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show me a graduate from the American</v>

1290
01:05:59.261 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 1>anti-education system that can balance a</v>
<v Speaker 1>checkbook.</v>

1291
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Does people do that anymore where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>ought to know?</v>

1292
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately they don't hedge the debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1293
01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:13.980
<v Speaker 1>pragmatism went the way of maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean.</v>

1294
01:06:13.981 --> 01:06:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I'd be pragmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Responsible,</v>

1295
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.970
<v Speaker 1>be accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Utilitarian.</v>

1296
01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Self be the best that you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call your body the sacred temple that</v>

1297
01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:25.660
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be treated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverence,</v>

1298
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:28.030
<v Speaker 1>eat good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be good,</v>

1299
01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:30.460
<v Speaker 1>be the best that you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Competitive.</v>

1300
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Life isn't fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get used to it.</v>

1301
01:06:32.141 --> 01:06:34.900
<v Speaker 1>If you want to excel in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show up earlier than the</v>

1302
01:06:34.901 --> 01:06:36.850
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You work harder than competition.</v>

1303
01:06:36.851 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 1>You do a better job than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

1304
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.830
<v Speaker 1>You stay later than the competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll end up owning the damn company.</v>

1305
01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and learning how to think.</v>

1306
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Learning how to think and learning how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at things.</v>

1307
01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.080
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's never taught in</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and it's one of the most</v>

1308
01:06:50.081 --> 01:06:52.570
<v Speaker 1>important lessons in your life and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn that lesson,</v>

1309
01:06:52.571 --> 01:06:54.250
<v Speaker 1>I think through doing difficult things.</v>

1310
01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation about you once and</v>

1311
01:06:56.441 --> 01:06:57.210
<v Speaker 1>someone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1312
01:06:57.210 --> 01:06:57.970
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1313
01:06:57.970 --> 01:06:58.803
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1314
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:01.330
<v Speaker 1>this is what you have to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about all the public shit.</v>

1315
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome at two things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard to be good at.</v>

1316
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Guitar in Bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>

1317
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Both very difficult to be disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be an exceptional person,</v>

1318
01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:16.780
<v Speaker 1>especially since you sound like such</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit for so long and the guitar,</v>

1319
01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:20.830
<v Speaker 1>there's no satisfaction whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go out for how many years took</v>

1320
01:07:20.831 --> 01:07:22.090
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the worst.</v>

1321
01:07:22.091 --> 01:07:23.860
<v Speaker 1>All my buddies learned faster than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

1322
01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.960
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just met up with Donnie Henderson.</v>

1323
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:29.530
<v Speaker 1>He's probably listening right now and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in a band called the gang when I had</v>

1324
01:07:29.531 --> 01:07:31.630
<v Speaker 1>a band called the lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kicked their ass and won the battle</v>

1325
01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:36.631
<v Speaker 1>of the bands in Michigan when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 13 or 14 and he and I are still</v>

1326
01:07:37.871 --> 01:07:38.860
<v Speaker 1>friends and he's.</v>

1327
01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's going to be 70 soon too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he played all the Chuck Berry and Bo</v>

1328
01:07:44.051 --> 01:07:45.490
<v Speaker 1>diddly stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

1329
01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:48.250
<v Speaker 1>And I'm stumbling and making stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>noises,</v>

1330
01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:51.490
<v Speaker 1>but you know what happened because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't figure out the exact licks.</v>

1331
01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I created my own style and I started</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>

1332
01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:58.900
<v Speaker 1>People thought I was being clever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wasn't doing them wrong,</v>

1333
01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:02.560
<v Speaker 1>but it still had a good rhythm at a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cool Santa.</v>

1334
01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like John Coltrain meets,</v>

1335
01:08:04.991 --> 01:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a punk kid play in bodiddly licks,</v>

1336
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:11.500
<v Speaker 1>and so I developed my own style and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a lot of fun with it.</v>

1337
01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:15.010
<v Speaker 1>But with all your question is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all your media,</v>

1338
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that you</v>

1339
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.580
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1340
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.490
<v Speaker 3>you're constantly doing interviews and</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone interviews.</v>

1341
01:08:19.491 --> 01:08:22.190
<v Speaker 3>You're constantly doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you have time to do all this?</v>

1342
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:24.350
<v Speaker 3>Still write music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a great team.</v>

1343
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:26.810
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about Linda getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>ahold of your team.</v>

1344
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Linda Peters have been with me for 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1345
01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug Bankers,</v>

1346
01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:35.150

<v Speaker 3>my crew,</v>

1347
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Chris Helms and Jim nap and my sons and</v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughters.</v>

1348
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife Charmaine is the goddess.</v>

1349
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:44.450
<v Speaker 3>If you ever seen Shane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure God help me.</v>

1350
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Senior show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1351
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:48.070
<v Speaker 3>she's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's the queen of the forest.</v>

1352
01:08:48.071 --> 01:08:49.640
<v Speaker 3>He is the queen of the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Full time.</v>

1353
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Not a damn thing you can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have such a great team.</v>

1354
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:58.070
<v Speaker 3>My crew on the road right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I leave nothing to chance.</v>

1355
01:08:58.071 --> 01:09:00.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry or think about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1356
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:05.500
<v Speaker 3>All I have to do is play my guitar and</v>
<v Speaker 3>rock my balls off,</v>

1357
01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:10.820
<v Speaker 3>so I always had a great team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>professional work ethic,</v>

1358
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:13.460
<v Speaker 3>monsters that are conscientious.</v>

1359
01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>professional,</v>

1360
01:09:16.071 --> 01:09:19.310
<v Speaker 3>knowledgeable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's no loose ends and that's how</v>

1361
01:09:19.311 --> 01:09:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm able to do all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're this,</v>

1362
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:25.830
<v Speaker 3>but you're also this really loud voice</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the culture war have to be,</v>

1363
01:09:25.831 --> 01:09:27.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be.</v>

1364
01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.890
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I refuse to let lives go unchallenged.</v>

1365
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I refuse to let antilogic going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Challenged antilogic like what?</v>

1366
01:09:35.690 --> 01:09:38.150
<v Speaker 3>Like did you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need secure borders really.</v>

1367
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 3>So the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we need to secure our borders</v>

1368
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:45.260
<v Speaker 3>and the Democrats don't admit there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between legal immigration and</v>

1369
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:48.200
<v Speaker 3>illegal immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you a little metaphor.</v>

1370
01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.630
<v Speaker 3>If you go to the bank and withdraw from</v>
<v Speaker 3>your account,</v>

1371
01:09:50.631 --> 01:09:53.450
<v Speaker 3>your illegal banker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to the bank and draw from</v>

1372
01:09:53.451 --> 01:09:55.820
<v Speaker 3>someone else's account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a bank robber.</v>

1373
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:58.790
<v Speaker 3>That was a division.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were four of legal banking.</v>

1374
01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:03.791
<v Speaker 3>We're not for illegal banking and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of antilogic has weaseled his way</v>

1375
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:08.921
<v Speaker 3>into policy and it's just tragic with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the multi trillion dollar debt and</v>

1376
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:12.620
<v Speaker 3>unsecured borders and we're worried</v>
<v Speaker 3>about separating families,</v>

1377
01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.300
<v Speaker 3>which we failed to say.</v>

1378
01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:19.540
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to come here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come legally are we will send you back.</v>

1379
01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.790
<v Speaker 3>We send out a message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have edit.</v>

1380
01:10:21.791 --> 01:10:23.510
<v Speaker 3>Just go ahead and implement across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dam river.</v>

1381
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you personally have a problem when</v>

1382
01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:30.050
<v Speaker 3>they separate families?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm a father and a grandfather.</v>

1383
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucked up.</v>

1384
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:35.170
<v Speaker 3>But the real fuck up starts with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1385
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:40.450
<v Speaker 3>the insane irresponsibility of daring to</v>
<v Speaker 3>subject your children to that.</v>

1386
01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they have any choice at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dinner over there.</v>

1387
01:10:43.581 --> 01:10:48.581
<v Speaker 3>They live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico and Guatemala is one big gang</v>

1388
01:10:48.681 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 3>infested government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Military law enforcement.</v>

1389
01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Shithole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1390
01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you call it a shit hole,</v>

1391
01:10:54.141 --> 01:10:55.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1392
01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:57.050
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't a shit hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would stay.</v>

1393
01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 3>It is a shit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever been there?</v>

1394
01:10:58.940 --> 01:10:59.773
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1395
01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 3>some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1396
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Mexico is also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the Mexico hasn't been raped and</v>

1397
01:11:02.631 --> 01:11:04.010
<v Speaker 3>pillaged yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but give them time.</v>

1398
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:08.720
<v Speaker 3>They'll make it that even in the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>resorts they're murdering and raping and</v>

1399
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:11.390
<v Speaker 3>bureau realizing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1400
01:11:11.391 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 3>it's just a hell hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely some bad things</v>

1401
01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:17.040
<v Speaker 3>happen in a lot of it is because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug war out of control.</v>

1402
01:11:17.041 --> 01:11:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people think that the</v>

1403
01:11:18.391 --> 01:11:21.490
<v Speaker 3>remedy to that is legalizing drugs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>taxing man.</v>

1404
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.373
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1405
01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.690
<v Speaker 3>So I mean the same thing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>prohibition.</v>

1406
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:29.990
<v Speaker 3>Same thing that would happen in America</v>
<v Speaker 3>really boosted organized crime and Al</v>

1407
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:33.090
<v Speaker 3>Capone and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got a stronghold because of the</v>

1408
01:11:33.091 --> 01:11:36.540
<v Speaker 3>money they were making from illegal</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs or alcohol at the time.</v>

1409
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:41.590
<v Speaker 3>I think that right now that the spoiled</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brat epidemic in this country,</v>

1410
01:11:42.211 --> 01:11:45.570
<v Speaker 3>if you don't get everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want you to start shooting people or</v>

1411
01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:49.260
<v Speaker 3>cut people off and road rage if</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything doesn't go just right.</v>

1412
01:11:49.261 --> 01:11:53.550
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is so touchy and so pussified</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when I was growing up,</v>

1413
01:11:53.551 --> 01:11:56.580
<v Speaker 3>sticks and stones may break your bones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but words will never hurt me.</v>

1414
01:11:56.610 --> 01:12:01.610
<v Speaker 3>What do you think that's coming from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberalization of policy and the the</v>

1415
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:08.930
<v Speaker 3>horrible lie of the welfare dream that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who need a helping hand are</v>

1416
01:12:11.851 --> 01:12:14.710
<v Speaker 3>always given a helping hand by neighbors</v>
<v Speaker 3>and family and friends,</v>

1417
01:12:14.711 --> 01:12:16.260
<v Speaker 3>and if they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1418
01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:19.230
<v Speaker 3>the Catholic Church has</v>
<v Speaker 3>$8,000,000,000,000 just in jewelry.</v>

1419
01:12:19.231 --> 01:12:23.220
<v Speaker 3>They could probably provide some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sandwiches and blankets so there's</v>

1420
01:12:23.221 --> 01:12:26.670
<v Speaker 3>plenty of help available,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you get into a system and you,</v>

1421
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:30.540
<v Speaker 3>you play on the people's emotions that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need a safety net,</v>

1422
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:32.730
<v Speaker 3>these poor people are just too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need help.</v>

1423
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's create a welfare where we can help</v>

1424
01:12:35.161 --> 01:12:36.960
<v Speaker 3>these destitute people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

1425
01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:41.550
<v Speaker 3>it's infested with scammers and blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>suckers and liars who are abled bodied</v>

1426
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.350
<v Speaker 3>and they just don't want to stop it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>

1427
01:12:43.351 --> 01:12:45.930
<v Speaker 3>One is sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want some of your income because</v>

1428
01:12:45.931 --> 01:12:49.740
<v Speaker 3>you're stupid enough to get up early and</v>
<v Speaker 3>work really hard and they don't want to.</v>

1429
01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:53.670
<v Speaker 3>That's pandemic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So meanwhile the people who are truly</v>

1430
01:12:53.671 --> 01:12:55.800
<v Speaker 3>needy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they slipped through the cracks.</v>

1431
01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.780
<v Speaker 3>We don't even get to know who they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and the the liberal policy of</v>

1432
01:13:00.781 --> 01:13:05.010
<v Speaker 3>eliminating the heartbreak and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>disrespect of Cuckoo's nest.</v>

1433
01:13:05.011 --> 01:13:07.440
<v Speaker 3>We can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can call them mental health centers.</v>

1434
01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:09.720
<v Speaker 3>We might hurt some feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now what are they doing?</v>

1435
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:12.180
<v Speaker 3>They're putting spikes in boards and</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking people,</v>

1436
01:13:12.181 --> 01:13:15.870
<v Speaker 3>walking their dog and La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said there's no place for them to go.</v>

1437
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.410
<v Speaker 3>When I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a place in Detroit called a</v>

1438
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:21.050
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a nuthouse and that's the</v>

1439
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Cuckoo's nest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where if you were mentally ill</v>

1440
01:13:24.061 --> 01:13:26.970
<v Speaker 3>and you needed help that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>place for you to go to get you off the</v>

1441
01:13:26.971 --> 01:13:29.330
<v Speaker 3>streets so you don't attack people with</v>
<v Speaker 3>spikes in Dubai.</v>

1442
01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.550
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The spikes in right here,</v>

1443
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.760
<v Speaker 3>right down the street here.</v>

1444
01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:33.750
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two days ago.</v>

1445
01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Tact some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fashion photographer walking his dog</v>

1446
01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:40.710
<v Speaker 3>and hit him in the head with a two by</v>
<v Speaker 3>four with a spike and almost killed him</v>

1447
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:42.330
<v Speaker 3>in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a citizen.</v>

1448
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.620
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1449
01:13:43.621 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Citizen jumped up in the air and caught</v>

1450
01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:47.710
<v Speaker 3>this guy with both feet right in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>neck and neck.</v>

1451
01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Beat the shit out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>

1452
01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:52.290
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a rare occasion of justice.</v>

1453
01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Pro Wrestling comes in handy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>

1454
01:13:54.151 --> 01:13:58.470
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that incident is not rare where you go</v>

1455
01:13:58.471 --> 01:14:03.471
<v Speaker 3>to San Francisco and the mental health</v>
<v Speaker 3>institution isn't supposed to be the</v>

1456
01:14:03.631 --> 01:14:07.290
<v Speaker 3>streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That mental health is a good example of</v>

1457
01:14:07.291 --> 01:14:11.100
<v Speaker 3>too much liberal policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get people that are a little bit too</v>

1458
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 3>progressive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>regressive.</v>

1459
01:14:14.231 --> 01:14:17.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did they ever utilize that term</v>

1460
01:14:17.081 --> 01:14:19.300
<v Speaker 3>that's bastardized as progressive?</v>

1461
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 3>It gets so far that it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>regressive when you're letting bombed</v>

1462
01:14:23.261 --> 01:14:24.970
<v Speaker 3>shit all over the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But thank you.</v>

1463
01:14:24.971 --> 01:14:27.470
<v Speaker 3>I think that would be an indicator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's.</v>

1464
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:31.030
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that just like these poor</v>
<v Speaker 3>people leave them alone,</v>

1465
01:14:31.031 --> 01:14:32.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fine.</v>

1466
01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:33.030
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1467
01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.520
<v Speaker 3>it's okay if they live on the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you go to San Francisco,</v>

1468
01:14:36.521 --> 01:14:39.460
<v Speaker 3>they're very aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the weirdest places I've</v>

1469
01:14:39.461 --> 01:14:42.430
<v Speaker 3>ever been in terms of homeless people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the most heartbreaking</v>

1470
01:14:42.431 --> 01:14:44.500
<v Speaker 3>unquote progressive places in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1471
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.870
<v Speaker 3>So one of the most progressive cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heartbreaking.</v>

1472
01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:49.720
<v Speaker 3>We need more cuckoo's nest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even those institutions,</v>

1473
01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 3>the corruption and the abuse of power</v>
<v Speaker 3>that runs ramp into nurse Cratchit and</v>

1474
01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:55.200
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1475
01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:58.780
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't just a fantasy scrip that</v>

1476
01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:03.760
<v Speaker 3>happens the irresponsibility and in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in pharmaceutical,</v>

1477
01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.460
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1478
01:15:05.461 --> 01:15:09.400
<v Speaker 3>they got a mental problem and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>increased the mental problem with big</v>

1479
01:15:09.401 --> 01:15:10.234
<v Speaker 3>farm.</v>

1480
01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:13.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had personal experiences with that</v>

1481
01:15:13.091 --> 01:15:18.040
<v Speaker 3>with dear friends of mine that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>having mental problems and they end up</v>

1482
01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:23.041
<v Speaker 3>in an institution and then their mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems are exasperated by chemical</v>

1483
01:15:24.101 --> 01:15:26.060
<v Speaker 3>warfare upon them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

1484
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:27.190
<v Speaker 3>When I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how old are you,</v>

1485
01:15:27.191 --> 01:15:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty slash 50 just to boy.</v>

1486
01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:31.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was growing up there was this,</v>

1487
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.720
<v Speaker 3>this mantra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this colloquialism better living through</v>

1488
01:15:34.721 --> 01:15:37.750
<v Speaker 3>chemistry in many ways it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1489
01:15:37.751 --> 01:15:42.751
<v Speaker 3>we saved tens of millions of lives in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa with DDT by killing the Zec fly</v>

1490
01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:48.640
<v Speaker 3>and we save tens of millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then some environmentalist come in</v>

1491
01:15:48.641 --> 01:15:53.641
<v Speaker 3>and the DDT is a dangerous chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they stopped it and we lost tens of</v>

1492
01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:55.170
<v Speaker 3>millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better to kill a bunch of seats.</v>

1493
01:15:55.171 --> 01:15:58.330
<v Speaker 3>He flies to save human lives than to</v>
<v Speaker 3>band the DDT.</v>

1494
01:15:58.331 --> 01:16:00.910
<v Speaker 3>That allows tsetse flies to flourish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>kills people.</v>

1495
01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:05.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now it's gone full circle and that's</v>

1496
01:16:05.411 --> 01:16:09.390
<v Speaker 3>where the toxins have accumulated and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1497
01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:13.930
<v Speaker 3>the horrific waste that I had texted</v>
<v Speaker 3>anthony just before he died,</v>

1498
01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.470
<v Speaker 3>congratulating him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt his hosting that brilliant</v>

1499
01:16:17.471 --> 01:16:19.750
<v Speaker 3>documentary if you haven't seen it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's waste,</v>

1500
01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:21.400
<v Speaker 3>waste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exclamation point,</v>

1501
01:16:21.401 --> 01:16:26.401
<v Speaker 3>what we do to where foods in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country and the self inflicted scourge</v>

1502
01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:27.640
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1503
01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.270
<v Speaker 3>of toxification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our precious environment.</v>

1504
01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.810
<v Speaker 3>So there's not a lot of easy answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here it is,</v>

1505
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:37.630
<v Speaker 3>28th of June,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2018.</v>

1506
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:41.470
<v Speaker 3>And here you and I are at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussing this stuff to millions of</v>

1507
01:16:41.471 --> 01:16:42.520
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect.</v>

1508
01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:47.850
<v Speaker 3>And I see upgrade taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see upgrade in awareness,</v>

1509
01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not fast enough to make me happy,</v>

1510
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:52.743
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1511
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:57.930
<v Speaker 3>enough to indicate an upgraded prognosis</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people's awareness,</v>

1512
01:17:00.551 --> 01:17:03.160
<v Speaker 3>accountability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

1513
01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.480
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are you seeing this?</v>

1514
01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's,</v>

1515
01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the circles that you travel circles</v>

1516
01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:10.364
<v Speaker 3>certainly in</v>

1517
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:14.210
<v Speaker 1>we don't waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my biggest pet peeves is little</v>

1518
01:17:14.211 --> 01:17:15.550
<v Speaker 1>fat kids that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1519
01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:19.100
<v Speaker 1>take a sip of $2 bottle of water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they leave it there and ended up</v>

1520
01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:24.101
<v Speaker 1>throwing it away and the waist is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pandemic in this country and I see my,</v>

1521
01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.940
<v Speaker 1>my kids are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like storm troopers there,</v>

1522
01:17:28.941 --> 01:17:33.941
<v Speaker 1>like drill sergeants with that we just</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to waste and we've always</v>

1523
01:17:34.641 --> 01:17:38.120
<v Speaker 1>recycled and the jury is still out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that has any effect at all.</v>

1524
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.980
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1525
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:45.370
<v Speaker 1>the disconnect in unconscionable</v>
<v Speaker 1>misbehavior of just tossing and throwing</v>

1526
01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:49.790
<v Speaker 1>away everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1527
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:52.250
<v Speaker 1>what drives me fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cigarettes out the window.</v>

1528
01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:55.340
<v Speaker 1>People just went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that smoke cigarettes for</v>

1529
01:17:55.341 --> 01:17:57.770
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a problem throwing it on the</v>

1530
01:17:57.771 --> 01:17:59.120
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't let her.</v>

1531
01:17:59.150 --> 01:18:01.970
<v Speaker 1>How about what drives me crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's somebody still stupid enough to</v>

1532
01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:03.790
<v Speaker 1>buy cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1533
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:04.690
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1534
01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me invest in the companies that want</v>

1535
01:18:06.921 --> 01:18:09.740
<v Speaker 1>to kill me here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a couple extra thousand dollars.</v>

1536
01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Kill more of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strange.</v>

1537
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it look a rebel man.</v>

1538
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never smoked.</v>

1539
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I've never smoked a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No drugs,</v>

1540
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:22.490
<v Speaker 1>no drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no alcohol?</v>

1541
01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:23.970
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You drink a little wine though.</v>

1542
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Fat Pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

1543
01:18:25.371 --> 01:18:27.850
<v Speaker 1>that shit will kill you know families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1544
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:33.160
<v Speaker 1>not even a little allergic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan for those who want,</v>

1545
01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.750
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drink a little wine though.</v>

1546
01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I do drink a little wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that qualifies as a</v>

1547
01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:42.200
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a glass of wine with my sons and</v>

1548
01:18:42.201 --> 01:18:44.360
<v Speaker 1>my daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brothers and sisters,</v>

1549
01:18:44.361 --> 01:18:46.200
<v Speaker 1>they Thanksgiving dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beer.</v>

1550
01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Beer is better than coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1551
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Vastly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1552
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:54.850
<v Speaker 1>It's when you start to enter the drool</v>
<v Speaker 1>zone that I have a big problem of</v>

1553
01:18:55.371 --> 01:18:57.740
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden if there's a</v>

1554
01:18:57.741 --> 01:19:00.520
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't rely on you anymore.</v>

1555
01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to be reliable and that's why I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a problem with comfortably numb.</v>

1556
01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in my experience,</v>

1557
01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:10.910
<v Speaker 1>you can't wake up the bass player</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was comfortably numb.</v>

1558
01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:13.460
<v Speaker 1>The guys don't show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tune his guitar.</v>

1559
01:19:13.461 --> 01:19:16.490
<v Speaker 1>He forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lyrics were not as tight as we could</v>

1560
01:19:16.491 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fired.</v>

1561
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is what I'm saying to you is</v>

1562
01:19:20.771 --> 01:19:25.190
<v Speaker 1>that this is just a discipline issue and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the marijuana or anything that</v>

1563
01:19:25.191 --> 01:19:27.680
<v Speaker 1>gets people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lack of discipline.</v>

1564
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I think Jitsu world and the Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is filled with people that smoked</v>

1565
01:19:32.151 --> 01:19:36.050
<v Speaker 1>pot and these motherfuckers work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want.</v>

1566
01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:41.080
<v Speaker 1>What's the number one karate guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was the guy that died personally?</v>

1567
01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee.</v>

1568
01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Did he smoke dope?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1569
01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.160
<v Speaker 1>he ate hash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Hash.</v>

1570
01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:46.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1571
01:19:46.701 --> 01:19:48.560
<v Speaker 1>he's into eating half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my question,</v>

1572
01:19:48.561 --> 01:19:52.430
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my question to you is I offered</v>

1573
01:19:52.431 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 1>to my son Rocco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's an advocate of marijuana.</v>

1574
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:57.403
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1575
01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocco.</v>

1576
01:19:58.730 --> 01:20:00.470
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

1577
01:20:00.471 --> 01:20:05.471
<v Speaker 1>so do you really believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfectly clean and sober [inaudible]</v>

1578
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.900
<v Speaker 2>taking care of your health with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious diet,</v>

1579
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:14.460
<v Speaker 2>good athletic workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>

1580
01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.030
<v Speaker 2>physical prowess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1581
01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Do you really think that an outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>source,</v>

1582
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.160
<v Speaker 2>payoti mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dope,</v>

1583
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:28.670
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really think that with that</v>

1584
01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:33.890
<v Speaker 2>outside influence you can do something</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do unto your God given gift,</v>

1585
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:38.940
<v Speaker 2>individual self?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm convinced,</v>

1586
01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you will be the absolute best you</v>

1587
01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:46.650
<v Speaker 2>can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will accomplish what I think is a</v>

1588
01:20:46.651 --> 01:20:49.920
<v Speaker 2>self inflicted curse of modern man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that 90 percent,</v>

1589
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.810
<v Speaker 2>98 percent of humanity might be tapping</v>
<v Speaker 2>into five percent of their capabilities</v>

1590
01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:59.670
<v Speaker 2>because they get on a treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get into a paradigm self restricted</v>

1591
01:20:59.671 --> 01:21:04.671
<v Speaker 2>pier nine ever so decreasing a view of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and experiences and the</v>

1592
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 2>overwrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the destroyed road over traveled versus</v>

1593
01:21:10.710 --> 01:21:14.550
<v Speaker 2>not only the road less traveled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the non road untraveled.</v>

1594
01:21:14.551 --> 01:21:16.980
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm convinced that you,</v>

1595
01:21:16.981 --> 01:21:21.981
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 2>will find your superior definitive best</v>

1596
01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.320
<v Speaker 2>without any outside influence.</v>

1597
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I believe you have the power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I have the power when I get</v>

1598
01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:35.400
<v Speaker 2>onstage tonight and you gotta come you</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotta come witness this,</v>

1599
01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:38.670
<v Speaker 2>but my bed and I do like it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll figure out a time.</v>

1600
01:21:38.671 --> 01:21:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I can't come tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Italy.</v>

1601
01:21:40.391 --> 01:21:44.130
<v Speaker 2>I got an orgy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the Improv of human fire,</v>

1602
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:49.140
<v Speaker 2>we put our fists together and chant</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Brown and Wilson Pickett and funk</v>

1603
01:21:49.141 --> 01:21:54.141
<v Speaker 2>brothers and it's like the last wolves</v>
<v Speaker 2>on an island gun gnashing of teeth over</v>

1604
01:21:54.811 --> 01:21:57.180
<v Speaker 2>the last bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Charlotte of flesh,</v>

1605
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:58.530
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1606
01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.800
<v Speaker 2>it's an out of body</v>
<v Speaker 2>soaring above life itself.</v>

1607
01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Experience that we have in us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need anything.</v>

1608
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I understand me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

1609
01:22:13.621 --> 01:22:17.350
<v Speaker 2>But you don't use anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're talking from a place of non</v>

1610
01:22:17.351 --> 01:22:20.370
<v Speaker 2>experience when it comes to marijuana or</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms or any of these things.</v>

1611
01:22:20.371 --> 01:22:24.840
<v Speaker 2>But my 70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say at least 55 of those years from</v>

1612
01:22:24.841 --> 01:22:26.490
<v Speaker 2>the beatniks to the hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

1613
01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:27.600
<v Speaker 2>to the friends.</v>

1614
01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.750
<v Speaker 2>And you got to meet this Wayne Kramer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guide Mc five guitars,</v>

1615
01:22:30.751 --> 01:22:32.340
<v Speaker 2>new book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hard stuff.</v>

1616
01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:35.790
<v Speaker 2>He and I were born the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same influenced Detroit,</v>

1617
01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:37.290
<v Speaker 2>the swamps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outdoors,</v>

1618
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.850
<v Speaker 2>but bodiddly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Berry,</v>

1619
01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Motown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Brown.</v>

1620
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.820
<v Speaker 2>He started smoking dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

1621
01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:46.470
<v Speaker 2>And he's a any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Heroin and had any prison again.</v>

1622
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:52.260
<v Speaker 2>And then arrested and I'm having the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time of my life and he's like wallowing</v>

1623
01:22:52.261 --> 01:22:56.580
<v Speaker 2>in a cesspool of dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not knocking Wayne.</v>

1624
01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:59.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that he was courageous to</v>
<v Speaker 2>write this book.</v>

1625
01:22:59.401 --> 01:23:02.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a brilliant book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to have them on.</v>

1626
01:23:02.071 --> 01:23:03.630
<v Speaker 2>You're going to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna.</v>

1627
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:06.400
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be consumed</v>

1628
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.400
<v Speaker 4>by his conversational writing of the MC</v>
<v Speaker 4>five's a ascension to the most</v>

1629
01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:19.120
<v Speaker 4>authoritative power house music I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever witnessed in my life,</v>

1630
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:23.770
<v Speaker 4>to a bunch of dirt bags on the downward</v>
<v Speaker 4>spiral because of drugs and alcohol.</v>

1631
01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:27.010
<v Speaker 4>I know that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It definitely happens,</v>

1632
01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.700
<v Speaker 4>but it happens with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens with people when they eat too</v>

1633
01:23:30.701 --> 01:23:32.680
<v Speaker 4>much food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens with people with gambling.</v>

1634
01:23:32.681 --> 01:23:36.220
<v Speaker 4>It happens in different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's because of discipline.</v>

1635
01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:38.140
<v Speaker 4>It's because they don't have a clear</v>
<v Speaker 4>path.</v>

1636
01:23:38.141 --> 01:23:40.870
<v Speaker 4>I think it's because they let themselves</v>
<v Speaker 4>become self indulgent and they let</v>

1637
01:23:40.871 --> 01:23:44.230
<v Speaker 4>themselves be weak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying is that I know a lot of</v>

1638
01:23:44.231 --> 01:23:47.440
<v Speaker 4>people who use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's psychedelics or they use</v>

1639
01:23:47.441 --> 01:23:49.930
<v Speaker 4>marijuana and they use it to enhance</v>
<v Speaker 4>their perspective.</v>

1640
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.420
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't become the primary focus of</v>
<v Speaker 4>their life.</v>

1641
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.880
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't consume their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't allow it to consume their</v>

1642
01:23:54.881 --> 01:23:55.510
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1643
01:23:55.510 --> 01:24:00.400
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole other world of</v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplined marijuana enthusiasts and</v>

1644
01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:03.460
<v Speaker 4>they're confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same way people confuse hunter's the</v>

1645
01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:06.220
<v Speaker 4>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People think of hunters as being lazy.</v>

1646
01:24:06.221 --> 01:24:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Drunk and slavs were cruel to animals</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you and I know that that's not the</v>

1647
01:24:09.521 --> 01:24:13.780
<v Speaker 4>case at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the most disciplined focused and</v>

1648
01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:17.080
<v Speaker 4>just people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intense people because to be,</v>

1649
01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.260
<v Speaker 4>to be at Cameron Hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a John Dudley,</v>

1650
01:24:20.261 --> 01:24:24.010
<v Speaker 4>you have to be a superior type of human</v>
<v Speaker 4>being super athletes.</v>

1651
01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.420
<v Speaker 4>You have to be able to execute in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme moment,</v>

1652
01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:31.660
<v Speaker 4>that moment where that animal walks out</v>
<v Speaker 4>into that shooting window and you're</v>

1653
01:24:31.661 --> 01:24:36.280
<v Speaker 4>looking at this three 90 bull elk</v>
<v Speaker 4>screaming,</v>

1654
01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:39.650
<v Speaker 4>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>overwhelming all over itself over</v>

1655
01:24:39.651 --> 01:24:42.520
<v Speaker 4>whelming and it's 40 yards away and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>center in that pen.</v>

1656
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:46.780
<v Speaker 4>It takes magical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful human being to execute that</v>

1657
01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:48.910
<v Speaker 4>shot and I don't think most people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>aware of that.</v>

1658
01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:52.510
<v Speaker 4>Most people don't know in the same way</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's misunderstood.</v>

1659
01:24:52.511 --> 01:24:55.330
<v Speaker 4>I think marijuana is misunderstood</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's a lot of dummies in this</v>

1660
01:24:55.331 --> 01:24:57.250
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get a group of 100 people,</v>

1661
01:24:57.370 --> 01:24:59.140
<v Speaker 4>what are the odds that one of them is</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be a dummy?</v>

1662
01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:01.690
<v Speaker 4>Fucking 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1663
01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.820
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent nowadays more than</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

1664
01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:05.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get a group of 100 people that</v>

1665
01:25:05.411 --> 01:25:09.580
<v Speaker 4>use marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one loud fucking stupid one defies</v>

1666
01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:12.580
<v Speaker 4>or defines rather what marijuana users</v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

1667
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:17.020
<v Speaker 4>You see that fucking idiot who's pissing</v>
<v Speaker 4>all over himself and fallen down so high</v>

1668
01:25:17.021 --> 01:25:19.000
<v Speaker 4>you can't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you think of.</v>

1669
01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:22.840
<v Speaker 4>You don't think of the Brazilian Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 4>black belt that smokes pot and then goes</v>

1670
01:25:22.841 --> 01:25:26.980
<v Speaker 4>out and strangles 50 people in class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't think of people that take yoga</v>

1671
01:25:26.981 --> 01:25:28.780
<v Speaker 4>class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked hiring marijuana.</v>

1672
01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:32.180
<v Speaker 4>Strangling there should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

1673
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:35.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm absorbing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absorbing,</v>

1674
01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:39.160
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>respecting and considering your work.</v>

1675
01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:41.800
<v Speaker 4>It can get away from you can get away</v>
<v Speaker 4>from you.</v>

1676
01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:44.230
<v Speaker 4>All I've ever said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything can get away from you.</v>

1677
01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:47.350
<v Speaker 4>That's all I've ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's because these people</v>

1678
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:50.290
<v Speaker 4>that consume it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have those other qualities.</v>

1679
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:53.770
<v Speaker 4>They don't have discipline and focus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have respect for their body.</v>

1680
01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.150
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing with the,</v>

1681
01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:57.910
<v Speaker 4>especially in the Jujitsu community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's super common.</v>

1682
01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.330
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana is really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

1683
01:25:59.331 --> 01:26:00.670
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really common.</v>

1684
01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:01.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1685
01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 4>there's a show called high rollers where</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys,</v>

1686
01:26:04.431 --> 01:26:07.280
<v Speaker 4>they put together a Jujitsu tournament</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody had to get high before</v>

1687
01:26:07.281 --> 01:26:11.580
<v Speaker 4>they rolled and you're talking like</v>
<v Speaker 4>elite world class Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>

1688
01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 4>black belts competing high on marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's got to be one of the highest</v>

1689
01:26:14.901 --> 01:26:17.540
<v Speaker 4>forms of disciplines very available to</v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

1690
01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:18.770
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very.</v>

1691
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:22.910
<v Speaker 4>With the camera and climbing bowhunting</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coleen and milk in your lap.</v>

1692
01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.133
<v Speaker 4>Well you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1693
01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:28.010
<v Speaker 4>you're doing an art that's designed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>break bodies and the two of you are</v>

1694
01:26:28.011 --> 01:26:30.800
<v Speaker 4>going to do it together and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea is that you're going to get someone</v>

1695
01:26:30.801 --> 01:26:33.260
<v Speaker 4>into a position where they have to tap</v>
<v Speaker 4>or they're going to get their arm</v>

1696
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:35.030
<v Speaker 4>snapped or they're going to get choked.</v>

1697
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:39.590
<v Speaker 4>Unconscious said intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Extremely difficult pursuit and a lot of</v>

1698
01:26:39.591 --> 01:26:41.210
<v Speaker 4>people do it under the influence of</v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana.</v>

1699
01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.900
<v Speaker 4>Do you know any of these master Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 4>martial artists?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1711
01:27:10.071 --> 01:27:11.990
<v Speaker 4>How about world champions that don't get</v>
<v Speaker 4>high?</v>

1712
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:16.160
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of those to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens with marijuana is increased</v>

1713
01:27:16.161 --> 01:27:18.310
<v Speaker 4>sensitivity that a lot of people talk</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1714
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:22.490
<v Speaker 4>They call it paranoia because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of things that people put blinders</v>

1715
01:27:22.491 --> 01:27:23.000
<v Speaker 4>on their life.</v>

1716
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.730
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people aren't aware,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sure because of your hunting,</v>

1717
01:27:25.731 --> 01:27:29.480
<v Speaker 4>you're spending time in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're soaking in all the variables.</v>

1718
01:27:29.481 --> 01:27:32.600
<v Speaker 4>The sound when I'm a radar there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1719
01:27:32.601 --> 01:27:35.000
<v Speaker 4>You're aware there's a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that go through life like this.</v>

1720
01:27:35.001 --> 01:27:36.020
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go through life like they're</v>

1721
01:27:36.021 --> 01:27:38.690
<v Speaker 4>looking through a toilet paper roll</v>
<v Speaker 4>there in the left lane right now.</v>

1722
01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:39.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not.</v>

1723
01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:42.020
<v Speaker 4>They're not using their blinkers and</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people,</v>

1724
01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.480
<v Speaker 4>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they smoke marijuana,</v>

1725
01:27:44.481 --> 01:27:46.970
<v Speaker 4>they freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get paranoid because what's</v>

1726
01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:50.890
<v Speaker 4>happening is the marijuana increases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your sensitivity makes you aware of all</v>

1727
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:53.630
<v Speaker 4>these variables and a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>consider that paranoia.</v>

1728
01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:55.880
<v Speaker 4>He started freaking out about all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>variables.</v>

1729
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.780
<v Speaker 4>You start thinking about your mortality</v>
<v Speaker 4>and instead of embracing this time as a</v>

1730
01:27:59.781 --> 01:28:02.480
<v Speaker 4>magical moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of being in this moment,</v>

1731
01:28:02.690 --> 01:28:05.750
<v Speaker 4>you just start getting overwhelmed and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel your own heartbeat and you</v>

1732
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:06.390
<v Speaker 4>start freaking.</v>

1733
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:10.400
<v Speaker 4>Now this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's without anything.</v>

1734
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:15.430
<v Speaker 4>It's an entheogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It brings you closer to whatever you are</v>

1735
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.100
<v Speaker 4>not encumbered by your ego.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will</v>

1736
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:25.630
<v Speaker 4>admit in escapable that everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>affects everyone differently.</v>

1737
01:28:25.821 --> 01:28:29.200
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once you make it widespread,</v>

1738
01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:31.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've studied the results of legalization</v>

1739
01:28:31.821 --> 01:28:36.770
<v Speaker 4>for recreational use in Colorado and how</v>
<v Speaker 4>the highway fatalities and accidents</v>

1740
01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:38.750
<v Speaker 4>have increased,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what else has increased the</v>

1741
01:28:38.751 --> 01:28:42.290
<v Speaker 4>population in proportion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it causes breeding.</v>

1742
01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.570
<v Speaker 4>Thousands is more people there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More people are there,</v>

1743
01:28:44.571 --> 01:28:48.770
<v Speaker 4>so you having more accidents there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is is a boom of population</v>

1744
01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.890
<v Speaker 4>also a boom in the economy of boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the real estate.</v>

1745
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:53.270
<v Speaker 4>Real estate's taking off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1746
01:28:53.271 --> 01:28:56.090
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of losers there too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of hacky sack playing</v>

1747
01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.830
<v Speaker 4>dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stinky hippies that are wandering around</v>

1748
01:28:57.831 --> 01:29:00.140
<v Speaker 4>with no shoes on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get those.</v>

1749
01:29:00.230 --> 01:29:01.160
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get those.</v>

1750
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have an opening welcome society</v>

1751
01:29:03.961 --> 01:29:05.820
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't lock those people up,</v>

1752
01:29:05.821 --> 01:29:08.010
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have those as a part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom.</v>

1753
01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:09.023
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sucks.</v>

1754
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:13.860
<v Speaker 4>Losers are a part of this safe world</v>
<v Speaker 4>that our kids are allowed to wander too.</v>

1755
01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:16.800
<v Speaker 4>We want the world to be safe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so sometimes things are too safe.</v>

1756
01:29:16.801 --> 01:29:19.200
<v Speaker 4>You nerve the edges and you get a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people that are used to hitting their</v>

1757
01:29:19.201 --> 01:29:21.090
<v Speaker 4>heads on things and they're not worried</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1758
01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:24.780
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have these losers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean that everybody who</v>

1759
01:29:24.781 --> 01:29:25.620
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a loser.</v>

1760
01:29:25.621 --> 01:29:30.621
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of CEO's of big</v>
<v Speaker 4>corporations that have responsibilities</v>

1761
01:29:30.810 --> 01:29:32.580
<v Speaker 4>and they liked to smoke a little pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>

1762
01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:37.620
<v Speaker 4>I get punched back off and on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a successful guy,</v>

1763
01:29:37.621 --> 01:29:39.060
<v Speaker 4>run my family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a good dad.</v>

1764
01:29:39.061 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm a good hunter and I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a trump supporter and I get high.</v>

1765
01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh God bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1766
01:29:44.490 --> 01:29:47.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't watch a babysitting my kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>while you're high.</v>

1767
01:29:47.371 --> 01:29:48.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's discipline.</v>

1768
01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:52.650
<v Speaker 4>Discipline is the thing that fucks</v>
<v Speaker 4>people up and the lack of this lack of</v>

1769
01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:56.850
<v Speaker 4>the lack of discipline and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's with everything and could be with</v>

1770
01:29:56.851 --> 01:29:58.710
<v Speaker 4>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be with gambling,</v>

1771
01:29:58.711 --> 01:30:01.560
<v Speaker 4>it could be with extreme risky</v>
<v Speaker 4>behaviors.</v>

1772
01:30:01.561 --> 01:30:04.350
<v Speaker 4>People could just get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get real nutty and get carried away with</v>

1773
01:30:04.351 --> 01:30:07.770
<v Speaker 4>things and sometimes those things are</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a big distraction for the lack of</v>

1774
01:30:07.771 --> 01:30:10.230
<v Speaker 4>discipline they have in pursuing their</v>
<v Speaker 4>own goals in life.</v>

1775
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:12.600
<v Speaker 4>I think that that is the real high in</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1776
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:15.240
<v Speaker 4>The real high end life is pursuing</v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult things.</v>

1777
01:30:15.250 --> 01:30:16.350
<v Speaker 4>Ratification,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

1778
01:30:16.351 --> 01:30:19.170
<v Speaker 4>getting good at them and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplishing your goals.</v>

1779
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.390
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a high to that that's.</v>

1780
01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.990
<v Speaker 4>You can't find that in pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist in the needle.</v>

1781
01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:29.700
<v Speaker 4>That high is a high of discipline and</v>
<v Speaker 4>determination and focus in learning,</v>

1782
01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:33.630
<v Speaker 4>but there's so much weakness out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in a society that has been</v>

1783
01:30:33.631 --> 01:30:38.631
<v Speaker 4>spoiled for so long and you get a trophy</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't even show up and you can't</v>

1784
01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:42.650
<v Speaker 4>hurt people's feelings and bullied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get bullied and you're crying.</v>

1785
01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:45.630
<v Speaker 4>Should fight and back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's so many manifestation of</v>

1786
01:30:45.631 --> 01:30:49.780
<v Speaker 4>a cultural deprivation that runs a muck</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our society that my fear is nice.</v>

1787
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:53.460
<v Speaker 4>Studied all these mass shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

1788
01:30:53.790 --> 01:30:56.850
<v Speaker 4>the Virginia Tech shooter high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1789
01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:59.250
<v Speaker 4>they're all buying high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1790
01:30:59.251 --> 01:31:01.110
<v Speaker 4>but they're all on SSRI.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1791
01:31:01.111 --> 01:31:03.130
<v Speaker 4>They're all on pills and</v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceuticals.</v>

1792
01:31:03.131 --> 01:31:08.131
<v Speaker 4>Almost all of them are on the PROZAC and</v>
<v Speaker 4>their parents or all of them are</v>

1793
01:31:09.421 --> 01:31:12.750
<v Speaker 4>chemical covering up a kid that shows</v>
<v Speaker 4>enthusiasm.</v>

1794
01:31:12.751 --> 01:31:15.210
<v Speaker 4>It's called an attention disorder now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1795
01:31:15.211 --> 01:31:16.830
<v Speaker 4>if they had that back when I was growing</v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

1796
01:31:16.831 --> 01:31:18.050
<v Speaker 4>I had ended up playing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1797
01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.840
<v Speaker 4>I ended up being nosy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is the word drugs,</v>

1798
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:24.420
<v Speaker 4>like you and I are drinking coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're on drugs right now.</v>

1799
01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.400
<v Speaker 4>We're on caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a drug.</v>

1800
01:31:26.610 --> 01:31:29.220
<v Speaker 4>There's some drugs that if used</v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibly or.</v>

1801
01:31:29.221 --> 01:31:31.470
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A glass of wine with dinner is a</v>

1802
01:31:31.471 --> 01:31:32.370
<v Speaker 4>drought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Understood.</v>

1803
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:34.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a mild drug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little tiny Toke</v>

1804
01:31:36.410 --> 01:31:41.190
<v Speaker 4>for sex with the Mrs. That's a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>drug and it makes you see I've never</v>

1805
01:31:41.191 --> 01:31:43.940
<v Speaker 4>smoked because I can't smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get in,</v>

1806
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:46.560
<v Speaker 4>when I shoot my machine guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all I do is chew on a Cuban.</v>

1807
01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:49.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't really smoke it well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get a little buzz.</v>

1808
01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:54.600
<v Speaker 4>Just love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seems to go with brash rainbows.</v>

1809
01:31:54.601 --> 01:31:55.434
<v Speaker 4>When I had that tight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tight,</v>

1810
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:59.070
<v Speaker 4>tight site,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was way faster than my best.</v>

1811
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.280
<v Speaker 4>My best morning</v>

1812

<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1813

<v Speaker 3>And I got a pof upper to piston driven.</v>

1814
01:32:09.281 --> 01:32:13.480
<v Speaker 3>So instead of 600 plus rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes over 700 rounds a minute and my</v>

1815
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:17.030
<v Speaker 3>$600 to sit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it is way too low,</v>

1816
01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:19.120
<v Speaker 3>but they actually had the original,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>including sargent rock could control</v>

1819
01:32:26.471 --> 01:32:28.330
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they backed it down to 600,</v>

1820
01:32:28.331 --> 01:32:30.250
<v Speaker 3>but that's 45 and it's got a whole lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of lift.</v>

1821

01:32:48.490 --> 01:32:53.490
<v Speaker 3>that is every wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that the pig problem is the one that</v>

1826
01:32:54.731 --> 01:32:58.070
<v Speaker 3>throws in the face of vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one because you,</v>

1827
01:32:58.090 --> 01:33:00.880
<v Speaker 3>you got to do something about those</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals because they're going to destroy</v>

1828
01:33:00.881 --> 01:33:01.610
<v Speaker 3>your food.</v>

1829
01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to eat every when we kill</v>

1830
01:33:03.431 --> 01:33:07.240
<v Speaker 3>pigs like that in such mass numbers from</v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopters with machine guns,</v>

1831
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:11.230
<v Speaker 3>we're literally saving the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeding a lot of people.</v>

1832
01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:16.000
<v Speaker 3>We the pork that we process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousands and thousands of people get</v>

1833
01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:18.160
<v Speaker 3>this pure organic port and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious.</v>

1834
01:33:18.161 --> 01:33:20.590
<v Speaker 3>The best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wild pork without white fat,</v>

1835
01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.910
<v Speaker 3>dark meat handy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1836
01:33:22.911 --> 01:33:25.450
<v Speaker 3>So we're saving the environment from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pig destruction.</v>

1837
01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:28.870
<v Speaker 3>We're saving agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat food production from the pig</v>

1838
01:33:28.871 --> 01:33:32.500
<v Speaker 3>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're saving tax dollars from hiring</v>

1839
01:33:32.501 --> 01:33:36.580
<v Speaker 3>sharp shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're saving all wildlife because the</v>

1840
01:33:36.581 --> 01:33:40.180
<v Speaker 3>alternative would have been a</v>
<v Speaker 3>indiscriminate poisoning campaign and</v>

1841
01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:43.690
<v Speaker 3>recreating a huge new industry of</v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopter hog hunting.</v>

1842
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:44.401
<v Speaker 3>When?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When?</v>

1843
01:33:44.401 --> 01:33:44.970
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1844
01:33:44.970 --> 01:33:48.520
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when will copter Haagan serious party</v>

1845
01:33:48.521 --> 01:33:50.950
<v Speaker 3>time USA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And guess who passed that law?</v>

1846
01:33:51.130 --> 01:33:52.450
<v Speaker 3>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>

1847
01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and Chris Cole back.</v>

1848
01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:58.780
<v Speaker 3>We were hunting and we weren't allowed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay the helicopter pilot by law.</v>

1849
01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:03.490
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't be a for profit outfit</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless the government paid him,</v>

1850
01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.200
<v Speaker 3>which was so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and Texas,</v>

1851
01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:09.480
<v Speaker 3>so Kris Kobach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the secretary of state and</v>

1852
01:34:09.481 --> 01:34:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Kansas and was running for governor and</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be governor of Kansas.</v>

1853
01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:17.340
<v Speaker 3>He's a constitutional master and he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took the current a pig hunting law</v>

1854
01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.750
<v Speaker 3>firm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopters that was government</v>

1855
01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:20.590
<v Speaker 3>controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1856
01:34:21.190 --> 01:34:24.490
<v Speaker 3>no citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no commercial value whatsoever.</v>

1857
01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:28.780
<v Speaker 3>He rewrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We gave it to then Attorney General Greg</v>

1858
01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Abbott and Governor Perry at the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we said,</v>

1859
01:34:31.061 --> 01:34:33.850
<v Speaker 3>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This can't be Texas where you get to</v>

1860
01:34:33.851 --> 01:34:35.650
<v Speaker 3>hunt the pigs on our land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can't,</v>

1861
01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:39.310
<v Speaker 3>so literally within a week or two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they passed the law where it became a</v>

1862
01:34:39.311 --> 01:34:42.190
<v Speaker 3>commercial outfit where we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people can hunt the pigs out of</v>

1863
01:34:42.191 --> 01:34:44.830
<v Speaker 3>helicopters and it's become a huge</v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

1864
01:34:44.831 --> 01:34:49.180
<v Speaker 3>It's really knocked the shit out of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous pig population in those areas</v>

1865
01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:53.530
<v Speaker 3>where land owners allow it and give</v>
<v Speaker 3>authorization and if so much fun,</v>

1866
01:34:53.531 --> 01:34:54.430
<v Speaker 3>it's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1867
01:34:54.431 --> 01:34:56.500
<v Speaker 3>that's what people need to realize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You re,</v>

1868
01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 3>there's no way to get to them</v>

1869
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.550
<v Speaker 1>in certain circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There accessible.</v>

1870
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:03.170
<v Speaker 1>There are millions and millions of wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs.</v>

1871
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:05.120
<v Speaker 1>They have three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four litters a year,</v>

1872
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.000
<v Speaker 1>and there's no way to take care of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally.</v>

1873
01:35:09.210 --> 01:35:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Unless you gonna let hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of wolves loose in Texas.</v>

1874
01:35:13.521 --> 01:35:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I'd really don't sit down with them from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the helicopters.</v>

1875
01:35:15.971 --> 01:35:16.804
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how.</v>

1876
01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they do in Alaska when they</v>

1877
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.710
<v Speaker 1>decimate the care enough to they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way to control these</v>

1878
01:35:21.711 --> 01:35:23.390
<v Speaker 1>pigs other than God bless you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joy.</v>

1879
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Not many people know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that and it's a.</v>

1880
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:29.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem when you talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were animal rights activists,</v>

1881
01:35:29.481 --> 01:35:31.610
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you propose to fix this?</v>

1887
01:35:39.111 --> 01:35:40.580
<v Speaker 1>hundreds.</v>

01:37:45.081 --> 01:37:48.920
<v Speaker 1>six foot two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>220 pound purple rim.</v>

1940
01:37:48.921 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm susceptible to all influences and</v>

1941
01:37:53.091 --> 01:37:57.660
<v Speaker 1>stimuli and that's where I get this</v>
<v Speaker 1>passion in this happiness everyday.</v>

1942
01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Spoiled rotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to hunt everywhere,</v>

1943
01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:04.080
<v Speaker 1>that's what's crazy and I get to rock my</v>
<v Speaker 1>balls off every year.</v>

1944
01:38:04.081 --> 01:38:07.740
<v Speaker 1>So I'm the lucky one in your yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You essentially leave your house.</v>

1945
01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 1>My swamp in Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to close the door quietly because</v>

1946
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I have tree stands really close to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cabin and it's.</v>

1947
01:38:13.290 --> 01:38:15.030
<v Speaker 1>The swamp is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a miracle.</v>

1948
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:18.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think God loves me more than he loves</v>

1949
01:38:18.291 --> 01:38:22.070
<v Speaker 1>you because you created this place just</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me and it.</v>

1950
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:24.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a glacier cut marsh swamp.</v>

1951
01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Phen phen is no fen fen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very unique wetland habitat</v>

1952
01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.640
<v Speaker 1>that's a cross between a marsh and swamp</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bog and it's the,</v>

1953
01:38:35.641 --> 01:38:37.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1954
01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:41.310
<v Speaker 1>habitat that produces the Mitchells</v>
<v Speaker 1>cetera butterfly environment,</v>

1955
01:38:41.311 --> 01:38:45.690
<v Speaker 1>which is the Christmas tree from and on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my Michigan Fan,</v>

1956
01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I have the healthiest productivity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the endangered species,</v>

1957
01:38:49.531 --> 01:38:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Christmas tree fern and Mitchell's</v>
<v Speaker 1>setter.</v>

1958
01:38:52.321 --> 01:38:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Butterfly according to the biologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the botanists that visit there every</v>

1959
01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:00.720
<v Speaker 1>year from universities because I killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of critters that would otherwise</v>

1960
01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:06.020
<v Speaker 1>denude those touchy for her wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetations.</v>

1961
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's why a hundred every day up</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1962
01:39:10.651 --> 01:39:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I coons and possums and skunks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>beavers,</v>

1963
01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:17.010
<v Speaker 1>mink and muskrats and pheasants up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I.</v>

1964
01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only ground in southern Michigan</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has pheasants because I wage war</v>

1965
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:25.170
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot hurt vomit populations.</v>

1966
01:39:25.171 --> 01:39:27.720
<v Speaker 1>In fact they are drastically under</v>
<v Speaker 1>harvested.</v>

1967
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:30.870
<v Speaker 1>But on mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I killed so many egg rate environments</v>

1968
01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:34.560
<v Speaker 1>that I have the best biodiversity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1969
01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:38.520
<v Speaker 1>including the endangered Mitchell</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday butterfly and Christmas tree</v>

1970
01:39:38.521 --> 01:39:42.840
<v Speaker 1>fern because I'm a steward who actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>walks the wild ground,</v>

1971
01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.280
<v Speaker 1>unlike a bureaucrat who looks at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer screen and is dnr office and</v>

1972
01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:50.940
<v Speaker 1>makes an assumption of what the model</v>
<v Speaker 1>might indicate instead of what the</v>

1973
01:39:50.941 --> 01:39:55.830
<v Speaker 1>actual wild ground will show you if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck off your chair and go walk</v>

1974
01:39:55.831 --> 01:39:56.311
<v Speaker 1>that say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1975
01:39:56.311 --> 01:39:59.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a big criticism to people or from</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that,</v>

1976
01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:02.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like people in bc that are</v>

1977
01:40:02.101 --> 01:40:06.120
<v Speaker 1>now a part of that grizzly bear band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably dishonest.</v>

1978
01:40:06.130 --> 01:40:09.660
<v Speaker 1>They're getting people that live in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city that don't have any interaction</v>

1979
01:40:09.661 --> 01:40:12.060
<v Speaker 1>with these animals and that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals are trouble.</v>

1980
01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not there can only you can eat</v>

1981
01:40:16.051 --> 01:40:16.860
<v Speaker 1>them too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1982
01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I think their stakes bear backstraps</v>
<v Speaker 1>candy,</v>

1983
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:22.860
<v Speaker 1>especially in the spring if they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating berries and the grass,</v>

1984
01:40:22.861 --> 01:40:26.340
<v Speaker 1>but the perception is that what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is trophy hunting,</v>

1985
01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.010
<v Speaker 1>that you know you're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're shooting something you don't plan</v>

1986
01:40:29.011 --> 01:40:31.180
<v Speaker 1>on eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to put a hand on you because you're</v>

1987
01:40:31.181 --> 01:40:33.690
<v Speaker 1>a cruel person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dishonest can you be?</v>

1988
01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not talking to the people that</v>

1989
01:40:34.951 --> 01:40:37.140
<v Speaker 1>are in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual people that are on the</v>

1990
01:40:37.141 --> 01:40:37.974
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1991
01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:41.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a real part of the problem is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these laws get passed by these</v>

1992
01:40:41.521 --> 01:40:44.820
<v Speaker 1>people that have no interaction with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this actual environment.</v>

1993
01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:49.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like people who live in a drought</v>
<v Speaker 1>voting on what's going on in your flood.</v>

1994
01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:50.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1995
01:40:50.281 --> 01:40:53.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like the people in Detroit voting</v>
<v Speaker 1>on wolves in the upper peninsula.</v>

1996
01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>If you don't</v>

1997
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.460
<v Speaker 3>live with bull with the wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get say so.</v>

1998
01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.790
<v Speaker 3>You need to respect the people who live</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the wolves and wolves.</v>

1999
01:41:00.791 --> 01:41:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Don't buy licenses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wolves don't buy permits.</v>

2000
01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Wolves don't pay fees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wolves don't have bag limits.</v>

2001
01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Wolves don't have seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just like to kill stuff and if you</v>

2002
01:41:11.291 --> 01:41:14.830
<v Speaker 3>have too many wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody spending money on deer license or</v>

2003
01:41:14.831 --> 01:41:18.580
<v Speaker 3>bear license or small game hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the upper peninsula of Michigan has</v>

2004
01:41:18.581 --> 01:41:23.230
<v Speaker 3>been abandoned by a bunch of politically</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct ignorant city jerks who think</v>

2005
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:26.590
<v Speaker 3>they have to save the endangered wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want wolves in Michigan,</v>

2006
01:41:26.591 --> 01:41:30.160
<v Speaker 3>but not to the detriment of wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually pays for the game</v>

2007
01:41:30.161 --> 01:41:33.460
<v Speaker 3>department to manage it for a sustained</v>
<v Speaker 3>yield productivity,</v>

2008
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the thing we're talking about</v>

2009
01:41:35.711 --> 01:41:36.101
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2010
01:41:36.101 --> 01:41:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Like wildlife management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this idea that you have to manage</v>

2011
01:41:39.401 --> 01:41:42.880
<v Speaker 3>the population of pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also have to like what you're doing</v>

2012
01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:44.560
<v Speaker 3>in your place in Michigan.</v>

2013
01:41:44.710 --> 01:41:49.710
<v Speaker 3>You're managing this wildlife to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate diversity that if you don't</v>

2014
01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:54.610
<v Speaker 3>have to deal with walls and if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet higher tax paid sharp shooters that</v>

2015
01:41:54.611 --> 01:41:58.510
<v Speaker 3>have no respect for the animals at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just doing a job of killing</v>

2016
01:41:58.511 --> 01:42:00.490
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what they do in California with</v>

2017
01:42:00.491 --> 01:42:04.180
<v Speaker 3>the mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievably irresponsible.</v>

2018
01:42:04.181 --> 01:42:08.680
<v Speaker 3>And here's a challenge and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>condemnation for the California fish and</v>

2019
01:42:08.681 --> 01:42:11.620
<v Speaker 3>game society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cod fish and game anymore,</v>

2020
01:42:11.621 --> 01:42:13.210
<v Speaker 3>they call it fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish and wildlife.</v>

2021
01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you go to work everyday,</v>

2022
01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:22.680
<v Speaker 3>violating your oath to wildlife science?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you force the mountain lion and</v>

2023
01:42:23.741 --> 01:42:28.741
<v Speaker 3>the black bear and California into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>liability column as a game warden,</v>

2024
01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:34.260
<v Speaker 3>as a person dedicated to conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you violate your wise use oath</v>

2025
01:42:36.670 --> 01:42:41.130
<v Speaker 3>and turn them out in line and the black</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear into a liability because some dirt</v>

2026
01:42:41.131 --> 01:42:46.000
<v Speaker 3>bag in San Francisco think it's unfair</v>
<v Speaker 3>to use hounds or bait for bear and then</v>

2027
01:42:46.001 --> 01:42:50.620
<v Speaker 3>you have to go in and shoot black bears</v>
<v Speaker 3>with tax dollars and buried them in a</v>

2028
01:42:50.621 --> 01:42:54.100
<v Speaker 3>hole in the ground instead of a family</v>
<v Speaker 3>recreational,</v>

2029
01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:59.420
<v Speaker 3>a resource that you buy licenses and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fees and permits and guides and</v>

2030
01:42:59.711 --> 01:43:01.180
<v Speaker 3>outfitters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hotels,</v>

2031
01:43:01.181 --> 01:43:03.310
<v Speaker 3>food lodging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grocery supplies,</v>

2032
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:05.830
<v Speaker 3>butcher's ice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taxidermists.</v>

2033
01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:10.920
<v Speaker 3>None of that happens because the some</v>
<v Speaker 3>liar has forced the wildlife manager,</v>

2034
01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:17.050
<v Speaker 3>wildlife mismanagement of California to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ban mountain lion hunting.</v>

2035
01:43:17.230 --> 01:43:20.470
<v Speaker 3>While you continue to kill them as</v>
<v Speaker 3>damage control,</v>

2036
01:43:20.530 --> 01:43:22.750
<v Speaker 3>instead of manage them as quality</v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

2037
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Shame on the California wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 3>officers.</v>

2038
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Shame on you for not blowing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whistle.</v>

2039
01:43:28.421 --> 01:43:30.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call me at the FBI,</v>

2040
01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:34.660
<v Speaker 3>how dare you walk into that building</v>
<v Speaker 3>that says j Edgar Hoover over the top</v>

2041
01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:38.290
<v Speaker 3>and not feel a sense of guilt because j</v>
<v Speaker 3>Edgar Hoover was one of the biggest</v>

2042
01:43:38.291 --> 01:43:42.220
<v Speaker 3>criminal punks that ever walked this</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth and now call me is following in</v>

2043
01:43:42.221 --> 01:43:45.010
<v Speaker 3>his footsteps and I challenged my FBI</v>
<v Speaker 3>buddies.</v>

2044
01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:49.200
<v Speaker 3>How did you go all these years without</v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing the whistles on the corruption,</v>

2045
01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:52.190
<v Speaker 3>the power abuse and the criminality by</v>
<v Speaker 3>your so</v>

2046
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:54.950
<v Speaker 1>called leaders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about pussy to</v>

2047
01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.080
<v Speaker 1>comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know enough about what you</v>

2048
01:43:57.081 --> 01:44:01.020
<v Speaker 1>did do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know because he's a liar and he's.</v>

2049
01:44:01.050 --> 01:44:04.700
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a perjurer and he's a felon and he</v>

2050
01:44:04.701 --> 01:44:07.460
<v Speaker 1>had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really angry because I worked with</v>

2051
01:44:07.461 --> 01:44:10.190
<v Speaker 1>the FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had to rely on these guys to cover</v>

2052
01:44:10.191 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 1>my back on on raids and they're great</v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors and they look the other way</v>

2053
01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:17.540
<v Speaker 1>because they're saving their pensions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instead of blowing the whistles on</v>

2054
01:44:17.541 --> 01:44:19.100
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt criminal leaders.</v>

2055
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Damn them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2056
01:44:20.901 --> 01:44:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that relates to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions.</v>

2057
01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Like to bring it all back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corruption is corruption.</v>

2058
01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was saying I don't think it's</v>

2059
01:44:28.851 --> 01:44:32.300
<v Speaker 1>corruption here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife officers that I don't think</v>

2060
01:44:32.301 --> 01:44:35.030
<v Speaker 1>they're getting this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is some that they're</v>

2061
01:44:35.031 --> 01:44:37.800
<v Speaker 1>trying to preserve their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to stick their neck out</v>

2062
01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:41.170
<v Speaker 1>with a very liberal government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2063
01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's.</v>

2064
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:46.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a real problem with education</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this conversation doesn't happen in</v>

2065
01:44:46.371 --> 01:44:49.970
<v Speaker 1>most circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This understanding of balance,</v>

2066
01:44:50.210 --> 01:44:53.450
<v Speaker 1>of nature of that you really do have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage the wardens.</v>

2067
01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:56.630
<v Speaker 1>They know what they studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got degrees in it and they defy it</v>

2068
01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.460
<v Speaker 1>and it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good about permits.</v>

2069
01:44:58.461 --> 01:45:01.580
<v Speaker 1>After the mountain lion is destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars worth of livestock</v>

2070
01:45:01.581 --> 01:45:04.460
<v Speaker 1>and pets and it scared the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and killed people.</v>

2071
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Then they kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill them before they just do the depth.</v>

2072
01:45:07.710 --> 01:45:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Supposed to be quality control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not damage control.</v>

2073
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 1>They know the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've abandoned it and they've gone</v>

2074
01:45:13.041 --> 01:45:16.490
<v Speaker 1>the political correct denial route and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that the mountain lions are not</v>

2075
01:45:16.491 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 1>game animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a lie.</v>

2076
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:23.270
<v Speaker 1>So the California Game Department are</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liars,</v>

2077
01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.700
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With the idea of the mount lines on a</v>

2078
01:45:25.701 --> 01:45:27.740
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animal comes from people that have never</v>

2079
01:45:27.741 --> 01:45:28.660
<v Speaker 1>eaten one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2080
01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:30.980
<v Speaker 1>the estimate backstrap.</v>

2081
01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never eaten one,</v>

2082
01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:35.570
<v Speaker 1>but I know people that have he</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious,</v>

2083
01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:37.620
<v Speaker 1>delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which beautiful p.</v>

2084
01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.970
<v Speaker 1>You hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell that to people and they go,</v>

2085
01:45:38.971 --> 01:45:40.090
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I can bear.</v>

2086
01:45:40.091 --> 01:45:42.710
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't think eat bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat Berries.</v>

2087
01:45:42.711 --> 01:45:44.300
<v Speaker 1>You dirt bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't know this?</v>

2088
01:45:44.301 --> 01:45:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know they're</v>

2089
01:45:45.801 --> 01:45:47.600
<v Speaker 1>idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had conversations with people</v>

2090
01:45:47.601 --> 01:45:51.320
<v Speaker 1>because I'm 100 bears that no one has</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten more mad at me at anything I've</v>

2091
01:45:51.321 --> 01:45:53.360
<v Speaker 1>ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when I killed a bear,</v>

2092
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:54.260
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

2093
01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:57.860
<v Speaker 1>That you pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not pissing off the assholes,</v>

2094
01:45:57.861 --> 01:46:00.050
<v Speaker 1>you're an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's people that don't understand</v>

2095
01:46:00.051 --> 01:46:02.890
<v Speaker 1>what a bear is not around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they don't understand.</v>

2096
01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:06.470
<v Speaker 1>I recommend shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go do a little research and come back</v>

2097
01:46:06.471 --> 01:46:08.150
<v Speaker 1>when you have some knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until then,</v>

2098
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:09.223
<v Speaker 1>suck my dick.</v>

2099
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:12.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to just explain to them what</v>

2100
01:46:12.501 --> 01:46:15.570
<v Speaker 1>it is and I see it over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Refused.</v>

2101
01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:18.340
<v Speaker 1>They refused to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2102
01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.120
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They liked their ignorance.</v>

2103
01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:25.040
<v Speaker 1>They go to maniacal levels to protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ignorance because it feels good</v>

2104
01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:28.040
<v Speaker 1>because it's booboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a tune.</v>

2105
01:46:28.041 --> 01:46:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I respect animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to reduce them to the level</v>

2106
01:46:30.591 --> 01:46:32.630
<v Speaker 1>of a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's also weird too,</v>

2107
01:46:32.631 --> 01:46:37.610
<v Speaker 1>because there was a deprivation permit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was issued for a mountain lion in</v>

2108
01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Malibu because it was killing the got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Alpaca farm and just went fucking</v>

2109
01:46:42.411 --> 01:46:44.890
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 10 Alpaca and Alpaca.</v>

2110
01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:45.793
<v Speaker 1>Yum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2111
01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:47.500
<v Speaker 1>just fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even eat.</v>

2112
01:46:47.501 --> 01:46:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fucked him off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They laid lines to kill.</v>

2113
01:46:49.711 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm a</v>

2114
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.340
<v Speaker 4>big fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a deprivation depredation permit was</v>

2115
01:46:53.341 --> 01:46:55.960
<v Speaker 4>issued so this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They destroyed a bunch of livestock so</v>

2116
01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:00.980
<v Speaker 4>this lady could kill this cat that had</v>
<v Speaker 4>been really qualified,</v>

2117
01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:04.500
<v Speaker 4>so she was going to hire somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then she got all these death</v>

2118
01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:06.570
<v Speaker 4>threats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is hilarious,</v>

2119
01:47:06.571 --> 01:47:08.490
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people say they love animals.</v>

2120
01:47:08.670 --> 01:47:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you obviously don't love these Alpine</v>

2121
01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.370
<v Speaker 4>lions coming in and fucking killing them</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

2122
01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:16.410
<v Speaker 4>The way they die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a slow death because the lion just bites</v>

2123
01:47:16.411 --> 01:47:19.590
<v Speaker 4>them and let them bleed to death and</v>
<v Speaker 4>flop around for a couple hours and then</v>

2124
01:47:19.591 --> 01:47:21.600
<v Speaker 4>goes to the one that's next to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just trying to get away.</v>

2125
01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:26.670
<v Speaker 4>It's the ignorance is staggering and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I continue to fight it.</v>

2126
01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:27.930
<v Speaker 4>It's convenient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2127
01:47:27.931 --> 01:47:29.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we love animals.</v>

2128
01:47:29.251 --> 01:47:30.420
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to kill this mountain</v>
<v Speaker 4>lion.</v>

2129
01:47:30.421 --> 01:47:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well if you love animals,</v>

2130
01:47:32.250 --> 01:47:35.460
<v Speaker 4>you'll let them kill this one mountain</v>
<v Speaker 4>line that's obviously targeting these</v>

2131
01:47:35.490 --> 01:47:37.860
<v Speaker 4>pets because this is not hunting.</v>

2132
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:39.390
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know why they're mountain lion is</v>

2133
01:47:39.391 --> 01:47:42.360
<v Speaker 4>targeting the pests because there's too</v>
<v Speaker 4>many mountain lions and the dominant</v>

2134
01:47:42.361 --> 01:47:46.200
<v Speaker 4>males have run all the other mountain</v>
<v Speaker 4>lions out of ideal habitat into your</v>

2135
01:47:46.201 --> 01:47:49.260
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood because you didn't harvest</v>
<v Speaker 4>the surplus.</v>

2136
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:51.300
<v Speaker 4>Now the surplus is coming into your</v>
<v Speaker 4>home.</v>

2137
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:55.530
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a liability because you were</v>
<v Speaker 4>too stupid to keep it in the asset</v>

2138
01:47:55.531 --> 01:47:58.020
<v Speaker 4>column.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely sinful.</v>

2139
01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:01.980
<v Speaker 4>People have accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a pond over it to hone ranch.</v>

2140
01:48:01.981 --> 01:48:04.560
<v Speaker 4>They have a game camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the trail camera on that pond.</v>

2141
01:48:04.561 --> 01:48:07.290
<v Speaker 4>They got 16 different mountain lions are</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that camera.</v>

2142
01:48:07.330 --> 01:48:09.840
<v Speaker 4>Then they're not allowed to do damn</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and it's hard to find deer.</v>

2143
01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:11.970
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to find deer here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's nothing.</v>

2144
01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:13.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one thing is good people aren't</v>

2145
01:48:13.621 --> 01:48:17.520
<v Speaker 4>dying in car accidents with deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you see a deer in California,</v>

2146
01:48:17.521 --> 01:48:17.990
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

2147
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:19.370
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty rare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

2148
01:48:19.371 --> 01:48:21.950
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fly over California.</v>

2149
01:48:21.951 --> 01:48:23.180
<v Speaker 3>I Love California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2150
01:48:23.181 --> 01:48:25.600
<v Speaker 3>My blood brothers live out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're having the greatest conscience.</v>

2151
01:48:25.610 --> 01:48:29.360
<v Speaker 3>My late last night in San Juan</v>
<v Speaker 3>Capistrano firestorm tonight,</v>

2152
01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:32.660
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow night we're in Pasadena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we'd go to a Gore hills.</v>

2153
01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Clear Rita.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2154
01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:38.900
<v Speaker 3>and then we go to big bear and then we</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to reno and we'd go to Iowa and Ohio</v>

2155
01:48:38.901 --> 01:48:42.110
<v Speaker 3>and Pennsylvania and know we're all over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the country and I fly in a little plane</v>

2156
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:47.270
<v Speaker 3>over the country and it's God's country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wildlife habitat.</v>

2157
01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:52.460
<v Speaker 3>It eternally all across this country and</v>
<v Speaker 3>California is one of the most beautiful</v>

2158
01:48:52.461 --> 01:48:56.780
<v Speaker 3>wilderness states in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because mountain lions have been</v>

2159
01:48:56.990 --> 01:49:00.920
<v Speaker 3>irresponsibly mismanaged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you have a destruction of the</v>

2160
01:49:00.921 --> 01:49:05.870
<v Speaker 3>wildlife in the deer category and those</v>
<v Speaker 3>small game and other game because the</v>

2161
01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.910
<v Speaker 3>mountain lions are in the liability</v>
<v Speaker 3>column.</v>

2162
01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:12.080
<v Speaker 3>If you reduce the mountain lion numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then hunters will pay for the deer</v>

2163
01:49:12.081 --> 01:49:15.830
<v Speaker 3>licenses which pay for the game</v>
<v Speaker 3>departments in the scientists to manage</v>

2164
01:49:15.831 --> 01:49:19.490
<v Speaker 3>the wildlife sea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have balanced California is him</v>

2165
01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:23.510
<v Speaker 3>balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's out of balance because of the lie</v>

2166
01:49:23.511 --> 01:49:28.460
<v Speaker 3>of the animal rights that have effect</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the wildlife officers of this</v>

2167
01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:32.390
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except that bullshit is just a crime.</v>

2168
01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:37.660
<v Speaker 3>They should stand up and go your wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a renewable wildlife research</v>

2169
01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:42.380
<v Speaker 3>resource and we're going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>season on it because now we're killing</v>

2170
01:49:42.381 --> 01:49:44.390
<v Speaker 3>them as damage control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still dying.</v>

2171
01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:46.790
<v Speaker 3>We're killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're taking millions of dollars to</v>

2172
01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 3>compensate the Lama and the</v>

2173
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Alpaca and the cattle and the sheep and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goat and the horse.</v>

2174
01:49:51.330 --> 01:49:54.910
<v Speaker 1>We're millions of dollars compensating</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to kill the lion</v>

2175
01:49:54.911 --> 01:49:56.020
<v Speaker 1>and bury it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2176
01:49:56.021 --> 01:49:57.490
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2177
01:49:57.491 --> 01:50:00.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to spend any money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide game department,</v>

2178
01:50:00.671 --> 01:50:01.840
<v Speaker 1>finances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2179
01:50:01.841 --> 01:50:05.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to go to hotels and travel</v>
<v Speaker 1>and food and lodging and supplies and</v>

2180
01:50:05.741 --> 01:50:09.640
<v Speaker 1>sporting goods and taxidermist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to increase the economy of</v>

2181
01:50:09.641 --> 01:50:11.920
<v Speaker 1>the entire area because of one mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion hunt.</v>

2182
01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:17.040
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take your tax dollars and</v>
<v Speaker 1>compensate all the dead livestock and</v>

2183
01:50:17.291 --> 01:50:20.350
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to hire a guy to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountain lion Joe.</v>

2184
01:50:20.770 --> 01:50:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Dig a hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the we're going to take your</v>

2185
01:50:23.471 --> 01:50:25.390
<v Speaker 1>tax dollars to hire a guy with a front</v>
<v Speaker 1>loader,</v>

2186
01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:30.720
<v Speaker 1>dig a hole and bury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't put this magnificent animal public</v>

2187
01:50:31.151 --> 01:50:33.660
<v Speaker 1>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because of the average person like</v>

2188
01:50:33.810 --> 01:50:34.990
<v Speaker 1>you saved precept chunks.</v>

2189
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:36.880
<v Speaker 1>I have dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not perception.</v>

2190
01:50:36.881 --> 01:50:41.881
<v Speaker 1>It's ignorance and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>this perception that does come from</v>

2191
01:50:42.161 --> 01:50:45.700
<v Speaker 1>ignorance is that we love animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a dog.</v>

2192
01:50:45.701 --> 01:50:47.470
<v Speaker 1>You have dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lived for my.</v>

2193
01:50:47.471 --> 01:50:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have three dogs.</v>

2194
01:50:48.730 --> 01:50:50.170
<v Speaker 1>We love dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't live without them.</v>

2195
01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:51.370
<v Speaker 1>You go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pat them.</v>

2196
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:54.340
<v Speaker 1>People that don't have any interaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever with wildlife.</v>

2197
01:50:54.341 --> 01:50:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Think of animals like they think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their dog.</v>

2198
01:50:56.081 --> 01:50:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anything to document and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you hear about a mountain lion</v>

2199
01:50:58.751 --> 01:50:59.021
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2200
01:50:59.021 --> 01:51:01.270
<v Speaker 1>why would you kill them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Outlined mind you're being cruel,</v>

2201
01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:03.820
<v Speaker 1>like you would only kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Outline if you're one of those dickless</v>

2202
01:51:03.821 --> 01:51:07.420
<v Speaker 1>assholes and once I go to Africa and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot a line and the head mounted on</v>

2203
01:51:07.421 --> 01:51:10.510
<v Speaker 1>your wall just because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the thought process behind</v>

2204
01:51:10.511 --> 01:51:14.950
<v Speaker 1>it and there's no pushback because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>public speaks and then I pushed back in</v>

2205
01:51:14.951 --> 01:51:15.580
<v Speaker 1>the attack.</v>

2206
01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:19.630
<v Speaker 1>They attack you bring it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it up because ignorance bounces</v>

2207
01:51:19.631 --> 01:51:22.150
<v Speaker 1>off of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like personal hygiene from Michael</v>

2208
01:51:22.150 --> 01:51:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Moore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just has no impact whatsoever.</v>

2209
01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:28.930
<v Speaker 1>I think he washes you don't think God</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a.</v>

2210
01:51:29.050 --> 01:51:30.080
<v Speaker 1>What a swine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

2211
01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:33.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a subhuman Mongrel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I ever saw I met him,</v>

2212
01:51:33.011 --> 01:51:34.540
<v Speaker 1>he was in this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a prick.</v>

2213
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:36.290
<v Speaker 1>He's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

2214
01:51:36.291 --> 01:51:38.410
<v Speaker 1>He's a scam artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like gun control.</v>

2215
01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about the fact that he put together</v>

2216
01:51:40.181 --> 01:51:42.850
<v Speaker 1>that move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so documented that Hollywood</v>

2217
01:51:42.851 --> 01:51:47.110
<v Speaker 1>actually gave them an award and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>copied and pasted out of sequence the</v>

2218
01:51:47.111 --> 01:51:50.350
<v Speaker 1>attack on the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlton Heston claiming he was somehow</v>

2219
01:51:50.351 --> 01:51:54.910
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the little child killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>herself with you're paroled felon,</v>

2220
01:51:54.911 --> 01:51:58.120
<v Speaker 1>father's gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they put it out of sequence and</v>

2221
01:51:58.210 --> 01:52:01.750
<v Speaker 1>attributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlton Heston defending such</v>

2222
01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:05.080
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible gun ownership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Moore is a line,</v>

2223
01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:07.780
<v Speaker 1>cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stoned punk,</v>

2224
01:52:07.890 --> 01:52:10.090
<v Speaker 1>as he stoned constantly all day.</v>

2225
01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:13.450
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he used the suppositories.</v>

2226
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do and I.</v>

2227
01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:19.060
<v Speaker 1>He's a punk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has He ever had a conversation?</v>

2228
01:52:19.061 --> 01:52:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2229
01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I was on his TV show and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for ending his TV show</v>

2230
01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:25.510
<v Speaker 1>because he tried to fuck with me and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if you'd noticed you,</v>

2231
01:52:25.630 --> 01:52:28.450
<v Speaker 1>but I'm unfuckable you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck with me.</v>

2232
01:52:28.451 --> 01:52:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat your family tree and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saw dust into your face.</v>

2233
01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Ask Pierce Morgan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like I saw your compensation.</v>

2234
01:52:35.471 --> 01:52:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was arm wrestling a torso.</v>

2235
01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pierce Morgan.</v>

2236
01:52:39.551 --> 01:52:41.290
<v Speaker 1>The problem is he didn't understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>

2237
01:52:41.291 --> 01:52:43.620
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about gun violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't understand how much of</v>

2238
01:52:43.621 --> 01:52:45.440
<v Speaker 1>guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact he knew them.</v>

2239
01:52:45.441 --> 01:52:46.050
<v Speaker 1>He avoided</v>

2240
01:52:46.050 --> 01:52:46.760
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2241
01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus,</v>

2242
01:52:47.801 --> 01:52:50.690
<v Speaker 3>we explain what we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when you say the numbers of gun</v>

2243
01:52:50.691 --> 01:52:53.630
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a giant percentage of murder suicide,</v>

2244
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:57.210
<v Speaker 3>a giant percentage of them are cops</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing bad guys and citizens defendant.</v>

2245
01:52:58.190 --> 01:53:02.660
<v Speaker 3>So all of those are out of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then accidental gun deaths may have</v>

2246
01:53:02.661 --> 01:53:06.020
<v Speaker 3>summarized it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Pierce Morgan fancies himself a</v>

2247
01:53:06.021 --> 01:53:08.780
<v Speaker 3>cookie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather woody limey usually got the</v>

2248
01:53:08.781 --> 01:53:11.270
<v Speaker 3>accent and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny little Matt actually an</v>

2249
01:53:11.271 --> 01:53:12.500
<v Speaker 3>accent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an impediment.</v>

2250
01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:13.521
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2251
01:53:13.521 --> 01:53:16.850
<v Speaker 3>he came out and of course he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take on the motor city madman.</v>

2252
01:53:16.851 --> 01:53:18.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean this guy is going to be easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>pickins.</v>

2253
01:53:18.501 --> 01:53:23.180
<v Speaker 3>He actually wrote Wango tango be all</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually this thing you're doing,</v>

2254
01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:29.520
<v Speaker 3>that's the limey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got manufactured confidence based</v>

2255
01:53:29.631 --> 01:53:33.860
<v Speaker 3>on nothing except an ego that has no</v>
<v Speaker 3>foundation.</v>

2256
01:53:33.861 --> 01:53:35.360
<v Speaker 3>In fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Pierce Morgan,</v>

2257
01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:40.220
<v Speaker 3>the CNN exec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when it's put Pierce Morgan on the</v>

2258
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Motor City Madman in a gun store to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first time you didn't see the first one</v>

2259
01:53:44.541 --> 01:53:46.590
<v Speaker 3>at the CNN officers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best thing.</v>

2260
01:53:46.590 --> 01:53:48.440
<v Speaker 3>Both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best one.</v>

2261
01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:54.370
<v Speaker 3>And so they think I'm a dirt bag and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a goof ball because I not only wrote</v>

2262
01:53:54.741 --> 01:53:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Wang Dang sweet poon Tang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I meant it,</v>

2263
01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:01.700
<v Speaker 3>but when they take me on they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize I never went to college because</v>

2264
01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:05.120
<v Speaker 3>I was too busy learning shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you take me on,</v>

2265
01:54:05.121 --> 01:54:08.390
<v Speaker 3>on any subject that I am even slightly</v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of,</v>

2266
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:13.340
<v Speaker 3>I will fuck you up because I've studied</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>

2267
01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.150
<v Speaker 3>I've lived this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been with guns since I could walk.</v>

2268
01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:22.360
<v Speaker 3>I have had universal unlimited access to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire power my whole life,</v>

2269
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:26.810
<v Speaker 3>both in a recreational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a disciplined,</v>

2270
01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:31.960
<v Speaker 3>a law enforcement military training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just a family plinking competition.</v>

2271
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:37.990
<v Speaker 3>So when every considerable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a imaginable gun use,</v>

2272
01:54:38.690 --> 01:54:42.410
<v Speaker 3>I've been 68 years of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2273
01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:47.740
<v Speaker 3>so they sick Pierce Morgan Ami to teach</v>
<v Speaker 3>me a lesson about how irresponsible gun</v>

2274
01:54:48.441 --> 01:54:50.870
<v Speaker 3>owners are and that if we could just ban</v>
<v Speaker 3>guns,</v>

2275
01:54:50.871 --> 01:54:52.370
<v Speaker 3>that all the violence would end.</v>

2276
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:55.460
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't seen it,</v>

2277
01:54:55.461 --> 01:54:58.070
<v Speaker 3>you got to google it because it was his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his take?</v>

2278
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2279
01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:00.640
<v Speaker 3>I almost fixed them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2280
01:55:02.150 --> 01:55:06.830
<v Speaker 3>because I so overwhelmed them with</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence that they finally research and</v>

2281
01:55:06.831 --> 01:55:10.130
<v Speaker 3>realized that every word out of my mouth</v>
<v Speaker 3>was absolutely indisputable.</v>

2282
01:55:10.131 --> 01:55:11.960
<v Speaker 3>What was most compelling that you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying to him?</v>

2283
01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll summarize it this way.</v>

2284
01:55:13.911 --> 01:55:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Like I did the pierce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The anti gunners have their dream.</v>

2285
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:22.670
<v Speaker 3>It exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It existed in a Paris where all those</v>

2286
01:55:22.671 --> 01:55:24.610
<v Speaker 3>people were shot with coalition of</v>
<v Speaker 3>coughs,</v>

2287
01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:28.040
<v Speaker 3>coalition to costs were banned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have their dream.</v>

2288
01:55:28.041 --> 01:55:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Pierce morgans dream exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called a gun free zone.</v>

2289
01:55:32.090 --> 01:55:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Virginia Tech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbine,</v>

2290
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Sandy Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aurora,</v>

2291
01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Parklin every instance where the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent lives have been,</v>

2292
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:47.250
<v Speaker 2>had been a Nancy Pelosi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maxine waters,</v>

2293
01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Eric holder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton,</v>

2294
01:55:49.951 --> 01:55:54.951
<v Speaker 2>Barack Obama's dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their dream is a gun free zone,</v>

2295
01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.660
<v Speaker 2>but we're free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are forced,</v>

2296
01:55:57.810 --> 01:56:02.810
<v Speaker 2>forced into unarmed helplessness where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most innocent lives are lost and</v>

2297
01:56:03.450 --> 01:56:08.450
<v Speaker 2>that dream has produced more carnage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed lives than anything in the</v>

2298
01:56:09.121 --> 01:56:13.260
<v Speaker 2>world compared to the NRA convention</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you have the highest incidence of</v>

2299
01:56:13.261 --> 01:56:16.530
<v Speaker 2>gun ownership or opening day of deer</v>
<v Speaker 2>season in Michigan where you have 100</v>

2300
01:56:16.531 --> 01:56:19.560
<v Speaker 2>percent gun ownership and access where</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody gets hurt.</v>

2301
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:23.730
<v Speaker 2>So if you know that your dream is a gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>free zone and that's where the most</v>

2302
01:56:23.731 --> 01:56:28.680
<v Speaker 2>innocent lives are lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of demonic dirt bag would</v>

2303
01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:31.350
<v Speaker 2>actually want more?</v>

2304
01:56:31.410 --> 01:56:32.243
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me stop.</v>

2305
01:56:32.410 --> 01:56:35.100
<v Speaker 3>Let me stop being kids position or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody's position.</v>

2306
01:56:35.101 --> 01:56:38.430
<v Speaker 3>On the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would say the real gun free zone</v>

2307
01:56:38.431 --> 01:56:42.120
<v Speaker 3>would be no one having access to the gun</v>
<v Speaker 3>that killed those people in the gun free</v>

2308
01:56:42.121 --> 01:56:43.710
<v Speaker 3>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gun free zone,</v>

2309
01:56:43.770 --> 01:56:47.670
<v Speaker 3>and the real and the real answer to</v>
<v Speaker 3>drownings in America would be the band</v>

2310
01:56:47.671 --> 01:56:50.460
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you work on banning water.</v>

2311
01:56:50.461 --> 01:56:53.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll work on banning guns and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>touch base every few weeks and see how</v>

2312
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:58.260
<v Speaker 3>you can not banned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot eliminate guns.</v>

2313
01:56:58.261 --> 01:57:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Finland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot eliminate guns.</v>

2314
01:57:01.050 --> 01:57:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alberta Canada,</v>

2315
01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:05.010
<v Speaker 3>where the guy who came into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>University of shot everybody up.</v>

2316
01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:07.500
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you do,</v>

2317
01:57:07.501 --> 01:57:12.501
<v Speaker 3>instead of thinking you could ban water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn to swim and watch your children by</v>

2318
01:57:14.011 --> 01:57:15.810
<v Speaker 3>the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call me weird.</v>

2319
01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:20.960
<v Speaker 3>But the way to handle violence is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>carry a gun practice with it.</v>

2320
01:57:21.330 --> 01:57:24.330
<v Speaker 3>And when someone brings lethal force</v>
<v Speaker 3>against you,</v>

2321
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:25.960
<v Speaker 3>shoot the motherfucker.</v>

2322
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:29.920
<v Speaker 3>But people are very uncomfortable with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of any society,</v>

2323
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:31.740
<v Speaker 3>comfortable babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

2324
01:57:31.741 --> 01:57:34.500
<v Speaker 3>you're uncomfortable that go ahead and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bend over and die.</v>

2325
01:57:34.530 --> 01:57:36.750
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying,</v>

2326
01:57:36.751 --> 01:57:39.750
<v Speaker 3>but wouldn't it be better if there</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't any concern that the.</v>

2327
01:57:39.770 --> 01:57:42.150
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea is to somehow enter the</v>

2328
01:57:42.151 --> 01:57:44.370
<v Speaker 3>takeaway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the concern of people being shot</v>

2329
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:48.300
<v Speaker 3>randomly by some psycho that you've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure out if you get all the guns</v>

2330
01:57:48.301 --> 01:57:50.070
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you get all the guns away?</v>

2331
01:57:50.071 --> 01:57:50.821
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2332
01:57:50.821 --> 01:57:52.830
<v Speaker 3>But this is what I'm saying is that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know.</v>

2333
01:57:52.831 --> 01:57:54.430
<v Speaker 3>So let's just start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're not,</v>

2334
01:57:54.730 --> 01:57:57.300
<v Speaker 3>if it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then everybody's got guns to shoot.</v>

2335
01:57:57.301 --> 01:57:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody will not have guns.</v>

2336
01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:00.090
<v Speaker 3>Some people have guns.</v>

2337
01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Some people here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I studied San Bernardino.</v>

2338
01:58:03.150 --> 01:58:05.310
<v Speaker 2>I studied at Aurora.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started at Virginia Tech.</v>

2339
01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I studied columbine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I studied sandy hook.</v>

2340
01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I studied them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know joe and everybody better</v>

2341
01:58:11.221 --> 01:58:14.220
<v Speaker 2>write this down because I'm the only guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will tell you this.</v>

2342
01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:17.640
<v Speaker 2>I've studied the cadence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bullet manufacturers,</v>

2343
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:20.450
<v Speaker 2>the rate of fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movement of the purpose,</v>

2344
01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:25.850
<v Speaker 2>and the movement of the victims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In every instance,</v>

2345
01:58:26.250 --> 01:58:30.040
<v Speaker 2>including in Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Aurora,</v>

2346
01:58:30.250 --> 01:58:32.320
<v Speaker 2>including San Bernardino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>

2347
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:38.310
<v Speaker 2>there were American citizens who would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have had a gun on their person if they</v>

2348
01:58:38.931 --> 01:58:43.931
<v Speaker 2>were allowed to and they could have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>a meaningful force to at least reduce,</v>

2349
01:58:44.201 --> 01:58:48.130
<v Speaker 2>if not terminate the violent murderous</v>
<v Speaker 2>threat,</v>

2350
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:53.550
<v Speaker 2>but by law we have been so dumbed down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forced against our natural</v>

2351
01:58:56.590 --> 01:59:01.590
<v Speaker 2>survival instinct to have a tool on our</v>
<v Speaker 2>belt that in every instance where the</v>

2352
01:59:02.711 --> 01:59:06.490
<v Speaker 2>most innocent lives were slaughtered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people that would have intervened</v>

2353
01:59:06.491 --> 01:59:07.570
<v Speaker 2>with a firearm.</v>

2354
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Not many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a janitor.</v>

2355
01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:11.710
<v Speaker 2>There was a couple of guys in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

2356
01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:14.350
<v Speaker 2>They had concealed weapons permits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't allowed to have in that</v>

2357
01:59:14.351 --> 01:59:16.000
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Virginia Tech,</v>

2358
01:59:16.001 --> 01:59:18.280
<v Speaker 2>there were guys that had concealed</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons permits,</v>

2359
01:59:18.281 --> 01:59:20.170
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't allowed to have them</v>
<v Speaker 2>there in Aurora,</v>

2360
01:59:20.171 --> 01:59:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>

2361
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:24.910
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of people would have had guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could have returned fire,</v>

2362
01:59:24.970 --> 01:59:27.760
<v Speaker 2>but they were forced into unarmed</v>
<v Speaker 2>helplessness.</v>

2363
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the gun debate.</v>

2364
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:32.050
<v Speaker 2>In it's con,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irrefutable conclusion,</v>

2365
01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:37.000
<v Speaker 2>if you are forced into unarmed</v>
<v Speaker 2>helplessness,</v>

2366
01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:42.420
<v Speaker 2>you are unarmed and helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a horrible,</v>

2367
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:47.470
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicidal condition that in.</v>

2368
01:59:47.710 --> 01:59:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a guitar player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

2369
01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I've never been on armed since I</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduated from high school.</v>

2370
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:59.810
<v Speaker 2>I've always had a hanky and a pocket</v>
<v Speaker 2>full of guitar picks and a pocket knife</v>

2371
01:59:59.811 --> 02:00:04.130
<v Speaker 2>and a belt knife and built tool and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pistol and some extra bullets.</v>

2372
02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I just have them everywhere I go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been on armed.</v>

2373
02:00:07.671 --> 02:00:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you travel around?</v>

2374
02:00:12.130 --> 02:00:13.090
<v Speaker 2>I improvise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adapt,</v>

2375
02:00:13.091 --> 02:00:16.570
<v Speaker 2>and overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I luckily I helped pass house resolution</v>

2376
02:00:16.571 --> 02:00:18.760
<v Speaker 2>to 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means all sworn law enforcement</v>

2377
02:00:18.761 --> 02:00:20.800
<v Speaker 2>officer allowed to carry a gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>nationwide.</v>

2378
02:00:21.010 --> 02:00:25.390
<v Speaker 2>I've been a sheriff deputy since 1984</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my credentials allow me to carry a</v>

2379
02:00:25.391 --> 02:00:27.970
<v Speaker 2>gun everywhere I go and I carry a gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere I go.</v>

2380
02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:29.290
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in England,</v>

2381
02:00:29.490 --> 02:00:31.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American law enforcement are allowed to</v>

2382
02:00:31.751 --> 02:00:34.450
<v Speaker 2>carry guns and I carry a gun over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a tool.</v>

2383
02:00:34.570 --> 02:00:36.700
<v Speaker 2>If somebody comes up and we carry a gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>in England.</v>

2384
02:00:36.850 --> 02:00:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat some dirt bag.</v>

2385
02:00:38.801 --> 02:00:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Comes at me with a spike in the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just shoot them,</v>

2386
02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:44.920
<v Speaker 2>but why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's plan b?</v>

2387
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:46.310
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

2388
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:51.310
<v Speaker 4>I agree that it's better to be better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have it and not need it than to need</v>

2389
02:00:51.801 --> 02:00:55.400
<v Speaker 4>it and not to have been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing that we would all like to have</v>

2390
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:58.700
<v Speaker 4>is no school shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no mass shootings,</v>

2391
02:00:58.701 --> 02:01:00.590
<v Speaker 4>no reward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no columbine,</v>

2392
02:01:00.591 --> 02:01:02.180
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how do you stop that?</v>

2393
02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:04.310
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you stopped that with more</v>
<v Speaker 4>guns?</v>

2394
02:01:04.330 --> 02:01:08.030
<v Speaker 4>Where do you think you stopped that with</v>
<v Speaker 4>mental health education,</v>

2395
02:01:08.031 --> 02:01:10.550
<v Speaker 4>figuring out how to get people off of</v>
<v Speaker 4>pills,</v>

2396
02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:13.940
<v Speaker 4>figuring out how to keep people from</v>
<v Speaker 4>living despondent lives where they want</v>

2397
02:01:13.941 --> 02:01:17.750
<v Speaker 4>to just tear it all down and shoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody in her hurt a bunch of people.</v>

2398
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:18.471
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we are.</v>

2399
02:01:18.471 --> 02:01:19.430
<v Speaker 4>That's the route,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2400
02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:20.150
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here we are.</v>

2401
02:01:20.150 --> 02:01:20.190
<v Speaker 4>We are</v>

2402
02:01:20.190 --> 02:01:25.190
<v Speaker 2>2018 so we can't go back in history in</v>
<v Speaker 2>find the goofball from Virginia Tech and</v>

2403
02:01:27.181 --> 02:01:30.930
<v Speaker 2>what motivated him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't go back there because we have</v>

2404
02:01:30.931 --> 02:01:35.931
<v Speaker 2>failed as a society to take care of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people or respond with any sense of</v>

2405
02:01:36.001 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>responsibility or effectiveness to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>glaring</v>

2406
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:45.040
<v Speaker 3>danger signs most outrageously in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Parkland where the guy called the cops</v>

2407
02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:50.160
<v Speaker 3>42 times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called the FBI three times that guys</v>

2408
02:01:50.190 --> 02:01:51.890
<v Speaker 3>going to shoot up the school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2409
02:01:51.891 --> 02:01:52.850
<v Speaker 3>We'll make a note of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2410
02:01:52.851 --> 02:01:55.880
<v Speaker 3>the guy's going to shoot up the school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2411
02:01:55.881 --> 02:01:59.360
<v Speaker 3>We'll make a note of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy is bringing a gun to school to</v>

2412
02:01:59.361 --> 02:02:01.340
<v Speaker 3>shoot people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's his manifesto.</v>

2413
02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:04.850
<v Speaker 3>We've made a note of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you kidding me?</v>

2414
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.840
<v Speaker 3>So now if we go for them to do something</v>
<v Speaker 3>until someone does something which not.</v>

2415
02:02:09.770 --> 02:02:10.351
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2416
02:02:10.351 --> 02:02:12.050
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a failure of law</v>

2417
02:02:12.051 --> 02:02:14.340
<v Speaker 3>enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had put matter.</v>

2418
02:02:14.530 --> 02:02:17.570
<v Speaker 3>It's just a shooting two hours ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

2419
02:02:17.571 --> 02:02:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Another one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five people are dead and multiple people</v>

2420
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:20.720
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where?</v>

2421
02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Annapolis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maryland at a Oh,</v>

2422
02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where no one's allowed to have a gun by</v>

2423
02:02:24.321 --> 02:02:26.410
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maryland to a newsroom and shot a bunch</v>

2424
02:02:26.411 --> 02:02:27.244
<v Speaker 3>of reporters.</v>

2425
02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:29.380
<v Speaker 3>How much cheese?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bit.</v>

2426
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:32.840
<v Speaker 3>It was a gun free zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Annapolis newsroom shooting leaves.</v>

2427
02:02:32.841 --> 02:02:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Five people dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suspect in custody.</v>

2428
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:36.680
<v Speaker 3>A newsroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2429
02:02:37.170 --> 02:02:39.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's my point.</v>

2430
02:02:39.001 --> 02:02:41.510
<v Speaker 3>So I made a newsroom and I'm ready to</v>
<v Speaker 3>rock.</v>

2431
02:02:41.511 --> 02:02:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be sitting where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I figured you got me covered.</v>

2432
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:48.110
<v Speaker 3>My point is is that the cat is already</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the bag,</v>

2433
02:02:48.111 --> 02:02:50.930
<v Speaker 3>but</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not too late.</v>

2434
02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Columbine guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>glaring signals,</v>

2435
02:02:55.851 --> 02:02:58.790
<v Speaker 3>red alarms going off over Virginia Tech</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy.</v>

2436
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Red Alarms going off for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the columbine thing is a difficult</v>

2437
02:03:03.021 --> 02:03:06.560
<v Speaker 3>one because it really hadn't happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>before that no one expected it,</v>

2438
02:03:06.650 --> 02:03:11.650
<v Speaker 3>but the parents walked through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>garage for three years where the bomb</v>

2439
02:03:11.811 --> 02:03:13.940
<v Speaker 3>making materials were on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2440
02:03:13.941 --> 02:03:16.880
<v Speaker 3>they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best parents guys were like zombies.</v>

2441
02:03:16.881 --> 02:03:21.881
<v Speaker 3>These guys were like doper freaks from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bonzai Zulu land maniacs.</v>

2442
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just.</v>

2443
02:03:25.281 --> 02:03:26.330
<v Speaker 3>He's just different.</v>

2444
02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:26.961
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not.</v>

2445
02:03:26.961 --> 02:03:29.600
<v Speaker 3>He's freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to sit down with this guy and</v>

2446
02:03:29.601 --> 02:03:32.270
<v Speaker 3>get him some healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aurora guy told his psychiatrist.</v>

2447
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:35.930
<v Speaker 3>My goal is to shoot as many people as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible and the psychiatrist didn't say</v>

2448
02:03:35.931 --> 02:03:38.420
<v Speaker 3>anything really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on record.</v>

2449
02:03:38.450 --> 02:03:43.130
<v Speaker 3>He said it in numerous visits with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrist that he had threatened his</v>

2450
02:03:43.131 --> 02:03:47.360
<v Speaker 3>golden life was to kill as many people</v>
<v Speaker 3>as possible and he's now got his new ar</v>

2451
02:03:47.361 --> 02:03:50.120
<v Speaker 3>15 to do it with and the psychiatrist</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't say anything.</v>

2452
02:03:50.121 --> 02:03:53.510
<v Speaker 3>I've studied this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to not only see something,</v>

2453
02:03:53.511 --> 02:03:55.610
<v Speaker 3>say something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're missing the part,</v>

2454
02:03:55.611 --> 02:04:00.611
<v Speaker 3>the final part do something when this</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of abberant threatening violent red</v>

2455
02:04:02.271 --> 02:04:07.271
<v Speaker 3>alarm behaviors going off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Inter veen sit down with this kid at the</v>

2456
02:04:07.851 --> 02:04:12.200
<v Speaker 3>first instance when your kid comes home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all glassy eyed and goofy and</v>

2457
02:04:12.201 --> 02:04:16.670
<v Speaker 3>incommunicable and showing weird signs</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the sandy hook guide he had all his</v>

2458
02:04:16.671 --> 02:04:20.680
<v Speaker 3>life and the Aurora guy did all his life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Parkland guys.</v>

2459
02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:24.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm being all staring like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When blinken a sandstorm,</v>

2460
02:04:24.730 --> 02:04:26.930
<v Speaker 3>somebody go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I would.</v>

2461
02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:31.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean in my life with her as musicians</v>
<v Speaker 3>or family members are going,</v>

2462
02:04:31.491 --> 02:04:35.570
<v Speaker 3>are you going to write what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look like you're going to shit</v>

2463
02:04:35.571 --> 02:04:36.321
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2464
02:04:36.321 --> 02:04:38.640
<v Speaker 3>Are you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't have that conversation with</v>

2465
02:04:38.641 --> 02:04:41.430
<v Speaker 3>somebody like the psychiatrist did to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Aurora shooter.</v>

2466
02:04:41.431 --> 02:04:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Didn't mean how do you fix these people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2467
02:04:44.130 --> 02:04:48.090
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying is if you have no gun</v>
<v Speaker 3>free zones and people allowed to have</v>

2468
02:04:48.091 --> 02:04:49.410
<v Speaker 3>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least they'll have an ability to</v>

2469
02:04:49.411 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 3>defend themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

2470
02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:54.270
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do you stop it from happening in</v>

2471
02:04:54.271 --> 02:04:57.060
<v Speaker 3>the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The anti gun people say the way to stop</v>

2472
02:04:57.061 --> 02:05:00.780
<v Speaker 3>it is to have no guns available to</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilians that can do things virtually</v>

2473
02:05:00.781 --> 02:05:02.700
<v Speaker 3>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A porsche.</v>

2474
02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.890
<v Speaker 3>So what we're dealing with just</v>
<v Speaker 3>pragmatically,</v>

2475
02:05:04.891 --> 02:05:09.360
<v Speaker 3>when you look at 300 million people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably 400 million guns,</v>

2476
02:05:09.361 --> 02:05:10.710
<v Speaker 3>but you haven't counted mine yet.</v>

2477
02:05:11.230 --> 02:05:14.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many guns for every guy like you</v>

2478
02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:16.940
<v Speaker 3>that has hundreds of guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2479
02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:19.800
<v Speaker 3>almost everybody I know has hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>guns.</v>

2480
02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:22.250
<v Speaker 3>He just not like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got hundreds of arrows.</v>

2481
02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:25.920
<v Speaker 3>I have four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have thousands of guitars.</v>

2482
02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to be a more assertive,</v>

2483
02:05:31.171 --> 02:05:32.820
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate,</v>

2484
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:36.630
<v Speaker 3>aware society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when we see these glaring</v>

2485
02:05:36.631 --> 02:05:38.520
<v Speaker 3>indicators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're never going to stop it all.</v>

2486
02:05:38.521 --> 02:05:43.440
<v Speaker 3>There's always going to be a evil in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives and you can't stop it.</v>

2487
02:05:43.441 --> 02:05:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Hence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be armed and prepared.</v>

2488
02:05:45.691 --> 02:05:47.310
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not comfortably being</v>
<v Speaker 3>armed,</v>

2489
02:05:47.610 --> 02:05:49.350
<v Speaker 3>by all means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't be.</v>

2490
02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:52.680
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I saw the debate bill marcy or why</v>

2491
02:05:52.681 --> 02:05:54.660
<v Speaker 3>you can't expect every teacher to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>gun.</v>

2492
02:05:54.750 --> 02:05:57.240
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's ever recommended that?</v>

2493
02:05:57.660 --> 02:05:59.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what the anti gun people always</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

2494
02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Why should have everybody should have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine gun just shooting everything.</v>

2495
02:06:03.150 --> 02:06:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty good.</v>

2496
02:06:04.410 --> 02:06:09.410
<v Speaker 3>That quote for quote what I recommended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go to the deep end every time where</v>

2497
02:06:09.871 --> 02:06:13.110
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to make fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they try to make fun of the proposition.</v>

2498
02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should be armed against killers.</v>

2499
02:06:17.190 --> 02:06:20.830
<v Speaker 3>There are people I know everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teachers,</v>

2500
02:06:22.450 --> 02:06:25.370
<v Speaker 3>grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>baggers,</v>

2501
02:06:25.870 --> 02:06:27.700
<v Speaker 3>a name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a walk of life.</v>

2502
02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:29.850
<v Speaker 3>My Weldon Buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mechanic,</v>

2503
02:06:29.851 --> 02:06:31.980
<v Speaker 3>my dentist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my doctor,</v>

2504
02:06:32.150 --> 02:06:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Dr. strapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2505
02:06:33.731 --> 02:06:35.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean they just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pragmatists,</v>

2506
02:06:35.971 --> 02:06:38.340
<v Speaker 3>they're utilitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're self sufficient.</v>

2507
02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:43.640
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did that become an desirable to be</v>

2508
02:06:45.091 --> 02:06:47.700
<v Speaker 3>self sufficient and capable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the problem.</v>

2509
02:06:47.701 --> 02:06:50.310
<v Speaker 3>I think what we're saying is that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have such a gun problem.</v>

2510
02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:53.700
<v Speaker 3>There's so many people in so many guns</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people just want to somehow or</v>

2511
02:06:53.701 --> 02:06:55.800
<v Speaker 3>another they do finish the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2512
02:06:55.801 --> 02:06:57.960
<v Speaker 3>we do not have a gun problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was growing up,</v>

2513
02:06:57.961 --> 02:07:01.290
<v Speaker 3>we had guns in school during the season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rifles,</v>

2514
02:07:01.291 --> 02:07:03.510
<v Speaker 3>shotguns were brought and put in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>lockers.</v>

2515
02:07:03.690 --> 02:07:08.690
<v Speaker 3>There was unlimited ubiquitous access to</v>
<v Speaker 3>firepower throughout my youth.</v>

2516
02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:13.000
<v Speaker 3>No school shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something else has happened and it has</v>

2517
02:07:13.090 --> 02:07:18.090
<v Speaker 3>to do with big farm in the dis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the irresponsible knee jerk,</v>

2518
02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:23.960
<v Speaker 3>a bandage on a gaping wound of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a child showing up at each childlike</v>

2519
02:07:25.831 --> 02:07:27.990
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden they PROZAC,</v>

2520
02:07:27.991 --> 02:07:29.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a Ritalin.</v>

2521
02:07:29.641 --> 02:07:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff turns into a Zombie.</v>

2522
02:07:32.071 --> 02:07:34.110
<v Speaker 3>My dear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dear blood brother,</v>

2523
02:07:34.111 --> 02:07:36.430
<v Speaker 3>cliff Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest</v>

2524
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:41.430
<v Speaker 1>drummer on the planet listened to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did on the Ted nugent album and the</v>

2525
02:07:41.771 --> 02:07:44.440
<v Speaker 1>cat scratch fever album in the free for</v>
<v Speaker 1>all album.</v>

2526
02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:48.580
<v Speaker 1>And the weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy was a god of musicality.</v>

2527
02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:54.300
<v Speaker 1>He became depressed and was prescribed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the incidents of people being</v>

2528
02:07:56.231 --> 02:08:01.231
<v Speaker 1>prescribed a mood controllers in emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>controllers and depression controllers.</v>

2529
02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:08.670
<v Speaker 1>The incidents in the consistency with</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they attempt to go cold Turkey and</v>

2530
02:08:10.690 --> 02:08:13.090
<v Speaker 1>kill themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2531
02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 1>your brain becomes changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes altered.</v>

2532
02:08:17.351 --> 02:08:22.351
<v Speaker 1>Your logic meter is off duty with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals in your system.</v>

2533
02:08:23.530 --> 02:08:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Cliff came home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to get off the PROZAC,</v>

2534
02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:31.810
<v Speaker 1>walked out into the yard screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown his clothes out the window and</v>

2535
02:08:31.811 --> 02:08:36.811
<v Speaker 1>shot himself in the head and Aurora guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the.</v>

2536
02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:41.320
<v Speaker 1>They're all on something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

2537
02:08:41.530 --> 02:08:44.800
<v Speaker 1>It's at and mothers and fathers out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2538
02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Discipline is the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not pharmaceuticals.</v>

2539
02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Conversation is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probing parenting is the answer would.</v>

2540
02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was growing up,</v>

2541
02:08:58.781 --> 02:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>we had a cuckoo's business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a eloise and people showed</v>

2542
02:09:02.221 --> 02:09:06.280
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and an in an antisocial</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

2543
02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>You intervened and you put them in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>institution and even that was a mistake</v>

2544
02:09:12.011 --> 02:09:15.370
<v Speaker 1>because there was always a chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>response instead of a,</v>

2545
02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:20.590
<v Speaker 1>a compassionate response to chemical to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people do or fucked in the head.</v>

2546
02:09:20.591 --> 02:09:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do have to do something.</v>

2547
02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is the argument that there's a</v>

2548
02:09:25.421 --> 02:09:28.690
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that take these</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals and they have no violent</v>

2549
02:09:28.691 --> 02:09:30.370
<v Speaker 1>outbursts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I agree with too,</v>

2550
02:09:30.371 --> 02:09:35.371
<v Speaker 1>but the people that do have violent</v>
<v Speaker 1>outbursts are almost universally on</v>

2551
02:09:35.771 --> 02:09:37.500
<v Speaker 1>something universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2552
02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:40.600
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've said this many times that I</v>

2553
02:09:40.601 --> 02:09:43.510
<v Speaker 1>don't think we have a gun problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have a mental health problem</v>

2554
02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:45.640
<v Speaker 1>disguised as a gun problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>

2555
02:09:45.641 --> 02:09:48.310
<v Speaker 1>because whether it's someone driving a</v>
<v Speaker 1>truck into a crowd of people,</v>

2556
02:09:48.311 --> 02:09:49.480
<v Speaker 1>that's the same thing.</v>

2557
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think after 42 calls to the</v>

2558
02:09:53.231 --> 02:09:56.770
<v Speaker 1>sheriff's department threatening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot the school and three to the FBI,</v>

2559
02:09:57.100 --> 02:10:00.490
<v Speaker 1>do you think the Parkland shooters</v>
<v Speaker 1>should've been visited a little earlier</v>

2560
02:10:00.491 --> 02:10:03.730
<v Speaker 1>than after 42 and three calls of</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening to shoot up the school?</v>

2561
02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the authorities should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to go visit this kid,</v>

2562
02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:11.200
<v Speaker 1>get the guns out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think when you say,</v>

2563
02:10:11.201 --> 02:10:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I am going to shoot up the school in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

2564
02:10:14.650 --> 02:10:19.300
<v Speaker 1>that would be good enough to disqualify</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person from owning a gun?</v>

2565
02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the circumstances were</v>

2566
02:10:21.791 --> 02:10:25.180
<v Speaker 1>with the Parkland kid and I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that the FBI did visit him on one</v>

2567
02:10:25.181 --> 02:10:26.860
<v Speaker 1>occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not good enough.</v>

2568
02:10:26.861 --> 02:10:28.210
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they there.</v>

2569
02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he was peeing on the Alamo</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just being a dirt bag.</v>

2570
02:10:32.441 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 1>He was threatening to kill as many</v>

2571
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:38.480
<v Speaker 3>people as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to me is enough information to</v>

2572
02:10:38.481 --> 02:10:41.750
<v Speaker 3>disarm the guy and probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>institutionalized Murray's and take him</v>

2573
02:10:41.751 --> 02:10:45.830
<v Speaker 3>in for review to a psychiatric ward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At that point,</v>

2574
02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:49.450
<v Speaker 3>you can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kill people yet.</v>

2575
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:53.510
<v Speaker 3>Can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you comfortable with a world where</v>

2576
02:10:53.511 --> 02:10:56.960
<v Speaker 3>there's so much gun violence that</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody just has to be strapped or.</v>

2577
02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.170
<v Speaker 3>No Way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last thing I.</v>

2578
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:02.510
<v Speaker 3>I've said it 100 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say it again on the Joe</v>

2579
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:04.280
<v Speaker 3>Rogan podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Write it down.</v>

2580
02:11:04.610 --> 02:11:09.610
<v Speaker 3>I do not want everyone to carry a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not want everyone to own a gun.</v>

2581
02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't want everyone to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want everyone to have an 850</v>

2582
02:11:17.811 --> 02:11:22.130
<v Speaker 3>horsepower Ford Bronco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want everyone to go on the Joe</v>

2583
02:11:22.130 --> 02:11:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Rogan podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a time and place for</v>

2584
02:11:25.581 --> 02:11:29.660
<v Speaker 3>individuality and individual choices and</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people will always be</v>

2585
02:11:29.661 --> 02:11:31.070
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2586
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:36.020
<v Speaker 3>taken a hook out of a fish's lip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so don't go fishing and if you don't</v>

2587
02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:38.600
<v Speaker 3>feel comfortable around guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by all means,</v>

2588
02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:43.610
<v Speaker 3>just don't have one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those of us that have a hint of</v>

2589
02:11:43.611 --> 02:11:48.320
<v Speaker 3>warrior instinct and rugged boy scout</v>
<v Speaker 3>being prepared,</v>

2590
02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:51.740
<v Speaker 3>desire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't disarm us,</v>

2591
02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.910
<v Speaker 3>we're your best friend with and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

2592
02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:00.440
<v Speaker 3>They're those teachers in all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>school shootings that were teachers that</v>

2593
02:12:00.441 --> 02:12:03.920
<v Speaker 3>would have had a gun but they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>forbidden to and there are instances,</v>

2594
02:12:03.921 --> 02:12:06.830
<v Speaker 3>and this is something that people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are anti gun don't like to talk about,</v>

2595
02:12:06.831 --> 02:12:09.440
<v Speaker 3>but there are instances where trained</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooters have stopped.</v>

2596
02:12:09.650 --> 02:12:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Mass shootings have stopped someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing people.</v>

2597
02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:15.970
<v Speaker 3>It's theirs and let me come in on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>train while I.</v>

2598
02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:18.040
<v Speaker 3>As long as they get training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's let's,</v>

2599
02:12:18.070 --> 02:12:23.070
<v Speaker 3>let's squash that myth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Old fat Jewish lady in New York City</v>

2600
02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:26.600
<v Speaker 3>back in the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was robbed at gunpoint at knife</v>

2601
02:12:26.601 --> 02:12:29.270
<v Speaker 3>point over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember when they had like 2000 murders</v>

2602
02:12:29.271 --> 02:12:32.480
<v Speaker 3>a year in man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just runaway mayhem.</v>

2603
02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:36.050
<v Speaker 3>She was getting upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wanted to get a pistol and she went</v>

2604
02:12:36.051 --> 02:12:37.760
<v Speaker 3>to the police station.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get permanent.</v>

2605
02:12:37.761 --> 02:12:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry we don't give permission,</v>

2606
02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:41.660
<v Speaker 3>but I had been robbed all these times.</v>

2607
02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:44.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He comes back all the time.</v>

2608
02:12:44.571 --> 02:12:46.820
<v Speaker 3>A guy had his good points gun once my</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you can't have a gun.</v>

2610
02:12:49.670 --> 02:12:53.840
<v Speaker 3>So she was frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a documented case and so she</v>

2611
02:12:53.841 --> 02:12:56.090
<v Speaker 3>went to uncle Joe and uncle John.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I need a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy Keeps dumps.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm a row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got Her a revolver.</v>

2615
02:13:02.210 --> 02:13:03.500
<v Speaker 3>She'd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it.</v>

2616
02:13:03.501 --> 02:13:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Just put it under the kind of scared</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I don't like guns.</v>

2617
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Never fired it in her life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No training.</v>

2618
02:13:09.410 --> 02:13:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Had no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she knew which,</v>

2619
02:13:11.090 --> 02:13:13.790
<v Speaker 3>which end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bullet came out of next time she was</v>

2620
02:13:13.791 --> 02:13:15.290
<v Speaker 3>robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She shot the son of a bitch.</v>

2621
02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:18.590
<v Speaker 3>She knew what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knows the trigger and the training.</v>

2622
02:13:18.591 --> 02:13:21.380
<v Speaker 3>She one shot the guy that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>threatening her life.</v>

2623
02:13:21.530 --> 02:13:24.980
<v Speaker 3>Now they put her in jail initially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slake,</v>

2624
02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:29.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie gets a defendant in his life,</v>

2625
02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:32.880
<v Speaker 3>but eventually the charges were dropped</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was clear and present.</v>

2626
02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:37.880
<v Speaker 3>She was defending herself from an</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineered recidivistic write that down,</v>

2627
02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:43.640
<v Speaker 3>engineered recidivistic the system in</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowingly and intentionally lets out,</v>

2628
02:13:44.710 --> 02:13:48.030
<v Speaker 3>knife and stabbers and rapists and</v>
<v Speaker 3>murderers and child molesters.</v>

2629
02:13:48.150 --> 02:13:50.460
<v Speaker 3>They keep letting them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the people.</v>

2630
02:13:50.461 --> 02:13:52.920
<v Speaker 3>90 six percent of the time that commit</v>
<v Speaker 3>the violent.</v>

2631
02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:55.190
<v Speaker 3>When you say engineered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think they do that because of</v>

2632
02:13:55.191 --> 02:13:56.300
<v Speaker 3>prison?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Overpopulation,</v>

2633
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:59.820
<v Speaker 3>lack of funds to do it because they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>society to be dangerous.</v>

2634
02:14:00.210 --> 02:14:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine how the engineered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine that anything is just in</v>

2635
02:14:05.101 --> 02:14:10.101
<v Speaker 3>competence and incompetence and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fusion of responsibility for the</v>

2636
02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:13.410
<v Speaker 3>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bureaucratic.</v>

2637
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Institutionalized irresponsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2638
02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:19.680
<v Speaker 3>and corruption and abusive party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to deal with it.</v>

2639
02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of resource.</v>

2640
02:14:21.210 --> 02:14:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Cut them a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They only shot three people.</v>

2641
02:14:22.951 --> 02:14:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Let's I get them on jaywalking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2642
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:28.860
<v Speaker 3>We'll cut them a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He only serve six years of his life</v>

2643
02:14:28.861 --> 02:14:30.120
<v Speaker 3>sentence for killing those people.</v>

2644
02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:33.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean it happens all the time and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys on the street and he kills</v>

2645
02:14:33.301 --> 02:14:34.134
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>

2646
02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:35.700
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had an arrest record,</v>

2647
02:14:35.701 --> 02:14:37.770
<v Speaker 3>goes back to his youth and it was 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>pages lie.</v>

2648
02:14:37.771 --> 02:14:38.850
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let him out.</v>

2649
02:14:38.851 --> 02:14:39.684
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we let them out.</v>

2650
02:14:39.870 --> 02:14:41.370
<v Speaker 3>We knew we killed people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2651
02:14:41.371 --> 02:14:43.290
<v Speaker 3>he stabbed two people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he missed the artery.</v>

2652
02:14:43.291 --> 02:14:46.380
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to let them out and see</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he can study anatomy enough and get a</v>

2653
02:14:46.381 --> 02:14:50.160
<v Speaker 3>good stab next time that our court</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems are a joke.</v>

2654
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Our prison system is a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2655
02:14:54.151 --> 02:14:56.760
<v Speaker 3>if somebody stabbed somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want him?</v>

2656
02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:59.700
<v Speaker 3>You want him on the street with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he stabbed somebody,</v>

2657
02:14:59.701 --> 02:15:01.950
<v Speaker 3>you are killing that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just shitty at it.</v>

2658
02:15:02.610 --> 02:15:05.430
<v Speaker 3>If you shoot at somebody in your miss</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's murder,</v>

2659
02:15:05.431 --> 02:15:07.470
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just bad at it.</v>

2660
02:15:07.770 --> 02:15:10.110
<v Speaker 3>If you're willing to just throw a bullet</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a human being,</v>

2661
02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:12.660
<v Speaker 3>I want him in a cage forever or better</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>

2662
02:15:12.690 --> 02:15:15.810
<v Speaker 3>dead right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if he's capable of taking an</v>

2663
02:15:15.811 --> 02:15:18.780
<v Speaker 3>innocent life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want him out of the gene pool.</v>

2664
02:15:19.050 --> 02:15:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2665
02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:21.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2666
02:15:21.570 --> 02:15:24.210
<v Speaker 3>how did I put it in that one interview?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2667
02:15:24.211 --> 02:15:28.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in repeat crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Repeat criminals.</v>

2668
02:15:28.381 --> 02:15:32.010
<v Speaker 3>I believe in dead criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone threatens innocent life,</v>

2669
02:15:32.610 --> 02:15:35.400
<v Speaker 3>get him Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that.</v>

2670
02:15:35.401 --> 02:15:37.440
<v Speaker 3>And you know who the best person to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>that decision is?</v>

2671
02:15:37.710 --> 02:15:40.830
<v Speaker 3>The person that bought to get stamped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lady bought to get raped.</v>

2672
02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:44.430
<v Speaker 3>The gigabyte to get shot at this all</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes sense.</v>

2673
02:15:44.490 --> 02:15:44.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2674
02:15:44.881 --> 02:15:48.600
<v Speaker 3>I feel what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the real problem is why does it</v>

2675
02:15:48.601 --> 02:15:51.180
<v Speaker 3>happen in the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we're a society that doesn't</v>

2676
02:15:51.181 --> 02:15:56.181
<v Speaker 3>respond to alarming signals in the hope</v>
<v Speaker 3>of not hurting feelings instead of</v>

2677
02:15:56.371 --> 02:16:01.371
<v Speaker 3>saving lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a liberal mantra of a feel good</v>

2678
02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:06.860
<v Speaker 3>inaction versus tough choices and harsh</v>
<v Speaker 3>choices that will actually save lives.</v>

2679
02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:10.020
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think it's also a lack of</v>
<v Speaker 3>resources to.</v>

2680
02:16:10.021 --> 02:16:14.220
<v Speaker 3>And a lack of these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewing these psychos before they</v>

2681
02:16:14.221 --> 02:16:15.780
<v Speaker 3>snap based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>

2682
02:16:15.781 --> 02:16:18.480
<v Speaker 3>psychology based on my tax bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2683
02:16:18.481 --> 02:16:21.690
<v Speaker 3>I think they have the resources is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>mismanaged and wasted.</v>

2684
02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:23.430
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while we're doing this,</v>

2685
02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:27.060
<v Speaker 3>can I hit the bathroom real quick before</v>
<v Speaker 3>I squirmed out of here?</v>

2686
02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Can I never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This will be right back</v>

2687
02:16:30.050 --> 02:16:31.390
<v Speaker 4>and I came in here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will stay here.</v>

2688
02:16:31.391 --> 02:16:32.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

2689
02:16:32.441 --> 02:16:34.480
<v Speaker 4>You're walking fantastic on those robot</v>
<v Speaker 4>knees,</v>

2690
02:16:34.481 --> 02:16:36.250
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2691
02:16:39.470 --> 02:16:41.740
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how few people can hold</v>
<v Speaker 4>their pis.</v>

2692
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:44.190
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it comes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2693
02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:45.860
<v Speaker 4>He's got to waterstone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2694
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:47.580
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he slammed to waters this.</v>

2695
02:16:47.730 --> 02:16:52.550
<v Speaker 4>A shooting happening while he's on is so</v>
<v Speaker 4>appropriate.</v>

2696
02:16:53.010 --> 02:16:53.811
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so,</v>

2697
02:16:53.811 --> 02:16:55.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy that this,</v>

2698
02:16:55.620 --> 02:16:58.180
<v Speaker 4>this is the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is a newsroom wide.</v>

2699
02:16:58.181 --> 02:17:00.160
<v Speaker 4>They got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do they have a motivation for this guy?</v>

2700
02:17:00.450 --> 02:17:03.030
<v Speaker 5>No motivation is being interrogated</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now is what I just read.</v>

2701
02:17:03.210 --> 02:17:04.043
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2702
02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:08.730
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing that these guys want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get captured but they don't get</v>

2703
02:17:08.731 --> 02:17:12.540
<v Speaker 4>killed like the Parkland kid and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these people like how are they</v>

2704
02:17:12.541 --> 02:17:15.000
<v Speaker 4>not killing these people when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's happening.</v>

2705
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:17.020
<v Speaker 5>Supposedly a white guy in his twenties.</v>

2706
02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:20.500
<v Speaker 4>Is it some fake news thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2707
02:17:20.501 --> 02:17:22.590
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he shot reporters,</v>

2708
02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:23.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2709
02:17:23.490 --> 02:17:27.220
<v Speaker 5>until the interrogation comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's not fair to say,</v>

2710
02:17:27.221 --> 02:17:30.010
<v Speaker 5>but there are people pointing at things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that have been in the news recently.</v>

2711
02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:31.570
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck.</v>

2712
02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:34.370
<v Speaker 4>It's just so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2713
02:17:34.430 --> 02:17:38.180
<v Speaker 4>I hear what Ted's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you should be able to defend</v>

2714
02:17:38.181 --> 02:17:39.590
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I agree.</v>

2715
02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:44.150
<v Speaker 4>Like if you were in a grocery store</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere and some guy came in shooting</v>

2716
02:17:44.151 --> 02:17:46.490
<v Speaker 4>and you had a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would want you to be able to defend</v>

2717
02:17:46.491 --> 02:17:48.440
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2718
02:17:48.441 --> 02:17:51.150
<v Speaker 4>I want you to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

2719
02:17:51.151 --> 02:17:54.860
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's the only way.</v>

2720
02:17:54.861 --> 02:17:56.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or is it just what we have to do right</v>

2721
02:17:56.991 --> 02:17:57.950
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2722
02:17:57.951 --> 02:18:01.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what anybody on the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>side wants other than taking away</v>

2723
02:18:01.641 --> 02:18:04.710
<v Speaker 4>everyone's guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you take away everyone's guns,</v>

2724
02:18:05.130 --> 02:18:08.520
<v Speaker 4>how are we possibly going to do an audit</v>
<v Speaker 4>of 300 million guns in this country?</v>

2725
02:18:08.521 --> 02:18:10.190
<v Speaker 4>How are you going to find all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal ones?</v>

2726
02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:11.730
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to find all the stored</v>
<v Speaker 4>ones?</v>

2727
02:18:11.970 --> 02:18:13.620
<v Speaker 4>And then there's that old cliche.</v>

2728
02:18:13.860 --> 02:18:16.260
<v Speaker 4>If you outlaw guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only outlaws will have guns.</v>

2729
02:18:16.261 --> 02:18:18.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's almost like the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about when it,</v>

2730
02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:23.950
<v Speaker 4>in terms of legalizing illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal drugs and when drugs are legal,</v>

2731
02:18:25.081 --> 02:18:28.590
<v Speaker 4>they can be taxed and you can make sense</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the situation.</v>

2732
02:18:28.591 --> 02:18:30.960
<v Speaker 4>You can have treatment centers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stigma of,</v>

2733
02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:31.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2734
02:18:31.621 --> 02:18:33.930
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the appeal of them of doing something</v>

2735
02:18:33.931 --> 02:18:37.470
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to do is no longer</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and then you're not funding these</v>

2736
02:18:37.471 --> 02:18:41.190
<v Speaker 4>illegal organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Organizations like the cartels in Mexico</v>

2737
02:18:41.191 --> 02:18:46.191
<v Speaker 4>or back when it was organized crime in</v>
<v Speaker 4>America for alcohol when the prohibition</v>

2738
02:18:48.111 --> 02:18:49.300
<v Speaker 4>was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2739
02:18:49.650 --> 02:18:54.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>able to take away all these guns,</v>

2740
02:18:55.350 --> 02:18:57.990
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know what the argument I</v>
<v Speaker 4>would like to talk to somebody who has</v>

2741
02:18:57.991 --> 02:19:01.800
<v Speaker 4>an argument that you could do it because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know they did it in Australia,</v>

2742
02:19:02.370 --> 02:19:06.150
<v Speaker 4>but Australia so small and by the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get guns in Australia.</v>

2743
02:19:06.151 --> 02:19:08.070
<v Speaker 4>People use guns for hunting all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2744
02:19:08.071 --> 02:19:12.240
<v Speaker 4>So guns are available and occasionally</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do have gun violence but they had</v>

2745
02:19:12.241 --> 02:19:15.750
<v Speaker 4>like one mass shooting in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 4>nineties in Australia and they just</v>

2746
02:19:15.751 --> 02:19:17.700
<v Speaker 4>banned all the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Australians,</v>

2747
02:19:17.701 --> 02:19:22.701
<v Speaker 4>are there a different culture too?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this fucking culture is gun happy</v>

2748
02:19:22.981 --> 02:19:27.770
<v Speaker 4>from all of our movies and television</v>
<v Speaker 4>shows and the solution is like bang,</v>

2749
02:19:27.771 --> 02:19:28.371
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bang.</v>

2750
02:19:28.371 --> 02:19:30.620
<v Speaker 4>Like shooting people as a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>solution.</v>

2751
02:19:33.170 --> 02:19:34.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2752
02:19:35.210 --> 02:19:36.043
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2753
02:19:36.050 --> 02:19:38.090
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one has an answer.</v>

2754
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:40.640
<v Speaker 4>There's no one on that side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one on this side.</v>

2755
02:19:40.641 --> 02:19:44.240
<v Speaker 4>Every answer has holes in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're laughing.</v>

2756
02:19:44.241 --> 02:19:46.860
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our Pis,</v>

2757
02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:48.970
<v Speaker 4>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2758
02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:53.980
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always say to this conversation about</v>

2759
02:19:54.951 --> 02:19:55.731
<v Speaker 4>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2760
02:19:55.731 --> 02:19:57.890
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't see an answer.</v>

2761
02:19:57.930 --> 02:19:58.850
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't.</v>

2762
02:19:58.851 --> 02:20:01.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't see an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ultimately will be like,</v>

2763
02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:04.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm all for responsible gun ownership.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have guns,</v>

2764
02:20:04.281 --> 02:20:06.710
<v Speaker 4>I've hunted with guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in gun ownership,</v>

2765
02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:09.200
<v Speaker 4>but how do you stop gun violence?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know.</v>

2766
02:20:09.201 --> 02:20:11.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the answer is and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think this is ultimately what everybody</v>

2767
02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:14.360
<v Speaker 4>is trying to find.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about when you were</v>

2768
02:20:14.361 --> 02:20:15.980
<v Speaker 4>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Australians were,</v>

2769
02:20:15.981 --> 02:20:19.490
<v Speaker 4>they banned guns because of one mass</v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting and they've never had a mass</v>

2770
02:20:19.491 --> 02:20:21.020
<v Speaker 4>shooting sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but doesn't.</v>

2771
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Crime continues to go up and down based</v>
<v Speaker 4>on other social factors and there's not</v>

2772
02:20:26.001 --> 02:20:28.070
<v Speaker 4>many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's only 20 million people in the</v>

2773
02:20:28.071 --> 02:20:28.904
<v Speaker 4>entire country</v>

2774
02:20:29.650 --> 02:20:33.940
<v Speaker 2>to address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably the glaring beast in the room</v>

2775
02:20:34.270 --> 02:20:37.730
<v Speaker 2>of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're 50 something,</v>

2776
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:39.110
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>

2777
02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:42.170
<v Speaker 2>51 in August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be 70 and I've had a pretty good</v>

2778
02:20:42.171 --> 02:20:46.160
<v Speaker 2>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a pretty good absorption factor of</v>

2779
02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:47.510
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence,</v>

2780
02:20:47.511 --> 02:20:50.210
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

2781
02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:53.540
<v Speaker 2>opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>activities,</v>

2782
02:20:56.570 --> 02:21:01.570
<v Speaker 2>what the hell happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would allow Americans so many of us</v>

2783
02:21:04.510 --> 02:21:09.510
<v Speaker 2>to become so evil that we want to hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and kill each other and</v>

2784
02:21:12.250 --> 02:21:15.760
<v Speaker 4>it killed children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rob in and molests so want to make the</v>

2785
02:21:15.761 --> 02:21:19.230
<v Speaker 4>biggest impact that hurt the most people</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're hurt.</v>

2786
02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Doing what w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>

2787
02:21:20.491 --> 02:21:20.911
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>

2788
02:21:20.911 --> 02:21:21.410
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>

2789
02:21:21.410 --> 02:21:26.410
<v Speaker 2>w where did that delineation from a post</v>
<v Speaker 2>World War,</v>

2790
02:21:26.470 --> 02:21:31.470
<v Speaker 2>two celebration of the freedoms that</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated our armed forces to defeat the</v>

2791
02:21:32.531 --> 02:21:37.531
<v Speaker 2>worst evil on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese Slaughters and the Nazi</v>

2792
02:21:39.550 --> 02:21:44.550
<v Speaker 2>devils that it was our constitution and</v>
<v Speaker 2>our individual rights that motivated</v>

2793
02:21:47.021 --> 02:21:50.110
<v Speaker 2>these guys to fight harder and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a martial artist.</v>

2794
02:21:50.111 --> 02:21:55.111
<v Speaker 2>You have to see beyond the contest and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you don't,</v>

2795
02:21:55.990 --> 02:21:58.300
<v Speaker 2>you don't make your hit where you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hit.</v>

2796
02:21:58.870 --> 02:22:01.300
<v Speaker 2>You want your hit to go past where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to hit.</v>

2797
02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:08.120
<v Speaker 2>We were a united nation in 1946,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

2798
02:22:08.131 --> 02:22:12.720
<v Speaker 2>47 and certainly right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>48 when I was born in Detroit was the</v>

2799
02:22:12.721 --> 02:22:15.930
<v Speaker 2>work ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity epicenter of planet Earth,</v>

2800
02:22:16.020 --> 02:22:21.020
<v Speaker 2>universally known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were the war machine that built the</v>

2801
02:22:21.301 --> 02:22:23.280
<v Speaker 2>tanks and the bombers and the planes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2802
02:22:23.850 --> 02:22:26.090
<v Speaker 2>and pride ownership and,</v>

2803
02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:30.660
<v Speaker 3>and you got up early and you busted your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass to be the best that you can be and</v>

2804
02:22:30.661 --> 02:22:35.661
<v Speaker 3>you kept your yard good and you kept</v>
<v Speaker 3>your house clean and you earn your own</v>

2805
02:22:35.941 --> 02:22:38.250
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was an embarrassment not to earn</v>

2806
02:22:38.251 --> 02:22:42.690
<v Speaker 3>your own way and you save for a rainy</v>
<v Speaker 3>day and you live within your means and</v>

2807
02:22:42.930 --> 02:22:44.270
<v Speaker 3>you discipline yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

2808
02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:46.590
<v Speaker 3>my upbringing was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wasn't poverty.</v>

2809
02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:49.800
<v Speaker 3>I was never in need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you couldn't drink a whole coke.</v>

2810
02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:52.320
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't buy something because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted it.</v>

2811
02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:55.170
<v Speaker 3>You needed some socks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She probably got them for Christmas.</v>

2812
02:22:55.660 --> 02:22:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if I wanted an Arrow,</v>

2813
02:22:58.351 --> 02:22:59.790
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2814
02:22:59.850 --> 02:23:03.630
<v Speaker 3>go to the pickup garbage and try to sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>golf balls back and,</v>

2815
02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:05.070
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bought,</v>

2816
02:23:05.130 --> 02:23:09.190
<v Speaker 3>get deposits on bottles and cans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

2817
02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:12.750
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the rugged individualism,</v>

2818
02:23:13.130 --> 02:23:16.560
<v Speaker 3>the self sufficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neighborliness,</v>

2819
02:23:16.561 --> 02:23:20.340
<v Speaker 3>the giving and caring and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it did take a village.</v>

2820
02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:23.340
<v Speaker 3>It started with family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you cared about your neighbors and</v>

2821
02:23:23.341 --> 02:23:28.050
<v Speaker 3>you watched over each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I saw and with all due respect,</v>

2822
02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:33.500
<v Speaker 3>when the beatniks and the dope and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hippies and the disconnect and a</v>

2823
02:23:35.371 --> 02:23:40.371
<v Speaker 3>carelessness erupted and and a meanness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started seeing more meanness and anger</v>

2824
02:23:44.971 --> 02:23:49.971
<v Speaker 3>and and disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after whether it was the new</v>

2825
02:23:50.491 --> 02:23:55.491
<v Speaker 3>deal or the great society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which kind of incentivized not being the</v>

2826
02:23:56.731 --> 02:23:59.730
<v Speaker 3>best that you can be and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually stay home and get a check.</v>

2827
02:23:59.731 --> 02:24:04.731
<v Speaker 3>And I'm the unions would negotiate not</v>
<v Speaker 3>unquality automobiles but money that may</v>

2828
02:24:06.691 --> 02:24:09.210
<v Speaker 3>or may not be there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we'll get you some more money and</v>

2829
02:24:09.211 --> 02:24:11.340
<v Speaker 3>you can make Chrysler's that won't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>start.</v>

2830
02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:14.460
<v Speaker 3>It can't even drive them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're such a pile of shit.</v>

2831
02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.840
<v Speaker 3>And I saw this Detroit go from this</v>
<v Speaker 3>glowing</v>

2832
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:25.790
<v Speaker 3>epicenter of goodwill and decency and</v>
<v Speaker 3>work ethic to Liberal Democrats,</v>

2833
02:24:27.870 --> 02:24:31.620
<v Speaker 3>scamming people and bribing people for</v>
<v Speaker 3>votes by getting you something you</v>

2834
02:24:31.621 --> 02:24:32.340
<v Speaker 3>didn't know.</v>

2835
02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:37.340
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden the city burned</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and no age couches in the street</v>

2836
02:24:39.481 --> 02:24:44.481
<v Speaker 3>and refrigerators on the lawns and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just turned into a lump I shit and it</v>

2837
02:24:46.290 --> 02:24:49.860
<v Speaker 3>breaks my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go downtown Detroit now and building</v>

2838
02:24:49.861 --> 02:24:54.150
<v Speaker 3>the beautiful architecture still boarded</v>
<v Speaker 3>up from the 67 riots.</v>

2839
02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I took my kids down for the 42nd</v>
<v Speaker 3>anniversary of the Amboy Dukes and I</v>

2840
02:24:58.531 --> 02:25:02.760
<v Speaker 3>wanted to show him this beautiful city I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was raised in and what happened to it?</v>

2841
02:25:02.940 --> 02:25:06.990
<v Speaker 3>And almost for dramatic effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like Cecil B de Mille was,</v>

2842
02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:10.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>directing a scene for me to emphasize</v>

2843
02:25:10.530 --> 02:25:14.940
<v Speaker 3>how deteriorated Detroit got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's this guy in a sidewalk with his</v>

2844
02:25:14.941 --> 02:25:18.440
<v Speaker 3>pants down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a dump in the middle of the after</v>

2845
02:25:18.441 --> 02:25:19.710
<v Speaker 3>known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

2846
02:25:19.711 --> 02:25:21.840
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't actually hire that guy.</v>

2847
02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:23.220
<v Speaker 3>That's really what's happened.</v>

2848
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:29.010
<v Speaker 4>So if you allow your society to crumble</v>
<v Speaker 4>before your eyes without intervening and</v>

2849
02:25:30.521 --> 02:25:30.941
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2850
02:25:30.941 --> 02:25:32.490
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go,</v>

2851
02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:33.400
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that.</v>

2852
02:25:33.410 --> 02:25:35.080
<v Speaker 4>I've done it with my musicians all my</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2853
02:25:35.081 --> 02:25:36.120
<v Speaker 4>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God demo.</v>

2854
02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:40.450
<v Speaker 4>We were really rocking last week and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're all stoned and can't even wake</v>

2855
02:25:40.451 --> 02:25:42.190
<v Speaker 4>you up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't you think that when you're</v>

2856
02:25:42.191 --> 02:25:44.410
<v Speaker 4>talking about 1946,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States,</v>

2857
02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:49.500
<v Speaker 4>we were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were all against the Nazis and the</v>

2858
02:25:50.291 --> 02:25:53.790
<v Speaker 4>Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were united certainly that are our</v>

2859
02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:57.040
<v Speaker 4>lives were threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world's future was threatened and</v>

2860
02:25:57.041 --> 02:25:58.840
<v Speaker 4>people felt like they had a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Purpose.</v>

2861
02:25:59.140 --> 02:26:00.700
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in.</v>

2862
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.660
<v Speaker 4>I was in New York right after September</v>
<v Speaker 4>11 and one of the credit and something</v>

2863
02:26:04.661 --> 02:26:06.450
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A friend of mine fainted and we had to</v>

2864
02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:11.460
<v Speaker 4>call the fire department.</v>
<v Speaker 4>EMT showed up and the respect and the</v>

2865
02:26:12.431 --> 02:26:15.490
<v Speaker 4>happiness that people had when they saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first responders,</v>

2866
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:16.600
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>

2867
02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:18.670
<v Speaker 4>This is fascinating because I lived in</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York.</v>

2868
02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:22.300
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a high point because people had</v>

2869
02:26:22.301 --> 02:26:25.330
<v Speaker 4>felt what it was like to be attacked to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be at war.</v>

2870
02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was what the attack and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trade Center,</v>

2871
02:26:28.490 --> 02:26:30.700
<v Speaker 4>the Twin Towers was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were at war.</v>

2872
02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:33.610
<v Speaker 4>They felt this and they felt united</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of it,</v>

2873
02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:37.750
<v Speaker 4>and when these people showed up to help,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were excited to see them.</v>

2874
02:26:37.751 --> 02:26:40.780
<v Speaker 4>They were like heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They treated them like real heroes and I</v>

2875
02:26:40.781 --> 02:26:42.280
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a different feeling than</v>

2876
02:26:42.281 --> 02:26:46.240
<v Speaker 4>anything I've had before and I had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to imagine that this was probably</v>

2877
02:26:46.241 --> 02:26:49.780
<v Speaker 4>what it was like in the United States in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the forties fixture in the middle of the</v>

2878
02:26:49.781 --> 02:26:54.781
<v Speaker 4>war when people were united working</v>
<v Speaker 4>together to make sure there was enough</v>

2879
02:26:55.151 --> 02:26:58.750
<v Speaker 4>scrap metal and enough rubber and there</v>
<v Speaker 4>were car pooling so that they have</v>

2880
02:26:58.751 --> 02:27:03.751
<v Speaker 4>enough raw materials to create twine and</v>
<v Speaker 4>rubber bands for the workout.</v>

2881
02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:07.810
<v Speaker 4>People felt sacrificing for the benefit</v>
<v Speaker 4>of their society.</v>

2882
02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:09.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they felt like there was something</v>

2883
02:27:09.971 --> 02:27:13.330
<v Speaker 4>real going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas when there's no threat and no</v>

2884
02:27:13.331 --> 02:27:15.910
<v Speaker 4>worries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people get lost.</v>

2885
02:27:16.210 --> 02:27:18.340
<v Speaker 4>I think especially people with no</v>
<v Speaker 4>discipline.</v>

2886
02:27:18.341 --> 02:27:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Not Everybody of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some it's.</v>

2887
02:27:20.260 --> 02:27:23.680
<v Speaker 4>There's a tendency to get lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then there's a tendency for people to</v>

2888
02:27:23.681 --> 02:27:25.450
<v Speaker 4>take advantage of those people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost and say,</v>

2889
02:27:25.451 --> 02:27:28.060
<v Speaker 4>it's not your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the government's fault and the</v>

2890
02:27:28.061 --> 02:27:31.210
<v Speaker 4>government needs to pay you and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government needs to help out so wrong,</v>

2891
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:36.100
<v Speaker 4>but there's this very strange tendency</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people have and also if I may</v>

2892
02:27:36.101 --> 02:27:37.570
<v Speaker 4>exalt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here I am with Joe Rogan.</v>

02:29:11.121 --> 02:29:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Kickers who sacrifice and take risks and</v>

2919
02:29:16.011 --> 02:29:20.420
<v Speaker 3>down in the arena and stand up and brush</v>

<v Speaker 3>But those that do know and do care no</v>

2953
02:31:24.391 --> 02:31:27.510
<v Speaker 3>more care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More and,</v>

2954
02:31:27.730 --> 02:31:30.240
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and demand answers.</v>

2955
02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's your family member.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come,</v>

2956
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:35.700
<v Speaker 3>how come you didn't show up at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>family event?</v>

2957
02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:38.880
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you high?</v>

2958
02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:41.880
<v Speaker 3>Are you using?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

2959
02:31:42.570 --> 02:31:47.570
<v Speaker 3>I think if we start family neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and don't be afraid to tell your</v>

2960
02:31:47.701 --> 02:31:48.051
<v Speaker 3>neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2961
02:31:48.051 --> 02:31:51.480
<v Speaker 3>I saw your son the other day was passed</v>
<v Speaker 3>out at the curb.</v>

2962
02:31:51.780 --> 02:31:54.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we intervene like we did</v>
<v Speaker 3>back when I was growing up.</v>

2963
02:31:55.140 --> 02:31:57.570
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would have tolerated that shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was growing up.</v>

2964
02:31:57.870 --> 02:32:00.960
<v Speaker 3>They would have sounded the alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think there's enough of</v>

2965
02:32:00.961 --> 02:32:02.550
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neighborliness,</v>

2966
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:04.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2967
02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:07.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not being afraid to hurt feelings.</v>

2968
02:32:08.220 --> 02:32:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's none of your business.</v>

2969
02:32:09.301 --> 02:32:11.470
<v Speaker 3>Well you wrote is my business because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2970
02:32:11.770 --> 02:32:14.190
<v Speaker 3>you're my neighbor and the guy you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitting on my lawn.</v>

2971
02:32:15.130 --> 02:32:17.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're aggressive enough.</v>

2972
02:32:17.461 --> 02:32:20.330
<v Speaker 3>I come from a world of aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

2973
02:32:20.370 --> 02:32:23.040
<v Speaker 3>not being a prick about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but asking questions.</v>

2974
02:32:23.041 --> 02:32:25.130
<v Speaker 3>At some point you might have to shrug</v>
<v Speaker 3>your shoulders and go away.</v>

2975
02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:26.760
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want any help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing I can do,</v>

2976
02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:27.790
<v Speaker 3>but I tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2977
02:32:27.791 --> 02:32:29.580
<v Speaker 3>you'd like conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Do,</v>

2978
02:32:29.690 --> 02:32:32.370
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to eradicate it.</v>

2979
02:32:32.371 --> 02:32:34.740
<v Speaker 3>I like to intervene to reduce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clearly,</v>

2980
02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:37.710
<v Speaker 3>you know that the way you express</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself is entertaining,</v>

2981
02:32:37.711 --> 02:32:40.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's also polarizing like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things to say,</v>

2982
02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:41.930
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2983
02:32:42.060 --> 02:32:44.880
<v Speaker 3>You invite this sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not intentionally.</v>

2984
02:32:45.090 --> 02:32:49.560
<v Speaker 3>I think by being a pragmatist you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to invite conflict because some</v>

2985
02:32:49.561 --> 02:32:51.660
<v Speaker 3>people don't like to hear this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2986
02:32:51.900 --> 02:32:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Some people don't like to hear this</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

2987
02:32:53.191 --> 02:32:57.540
<v Speaker 3>but the style in which you talk like</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when you're debating Pierce Morgan,</v>

2988
02:32:57.541 --> 02:32:59.940
<v Speaker 3>you're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very powerful with the way you describe</v>

2989
02:32:59.941 --> 02:33:01.380
<v Speaker 3>things and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2990
02:33:01.470 --> 02:33:04.200
<v Speaker 3>you get people that want to argue back</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

2991
02:33:04.860 --> 02:33:08.040
<v Speaker 3>It's time for that because I think the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentleman's approach,</v>

2992
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:12.210
<v Speaker 3>Mitt Romney and John Mccain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't represent nothing.</v>

2993
02:33:12.450 --> 02:33:16.740
<v Speaker 3>The reason Donald Trump won is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>finally the shit kickers who worked</v>

2994
02:33:16.741 --> 02:33:21.480
<v Speaker 3>rough and tumble those construction guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside the four seasons.</v>

2995
02:33:21.481 --> 02:33:23.370
<v Speaker 3>I stayed at the four seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How cool does that.</v>

2996
02:33:24.370 --> 02:33:27.540
<v Speaker 3>They're busting their ass to getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>approved and they're working hard and to</v>

2997
02:33:27.541 --> 02:33:30.300
<v Speaker 3>go throw back a few beers and have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little barbecue at night.</v>

2998
02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:35.540
<v Speaker 3>These are the guys I'm talking about and</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to and they're the ones who</v>

2999
02:33:36.030 --> 02:33:38.190
<v Speaker 3>voted for Donald trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally because he came out,</v>

3000
02:33:38.191 --> 02:33:40.740
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sounded like a shit kicker.</v>

3001
02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Really sounded like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sound like us.</v>

3002
02:33:43.570 --> 02:33:45.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>

3003
02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:48.630
<v Speaker 3>There was a real problem that we have in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this country with people that are career</v>

3004
02:33:48.631 --> 02:33:51.060
<v Speaker 3>politicians and he was really the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

3005
02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:54.270
<v Speaker 3>Career politicians is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The status quo.</v>

3006
02:33:54.620 --> 02:33:55.453
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3007
02:33:55.470 --> 02:33:57.720
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump isn't perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked imperfect,</v>

3008
02:33:57.870 --> 02:33:59.470
<v Speaker 3>imperfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just cool you and me.</v>

3009
02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Good examples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he came in swinging a crow bar to</v>

3010
02:34:03.661 --> 02:34:06.590
<v Speaker 3>this horrible status quo that can best</v>
<v Speaker 3>be described as one of.</v>

3011
02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.690
<v Speaker 3>He's not presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're goddamn right is not presidential</v>

3012
02:34:09.750 --> 02:34:13.340
<v Speaker 3>because all these presents presidential</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys got us into this mess because there</v>

3013
02:34:13.341 --> 02:34:16.320
<v Speaker 3>were so cautious and they didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ruffle any feathers.</v>

3014
02:34:16.330 --> 02:34:21.330
<v Speaker 3>We want have a big tent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including all the bad guys and people</v>

3015
02:34:21.581 --> 02:34:23.920
<v Speaker 3>that don't believe in secure borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

3016
02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:25.900
<v Speaker 3>And people that don't believe in earning</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own way.</v>

3017
02:34:25.930 --> 02:34:27.970
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that don't know the difference</v>

3018
02:34:27.971 --> 02:34:30.220
<v Speaker 3>between legal immigration and illegal</v>
<v Speaker 3>immigration.</v>

3019
02:34:30.221 --> 02:34:32.590
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the shit kickers.</v>

3020
02:34:32.591 --> 02:34:35.200
<v Speaker 3>Finally her saw somebody busted the</v>
<v Speaker 3>status quo.</v>

3021
02:34:35.201 --> 02:34:37.120
<v Speaker 3>You're damn right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not presidential.</v>

3022
02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Presidential got us into this train</v>
<v Speaker 3>wreck and we're done with it.</v>

3023
02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:46.010
<v Speaker 3>So the Republicans better be paying</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention because if you're status quo,</v>

3024
02:34:46.011 --> 02:34:47.890
<v Speaker 3>we were not voting for you.</v>

3025
02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:50.380
<v Speaker 3>If you come in swing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be rude enough to be</v>

3026
02:34:50.381 --> 02:34:52.060
<v Speaker 3>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to be condemning,</v>

3027
02:34:52.270 --> 02:34:55.060
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be honest and forthright</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sound like somebody.</v>

3028
02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:57.010
<v Speaker 3>You'd have a beer with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a barbecue,</v>

3029
02:34:57.100 --> 02:34:59.940
<v Speaker 3>and if you sound like a shit kicker and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of us working our plane out</v>

3030
02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Americans and you address our concerns</v>
<v Speaker 3>will vote for you.</v>

3031
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:06.070
<v Speaker 3>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to stay in our tree stand in</v>

3032
02:35:06.071 --> 02:35:08.470
<v Speaker 3>November,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what happened traditionally.</v>

3033
02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:11.420
<v Speaker 3>That's why Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin and Pennsylvania with 800,000,</v>

3034
02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:14.050
<v Speaker 3>100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one it for trump because we are a</v>

3035
02:35:14.051 --> 02:35:18.220
<v Speaker 3>hunter's nation and those families were</v>
<v Speaker 3>a huge voting block.</v>

3036
02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:20.860
<v Speaker 3>They'd never felt like they had skin in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game.</v>

3037
02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody had skin in the game,</v>

3038
02:35:23.261 --> 02:35:25.540
<v Speaker 3>including my teamster buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my union buddies,</v>

3039
02:35:25.690 --> 02:35:28.630
<v Speaker 3>instead of just like puppets pulling</v>
<v Speaker 3>that deliberately went,</v>

3040
02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:30.760
<v Speaker 3>the Democrats had been lying to me.</v>

3041
02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:33.850
<v Speaker 3>The Democrats have been scamming me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm voting for trump.</v>

3042
02:35:33.940 --> 02:35:35.960
<v Speaker 3>He's a status quo wrecker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3043
02:35:35.970 --> 02:35:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say look,</v>

3044
02:35:37.211 --> 02:35:38.550
<v Speaker 3>lying and scamming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3045
02:35:38.570 --> 02:35:39.850
<v Speaker 3>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you examples?</v>

3046
02:35:39.851 --> 02:35:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good grief.</v>

3047
02:35:42.470 --> 02:35:44.200
<v Speaker 3>But like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What gets to you?</v>

3048
02:35:44.201 --> 02:35:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the thing that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think of Democrats and you</v>

3049
02:35:46.901 --> 02:35:50.490
<v Speaker 3>think of lying and how about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think you need to read this?</v>

3050
02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:52.810
<v Speaker 3>You need to cite it to find out what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

3051
02:35:54.100 --> 02:35:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Nancy Pelosi on the House floor with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge voluminous healthcare bill</v>

3052
02:35:58.630 --> 02:36:00.790
<v Speaker 3>actually said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to read it.</v>

3053
02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:03.040
<v Speaker 3>You need to cite it to find out what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

3054
02:36:03.770 --> 02:36:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't remember that?</v>

3055
02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:07.750
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

3056
02:36:07.780 --> 02:36:11.950
<v Speaker 3>That sounds pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said it and then watch her try to</v>

3057
02:36:11.951 --> 02:36:15.700
<v Speaker 3>form a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch maxine water desperately searched</v>

3058
02:36:15.701 --> 02:36:19.000
<v Speaker 3>for a syllable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to the words out of their mouths.</v>

3059
02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Greeks.</v>

3060
02:36:20.890 --> 02:36:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Did you see this thing that she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>calling out for people to see anyone in</v>

3061
02:36:24.341 --> 02:36:27.040
<v Speaker 3>the administration having dinner?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Including Ted nugent?</v>

3062
02:36:27.070 --> 02:36:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bring it on,</v>

3063
02:36:28.391 --> 02:36:31.120
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disrupt and cause a crowd.</v>

3064
02:36:31.121 --> 02:36:32.950
<v Speaker 3>And tell them what you're not welcomed</v>
<v Speaker 3>every.</v>

3065
02:36:32.951 --> 02:36:35.110
<v Speaker 3>That's an insanely irresponsible thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say.</v>

3066
02:36:35.150 --> 02:36:38.050
<v Speaker 3>That's treacherous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every one of my promoters have death</v>

3067
02:36:38.051 --> 02:36:42.090
<v Speaker 3>threats because they dare to hire me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every one of my band mates and my crew</v>

3068
02:36:42.091 --> 02:36:44.080
<v Speaker 3>mates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some guys that are building this</v>

3069
02:36:44.081 --> 02:36:45.090
<v Speaker 3>wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3070
02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:47.210
<v Speaker 3>a bell amplifier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3071
02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:50.440
<v Speaker 3>they just showed a picture on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>website with me testing the new</v>

3072
02:36:50.441 --> 02:36:53.110
<v Speaker 3>amplifier and people attacked him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>threatened to kill them because they're</v>

3073
02:36:53.111 --> 02:36:58.111
<v Speaker 3>working with the coward animal murderer</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the the gun nut.</v>

3074
02:36:58.480 --> 02:36:59.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm a gun nut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm also,</v>

3075
02:36:59.691 --> 02:37:02.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm a screwdriver not to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I'm saying about you</v>

3076
02:37:02.321 --> 02:37:05.890
<v Speaker 3>being this polarizing figure that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that aren't looking too deeply into it</v>

3077
02:37:05.891 --> 02:37:09.300
<v Speaker 3>or listening to everything you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can was thing how.</v>

3078
02:37:09.330 --> 02:37:12.390
<v Speaker 3>How else can you address it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's why I'm asking.</v>

3079
02:37:12.410 --> 02:37:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

3080
02:37:13.470 --> 02:37:16.280
<v Speaker 3>you know Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys who have tried own very polite</v>

3081
02:37:16.281 --> 02:37:20.690
<v Speaker 3>and a very nonconfrontational got us</v>
<v Speaker 3>into this mess.</v>

3082
02:37:20.930 --> 02:37:23.690
<v Speaker 3>If you don't believe America needs</v>
<v Speaker 3>secure borders,</v>

3083
02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:27.290
<v Speaker 3>you're the enemy of America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need secure.</v>

3084
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Who doesn't know you need secure</v>
<v Speaker 3>borders?</v>

3085
02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Nancy Pelosi doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton didn't have Loretta</v>

3086
02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Lynch didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3087
02:37:34.191 --> 02:37:35.870
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people are freaks.</v>

3088
02:37:36.350 --> 02:37:41.350
<v Speaker 3>America first pisses off Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can that be if it's not America</v>

3089
02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:44.410
<v Speaker 3>thinkers,</v>

3090
02:37:44.410 --> 02:37:48.330
<v Speaker 4>think of it as you're denying</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to people that live in an</v>

3091
02:37:48.331 --> 02:37:50.820
<v Speaker 4>impoverished third world country that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to us.</v>

3092
02:37:51.090 --> 02:37:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Think of it as racism.</v>

3093
02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:57.340
<v Speaker 3>All my ancestors came through Ellis</v>
<v Speaker 3>Island and did mine and denounce their</v>

3094
02:37:57.341 --> 02:38:02.341
<v Speaker 3>allegiance to where they came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can still cook Swedish and still</v>

3095
02:38:03.131 --> 02:38:06.760
<v Speaker 3>cook German,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got an announce allegiance to</v>

3096
02:38:06.761 --> 02:38:08.650
<v Speaker 3>where you come from because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming here.</v>

3097
02:38:09.570 --> 02:38:13.590
<v Speaker 4>Of the habits pages per night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking hard for someone to come over</v>

3098
02:38:13.591 --> 02:38:17.060
<v Speaker 4>from Mexico and don't you think that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>real problem is that Mexico sucks or</v>

3099
02:38:17.070 --> 02:38:20.730
<v Speaker 4>they parts of Mexico sock overall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You figure out a way to help those</v>

3100
02:38:20.731 --> 02:38:23.130
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really the only way would be to make</v>

3101
02:38:23.131 --> 02:38:27.540
<v Speaker 4>Mexico so healthy and and and a great</v>
<v Speaker 4>place to live.</v>

3102
02:38:27.541 --> 02:38:30.630
<v Speaker 4>That it's just like the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason to come over here and</v>

3103
02:38:30.631 --> 02:38:34.050
<v Speaker 4>certainly we have tried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our policies have been very generous to</v>

3104
02:38:34.051 --> 02:38:36.870
<v Speaker 4>those countries were in fact we're the</v>
<v Speaker 4>only country that has been generous to</v>

3105
02:38:36.871 --> 02:38:39.070
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the massive.</v>

3106
02:38:39.630 --> 02:38:41.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive corruption.</v>

3107
02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Hire Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guatemalan.</v>

3108
02:38:44.580 --> 02:38:49.440
<v Speaker 3>All those governments are as criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Al Capone in Chicago and 32.</v>

3109
02:38:49.730 --> 02:38:53.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so infested by the law enforcement is</v>

3110
02:38:53.251 --> 02:38:55.560
<v Speaker 3>the cartel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The military is the cocktail,</v>

3111
02:38:56.070 --> 02:39:00.630
<v Speaker 3>so where do you next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the right to secure,</v>

3112
02:39:00.631 --> 02:39:05.631
<v Speaker 3>but this is not my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We in America have the right and the</v>

3113
02:39:06.181 --> 02:39:10.500
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to secure our borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think otherwise,</v>

3114
02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:13.740
<v Speaker 3>your dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to break.</v>

3115
02:39:13.830 --> 02:39:17.100
<v Speaker 3>I want people who need a better quality</v>
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>

3116
02:39:17.101 --> 02:39:20.640
<v Speaker 3>I welcome them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got buddies that came like that,</v>

3117
02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:22.140
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my sound man,</v>

3118
02:39:22.141 --> 02:39:26.030
<v Speaker 3>frank went through the seven year</v>
<v Speaker 3>process from Germany and now he's</v>

3119
02:39:26.050 --> 02:39:29.550
<v Speaker 3>illegal citizen in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why should someone be able to swim</v>

3120
02:39:29.551 --> 02:39:33.900
<v Speaker 3>across the Rio Grande and circumvent all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that process so we know whether you're</v>

3121
02:39:33.901 --> 02:39:37.650
<v Speaker 3>going to be an asset or a liability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not rocket science.</v>

3122
02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:42.980
<v Speaker 3>It's liability or asset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want assets and that's why our</v>

3123
02:39:44.731 --> 02:39:47.460
<v Speaker 3>immigration system is horrific.</v>

3124
02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Even the legal one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I know it's a problem,</v>

3125
02:39:50.100 --> 02:39:54.900
<v Speaker 3>but we're putting all these resources</v>
<v Speaker 3>and man hours into securing the poorest</v>

3126
02:39:54.901 --> 02:39:59.901
<v Speaker 3>border instead of processing those who</v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately would like a better quality</v>

3127
02:40:00.331 --> 02:40:02.580
<v Speaker 3>of life in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but first they have to.</v>

3128
02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:06.600
<v Speaker 3>We have to differentiate between the</v>
<v Speaker 3>protesters who think that we need to</v>

3129
02:40:06.601 --> 02:40:11.580
<v Speaker 3>turn over California and Arizona and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas back to Mexico so it can turn into</v>

3130
02:40:11.581 --> 02:40:12.990
<v Speaker 3>a shit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

3131
02:40:13.170 --> 02:40:15.240
<v Speaker 3>left Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know it's horrible.</v>

3132
02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:18.450
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you come here to get away from</v>

3133
02:40:18.451 --> 02:40:22.740
<v Speaker 3>a Shithole and then turn the place you</v>
<v Speaker 3>came to into the shit hole.</v>

3134
02:40:23.250 --> 02:40:26.310
<v Speaker 3>We have a constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a bill of rights.</v>

3135
02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:31.460
<v Speaker 3>You need to earn your own way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to work very hard if you're in</v>

3136
02:40:31.621 --> 02:40:34.560
<v Speaker 3>the asset column,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>

3137
02:40:34.830 --> 02:40:38.670
<v Speaker 3>If you're in the liability column,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you if you're having hard times,</v>

3138
02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:43.820
<v Speaker 3>but if you have squatted intentionally</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an able bodied individual in that</v>

3139
02:40:44.161 --> 02:40:48.360
<v Speaker 3>liability column,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are a detriment to America and you</v>

3140
02:40:48.361 --> 02:40:49.860
<v Speaker 3>should get the fuck outta here.</v>

3141
02:40:50.010 --> 02:40:51.540
<v Speaker 3>That's when you look at it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

3142
02:40:51.541 --> 02:40:54.510
<v Speaker 3>The people that are able bodied</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans that don't do Jack Shit and</v>

3143
02:40:54.511 --> 02:40:58.410
<v Speaker 3>some poor bastard is trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything they can to get here from</v>

3144
02:40:58.411 --> 02:41:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Mexico to the point where they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally dying and hydration in the</v>

3145
02:41:02.470 --> 02:41:03.390
<v Speaker 3>desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3146
02:41:03.570 --> 02:41:05.680
<v Speaker 3>and they would bust their ass if given</v>
<v Speaker 3>that opportunity.</v>

3147
02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:09.540
<v Speaker 3>So it's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy and it's never going to be</v>

3148
02:41:09.541 --> 02:41:10.880
<v Speaker 3>easy advocated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

3149
02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:14.100
<v Speaker 3>But it is doable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But our priorities as a government are</v>

3150
02:41:14.101 --> 02:41:19.101
<v Speaker 3>so clustered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so just prioritized that all</v>

3151
02:41:21.841 --> 02:41:26.841
<v Speaker 3>this efforts going towards securing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rio Grande when people are illegally</v>

3152
02:41:27.481 --> 02:41:31.140
<v Speaker 3>swimming across and jeopardizing their</v>
<v Speaker 3>very life and limb when just down a</v>

3153
02:41:31.141 --> 02:41:33.750
<v Speaker 3>couple of miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a legal entrance and it might be</v>

3154
02:41:33.751 --> 02:41:36.990
<v Speaker 3>a pain in the ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're here with me today,</v>

3155
02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:39.150
<v Speaker 3>June 28th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

3156
02:41:39.380 --> 02:41:43.830
<v Speaker 3>2018.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you not put up with major pains in</v>

3157
02:41:43.831 --> 02:41:46.020
<v Speaker 3>the ass as a martial artist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a comedian,</v>

3158
02:41:46.021 --> 02:41:47.220
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough life.</v>

3159
02:41:47.730 --> 02:41:52.730
<v Speaker 3>You got your world carved out because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put up with a pain in the ass and</v>

3160
02:41:53.011 --> 02:41:53.400
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3161
02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.200
<v Speaker 3>you improvise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adapt and overcome.</v>

3162
02:41:55.470 --> 02:41:59.760
<v Speaker 3>It makes you happier at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very fortunate.</v>

3163
02:41:59.761 --> 02:42:01.640
<v Speaker 3>I was born in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3164
02:42:01.641 --> 02:42:03.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't grow up in an impoverished</v>

3165
02:42:03.781 --> 02:42:07.530
<v Speaker 3>crime ridden community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Understood to deal with gang violence,</v>

3166
02:42:07.531 --> 02:42:10.140
<v Speaker 3>but you're certainly not advocating them</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming in illegally.</v>

3167
02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:12.450
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think there's gotta be.</v>

3168
02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:16.200
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be a better conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this and I think that the</v>

3169
02:42:16.201 --> 02:42:19.620
<v Speaker 3>conversation is that if you oppose these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are illegal,</v>

3170
02:42:19.630 --> 02:42:21.660
<v Speaker 3>immigrating illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immigrated into this country,</v>

3171
02:42:21.661 --> 02:42:24.450
<v Speaker 3>that you're a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is what's going on right now.</v>

3172
02:42:24.451 --> 02:42:26.090
<v Speaker 3>My Bass player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark Mendoza's,</v>

3173
02:42:26.220 --> 02:42:29.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm Mexican and my bass player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnny gunnels,</v>

3174
02:42:29.041 --> 02:42:31.890
<v Speaker 3>a black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's simple to call people racist.</v>

3175
02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Like people love to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love to reduce you down that,</v>

3176
02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:36.720
<v Speaker 3>but it's cruel.</v>

3177
02:42:36.770 --> 02:42:38.220
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ignorance.</v>

3178
02:42:38.370 --> 02:42:40.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a denial of nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a,</v>

3179
02:42:40.950 --> 02:42:43.920
<v Speaker 3>that's a tsunami of accusations against</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

3180
02:42:44.070 --> 02:42:48.060
<v Speaker 3>And I've always made it perfectly clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout my 70 year life,</v>

3181
02:42:48.290 --> 02:42:51.210
<v Speaker 3>I have always judged by content of</v>
<v Speaker 3>character,</v>

3182
02:42:51.570 --> 02:42:55.260
<v Speaker 3>never by color of skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to admit there is a racist</v>

3183
02:42:55.261 --> 02:42:58.860
<v Speaker 3>element in me because I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>expect a black guy to be able to play</v>

3184
02:42:58.861 --> 02:43:01.680
<v Speaker 3>better groove than a white guy that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>

3185
02:43:01.970 --> 02:43:04.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been overruled over the years</v>

3186
02:43:04.321 --> 02:43:08.430
<v Speaker 3>because there's so many white guys that</v>
<v Speaker 3>learned from the black masters that now</v>

3187
02:43:08.431 --> 02:43:11.500
<v Speaker 3>it is raceless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in growing up,</v>

3188
02:43:11.501 --> 02:43:14.320
<v Speaker 3>I always figured the black guy would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a better musician.</v>

3189
02:43:14.660 --> 02:43:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a racist against white people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the early days it was that way.</v>

3190
02:43:19.410 --> 02:43:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nowadays we learn from those black</v>

3191
02:43:23.141 --> 02:43:28.141
<v Speaker 3>soul artists that were the consummate</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitive authority of emotional music</v>

3192
02:43:29.710 --> 02:43:32.770
<v Speaker 3>from the James Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the funk brothers and chuck and Bo and</v>

3193
02:43:32.771 --> 02:43:37.771
<v Speaker 3>little Richard and bb and Freddy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Albert and Ali's monster black heroes of</v>

3194
02:43:38.261 --> 02:43:39.040
<v Speaker 3>everybody's.</v>

3195
02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:41.320
<v Speaker 3>And there's not a musician in the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that won't admit that.</v>

3196
02:43:41.860 --> 02:43:44.710
<v Speaker 3>But now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that influence all these</v>

3197
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:45.461
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3198
02:43:45.461 --> 02:43:47.370
<v Speaker 3>the white boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3199
02:43:47.430 --> 02:43:49.300
<v Speaker 3>can keep right up there with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

3200
02:43:49.301 --> 02:43:52.080
<v Speaker 3>in many instances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a compared to a lot of the rap and the</v>

3201
02:43:52.081 --> 02:43:53.280
<v Speaker 3>hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3202
02:43:53.281 --> 02:43:55.330
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole lot of white guys out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3203
02:43:55.331 --> 02:44:00.331
<v Speaker 3>I think a job on a Masa and Anton Fagan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly Jason Heartless and Greg Smith</v>

3204
02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:03.580
<v Speaker 3>and all the guys narrows Smith and Zz</v>
<v Speaker 3>top.</v>

3205
02:44:03.581 --> 02:44:05.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you close your eyes and there's not a</v>

3206
02:44:05.171 --> 02:44:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Caucasian to be found in these bands</v>
<v Speaker 3>nowadays soul wise.</v>

3207
02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:10.750
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it raised the,</v>

3208
02:44:10.810 --> 02:44:11.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3209
02:44:12.370 --> 02:44:17.050
<v Speaker 3>the repugnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dishonest.</v>

3210
02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Charge of racism is completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one that you can't shake.</v>

3211
02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Just somebody calls you a racist and</v>
<v Speaker 3>heat it,</v>

3212
02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:28.930
<v Speaker 3>but people have called you a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>

3213
02:44:28.990 --> 02:44:31.820
<v Speaker 3>everybody with a heart and a soul knows</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in a,</v>

3214
02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:32.740
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3215
02:44:32.740 --> 02:44:34.060
<v Speaker 3>you know who the racists are.</v>

3216
02:44:34.060 --> 02:44:38.590
<v Speaker 3>People that call me a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the racists while and dirt</v>

3217
02:44:38.591 --> 02:44:39.850
<v Speaker 3>bags to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3218
02:44:40.390 --> 02:44:45.160
<v Speaker 3>it's an unfair thing to do that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to do because it automatically puts</v>

3219
02:44:45.161 --> 02:44:47.680
<v Speaker 3>you on the defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're automatically on your heels and</v>

3220
02:44:47.681 --> 02:44:50.650
<v Speaker 3>you have to defend this charge against</v>
<v Speaker 3>raising by proving you're not a racist,</v>

3221
02:44:50.770 --> 02:44:53.310
<v Speaker 3>which makes people suspicious that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be raised and Speidel.</v>

3222
02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:54.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

3223
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I just live a great life with great</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and race,</v>

3224
02:44:58.060 --> 02:44:59.500
<v Speaker 3>creed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethnicity,</v>

3225
02:44:59.501 --> 02:45:00.820
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender,</v>

3226
02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:03.780
<v Speaker 3>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>confusion matters.</v>

3227
02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:05.950
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3228
02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:10.150
<v Speaker 3>I think Caitlin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Caitlin,</v>

3229
02:45:10.151 --> 02:45:12.490
<v Speaker 3>because I beat him in all the races we</v>
<v Speaker 3>raced against.</v>

3230
02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:17.050
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pray for Bruce.</v>

3231
02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:18.040
<v Speaker 3>Katelyn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3232
02:45:18.450 --> 02:45:22.000
<v Speaker 3>what a great guy or a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I will,</v>

3233
02:45:22.001 --> 02:45:24.520
<v Speaker 3>if that's what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's what she likes.</v>

3234
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:26.590
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3235
02:45:26.591 --> 02:45:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3236
02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Where was this when you were a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3237
02:45:28.410 --> 02:45:28.961
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3238
02:45:28.961 --> 02:45:32.140
<v Speaker 3>it's a different arena of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3239
02:45:32.530 --> 02:45:37.530
<v Speaker 3>and only she can make that choice and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to respect that choice.</v>

3240
02:45:37.790 --> 02:45:40.120
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mind twisting,</v>

3241
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:42.400
<v Speaker 3>twisting in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody says it's not,</v>

3242
02:45:42.401 --> 02:45:43.870
<v Speaker 3>it's not being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3243
02:45:43.890 --> 02:45:44.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3244
02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:46.570
<v Speaker 3>it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Diane Sawyer.</v>

3245
02:45:46.571 --> 02:45:48.730
<v Speaker 3>God love her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she had the opportunity of a</v>

3246
02:45:48.731 --> 02:45:51.940
<v Speaker 3>lifetime when she was interviewing bruce</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was saying,</v>

3247
02:45:51.941 --> 02:45:53.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all practical purposes,</v>

3248
02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:55.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

3249
02:45:55.180 --> 02:45:58.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said she should've said,</v>

3250
02:45:58.391 --> 02:45:59.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except for the Dick.</v>

3251
02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:05.790
<v Speaker 3>But I raced against her if she did say I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wish like that man.</v>

3252
02:46:06.330 --> 02:46:07.163
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

3253
02:46:07.260 --> 02:46:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to be friends with Bruce.</v>

3254
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:11.740
<v Speaker 3>He was the god of manliness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3255
02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:13.910

3256
02:46:14.530 --> 02:46:18.350
<v Speaker 3>the baddest motherfucker hurdled the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

3257
02:46:19.050 --> 02:46:22.500
<v Speaker 3>And I raced with them in off road races</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff and I always beat him,</v>

3258
02:46:23.780 --> 02:46:26.240
<v Speaker 3>which was just shit luck because I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>more aggressive.</v>

3259
02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:29.070
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a great guy and I spent a</v>

3260
02:46:29.140 --> 02:46:30.030
<v Speaker 3>suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's still,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3263
02:46:33.231 --> 02:46:36.350
<v Speaker 3>I respect everyone's choice to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want as long as we're</v>

3264
02:46:36.390 --> 02:46:38.570
<v Speaker 3>reading people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that fills right into that category.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people have come to you that</v>

02:46:51.351 --> 02:46:54.470
<v Speaker 3>where to start because that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that comes to me a lot.</v>

3271
02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:57.800
<v Speaker 3>People like I want to get it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3273

<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3274
02:47:00.021 --> 02:47:01.760

3275
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:04.820
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I barely have enough time to go myself.</v>

3276
02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:07.940
<v Speaker 3>I've witnessed you articulate it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing a great job and I thank you</v>

3277
02:47:07.941 --> 02:47:11.600
<v Speaker 3>for that and I salute you and you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>made great progress in inroads in that</v>

3278
02:47:11.601 --> 02:47:14.960
<v Speaker 3>arena of ignorance and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>presumptuousness.</v>

3279
02:47:15.470 --> 02:47:18.980
<v Speaker 3>But I'm very blessed because I'm a loud</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth and I'm alive.</v>

3280
02:47:18.981 --> 02:47:23.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I exercised my duties as we the people</v>

3281
02:47:23.961 --> 02:47:28.961
<v Speaker 3>to talk about policies and getting the</v>
<v Speaker 3>face of my elected employees and hold</v>

3282
02:47:29.781 --> 02:47:32.780
<v Speaker 3>them to constitutional accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3283
02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:35.900
<v Speaker 3>I missed the concord bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm here doing this now.</v>

3284
02:47:36.380 --> 02:47:41.380
<v Speaker 3>And I in my everyday walk at the Sushi</v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant at the gas station,</v>

3285
02:47:43.671 --> 02:47:45.830
<v Speaker 3>at the feed mill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the charity event.</v>

3286
02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:50.300
<v Speaker 3>People always coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those that would hesitate,</v>

3287
02:47:50.301 --> 02:47:53.090
<v Speaker 3>I guess never showed up because I never</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt any hesitation.</v>

3288
02:47:53.330 --> 02:47:55.960
<v Speaker 3>They're always genuinely intrigued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they express,</v>

3289
02:47:56.420 --> 02:48:00.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>confusion and uncomfortableness,</v>

3290
02:48:00.290 --> 02:48:03.320
<v Speaker 3>discomfort with the concept of killing</v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

3291
02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but within minutes when I talk about</v>

3292
02:48:07.220 --> 02:48:09.650
<v Speaker 3>sustained yield,</v>
<v Speaker 3>habitat carrying capacity,</v>

3293
02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:14.830
<v Speaker 3>just simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>readily understood earthly logistics,</v>

3294
02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:16.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

3295
02:48:16.610 --> 02:48:18.030
<v Speaker 3>I never thought of it like that before</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3296
02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:19.340
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're going to have babies</v>

3297
02:48:19.341 --> 02:48:22.550
<v Speaker 3>next year and there's not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>any new ground,</v>

3298
02:48:22.730 --> 02:48:26.570
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to grow next year as</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife on the existing habitat and in</v>

3299
02:48:26.571 --> 02:48:29.090
<v Speaker 3>most cases reduced habitat.</v>

3300
02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:32.300
<v Speaker 3>But thank God the cougars can live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your backyard and the bears can live in</v>

3301
02:48:32.301 --> 02:48:36.240
<v Speaker 3>the Culdesac and Pennsylvania and</v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes that live in your bathroom if</v>

3302
02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:40.310
<v Speaker 3>you don't lock the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So wildlife has adapted miraculously.</v>

3303
02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean geese and ducks and turkeys and</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer and elk and bear.</v>

3304
02:48:44.541 --> 02:48:46.420
<v Speaker 3>They're literally everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Check out,</v>

3305
02:48:46.590 --> 02:48:48.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at estes park in Colorado.</v>

3306
02:48:48.501 --> 02:48:51.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their landscaping,</v>

3307
02:48:51.291 --> 02:48:54.740
<v Speaker 3>destructo derby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't need to worry about</v>

3308
02:48:55.130 --> 02:48:59.210
<v Speaker 3>encroaching on habitat because they will</v>
<v Speaker 3>adapt and they have wonderful.</v>

3309
02:48:59.330 --> 02:49:00.740
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more deer,</v>

3310
02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:02.810
<v Speaker 3>more elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more cougar,</v>

3311
02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:04.320
<v Speaker 3>more bare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more tricky,</v>

3312
02:49:04.321 --> 02:49:06.950
<v Speaker 3>more geese than ever in recorded</v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

3313
02:49:07.050 --> 02:49:11.130
<v Speaker 3>And we're slaughtering them by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gazillions every year because they</v>

3314
02:49:11.270 --> 02:49:15.900
<v Speaker 3>growed gazillions every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once I expressed it to people like</v>

3315
02:49:15.901 --> 02:49:17.550
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I inject the,</v>

3316
02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:22.640
<v Speaker 3>the inescapable truism you talk organic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk close to the earth quality,</v>

3317
02:49:24.990 --> 02:49:28.860
<v Speaker 3>real food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there something better than venison</v>

3318
02:49:28.900 --> 02:49:29.490
<v Speaker 3>eye?</v>

3319
02:49:29.490 --> 02:49:32.040
<v Speaker 3>Because if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want some of this conversation is what</v>

3320
02:49:32.041 --> 02:49:34.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't know how to get started.</v>

3321
02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:38.100
<v Speaker 3>They hear about that and there's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this talk about organic and you know,</v>

3322
02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:41.070
<v Speaker 3>close to nature and being connected to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your food,</v>

3323
02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:43.950
<v Speaker 3>but they don't know how to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty easy to start a garden if</v>

3324
02:49:43.951 --> 02:49:45.480
<v Speaker 3>you have a yard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to,</v>

3325
02:49:45.530 --> 02:49:49.740
<v Speaker 3>to start hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great barrier to entry there</v>

3326
02:49:49.741 --> 02:49:52.320
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's easily overcome.</v>

3327
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:53.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go again,</v>

3328
02:49:53.731 --> 02:49:57.090
<v Speaker 3>go to my facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not just to be made my facebook,</v>

3329
02:49:57.091 --> 02:50:02.091
<v Speaker 3>but I am the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the glow worm of the hunting lifestyle.</v>

3330
02:50:02.341 --> 02:50:04.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have always come to me for that</v>

3331
02:50:05.070 --> 02:50:08.520
<v Speaker 3>because I've always promoted it and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>never backed down and almost every</v>

3332
02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:12.900
<v Speaker 3>interviewer brings it up since the 19</v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties because it was the tip of the</v>

3333
02:50:12.901 --> 02:50:15.120
<v Speaker 3>culture work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Controversial spear.</v>

3334
02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:19.440
<v Speaker 3>It really was hunting and guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the tip of the culture war</v>

3335
02:50:19.530 --> 02:50:23.560
<v Speaker 3>from the beginning because people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving from urban self-sufficient,</v>

3336
02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:24.271
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing,</v>

3337
02:50:24.271 --> 02:50:27.120
<v Speaker 3>trapping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthly lifestyles to the city where</v>

3338
02:50:27.121 --> 02:50:30.310
<v Speaker 3>they were catered to and they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear the chickens squawking,</v>

3339
02:50:30.330 --> 02:50:32.600
<v Speaker 3>so they didn't feel responsible for its</v>
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

3340
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:35.300
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you haven't caught on blue era</v>

3341
02:50:35.301 --> 02:50:36.200
<v Speaker 3>killer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3342
02:50:36.510 --> 02:50:37.740
<v Speaker 3>That is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>

3343
02:50:37.770 --> 02:50:38.940
<v Speaker 3>when I expressed that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

3344
02:50:38.941 --> 02:50:40.150
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a point there and I went,</v>

3345
02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:42.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

3346
02:50:42.510 --> 02:50:47.510
<v Speaker 3>I use blunt street term nomenclature and</v>
<v Speaker 3>easily identified colloquialisms of of</v>

3347
02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:57.500
<v Speaker 3>modern terminology that is timeless and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it it registers with them quickly now</v>

3348
02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:02.550
<v Speaker 3>getting over the hump to have access to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting ground.</v>

3349
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:06.780
<v Speaker 3>I also have been effective in educating</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on that because everybody's got</v>

3350
02:51:06.781 --> 02:51:09.870
<v Speaker 3>an uncle Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got access to some state or</v>

3351
02:51:09.871 --> 02:51:14.760
<v Speaker 3>federal open ground and even though the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting isn't very quality on those</v>

3352
02:51:14.761 --> 02:51:18.870
<v Speaker 3>public areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes if you are willing to pursue</v>

3353
02:51:19.050 --> 02:51:24.050
<v Speaker 3>what should have inspired you to ask</v>
<v Speaker 3>about hunting and that means to go</v>

3354
02:51:24.121 --> 02:51:27.180
<v Speaker 3>beyond the beaten path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is part of the spiritual</v>

3355
02:51:27.181 --> 02:51:28.014
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

3356
02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Leaving the modern Kush and getting into</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wild area.</v>

3357
02:51:33.390 --> 02:51:36.050
<v Speaker 3>I find that a lot of my new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3358
02:51:36.180 --> 02:51:38.580
<v Speaker 3>baptized hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>

3359
02:51:38.581 --> 02:51:42.120
<v Speaker 3>old and otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they like going deep and they will</v>

3360
02:51:42.121 --> 02:51:44.970
<v Speaker 3>find that deer that's not on the fringes</v>
<v Speaker 3>of public ground,</v>

3361
02:51:44.971 --> 02:51:49.620
<v Speaker 3>that have already been so pressured that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they moved into the anterior nucleus of</v>

3362
02:51:49.650 --> 02:51:52.620
<v Speaker 3>more sanctuary habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these guys,</v>

3363
02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:55.500
<v Speaker 3>it's almost cry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so happy.</v>

3364
02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Even if they didn't get something</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I got in there and it took me</v>

3365
02:51:58.801 --> 02:52:02.490
<v Speaker 3>two hours to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was still dark and I was concerned</v>

3366
02:52:02.491 --> 02:52:04.800
<v Speaker 3>about my safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never been that deep in the woods</v>

3367
02:52:04.810 --> 02:52:06.340
<v Speaker 3>before the manistee national forest</v>

3368
02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:09.880
<v Speaker 1>in Michigan or any wild ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado,</v>

3369
02:52:09.881 --> 02:52:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana,</v>

3370
02:52:10.990 --> 02:52:12.760
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

3371
02:52:13.060 --> 02:52:13.990
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ted.</v>

3372
02:52:14.890 --> 02:52:19.150
<v Speaker 1>It's changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just watching that deer come down.</v>

3373
02:52:19.151 --> 02:52:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to draw my bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

3374
02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:24.040
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an immediate</v>

3375
02:52:27.430 --> 02:52:32.430
<v Speaker 1>alive snus that is rarely available in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern setting except for great family</v>

3376
02:52:35.561 --> 02:52:36.700
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Birth,</v>

3377
02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:39.760
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

3378
02:52:41.500 --> 02:52:44.200
<v Speaker 1>laughter around a campfire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primal moments,</v>

3379
02:52:44.230 --> 02:52:45.760
<v Speaker 1>primal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primal moments.</v>

3380
02:52:45.761 --> 02:52:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it a prayer for the wild things.</v>

3381
02:52:48.581 --> 02:52:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I actually wrote this in the New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>Times,</v>

3382
02:52:50.441 --> 02:52:52.010
<v Speaker 1>way back in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3383
02:52:52.120 --> 02:52:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a New York Times Sunday magazine</v>

3384
02:52:55.601 --> 02:53:00.601
<v Speaker 1>feature about my Christmas Buck and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>written it in all kinds of places and</v>

3385
02:53:02.321 --> 02:53:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm amazed that people still question</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether I'm serious about hunting or</v>

3386
02:53:05.981 --> 02:53:06.880
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you kidding me.</v>

3387
02:53:06.881 --> 02:53:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I've written New York Times bestsellers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the number one showing up your</v>

3388
02:53:09.460 --> 02:53:12.070
<v Speaker 1>channel for 30 years almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who questions whether or not you're</v>

3389
02:53:12.071 --> 02:53:13.060
<v Speaker 1>serious about hunting?</v>

3390
02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:13.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

3391
02:53:14.080 --> 02:53:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Someone actually questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3392
02:53:15.730 --> 02:53:18.890
<v Speaker 1>just did not sure what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3393
02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:20.620
<v Speaker 1>well they don't know what it's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3394
02:53:20.650 --> 02:53:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Being receptive to my statements are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>

3395
02:53:23.980 --> 02:53:26.800
<v Speaker 1>how can you not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you avoid them?</v>

3396
02:53:27.420 --> 02:53:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's many people that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear about you and then immediately go,</v>

3397
02:53:30.941 --> 02:53:32.080
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that guy.</v>

3398
02:53:32.081 --> 02:53:34.720
<v Speaker 1>I heard him talk sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said fuck.</v>

3399
02:53:34.721 --> 02:53:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And he called somebody a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

3400
02:53:36.820 --> 02:53:39.550
<v Speaker 1>He did something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've never been on the street.</v>

3401
02:53:39.551 --> 02:53:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Really the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never been on the street.</v>

3402
02:53:41.591 --> 02:53:44.140
<v Speaker 1>You've never heard this language before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lying sack of shit.</v>

3403
02:53:45.010 --> 02:53:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Being this polarizing guy though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it get exhausting?</v>

3404
02:53:47.741 --> 02:53:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Like so many people hungry in Tom faker</v>
<v Speaker 1>rating.</v>

3405
02:53:50.390 --> 02:53:54.700
<v Speaker 1>You don't get tired of constantly doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in battle with people,</v>

3406
02:53:54.880 --> 02:53:56.560
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do battle.</v>

3407
02:53:56.561 --> 02:53:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I merely put out the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logic,</v>

3408
02:53:58.301 --> 02:53:59.860
<v Speaker 1>common sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the science.</v>

3409
02:54:00.310 --> 02:54:02.140
<v Speaker 1>It's irrefutable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not my opinion.</v>

3410
02:54:02.141 --> 02:54:04.990
<v Speaker 1>I have no opinion on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just genuflect at the altar of</v>

3411
02:54:04.991 --> 02:54:06.100
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logic,</v>

3412
02:54:06.101 --> 02:54:09.040
<v Speaker 1>common sense of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I share it.</v>

3413
02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't grasp it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work on it.</v>

3414
02:54:11.531 --> 02:54:13.380
<v Speaker 1>And I'm here if you need me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3415
02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:17.590
<v Speaker 1>but you clearly like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You liked Pierce Morgan interviews?</v>

3416
02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because without me,</v>

3417
02:54:21.210 --> 02:54:26.210
<v Speaker 1>who's going to do it right there lies</v>
<v Speaker 1>will stand their,</v>

3418
02:54:26.321 --> 02:54:28.780
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their dishonesty.</v>

3419
02:54:29.020 --> 02:54:31.170
<v Speaker 1>And they're mean spirited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3420
02:54:31.171 --> 02:54:33.620
<v Speaker 1>why do you think they have these low?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think a good cause?</v>

3421
02:54:33.621 --> 02:54:35.020
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morgan does.</v>

3422
02:54:35.050 --> 02:54:39.520
<v Speaker 1>He's been so removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are so satisfied that they say</v>

3423
02:54:39.521 --> 02:54:42.160
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think their cord on blue didn't</v>

3424
02:54:42.190 --> 02:54:45.490
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that their pulled pork</v>

3425
02:54:45.491 --> 02:54:48.580
<v Speaker 1>sandwich came like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3426
02:54:48.730 --> 02:54:53.530
<v Speaker 1>and within just minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an honest person will admit that they're</v>

3427
02:54:53.531 --> 02:54:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Tofu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salad has a whole bunch of dead ground</v>

3428
02:54:55.811 --> 02:54:57.370
<v Speaker 1>squirrels and it's vapor trail.</v>

3429
02:54:57.640 --> 02:54:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unless they're,</v>

3430
02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:01.570
<v Speaker 1>unless I tell them then what nobody else</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I tell them,</v>

3431
02:55:01.780 --> 02:55:03.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing that's a big spot,</v>

3432
02:55:03.561 --> 02:55:05.750
<v Speaker 1>if they don't understand where</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservation money comes from,</v>

3433
02:55:05.751 --> 02:55:10.370
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to them about the Pickman</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robertson or talk to them about how many</v>

3434
02:55:10.430 --> 02:55:14.990
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars every year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>generated from sales of ammunition,</v>

3435
02:55:14.991 --> 02:55:17.650
<v Speaker 1>hunting gear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bows and arrows and all that stuff.</v>

3436
02:55:17.930 --> 02:55:20.990
<v Speaker 1>We selfimposed that the hundreds before</v>
<v Speaker 1>our time.</v>

3437
02:55:20.991 --> 02:55:22.300
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunters.</v>

3438
02:55:22.730 --> 02:55:24.240
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't before my time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3439
02:55:24.260 --> 02:55:29.260
<v Speaker 1>it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well a 30 the dingle Robert Pitchman,</v>

3440
02:55:29.801 --> 02:55:33.020
<v Speaker 1>he edited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was almost a Teddy Roosevelt thing,</v>

3441
02:55:33.530 --> 02:55:38.530
<v Speaker 1>but the real battle cry was in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

3442
02:55:38.931 --> 02:55:40.220
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no anti hunting.</v>

3443
02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:45.260
<v Speaker 1>First 10 years of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the concrete jungle citification</v>

3444
02:55:46.281 --> 02:55:49.430
<v Speaker 1>removal from the system by which we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustained.</v>

3445
02:55:49.850 --> 02:55:54.290
<v Speaker 1>That was a convenient disconnect and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could deny it because you didn't hear</v>

3446
02:55:54.291 --> 02:55:56.540
<v Speaker 1>the animals die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't see the blood.</v>

3447
02:55:56.540 --> 02:55:59.570
<v Speaker 1>It was nice and cleaned up in the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>cellophane package.</v>

3448
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And then this is new over the last few</v>
<v Speaker 1>generations and that denial metastasized</v>

3449
02:56:04.551 --> 02:56:09.380
<v Speaker 1>into a cult of make believe and fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to their credit,</v>

3450
02:56:09.810 --> 02:56:14.810
<v Speaker 1>and there is only a lunatic fringe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that the animal rights,</v>

3451
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:17.780
<v Speaker 1>even though they've succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in California,</v>

3452
02:56:18.290 --> 02:56:21.620
<v Speaker 1>they are run into dead end brick wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere else.</v>

3453
02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Even though in Michigan the dirtbags</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeeded in banning the hunting of the</v>

3454
02:56:26.931 --> 02:56:30.800
<v Speaker 1>number one game animal on planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The morning dove where we grow more</v>

3455
02:56:30.801 --> 02:56:32.690
<v Speaker 1>doves in Michigan than all the quail</v>
<v Speaker 1>pheasant,</v>

3456
02:56:32.691 --> 02:56:34.820
<v Speaker 1>woodcock and grouse combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird one,</v>

3457
02:56:34.821 --> 02:56:36.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Doug's been people who've never</v>

3458
02:56:36.891 --> 02:56:37.510
<v Speaker 1>eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dove.</v>

3459
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:39.510
<v Speaker 1>They don't know the delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you hear about a dub,</v>

3460
02:56:39.511 --> 02:56:40.071
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

3461
02:56:40.071 --> 02:56:41.780
<v Speaker 1>That's piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't shoot p.</v>

3462
02:56:41.781 --> 02:56:43.730
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't an analogy of everything</v>

3463
02:56:43.731 --> 02:56:46.010
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're killing piece.</v>

3464
02:56:46.370 --> 02:56:49.670
<v Speaker 1>You're killing piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is a lunatic fringe though?</v>

3465
02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:51.770
<v Speaker 1>It really is a lunatic fringe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

3466
02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a convenient opinion because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like it's sensible.</v>

3467
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're shooting a dove.</v>

3468
02:56:57.621 --> 02:56:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Why would you shoot a dove Ted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

3469
02:56:59.121 --> 02:57:01.220
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to cook up some dub for you.</v>

3470
02:57:01.550 --> 02:57:03.780
<v Speaker 1>And then you tell me why wouldn't shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up?</v>

3471
02:57:04.740 --> 02:57:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay to shoot a chicken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not okay to shoot a dove.</v>

3472
02:57:06.911 --> 02:57:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Why is it okay to shoot a pheasant is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as you have much to pragmatic joe</v>

3473
02:57:11.850 --> 02:57:14.240
<v Speaker 1>and watched the logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might hurt somebody.</v>

3474
02:57:14.270 --> 02:57:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Conversations don't take place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3475
02:57:16.940 --> 02:57:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Thank God you've been baptized because</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has a great impact because your</v>

3476
02:57:20.930 --> 02:57:23.900
<v Speaker 1>average listener does not come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing haunting truth.</v>

3477
02:57:24.020 --> 02:57:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Your average listener comes to hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart ass a dialogue in issue review and</v>

3478
02:57:30.321 --> 02:57:34.670
<v Speaker 1>intellectual analysis of life's</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

3479
02:57:34.970 --> 02:57:36.290
<v Speaker 1>All good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all perfect,</v>

3480
02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:41.620
<v Speaker 1>but that you have inflicted and injected</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth about conservation wise use</v>

3481
02:57:42.631 --> 02:57:45.380
<v Speaker 1>wildlife management is a Hallelujah</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

3482
02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:49.310
<v Speaker 1>which is why I'm sitting across from you</v>
<v Speaker 1>today because I value that and a lot of</v>

3483
02:57:49.311 --> 02:57:52.940
<v Speaker 1>it I got honestly from people like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were enthusiastic about it.</v>

3484
02:57:52.940 --> 02:57:56.000
<v Speaker 1>That got me curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I saw how enthusiastic you are</v>

3485
02:57:56.001 --> 02:57:59.090
<v Speaker 1>about hunting and about the eating of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild meat and how much energy it gives</v>

3486
02:57:59.091 --> 02:58:01.410
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got very curious many years before I</v>

3487
02:58:01.411 --> 02:58:06.270
<v Speaker 1>ever started hunting because because I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a lot of those p to videos.</v>

3488
02:58:06.271 --> 02:58:10.140
<v Speaker 1>We see these horrific conditions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>factory farms and I didn't want to be a</v>

3489
02:58:10.141 --> 02:58:15.141
<v Speaker 1>part of that was trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to not be a part of that and so when</v>

3490
02:58:15.181 --> 02:58:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I first decided to start hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before that I was making two</v>

3491
02:58:18.870 --> 02:58:20.280
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either I'm going to do this and I'm</v>

3492
02:58:20.281 --> 02:58:23.340
<v Speaker 1>going to hate it and I'm never going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it again and I'm going to be a</v>

3493
02:58:23.341 --> 02:58:25.680
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian or I'm going to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter,</v>

3494
02:58:25.710 --> 02:58:28.170
<v Speaker 1>and the moment I shot that deer and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ate it,</v>

3495
02:58:28.171 --> 02:58:28.681
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3496
02:58:28.681 --> 02:58:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this forever.</v>

3497
02:58:29.660 --> 02:58:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Metrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg actually came out and</v>

3498
02:58:31.291 --> 02:58:33.300
<v Speaker 1>admitted that if he's going to eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>flesh,</v>

3499
02:58:33.540 --> 02:58:36.000
<v Speaker 1>he's going to kill it himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did it for a whole year and</v>

3500
02:58:36.001 --> 02:58:37.650
<v Speaker 1>everything he ate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he killed.</v>

3501
02:58:37.950 --> 02:58:40.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that people would have a</v>

3502
02:58:40.651 --> 02:58:44.370
<v Speaker 1>better understanding of what their food</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and when you have these conversations</v>

3503
02:58:44.371 --> 02:58:45.210
<v Speaker 1>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it talks,</v>

3504
02:58:45.240 --> 02:58:47.630
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to animal rights ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what shouldn't,</v>

3505
02:58:47.640 --> 02:58:50.280
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be legal 90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3506
02:58:50.310 --> 02:58:54.480
<v Speaker 1>five 97 percent of the people eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3507
02:58:54.481 --> 02:58:57.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our life support system.</v>

3508
02:58:57.480 --> 02:58:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food and people will think you're just</v>

3509
02:58:59.761 --> 02:59:00.990
<v Speaker 1>going to stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

3510
02:59:01.050 --> 02:59:03.030
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't healthy.</v>

3511
02:59:03.031 --> 02:59:06.420
<v Speaker 1>This is not the way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if some people want to go vegan and</v>

3512
02:59:06.421 --> 02:59:10.080
<v Speaker 1>they can pull it off with careful</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying of their diet and making sure</v>

3513
02:59:10.081 --> 02:59:12.210
<v Speaker 1>they're supplementing with all the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

3514
02:59:12.540 --> 02:59:13.373
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

3515
02:59:13.500 --> 02:59:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go for it.</v>

3516
02:59:15.310 --> 02:59:18.420
<v Speaker 1>How we can initiate this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After my great hero,</v>

3517
02:59:18.421 --> 02:59:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Fred Bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>died in 1987.</v>

3518
02:59:20.071 --> 02:59:22.530
<v Speaker 1>It was the next year I started the Ted</v>
<v Speaker 1>nugent camp for kids,</v>

3519
02:59:22.740 --> 02:59:27.270
<v Speaker 1>which was a a movement forward of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me to continue promoting</v>

3520
02:59:27.271 --> 02:59:31.250
<v Speaker 1>conservation and hunting the way I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I started a charity 500,</v>

3521
02:59:31.251 --> 02:59:33.180
<v Speaker 1>one c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three church did the Ted nugent camp for</v>

3522
02:59:33.181 --> 02:59:36.360
<v Speaker 1>kids where we run in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Dakota,</v>

3523
02:59:36.750 --> 02:59:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Iowa.</v>

3524
02:59:38.061 --> 02:59:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Every year we graduated over 16,000 boys</v>
<v Speaker 1>and girls between the ages of seven and</v>

3525
02:59:42.171 --> 02:59:47.171
<v Speaker 1>17 from great volunteers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women from every measurable walk</v>

3526
02:59:47.581 --> 02:59:49.860
<v Speaker 1>of life that I have to vet because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got my name on it,</v>

3527
02:59:50.130 --> 02:59:54.420
<v Speaker 1>but a great heroes of law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military and just great families and we</v>

3528
02:59:54.421 --> 02:59:59.421
<v Speaker 1>teach them the discipline of archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the discipline of wildlife management</v>

3529
02:59:59.461 --> 03:00:02.250
<v Speaker 1>colluding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't fish upon the fish will,</v>

3530
03:00:02.580 --> 03:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>if they'll overpopulate and they'll die</v>
<v Speaker 1>off that you have to harvest a surplus</v>

3531
03:00:07.441 --> 03:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>to make room for the next productivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trapping the importance of trapping</v>

3532
03:00:12.091 --> 03:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>that that's how you keep disease under</v>
<v Speaker 1>control and that's how you keep value to</v>

3533
03:00:15.961 --> 03:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>fur bearers.</v>

3534
03:00:16.950 --> 03:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you make really great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great warm clothes and at laterals and</v>

3535
03:00:21.540 --> 03:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>fly fishing and the meticulous detail</v>
<v Speaker 1>and discipline of tying flies and being</v>

3536
03:00:27.631 --> 03:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>clean and sober and being the best that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be.</v>

3537
03:00:30.450 --> 03:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>And self sufficiency and rugged</v>
<v Speaker 1>individualism.</v>

3538
03:00:32.941 --> 03:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>So this has been going on since 1989.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3539
03:00:36.740 --> 03:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still you haven't read a word about it.</v>

3540
03:00:38.930 --> 03:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't worried about it anywhere</v>

3541
03:00:41.280 --> 03:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>because they're too quick to condemn me</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm so good at promoting hunting</v>

3542
03:00:45.661 --> 03:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>gun ownership that they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They avoid me like the plague,</v>

3543
03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>but the real tragedy is that outdoor</v>
<v Speaker 1>life field and stream sports,</v>

3544
03:00:53.050 --> 03:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>field guns and Ammo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these sporting publications,</v>

3545
03:00:57.480 --> 03:01:00.160
<v Speaker 1>not a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years</v>

3546
03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:05.160
<v Speaker 3>of a wonderful charity created by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>household name celebrity about the most</v>

3547
03:01:06.101 --> 03:01:09.520
<v Speaker 3>important things in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just don't care.</v>

3548
03:01:09.940 --> 03:01:13.930
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm mentioning it here on the Joe Rogan</v>

3549
03:01:13.931 --> 03:01:18.931
<v Speaker 3>podcast because my volunteers have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing God's work for all these years and</v>

3550
03:01:19.361 --> 03:01:22.300
<v Speaker 3>plus people have been very generous to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shukar Safaris,</v>

3551
03:01:22.510 --> 03:01:26.650
<v Speaker 3>donate money every year and people just</v>
<v Speaker 3>dig deep and make donations to keep the</v>

3552
03:01:26.651 --> 03:01:29.050
<v Speaker 3>camp alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if people want to find out about</v>

3553
03:01:29.051 --> 03:01:30.310
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then go to my website,</v>

3554
03:01:30.580 --> 03:01:35.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's a charity for children about</v>
<v Speaker 3>being aware of resource stewardship and</v>

3555
03:01:35.441 --> 03:01:38.530
<v Speaker 3>hands on boots on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Environmentalism.</v>

3556
03:01:38.710 --> 03:01:42.250
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to cut a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might want to plant 50 simple.</v>

3557
03:01:42.251 --> 03:01:46.120
<v Speaker 3>I know you do a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do a lot of that tree planting and</v>

3558
03:01:46.121 --> 03:01:47.410
<v Speaker 3>you've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've done every year since [inaudible]</v>

3559
03:01:47.411 --> 03:01:50.020
<v Speaker 3>69.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got forest in Michigan.</v>

3560
03:01:50.021 --> 03:01:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean giant towering forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to kill deer on your own grads</v>

3561
03:01:53.771 --> 03:01:54.760
<v Speaker 3>fund to kill deer anywhere.</v>

3562
03:01:55.030 --> 03:01:57.880
<v Speaker 3>It's exciting and it's challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all the good things both to me to</v>

3563
03:01:57.881 --> 03:01:59.470
<v Speaker 3>do it on your own ground that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>earned.</v>

3564
03:01:59.471 --> 03:02:02.200
<v Speaker 3>It's really special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you do it on the ground that</v>

3565
03:02:02.201 --> 03:02:05.650
<v Speaker 3>you earned and you literally built the</v>
<v Speaker 3>forest,</v>

3566
03:02:05.850 --> 03:02:07.100
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3567
03:02:07.220 --> 03:02:09.820
<v Speaker 3>it's spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like.</v>

3568
03:02:09.821 --> 03:02:13.270
<v Speaker 3>I love aetate when I'm in my forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3569
03:02:13.330 --> 03:02:15.490
<v Speaker 3>I remember you had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember who it was.</v>

3570
03:02:15.491 --> 03:02:17.620
<v Speaker 3>He had some rock and roll guy on your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3571
03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Sebastian Bach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one time it was one of one of</v>

3572
03:02:20.010 --> 03:02:20.751
<v Speaker 3>the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you were,</v>

3573
03:02:20.751 --> 03:02:22.600
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about how someone was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

3574
03:02:22.601 --> 03:02:24.820
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had my own thoughts.</v>

3575
03:02:24.830 --> 03:02:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Was Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3576
03:02:25.410 --> 03:02:27.730
<v Speaker 3>it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was Steven Tyler and Joe</v>

3577
03:02:29.450 --> 03:02:31.770
<v Speaker 3>snored in your own forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3578
03:02:31.830 --> 03:02:34.700
<v Speaker 3>you snorted the upper peninsula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are you kidding?</v>

3579
03:02:35.020 --> 03:02:38.890
<v Speaker 3>And they did you add a mine here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could have bought one hell of a nice</v>

3580
03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:39.753
<v Speaker 3>ranch.</v>

3581
03:02:40.150 --> 03:02:44.170
<v Speaker 3>He would admit that the life that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>live that life,</v>

3582
03:02:44.171 --> 03:02:45.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having this,</v>

3583
03:02:45.011 --> 03:02:47.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you essentially live in an area in both</v>

3584
03:02:47.951 --> 03:02:52.420
<v Speaker 3>places when Michigan into taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hunt in your own environment,</v>

3585
03:02:52.421 --> 03:02:56.080
<v Speaker 3>you have your own hunting place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's controversial.</v>

3586
03:02:56.170 --> 03:02:57.610
<v Speaker 3>And this is what's controversial about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3587
03:02:57.611 --> 03:02:59.000
<v Speaker 3>The fence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3588
03:02:59.001 --> 03:03:01.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Texas property is fenced because I</v>

3589
03:03:01.751 --> 03:03:04.960
<v Speaker 3>have exotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so by law in why do I have it fenced</v>

3590
03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.210
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever exotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if it wasn't fenced with</v>

3591
03:03:07.211 --> 03:03:10.210
<v Speaker 3>exotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exotics would have probably been extinct</v>

3592
03:03:10.211 --> 03:03:12.280
<v Speaker 3>by now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but land owners in Texas,</v>

3593
03:03:12.281 --> 03:03:15.520
<v Speaker 3>we took the lead from South Africa and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people don't know this Joe.</v>

3594
03:03:15.521 --> 03:03:17.620
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I articulated in an upcoming spirit of</v>

3595
03:03:17.621 --> 03:03:21.340
<v Speaker 3>the wild show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high fence hunting saved wildlife in</v>

3596
03:03:21.341 --> 03:03:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Africa because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the development of agriculture in Africa</v>

3597
03:03:26.050 --> 03:03:29.410
<v Speaker 3>was in total conflict with the migration</v>
<v Speaker 3>of wildlife.</v>

3598
03:03:29.411 --> 03:03:33.970
<v Speaker 3>We're talking all those incredible</v>
<v Speaker 3>species from Eland and Kudu and GMS,</v>

3599
03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:37.750
<v Speaker 3>Bach in Yallah and willdabeast and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3600
03:03:37.751 --> 03:03:39.370
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the wart hogs.</v>

3601
03:03:39.370 --> 03:03:42.450
<v Speaker 3>And in elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would migrate every year and have</v>

3602
03:03:42.460 --> 03:03:46.060
<v Speaker 3>Gulf sudden the migration came to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>citrus grove and destroyed everything.</v>

3603
03:03:46.110 --> 03:03:49.180
<v Speaker 3>You had killed all the wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you want to sell your citrus.</v>

3604
03:03:49.510 --> 03:03:52.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the ranchers who value the</v>

3605
03:03:52.121 --> 03:03:55.390
<v Speaker 3>wildlife more than citrus and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing wrong with citrus.</v>

3606
03:03:55.870 --> 03:03:58.210
<v Speaker 3>They literally said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit,</v>

3607
03:03:58.211 --> 03:04:02.660
<v Speaker 3>everytime I herds migrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only a portion of them come back because</v>

3608
03:04:02.661 --> 03:04:05.360
<v Speaker 3>they all these agric concerns are</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroying,</v>

3609
03:04:05.960 --> 03:04:08.780
<v Speaker 3>killing the wildlife to protect your</v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture.</v>

3610
03:04:08.930 --> 03:04:12.560
<v Speaker 3>So I'm an offense my 20,000 acres and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to manage it.</v>

3611
03:04:12.770 --> 03:04:15.230
<v Speaker 3>Twenty thousand acres is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even my spirit world,</v>

3612
03:04:15.231 --> 03:04:16.400
<v Speaker 3>ranches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>300 acres,</v>

3613
03:04:16.520 --> 03:04:21.520
<v Speaker 3>it's still has a finite productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every habitat is finite and so they</v>

3614
03:04:22.461 --> 03:04:27.260
<v Speaker 3>started selling those hunts for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>surplus every year of these magnificent</v>

3615
03:04:27.260 --> 03:04:32.030
<v Speaker 3>wildlife species instead of agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those animals are thriving and</v>

3616
03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:36.590
<v Speaker 3>absolute natural habitat as is my home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground spirit,</v>

3617
03:04:36.591 --> 03:04:41.270
<v Speaker 3>wild ranch in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must harvest the surplus fence or no</v>

3618
03:04:41.271 --> 03:04:46.160
<v Speaker 3>fence and mark my words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who condemn and criticize high</v>

3619
03:04:46.161 --> 03:04:47.480
<v Speaker 3>fence hunting is not fair.</v>

3620
03:04:47.480 --> 03:04:52.480
<v Speaker 3>Chase are speaking out of their ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ted nugent hunts more days in an average</v>

3621
03:04:55.010 --> 03:04:57.950
<v Speaker 3>year than most people will in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime.</v>

3622
03:04:58.310 --> 03:05:02.120
<v Speaker 3>I hunt hundreds of days every morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every afternoon.</v>

3623
03:05:02.840 --> 03:05:07.840
<v Speaker 3>The animals have to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I must make room for next year's</v>

3624
03:05:08.871 --> 03:05:10.790
<v Speaker 3>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In your situation,</v>

3625
03:05:10.850 --> 03:05:13.850
<v Speaker 3>in all situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your situation in particular because</v>

3626
03:05:13.851 --> 03:05:15.380
<v Speaker 3>you're only on 300 acres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3627
03:05:15.381 --> 03:05:17.790
<v Speaker 3>I have a certain amount of animals and</v>
<v Speaker 3>habitat.</v>

3628
03:05:17.810 --> 03:05:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Everybody even on outside my fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still gotta kill them animals too,</v>

3629
03:05:21.621 --> 03:05:24.620
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of like purists would look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and go,</v>

3630
03:05:24.650 --> 03:05:26.120
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that really hunting?</v>

3631
03:05:26.150 --> 03:05:27.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's my answer.</v>

3632
03:05:27.380 --> 03:05:28.670
<v Speaker 3>Read in areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're ready?</v>

3633
03:05:28.671 --> 03:05:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lifetime experience hunting.</v>

3634
03:05:32.001 --> 03:05:33.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most difficult animals in the world.</v>

3635
03:05:33.790 --> 03:05:35.300
<v Speaker 3>The most challenging animals in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

3636
03:05:35.301 --> 03:05:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Pressured are my pressured animals and</v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit.</v>

3637
03:05:37.941 --> 03:05:40.510
<v Speaker 3>One ranch on my open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1100 acres,</v>

3638
03:05:40.511 --> 03:05:43.400
<v Speaker 3>swamp and Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I want to shoot a deer,</v>

3639
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:48.550
<v Speaker 3>I can 90 percent plus tell you with all</v>
<v Speaker 3>my different choices of tree stands and</v>

3640
03:05:50.091 --> 03:05:53.900
<v Speaker 3>my strategies of wind and and habitat</v>
<v Speaker 3>and positioning.</v>

3641
03:05:54.140 --> 03:05:55.190
<v Speaker 3>Bader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no bait,</v>

3642
03:05:55.191 --> 03:05:57.420
<v Speaker 3>just travel corridors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been living there.</v>

3643
03:05:57.860 --> 03:06:00.500
<v Speaker 3>I've owned it since 1978.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

3644
03:06:00.501 --> 03:06:05.501
<v Speaker 3>the one place I've owned since 1970 I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a like a 20 times the shot</v>

3645
03:06:08.300 --> 03:06:13.010
<v Speaker 3>opportunity on my open ground than I do</v>
<v Speaker 3>on my fence ground.</v>

3646
03:06:13.610 --> 03:06:17.580
<v Speaker 3>My high fenced hunting and all the high</v>
<v Speaker 3>fenced hunting I've ever had is,</v>

3647
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:22.590
<v Speaker 3>is absolutely pure fair chase is any</v>
<v Speaker 3>wilderness I've ever been to from the</v>

3648
03:06:24.441 --> 03:06:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Sudan to Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Saskatchewan,</v>

3649
03:06:27.741 --> 03:06:29.930
<v Speaker 3>to Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Montana,</v>

3650
03:06:30.050 --> 03:06:32.300
<v Speaker 3>to Wyoming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to northern California.</v>

3651
03:06:32.660 --> 03:06:37.660
<v Speaker 3>It is hunting the role the fence plays</v>
<v Speaker 3>is zero in my killing an animal.</v>

3652
03:06:40.490 --> 03:06:44.090
<v Speaker 3>It only plays a role in keeping pressure</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside,</v>

3653
03:06:44.180 --> 03:06:46.760
<v Speaker 3>so I don't have to shoot that two or</v>
<v Speaker 3>three or four year old buck.</v>

3654
03:06:46.880 --> 03:06:49.820
<v Speaker 3>I can wait till he's five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still have to kill those fidgety</v>

3655
03:06:49.821 --> 03:06:54.821
<v Speaker 3>dose and it's absolutely pure hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand your</v>

3656
03:06:56.010 --> 03:06:58.890
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way the way people disagree is that</v>

3657
03:06:58.891 --> 03:07:00.720
<v Speaker 1>the idea that these animals can never</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>

3658
03:07:00.780 --> 03:07:02.850
<v Speaker 1>They're stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're stuck there so you know that</v>

3659
03:07:02.851 --> 03:07:05.730
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the difference between that and</v>

3660
03:07:05.731 --> 03:07:08.870
<v Speaker 1>like say you go into a back country</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt,</v>

3661
03:07:08.871 --> 03:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>you know you park your truck and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trailhead and hike in twitch and tried</v>

3662
03:07:12.621 --> 03:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you do these animals,</v>

3663
03:07:15.060 --> 03:07:19.200
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea if they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are not white ranch.</v>

3664
03:07:19.230 --> 03:07:21.540
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea whether they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3665
03:07:21.541 --> 03:07:23.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know,</v>

3666
03:07:23.191 --> 03:07:24.550
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3667
03:07:24.570 --> 03:07:26.610
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing to be both,</v>

3668
03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:28.890
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like do people have a problem</v>

3669
03:07:28.920 --> 03:07:33.920
<v Speaker 1>fishing in a stock pond or in a pond?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not stocked but managed on my</v>

3670
03:07:33.961 --> 03:07:38.130
<v Speaker 1>property so that I fish it adequately</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that the basket to be six,</v>

3671
03:07:38.131 --> 03:07:41.010
<v Speaker 1>seven and eight pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't let them get stunted.</v>

3672
03:07:41.400 --> 03:07:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those fishing going anywhere and quite</v>

3673
03:07:43.381 --> 03:07:48.150
<v Speaker 1>honestly in those suburban areas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>urban areas and even farming across</v>

3674
03:07:48.151 --> 03:07:51.120
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those deer are there.</v>

3675
03:07:51.180 --> 03:07:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are there and I have no better</v>

3676
03:07:54.541 --> 03:07:58.740
<v Speaker 1>chance of shooting deer and spirit wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>ranch and the high fence than I do</v>

3677
03:07:58.741 --> 03:08:03.741
<v Speaker 1>hunting the suburbs of Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio where those deer can go everywhere</v>

3678
03:08:03.781 --> 03:08:06.840
<v Speaker 1>except that there is a highway right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and there's a hospital over there</v>

3679
03:08:06.950 --> 03:08:10.230
<v Speaker 1>and there's a school over there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a neighborhood over there and</v>

3680
03:08:10.231 --> 03:08:14.970
<v Speaker 1>there was a factory over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every habitat has its limitations.</v>

3681
03:08:15.920 --> 03:08:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with someone about,</v>

3682
03:08:17.641 --> 03:08:19.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>access deer and Lanai.</v>

3683
03:08:19.230 --> 03:08:20.880
<v Speaker 1>We just got back from Lanai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

3684
03:08:21.410 --> 03:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Populated there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy overpopulated.</v>

3685
03:08:23.850 --> 03:08:28.560
<v Speaker 1>So I said there's two irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000 axis deer and 3000 people on this</v>

3686
03:08:28.561 --> 03:08:30.060
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so someone says to me,</v>

3687
03:08:30.300 --> 03:08:31.710
<v Speaker 1>what's the challenge in that?</v>

3688
03:08:31.710 --> 03:08:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3689
03:08:32.460 --> 03:08:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never seen an axis so uppity.</v>

3690
03:08:34.950 --> 03:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>They are white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the most weird species this side of</v>

3691
03:08:41.220 --> 03:08:45.090
<v Speaker 1>bungle and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say mature,</v>

3692
03:08:45.091 --> 03:08:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Kudu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>

3693
03:08:46.530 --> 03:08:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Tango Bango is a huge antelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually orange with black and</v>

3694
03:08:51.061 --> 03:08:55.350
<v Speaker 1>white stripes from the Central African</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republic and Cameroon.</v>

3695
03:08:55.351 --> 03:08:57.640
<v Speaker 1>And so they evolved to get away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions,</v>

3696
03:08:57.660 --> 03:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>whereas the axis deer evolved to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from tigers.</v>

3697
03:09:00.360 --> 03:09:01.193
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3698
03:09:01.210 --> 03:09:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Just anything that lives around cats</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mule deer,</v>

3699
03:09:03.721 --> 03:09:06.200
<v Speaker 1>high country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just switched on or looking for</v>

3700
03:09:06.900 --> 03:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Michigan deer because there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of either pressure from the</v>

3701
03:09:11.521 --> 03:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>time they're with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about your place in</v>

3702
03:09:13.501 --> 03:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Michigan,</v>

3703
03:09:14.791 --> 03:09:17.790
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to find a large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mature deer,</v>

3704
03:09:17.970 --> 03:09:19.830
<v Speaker 1>not on our property because what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3705
03:09:19.831 --> 03:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>we stopped shooting young ones and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neighbors agree just like they did</v>

3706
03:09:23.041 --> 03:09:24.640
<v Speaker 1>in Buffalo County,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin,</v>

3707
03:09:24.810 --> 03:09:29.250
<v Speaker 1>which is all just decisions by</v>
<v Speaker 1>contiguous land owners to not shoot</v>

3708
03:09:29.251 --> 03:09:32.680
<v Speaker 1>young bucks because somebody shot a $200</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when we get that,</v>

3709
03:09:32.700 --> 03:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I went on my farm so they knew they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3710
03:09:35.401 --> 03:09:39.540
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was so popular because deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting was not popular in guys were</v>

3711
03:09:39.541 --> 03:09:43.560
<v Speaker 1>shooting six and seven year old mammoths</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the hundreds that started deer</v>

3712
03:09:43.561 --> 03:09:45.720
<v Speaker 1>hunting went well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not shooting at two year old,</v>

3713
03:09:45.721 --> 03:09:48.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bulger buck because joe down the road</v>

3714
03:09:48.691 --> 03:09:50.790
<v Speaker 1>got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a massive stag.</v>

3715
03:09:50.791 --> 03:09:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wait for one of them and by</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting them they do</v>

3716
03:09:54.220 --> 03:09:58.480
<v Speaker 3>get older and they do have that</v>
<v Speaker 3>mysticism of stagnant,</v>

3717
03:09:58.481 --> 03:10:01.750
<v Speaker 3>which is better for the population</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the bad guy gets to breed</v>

3718
03:10:02.260 --> 03:10:05.530
<v Speaker 3>geared and spread those good genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about that to let people go.</v>

3719
03:10:05.531 --> 03:10:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Trophy hunting takes out the best jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3720
03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:09.700
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does not understand.</v>

3721
03:10:09.701 --> 03:10:12.640
<v Speaker 3>We keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We keep setting records for deer and</v>

3722
03:10:12.641 --> 03:10:17.260
<v Speaker 3>Moose and elk and Caribou and bear and</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain lion and antelope every year.</v>

3723
03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:22.320
<v Speaker 3>We set world records constantly because</v>
<v Speaker 3>our hunting system of being disciplined</v>

3724
03:10:22.751 --> 03:10:25.630
<v Speaker 3>and waiting for that mature animal are</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting system,</v>

3725
03:10:25.631 --> 03:10:30.631
<v Speaker 3>has produced the healthiest most</v>
<v Speaker 3>monstrosity specimens in the history of</v>

3726
03:10:31.031 --> 03:10:35.920
<v Speaker 3>record keeping every year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're not hurting anything by being</v>

3727
03:10:35.921 --> 03:10:39.430
<v Speaker 3>disciplined and patient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've learned over the years and my</v>

3728
03:10:39.431 --> 03:10:43.300
<v Speaker 3>son is very adamant about in so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters are.</v>

3729
03:10:43.480 --> 03:10:46.570
<v Speaker 3>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a mysticism to that mature stag.</v>

3730
03:10:47.470 --> 03:10:52.180
<v Speaker 3>The breeders of our ancestors were the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best hunters and they did the breeding</v>

3731
03:10:52.181 --> 03:10:57.181
<v Speaker 3>because they were more resourceful and</v>
<v Speaker 3>more intelligently connected to the</v>

3732
03:10:57.431 --> 03:11:00.220
<v Speaker 3>system by which we fed the tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those,</v>

3733
03:11:00.430 --> 03:11:03.640
<v Speaker 3>those killer stag hunters were always</v>
<v Speaker 3>the leader of,</v>

3734
03:11:03.820 --> 03:11:05.470
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of tribes.</v>

3735
03:11:05.471 --> 03:11:10.471
<v Speaker 3>And in it's still that way today I'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to think and also this pursuit of</v>

3736
03:11:11.170 --> 03:11:14.050
<v Speaker 4>bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is more difficult and more</v>

3737
03:11:14.051 --> 03:11:18.730
<v Speaker 4>rewarding because it's more difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is many levels more difficult when</v>

3738
03:11:18.731 --> 03:11:22.240
<v Speaker 4>you're chasing after a 200 inch box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because this is a six,</v>

3739
03:11:22.241 --> 03:11:26.530
<v Speaker 4>seven year old animal that's been</v>
<v Speaker 4>avoiding mountain lions and bears and</v>

3740
03:11:26.531 --> 03:11:29.680
<v Speaker 4>whatever else is trying to eat it for</v>
<v Speaker 4>years and years,</v>

3741
03:11:29.681 --> 03:11:32.620
<v Speaker 4>this thing is switched on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take very clever paths.</v>

3742
03:11:32.621 --> 03:11:37.270
<v Speaker 4>They let the dose and the Fonz Wander on</v>
<v Speaker 4>first and they laid back and typically</v>

3743
03:11:37.271 --> 03:11:37.990
<v Speaker 4>come out around,</v>

3744
03:11:37.990 --> 03:11:40.960
<v Speaker 3>turn to come out about midnight and go</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to bed around one.</v>

3745
03:11:41.380 --> 03:11:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Now there is a variance there in south</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas where a age management was created</v>

3746
03:11:48.220 --> 03:11:52.060
<v Speaker 3>because they they supplement and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a center pivot agriculture down in</v>

3747
03:11:52.061 --> 03:11:55.930
<v Speaker 3>the deserts of south Texas and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic is a very fortified genetic.</v>

3748
03:11:55.931 --> 03:11:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 pound deer are not that rare.</v>

3749
03:11:58.710 --> 03:12:00.790
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people think all deer in Texas</v>
<v Speaker 3>are little,</v>

3750
03:12:00.791 --> 03:12:03.280
<v Speaker 3>but they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you let them grow,</v>

3751
03:12:03.310 --> 03:12:08.310
<v Speaker 3>which texts is pretty much pioneered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those bucks in south Texas are the</v>

3752
03:12:11.020 --> 03:12:15.370
<v Speaker 3>easiest deer on the planet to kill and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of dynamics.</v>

3753
03:12:15.520 --> 03:12:20.440
<v Speaker 3>There's just some strange genetic</v>
<v Speaker 3>lineage there that they're a calmer</v>

3754
03:12:20.441 --> 03:12:23.080
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus they're on wide open,</v>

3755
03:12:23.350 --> 03:12:27.310
<v Speaker 3>vast private ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means they don't get the public</v>

3756
03:12:27.311 --> 03:12:32.140
<v Speaker 3>hordes of pressure and once that book is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a button buck the first year,</v>

3757
03:12:32.260 --> 03:12:34.840
<v Speaker 3>nobody shoots at him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he encounters.</v>

3758
03:12:34.841 --> 03:12:36.670
<v Speaker 3>He smells that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he sees that person,</v>

3759
03:12:36.790 --> 03:12:38.500
<v Speaker 3>he hears that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

3760
03:12:38.650 --> 03:12:40.120
<v Speaker 3>Second year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little booger.</v>

3761
03:12:40.121 --> 03:12:42.150
<v Speaker 3>Buck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ran into people.</v>

3762
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody messed with him.</v>

3763
03:12:44.610 --> 03:12:48.750
<v Speaker 3>Third Year she's got a nice little rack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still run into people.</v>

3764
03:12:49.540 --> 03:12:52.190
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some corn is where the</v>

3765
03:12:52.250 --> 03:12:54.380
<v Speaker 1>wheat field is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smelled that guy,</v>

3766
03:12:54.381 --> 03:12:55.520
<v Speaker 1>but male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>

3767
03:12:55.521 --> 03:12:57.440
<v Speaker 1>he's never bothered me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just keep you in fourth year,</v>

3768
03:12:57.441 --> 03:13:01.490
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they reduce their fear factor of the</v>

3769
03:13:01.491 --> 03:13:04.880
<v Speaker 1>encounter with humans because nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot at them because they're not going</v>

3770
03:13:04.881 --> 03:13:06.830
<v Speaker 1>to shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is that natural,</v>

3771
03:13:07.640 --> 03:13:09.700
<v Speaker 1>but probably isn't with nappy</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered.</v>

3772
03:13:09.701 --> 03:13:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Like that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like this is a pet or a</v>

3773
03:13:12.240 --> 03:13:14.040
<v Speaker 1>farmer about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3774
03:13:14.041 --> 03:13:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a relaxed animal that he's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressured,</v>

3775
03:13:16.850 --> 03:13:19.580
<v Speaker 1>which not just relaxed but accustomed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

3776
03:13:19.581 --> 03:13:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're still elusive.</v>

3777
03:13:21.141 --> 03:13:22.740
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to walk up to them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

3778
03:13:22.830 --> 03:13:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

3779
03:13:24.021 --> 03:13:28.340
<v Speaker 1>there are some places down there where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get so relaxed that they do hand</v>

3780
03:13:28.341 --> 03:13:31.430
<v Speaker 1>feed some of the dose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get so relaxed.</v>

3781
03:13:31.460 --> 03:13:33.000
<v Speaker 1>That seems so strange to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3782
03:13:33.150 --> 03:13:36.910
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's got their own little</v>
<v Speaker 1>preference and I,</v>

3783
03:13:36.950 --> 03:13:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I've never thought of wildlife as pets.</v>

3784
03:13:39.230 --> 03:13:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I just wouldn't own a deer as a pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

3785
03:13:42.770 --> 03:13:46.220
<v Speaker 1>You're asking for trouble and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>

3786
03:13:46.400 --> 03:13:48.090
<v Speaker 1>but if that's what you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3787
03:13:48.350 --> 03:13:49.730
<v Speaker 1>have a nice day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3788
03:13:49.731 --> 03:13:51.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those farms,</v>

3789
03:13:51.280 --> 03:13:52.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deer farms,</v>

3790
03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:57.950
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the primary ideas of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>source of CBC Cwd,</v>

3791
03:13:57.951 --> 03:13:58.784
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3792
03:13:58.790 --> 03:14:03.440
<v Speaker 1>they think that a lot of it comes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>deere phones came from Colorado</v>

3793
03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:03.981
<v Speaker 1>Department of Wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

3794
03:14:03.981 --> 03:14:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>67.</v>

3795
03:14:05.081 --> 03:14:08.330
<v Speaker 1>They injected scrapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the sheep version of the</v>

3796
03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:11.990
<v Speaker 1>sponge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A forum and stuff elect me into the mule</v>

3797
03:14:11.991 --> 03:14:14.870
<v Speaker 1>deer in 1967 and they got out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it started.</v>

3798
03:14:14.880 --> 03:14:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Why did they inject?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can not imagine bureaucrats be an</v>

3799
03:14:18.181 --> 03:14:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect.</v>

3800
03:14:19.460 --> 03:14:22.170
<v Speaker 1>And so that is some sort of experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the,</v>

3801
03:14:22.320 --> 03:14:24.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sheep were more popular in America</v>

3802
03:14:24.861 --> 03:14:27.290
<v Speaker 1>than cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were way more sheep and cattle</v>

3803
03:14:27.410 --> 03:14:28.970
<v Speaker 1>until scrape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These came in,</v>

3804
03:14:28.971 --> 03:14:32.060
<v Speaker 1>which is that that cwd version for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep,</v>

3805
03:14:32.090 --> 03:14:35.720
<v Speaker 1>mad cow and bovines and Crutchfield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob and humans,</v>

3806
03:14:36.080 --> 03:14:37.040
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crutchfield.</v>

3807
03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Jacob was a result to scientists</v>
<v Speaker 1>determined by the scientists,</v>

3808
03:14:40.701 --> 03:14:43.760
<v Speaker 1>crutchfield end Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Indonesians,</v>

3809
03:14:44.090 --> 03:14:47.150
<v Speaker 1>people that got this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sponge of forum,</v>

3810
03:14:47.260 --> 03:14:52.260
<v Speaker 1>a condition from a prion because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>ate the brains of their conquered</v>

3811
03:14:52.821 --> 03:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never a good idea.</v>

3812
03:14:55.700 --> 03:14:58.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm aware of all this stuff,</v>

3813
03:14:58.310 --> 03:15:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but believe me when I tell you live on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Joe Rogan podcast,</v>

3814
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:08.590
<v Speaker 1>the cwd hysteria is a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More deer are killed in Michigan every</v>

3815
03:15:11.870 --> 03:15:16.870
<v Speaker 1>year by feral dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all the deer ever worldwide by cwd.</v>

3816
03:15:18.980 --> 03:15:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I think the concern though with cwd is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's spreading.</v>

3817
03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:25.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not my friend Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his farm in Wisconsin,</v>

3818
03:15:25.911 --> 03:15:30.320
<v Speaker 1>they're just starting to test positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>for cwd know why?</v>

3819
03:15:30.610 --> 03:15:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Because they're looking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3820
03:15:32.001 --> 03:15:34.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that they were looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it before,</v>

3821
03:15:34.071 --> 03:15:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but they think that it's come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals that get out of these high fence</v>

3822
03:15:38.091 --> 03:15:42.190
<v Speaker 1>farm operations where they all feed from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same trough and they they,</v>

3823
03:15:42.240 --> 03:15:45.740
<v Speaker 1>they spread this from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no evidence to support</v>

3824
03:15:45.741 --> 03:15:48.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr James Crow just testified with me in</v>

3825
03:15:48.990 --> 03:15:50.990
<v Speaker 1>front of the Michigan Natural Resource</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commission</v>

3826
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:55.440
<v Speaker 3>and Department of Natural Resources and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the exhaustive studies have</v>

3827
03:15:55.441 --> 03:16:00.441
<v Speaker 3>concluded that cwd cannot be cross</v>
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>

3828
03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:03.930
<v Speaker 3>You can't get by eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Person.</v>

3829
03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Person can't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They they had on macaque monkeys get up,</v>

3830
03:16:07.981 --> 03:16:11.890
<v Speaker 3>but that's because the injected massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>quantities into the brain of a cop</v>

3831
03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:14.040
<v Speaker 3>monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise they couldn't get in.</v>

3832
03:16:14.550 --> 03:16:19.550
<v Speaker 3>But cwd Wisconsin spent $70,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making that number up.</v>

3833
03:16:21.360 --> 03:16:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin spent $70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars,</v>

3834
03:16:24.120 --> 03:16:28.170
<v Speaker 3>tried to eradicate certain hers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a virtual impossibility by the</v>

3835
03:16:28.171 --> 03:16:29.790
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even if you were successful,</v>

3836
03:16:30.110 --> 03:16:32.880
<v Speaker 3>the the mutated prion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3837
03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:38.000
<v Speaker 3>they stay in the ground typically</v>
<v Speaker 3>through urine and there isn't a part of</v>

3838
03:16:38.320 --> 03:16:42.510
<v Speaker 3>plants as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no evidence whatsoever that</v>

3839
03:16:42.511 --> 03:16:47.511
<v Speaker 3>cwd is ever compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A servant heard it.</v>

3840
03:16:47.790 --> 03:16:50.630
<v Speaker 3>There's been no reduce seasons even in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the epicenter,</v>

3841
03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:53.940
<v Speaker 3>the endemic areas of Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wyoming where it started,</v>

3842
03:16:53.941 --> 03:16:57.000
<v Speaker 3>where it's the most prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No seasons have been reduced,</v>

3843
03:16:57.270 --> 03:17:00.930
<v Speaker 3>no reduced tags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no reduced in harvest.</v>

3844
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:06.830
<v Speaker 3>It's in consequential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It occurs so rarely.</v>

3845
03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:12.830
<v Speaker 3>They've studied the deer for 18 years in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin and deer that had cwd 18 years</v>

3846
03:17:14.161 --> 03:17:17.670
<v Speaker 3>collared and monitored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still having funds,</v>

3847
03:17:18.180 --> 03:17:22.170
<v Speaker 3>they say it's always fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not always fatal.</v>

3848
03:17:22.320 --> 03:17:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Go to the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dear a slash facebook.</v>

3849
03:17:25.921 --> 03:17:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Either Dr Dr. Com slash facebook or</v>
<v Speaker 3>failure.</v>

3850
03:17:28.890 --> 03:17:33.060
<v Speaker 3>You're not worried about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not worried about bureaucrats that have</v>

3851
03:17:33.061 --> 03:17:38.061
<v Speaker 3>scared away hunters in Wisconsin and</v>
<v Speaker 3>caused butchers to quit processing deer</v>

3852
03:17:38.551 --> 03:17:43.551
<v Speaker 3>because of the manufactured hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CWD is not a concern.</v>

3853
03:17:44.310 --> 03:17:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Buicks kill more deer than cwd it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3854
03:17:48.770 --> 03:17:51.200
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bureaucrats go in and slaughtered</v>

3855
03:17:51.201 --> 03:17:54.120
<v Speaker 3>dear by the thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if cwd is killed,</v>

3856
03:17:54.121 --> 03:17:56.730
<v Speaker 3>58 deer in Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has,</v>

3857
03:17:57.240 --> 03:17:58.890
<v Speaker 3>they found,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3858
03:17:59.010 --> 03:18:02.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't think any of them were fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they had to kill him though they</v>

3859
03:18:02.281 --> 03:18:04.200
<v Speaker 3>did find one in Jackson County.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They claim,</v>

3860
03:18:04.201 --> 03:18:06.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't believe bureaucrats.</v>

3861
03:18:06.300 --> 03:18:07.590
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the bureaucrats.</v>

3862
03:18:07.591 --> 03:18:12.591
<v Speaker 3>Joel in Michigan that claimed that there</v>
<v Speaker 3>were quote 5,000 to 7,000 Russian boar</v>

3863
03:18:13.561 --> 03:18:16.380
<v Speaker 3>running wild and Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we analyze that,</v>

3864
03:18:16.381 --> 03:18:19.470
<v Speaker 3>analyze that claim for a moment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you can tell me Joe,</v>

3865
03:18:19.590 --> 03:18:23.460
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is a Russian boy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what a Russian boar is.</v>

3866
03:18:23.550 --> 03:18:28.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a male pig in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no such genius as a Russian</v>

3867
03:18:28.321 --> 03:18:31.260
<v Speaker 3>boar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all wives tale bullshit.</v>

3868
03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:34.800
<v Speaker 3>That was the official statement by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>game agency in Michigan.</v>

3869
03:18:34.801 --> 03:18:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sons of bitches and then they claim,</v>

3870
03:18:37.620 --> 03:18:41.160
<v Speaker 3>and here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So isn't it our moral and spiritual</v>

3871
03:18:41.161 --> 03:18:44.940
<v Speaker 3>obligation to wisely use the animals we</v>
<v Speaker 3>harvest,</v>

3872
03:18:44.970 --> 03:18:46.380
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3873
03:18:47.320 --> 03:18:49.930
<v Speaker 3>In Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the farmers can slaughter sandhill</v>

3874
03:18:49.931 --> 03:18:51.910
<v Speaker 3>cranes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are known as rib eye in the sky,</v>

3875
03:18:51.911 --> 03:18:53.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be delicious.</v>

3876
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:58.240
<v Speaker 3>It is farmers and Michigan's can can</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot sandhill cranes,</v>

3877
03:18:58.241 --> 03:19:01.720
<v Speaker 3>but by law are not allowed to eat them.</v>

3878
03:19:01.870 --> 03:19:04.510
<v Speaker 3>What is this a game department you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust?</v>

3879
03:19:04.511 --> 03:19:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

3880
03:19:05.441 --> 03:19:06.570
<v Speaker 3>I will not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

3881
03:19:06.730 --> 03:19:09.480
<v Speaker 3>You heard me right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to eat sand.</v>

3882
03:19:09.940 --> 03:19:14.530
<v Speaker 3>This game department is going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me about wildlife management when</v>

3883
03:19:14.531 --> 03:19:17.590
<v Speaker 3>they claimed there were 6,000 or 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian born.</v>

3884
03:19:17.591 --> 03:19:20.200
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say there were 6,000,</v>

3885
03:19:20.201 --> 03:19:24.070
<v Speaker 3>5,000 to 7,000 wild pigs and Michigan</v>
<v Speaker 3>back when they claimed it in the</v>

3886
03:19:24.071 --> 03:19:26.050
<v Speaker 3>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how many that would be today?</v>

3887
03:19:26.380 --> 03:19:29.650
<v Speaker 3>Show me some game cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>800,000 deer hunters in Michigan.</v>

3888
03:19:29.710 --> 03:19:30.350
<v Speaker 3>What are there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

3889
03:19:30.350 --> 03:19:33.520
<v Speaker 3>20,000 game cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lie.</v>

3890
03:19:33.730 --> 03:19:37.930
<v Speaker 3>Cwd is ally cwd as killed 58 deer in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michigan,</v>

3891
03:19:37.931 --> 03:19:42.931
<v Speaker 3>so they claim the dnr has authorized the</v>
<v Speaker 3>slaughter of tens of thousands.</v>

3892
03:19:43.690 --> 03:19:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Who's the enemy of the deer hunter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bureaucrats are.</v>

3893
03:19:47.350 --> 03:19:51.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you in Michigan they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost their souls.</v>

3894
03:19:51.520 --> 03:19:54.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a heartbreaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't understand the rationale for not</v>

3895
03:19:54.431 --> 03:19:55.270
<v Speaker 3>eating sandhill cranes.</v>

3896
03:19:55.270 --> 03:19:56.230
<v Speaker 3>There is none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What w?</v>

3897
03:19:56.250 --> 03:19:57.580
<v Speaker 3>What are they saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you shoot them,</v>

3898
03:19:57.581 --> 03:19:59.980
<v Speaker 3>you have to just let them rot bay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to bury.</v>

3899
03:20:00.030 --> 03:20:02.950
<v Speaker 3>So we're shooting them as a nuisance</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals that the idea,</v>

3900
03:20:02.980 --> 03:20:05.320
<v Speaker 3>even if even if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea,</v>

3901
03:20:05.440 --> 03:20:06.740
<v Speaker 3>but here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the truth,</v>

3902
03:20:06.741 --> 03:20:09.910
<v Speaker 3>here's the guitar tags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guitar player will help.</v>

3903
03:20:09.911 --> 03:20:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's enough sand,</v>

3904
03:20:12.311 --> 03:20:16.270
<v Speaker 3>no cranes for farmers to shoot open the</v>
<v Speaker 3>season,</v>

3905
03:20:16.450 --> 03:20:21.220
<v Speaker 3>sell licenses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>create a management plan and show some</v>

3906
03:20:21.221 --> 03:20:25.600
<v Speaker 3>decency and respect and let us eat the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rib eye in the sky.</v>

3907
03:20:25.810 --> 03:20:29.080
<v Speaker 3>You stupid bastards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3908
03:20:29.081 --> 03:20:30.010
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

3909
03:20:30.011 --> 03:20:31.600
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm confrontational now,</v>

3910
03:20:31.630 --> 03:20:34.080
<v Speaker 3>but because I've been confronted with an</v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive,</v>

3911
03:20:34.780 --> 03:20:39.780
<v Speaker 3>a criminal law that forbids us to</v>
<v Speaker 3>utilize God's precious protein.</v>

3912
03:20:41.160 --> 03:20:45.550
<v Speaker 3>This is bizarre world that doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sense.</v>

3913
03:20:45.551 --> 03:20:48.970
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning who the picture of the dove on</v>

3914
03:20:48.971 --> 03:20:52.900
<v Speaker 3>millions of boxes of Ammo in Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a picture of a dove and it says</v>

3915
03:20:52.901 --> 03:20:54.910
<v Speaker 3>game load,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Michigan Dnr will say,</v>

3916
03:20:54.911 --> 03:20:55.451
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3917
03:20:55.451 --> 03:20:58.300
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a song bird.</v>

3918
03:20:58.750 --> 03:21:03.000
<v Speaker 3>You can't shoot them and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's it's planet of the apes and it's</v>

3919
03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Cooper's people that don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 3>background whatsoever in wildlife for</v>

3920
03:21:06.971 --> 03:21:10.330
<v Speaker 3>hunting as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that they're trained biologists.</v>

3921
03:21:10.340 --> 03:21:11.200
<v Speaker 3>That's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3922
03:21:11.620 --> 03:21:14.680
<v Speaker 3>and they're influenced by politicians</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bureaucrats.</v>

3923
03:21:14.681 --> 03:21:17.260
<v Speaker 3>They're liars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That question to wild boar,</v>

3924
03:21:17.261 --> 03:21:20.080
<v Speaker 3>like whenever I go to a restaurant it</v>
<v Speaker 3>says like wild boar sausage,</v>

3925
03:21:20.130 --> 03:21:21.260
<v Speaker 3>like how do you know it was a male?</v>

3926
03:21:23.610 --> 03:21:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Why are you calling it a boar wild pig?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

3927
03:21:26.570 --> 03:21:30.460
<v Speaker 3>It's a sound sexy Russian bores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have 8,000 Russian boards.</v>

3928
03:21:30.461 --> 03:21:31.294
<v Speaker 3>What are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gang?</v>

3929
03:21:31.490 --> 03:21:33.010
<v Speaker 3>They're out there in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Band each other.</v>

3930
03:21:33.160 --> 03:21:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank God they're all males there.</v>

3931
03:21:35.381 --> 03:21:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they did have 8,000 boys and</v>

3932
03:21:38.111 --> 03:21:39.790
<v Speaker 3>they're all going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the fucking check?</v>

3933
03:21:39.791 --> 03:21:44.290
<v Speaker 3>But how can the game department use that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of terminology?</v>

3934
03:21:44.320 --> 03:21:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a real problem with a straight</v>

3935
03:21:45.891 --> 03:21:46.580
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

3936
03:21:46.580 --> 03:21:47.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when they,</v>

3937
03:21:47.870 --> 03:21:50.660
<v Speaker 1>when they speak about it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you immediately dismiss what they're</v>

3938
03:21:50.661 --> 03:21:51.860
<v Speaker 1>saying because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

3939
03:21:52.100 --> 03:21:55.430
<v Speaker 1>They're not being accurate and not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate with describing what the animal</v>

3940
03:21:55.431 --> 03:21:58.430
<v Speaker 1>is and you're inclined to dismiss</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

3941
03:21:58.490 --> 03:22:02.630
<v Speaker 1>so you're only allowed to shoot those</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandhill cranes as a nuisance animal.</v>

3942
03:22:02.631 --> 03:22:05.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't shoot them and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

3943
03:22:05.480 --> 03:22:06.520
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there,</v>

3944
03:22:06.521 --> 03:22:07.790
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere.</v>

3945
03:22:07.791 --> 03:22:10.710
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of sandhill cranes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michigan to open the season in.</v>

3946
03:22:10.711 --> 03:22:13.130
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever talked to senators and</v>

3947
03:22:13.131 --> 03:22:13.881
<v Speaker 1>congressmen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

3948
03:22:13.881 --> 03:22:14.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

3949
03:22:14.510 --> 03:22:16.170
<v Speaker 1>You can't shoot sandhill cranes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

3950
03:22:16.171 --> 03:22:18.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a game bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had dirt bag.</v>

3951
03:22:18.240 --> 03:22:21.920
<v Speaker 1>You need to cook it for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the episode of Rinella show</v>

3952
03:22:21.921 --> 03:22:22.850
<v Speaker 1>and they were cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3953
03:22:22.851 --> 03:22:26.150
<v Speaker 1>that looks like a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time read animal.</v>

3954
03:22:26.220 --> 03:22:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red Meat.</v>

3955
03:22:27.880 --> 03:22:30.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just tragic in California.</v>

3956
03:22:30.411 --> 03:22:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Can Eat mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to bury him.</v>

3957
03:22:32.330 --> 03:22:35.630
<v Speaker 1>He told me he didn't eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you shot one with the depredation</v>

3958
03:22:35.631 --> 03:22:37.340
<v Speaker 1>permit and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3959
03:22:37.460 --> 03:22:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

3960
03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:44.000
<v Speaker 1>That's indecent in the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm confrontational.</v>

3961
03:22:44.780 --> 03:22:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm confronting indecency and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some honesty involved and you can't</v>

3962
03:22:50.361 --> 03:22:54.980
<v Speaker 1>do it by backing off and being Mitt</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romney like and bring a doily to a</v>

3963
03:22:54.981 --> 03:22:55.814
<v Speaker 1>grenade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

3964

<v Speaker 1>Doily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to bring an eight,</v>

3965
03:22:57.981 --> 03:23:01.190

<v Speaker 1>Ted,</v>

<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just flew by because it's a love fest of</v>

3969
03:23:09.981 --> 03:23:11.660
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logic and common sense.</v>

3970
03:23:12.230 --> 03:23:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man has been a pleasure to meet.</v>

3971
03:23:15.180 --> 03:23:19.340
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to sit down with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>again and have a good conversation here.</v>

3972
03:23:19.370 --> 03:23:22.730
<v Speaker 1>My friends were right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do deserve me and I think it's,</v>

3973
03:23:22.880 --> 03:23:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good opportunity for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to get a chance to see you in a</v>

3974
03:23:26.571 --> 03:23:29.960
<v Speaker 1>long form conversation rather than these</v>
<v Speaker 1>soundbites they could just choose to</v>

3975
03:23:29.961 --> 03:23:31.880
<v Speaker 1>hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they sound bites her</v>

3976
03:23:31.881 --> 03:23:35.180
<v Speaker 1>edited and a manufacturer has it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make it perfectly clear.</v>

3977
03:23:35.240 --> 03:23:37.970
<v Speaker 1>I did not avoid the draft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did nothing.</v>

3978
03:23:38.330 --> 03:23:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to that.</v>

3979
03:23:39.291 --> 03:23:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I am raising real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was an old school story of an</v>

3980
03:23:43.671 --> 03:23:47.120
<v Speaker 1>interview supposedly that you should all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over yourself and hype type.</v>

3981
03:23:47.570 --> 03:23:48.403
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

3982
03:23:48.460 --> 03:23:51.200
<v Speaker 1>you know me pretty well in the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours.</v>

3983
03:23:51.380 --> 03:23:54.320
<v Speaker 1>If I had shit on myself to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the draft,</v>

3984
03:23:54.340 --> 03:23:56.390
<v Speaker 1>do you think for a minute?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would deny it.</v>

3985
03:23:56.630 --> 03:23:59.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the stories out about.</v>

3986
03:24:00.260 --> 03:24:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I went in and got my draft physical and</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3987
03:24:03.381 --> 03:24:05.990
<v Speaker 1>when I win in 1969,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was superman.</v>

3988
03:24:05.990 --> 03:24:08.660
<v Speaker 1>I literally would hurdle Volkswagen</v>
<v Speaker 1>bugs.</v>

3989
03:24:08.750 --> 03:24:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I was all muscle and sinew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could.</v>

3990
03:24:12.620 --> 03:24:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I was superman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the most athletic running,</v>

3991
03:24:15.531 --> 03:24:18.890
<v Speaker 1>jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gazelle known demand,</v>

3992
03:24:19.250 --> 03:24:21.560
<v Speaker 1>and I went in for my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anything about Vietnam.</v>

3993
03:24:21.561 --> 03:24:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anything about war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad was a war hero,</v>

3994
03:24:23.841 --> 03:24:27.020
<v Speaker 1>but nobody talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard of the Bataan death march.</v>

3995
03:24:27.021 --> 03:24:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I graduated from the American education</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

3996
03:24:29.210 --> 03:24:32.840
<v Speaker 1>so I knew nothing and there was all</v>
<v Speaker 1>protests around me,</v>

3997
03:24:32.841 --> 03:24:36.530
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't really tuned into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>protests because I was making music</v>

3998
03:24:36.531 --> 03:24:39.050
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just obsessed with the amboy</v>

3999
03:24:39.051 --> 03:24:42.260
<v Speaker 1>dukes and playing gigs every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't pay attention.</v>

4000
03:24:42.261 --> 03:24:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I never watched a in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

4001
03:24:44.100 --> 03:24:45.990
<v Speaker 3>I was given a draft notice and I went</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

4002
03:24:45.991 --> 03:24:48.450
<v Speaker 3>I went down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had my draft physical and I passed</v>

4003
03:24:48.451 --> 03:24:52.270
<v Speaker 3>with flying cover colors and I got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>draft card in the mail a couple of</v>

4004
03:24:52.280 --> 03:24:53.300
<v Speaker 3>months later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4005
03:24:53.430 --> 03:24:55.170
<v Speaker 3>through my mom and dad's house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one,</v>

4006
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:59.700
<v Speaker 3>why not a deferment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a designation.</v>

4007
03:24:59.910 --> 03:25:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I was in Oakland Community College at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

4008
03:25:03.210 --> 03:25:06.900
<v Speaker 3>so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why was a student a designation?</v>

4009
03:25:06.901 --> 03:25:08.580
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was ready to rock.</v>

4010
03:25:08.940 --> 03:25:09.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to go.</v>

4011
03:25:09.931 --> 03:25:12.100
<v Speaker 3>I didn't understand me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my buddies were going,</v>

4012
03:25:12.210 --> 03:25:12.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4013
03:25:12.990 --> 03:25:15.360
<v Speaker 3>John Break,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my singer had to go,</v>

4014
03:25:15.870 --> 03:25:19.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rob Leonard from Amboy.</v>

4015
03:25:19.231 --> 03:25:20.940
<v Speaker 3>Dukes had to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4016
03:25:21.010 --> 03:25:23.490
<v Speaker 3>so the only way you could have gone as</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you dropped out of school,</v>

4017
03:25:23.491 --> 03:25:24.560
<v Speaker 3>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4018
03:25:25.020 --> 03:25:26.250
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a deferment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4019
03:25:26.251 --> 03:25:26.750
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4020
03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I would have been called anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could have been called or just</v>

4021
03:25:30.421 --> 03:25:30.720
<v Speaker 3>weren't.</v>

4022
03:25:30.720 --> 03:25:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the wikipedia claims,</v>

4023
03:25:33.031 --> 03:25:36.550
<v Speaker 3>I got a four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>f four f what is a four f four F emmys.</v>

4024
03:25:36.610 --> 03:25:40.410
<v Speaker 3>You're physically incapable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been physically incapable of</v>

4025
03:25:40.411 --> 03:25:43.190
<v Speaker 3>anything so they make this shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

4026
03:25:43.191 --> 03:25:46.200
<v Speaker 3>So I did an interview with high times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

4027
03:25:46.201 --> 03:25:48.510
<v Speaker 3>let's make it clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done this so many times that people</v>

4028
03:25:48.600 --> 03:25:52.560
<v Speaker 3>ignore my actual statements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had been doing interviews all</v>

4029
03:25:52.580 --> 03:25:56.190
<v Speaker 3>because the employee dukes were on fire</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was just an outrage on stage with</v>

4030
03:25:56.191 --> 03:26:00.060
<v Speaker 3>the loin cloth and the bone Arrow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>feedback and he's killer songs and the</v>

4031
03:26:00.061 --> 03:26:02.550
<v Speaker 3>band was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greatest musicians in the world.</v>

4032
03:26:02.700 --> 03:26:06.450
<v Speaker 3>So I did interviews all the time talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the music I loved and they never</v>

4033
03:26:06.451 --> 03:26:10.560
<v Speaker 3>got anything right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These stone dirt bag hippie writers get</v>

4034
03:26:10.561 --> 03:26:14.250
<v Speaker 3>the gas guys in the band's names wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got the facility wrong,</v>

4035
03:26:14.490 --> 03:26:19.290
<v Speaker 3>they mentioned songs we didn't perform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got nothing right.</v>

4036
03:26:19.290 --> 03:26:21.150
<v Speaker 3>And every time I'd read the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

4037
03:26:21.151 --> 03:26:24.990
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about my music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't even get the song titles</v>

4038
03:26:24.991 --> 03:26:27.210
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started having fun with these</v>

4039
03:26:27.230 --> 03:26:29.310
<v Speaker 3>interviewers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much to the entertainment of my band</v>

4040
03:26:29.311 --> 03:26:33.880
<v Speaker 3>mates who would break out in hysterics</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'd make up stories because I'm not</v>

4041
03:26:33.881 --> 03:26:35.460
<v Speaker 3>going to even try to be accurate</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

4042
03:26:35.580 --> 03:26:40.080
<v Speaker 3>It was an ongoing maneuver of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd have these hippie writers come in</v>

4043
03:26:40.081 --> 03:26:42.150
<v Speaker 3>to take notes and I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4044
03:26:42.151 --> 03:26:45.810
<v Speaker 3>I played his fender stratocaster as I</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold up my Gibson bird land,</v>

4045
03:26:45.811 --> 03:26:47.870
<v Speaker 3>which was known for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'd write down,</v>

4046
03:26:47.880 --> 03:26:52.880
<v Speaker 3>he played in a Gibson a stratocaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as a guest.</v>

4047
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:57.510
<v Speaker 3>So I was having fun with dirt bag anti</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists.</v>

4048
03:26:57.570 --> 03:27:01.830
<v Speaker 3>So now I'm invited to high times</v>
<v Speaker 3>magazine and I was hardcore anti-drug.</v>

4049
03:27:02.400 --> 03:27:04.530
<v Speaker 3>So I go in and this guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

4050
03:27:08.100 --> 03:27:08.933
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4051
03:27:10.190 --> 03:27:11.960
<v Speaker 3>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me about,</v>

4052
03:27:11.961 --> 03:27:14.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this I am boy,</v>

4053
03:27:14.120 --> 03:27:14.950
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

4054
03:27:14.950 --> 03:27:17.220
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it like a band?</v>

4055
03:27:17.400 --> 03:27:17.821
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4056
03:27:17.821 --> 03:27:21.910
<v Speaker 3>it's like a band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost exactly like a bad fuck</v>

4057
03:27:22.040 --> 03:27:23.550
<v Speaker 3>kind of question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this,</v>

4058
03:27:24.140 --> 03:27:26.470
<v Speaker 3>how did this get started?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Draft.</v>

4059
03:27:26.520 --> 03:27:28.650
<v Speaker 3>So anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we started talking about when I'm with</v>

4060
03:27:28.651 --> 03:27:30.780
<v Speaker 3>the MC five and the stooges and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

4061
03:27:30.980 --> 03:27:31.950
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>

4062
03:27:31.951 --> 03:27:34.170
<v Speaker 3>I was snorting something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it was,</v>

4063
03:27:34.230 --> 03:27:35.820
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got higher than a kite.</v>

4064
03:27:35.821 --> 03:27:36.870
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

4065
03:27:36.880 --> 03:27:38.670
<v Speaker 3>you think it might've been a crystal</v>
<v Speaker 3>meth?</v>

4066
03:27:38.671 --> 03:27:39.181
<v Speaker 3>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4067
03:27:39.181 --> 03:27:41.070
<v Speaker 3>that's what they called it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never snorted,</v>

4068
03:27:41.410 --> 03:27:43.450
<v Speaker 3>just made up some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just went nuts.</v>

4069
03:27:43.451 --> 03:27:45.790
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went into the war thing and I go,</v>

4070
03:27:45.791 --> 03:27:47.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

4071
03:27:47.290 --> 03:27:50.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm a guitar player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I went down for my draft physical</v>

4072
03:27:50.111 --> 03:27:53.350
<v Speaker 3>and when I went into the a booth to give</v>
<v Speaker 3>my urine sample,</v>

4073
03:27:53.351 --> 03:27:55.630
<v Speaker 3>I made sure I eat Mexican food all week.</v>

4074
03:27:55.630 --> 03:27:59.050
<v Speaker 3>So instead of pissing in the Urine Cup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a big dump in it was green and</v>

4075
03:27:59.051 --> 03:28:00.400
<v Speaker 3>went all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy went,</v>

4076
03:28:01.330 --> 03:28:05.440
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really ain't really.</v>

4077
03:28:05.770 --> 03:28:08.950
<v Speaker 3>And so I made up the story for High</v>
<v Speaker 3>Times magazine,</v>

4078
03:28:08.951 --> 03:28:12.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great magazine of good information.</v>

4079
03:28:13.150 --> 03:28:16.270
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it turned out that my drummer,</v>

4080
03:28:16.271 --> 03:28:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Kj night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God bless him,</v>

4081
03:28:17.381 --> 03:28:21.520
<v Speaker 3>he was actually admitted this in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>testified that that's what he did.</v>

4082
03:28:22.990 --> 03:28:26.470
<v Speaker 3>We thought it was the funniest thing in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world were teenagers and this guy</v>

4083
03:28:26.471 --> 03:28:31.390
<v Speaker 3>went into the draft physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just an absolute near death lump of Shit</v>

4084
03:28:31.391 --> 03:28:33.900
<v Speaker 3>to get out of the draft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we thought it was funnier than hell.</v>

4085
03:28:33.920 --> 03:28:36.160
<v Speaker 3>We weren't paying attention to important</v>
<v Speaker 3>things in life.</v>

4086
03:28:36.400 --> 03:28:41.290
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ted Hating liberal press started</v>

4087
03:28:41.291 --> 03:28:46.291
<v Speaker 3>quoting the high times magazine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>quoting an ex girlfriend who claimed</v>

4088
03:28:47.741 --> 03:28:50.330
<v Speaker 3>that I had adopted her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that her,</v>

4089
03:28:51.070 --> 03:28:54.370
<v Speaker 3>I adopted my girlfriend to have you read</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one.</v>

4090
03:28:54.430 --> 03:28:55.910
<v Speaker 3>I did read that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about it.</v>

4091
03:28:56.800 --> 03:28:58.960
<v Speaker 3>So this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4092
03:28:58.961 --> 03:29:01.570
<v Speaker 3>you adopted her so you could take her on</v>
<v Speaker 3>tour with,</v>

4093
03:29:01.571 --> 03:29:03.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I could fuck her.</v>

4094
03:29:03.400 --> 03:29:06.490
<v Speaker 3>That's what the story was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's APP.</v>

4095
03:29:07.280 --> 03:29:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it works.</v>

4096
03:29:09.310 --> 03:29:11.500
<v Speaker 3>That's not how I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes it easy to talk to them once</v>

4097
03:29:11.501 --> 03:29:14.670
<v Speaker 3>you adopt them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't adopt anybody Christ.</v>

4098
03:29:14.830 --> 03:29:19.240
<v Speaker 3>I never shit my pants since I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think eight months old.</v>

4099
03:29:19.620 --> 03:29:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been with an underage girl</v>

4100
03:29:21.581 --> 03:29:24.730
<v Speaker 3>since I was under age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a racist.</v>

4101
03:29:24.731 --> 03:29:25.690
<v Speaker 3>And what else they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4102
03:29:25.691 --> 03:29:29.140
<v Speaker 3>and they seem that they claim that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>made courtney love blow me when she was</v>

4103
03:29:29.141 --> 03:29:30.730
<v Speaker 3>12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she claimed that.</v>

4104
03:29:30.970 --> 03:29:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never met Courtney love.</v>

4105
03:29:32.771 --> 03:29:37.270
<v Speaker 3>You can tell I don't have a rash of you</v>
<v Speaker 3>gotta be kidding me.</v>

4106
03:29:37.540 --> 03:29:42.540
<v Speaker 3>They just make this shit up because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>know I'm so good at bringing my basic</v>

4107
03:29:45.160 --> 03:29:50.160
<v Speaker 3>conservative agenda forward that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go full solid Linsky and lie and</v>

4108
03:29:51.671 --> 03:29:53.470
<v Speaker 3>lie and lie.</v>

4109
03:29:53.620 --> 03:29:57.130
<v Speaker 3>And if you go to Wikipedia to find out</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Ted Nugent,</v>

4110
03:29:57.370 --> 03:30:00.880
<v Speaker 3>they will repeat these lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're lies.</v>

4111
03:30:01.000 --> 03:30:03.400
<v Speaker 3>And every one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every one of those things,</v>

4112
03:30:03.401 --> 03:30:04.510
<v Speaker 3>if I had done it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

4113
03:30:04.570 --> 03:30:05.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was awesome.</v>

4114
03:30:05.890 --> 03:30:08.560
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't do any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone can edit wikipedia,</v>

4115
03:30:08.561 --> 03:30:10.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strange.</v>

4116
03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Think she might have edited it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

4117
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:15.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad we got that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this thing is just persistent</v>

4118
03:30:15.971 --> 03:30:17.950
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it stuck in your crop because</v>

4119
03:30:17.951 --> 03:30:19.250
<v Speaker 3>you wanted to bring it up at the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>

4120
03:30:19.270 --> 03:30:20.710
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take up my cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just.</v>

4121
03:30:20.711 --> 03:30:25.120
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating example of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dishonesty and the anti journalism</v>

4122
03:30:25.390 --> 03:30:29.950
<v Speaker 3>agenda driven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm anti Anti-american Anti-tech,</v>

4123
03:30:29.980 --> 03:30:33.430
<v Speaker 3>anti second amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti freedom buffoonery.</v>

4124
03:30:33.431 --> 03:30:35.500
<v Speaker 3>They exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes for an interesting</v>

4125
03:30:35.501 --> 03:30:37.500
<v Speaker 3>podcast exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

4126
03:30:37.600 --> 03:30:40.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not in my crotch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even in my universe,</v>

4127
03:30:40.220 --> 03:30:42.080
<v Speaker 1>but I notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hysterical.</v>

4128
03:30:42.260 --> 03:30:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Ted nugent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies.</v>

4129
03:30:43.080 --> 03:30:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you have it fully.</v>
