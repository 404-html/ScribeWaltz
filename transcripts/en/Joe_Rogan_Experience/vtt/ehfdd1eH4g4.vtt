<v Speaker 1>Package is supposed to be out with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

2
00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:04.430
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.623
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

4
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Ben Greenfield is gentlemen and Robo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's been a lot of fun hanging out</v>

5
00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>with you for the last 44 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sick game you out.</v>

6
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fun,</v>

7
00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:18.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to build a really,</v>

8
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:21.080
<v Speaker 1>really big like 67 yard long living room</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 1>to put my big screen in now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:24.370
<v Speaker 1>That thing is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about this game called</v>
<v Speaker 1>techno hunt that were just so,</v>

12
00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:27.941
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

13
00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you are an interesting fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do a lot of weird shit.</v>

14
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 1>I would no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

15
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

16
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

17
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a compliment when I say yeah,</v>

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>interesting is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your,</v>

19
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:41.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your background,</v>

20
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>you were just telling me this is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

21
00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live way the fuck out in the middle</v>

22
00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda,</v>

24
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's spokane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spokane,</v>

25
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 1>ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have like a theater.</v>

26
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>You're off the grid and we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants.</v>

27
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 1>They're actual people there who</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants.</v>

28
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a theater there.</v>

29
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a little five and dime store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a general store,</v>

30
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.380
<v Speaker 1>a spoke cans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a normal place.</v>

31
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:03.340
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

32
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:05.410
<v Speaker 1>you're totally off the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:06.610
<v Speaker 1>up at our house we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in solar panels and,</v>

35
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way I have it set up is we eased</v>

36
00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>in power from the local municipal power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if that goes out then it hits the</v>

37
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>solar inverters and we're full solar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then there's that.</v>

38
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:21.040
<v Speaker 1>There's like a battery power in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>garage that stores a solar because we're</v>

39
00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're on like a north facing slope,</v>

40
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>so you get sun from 10 to two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can't collect a lot of solar,</v>

41
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>but you stored in the battery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

42
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.880
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've gotta be very judicious with</v>

43
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>your laptop use.</v>

44
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we do want to go off the grid.</v>

45
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

46
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.280
<v Speaker 1>there's no Wifi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no bluetooth.</v>

47
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>So everything's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

48
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it's hardwired metal shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ethernet cable that's through the</v>

49
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>whole house because I don't like to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Wifi signals bouncing around.</v>

50
00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I just really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel good.</v>

51
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that doing to us?</v>

52
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently I just actually just read,</v>

53
00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:56.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a really good new book that came</v>

54
00:01:56.111 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>out is called like that the non tin foil</v>
<v Speaker 1>hat guide to Emf I think is,</v>

55
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>is the full title of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it goes into this idea of what are</v>

56
00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>called voltage gated calcium channels on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cell membrane and all those</v>

57
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>actually get affected by Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently you see like a,</v>

58
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 1>like a change in the electro chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance across the actual membrane in</v>

59
00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 1>response to things like Wifi.</v>

60
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Apparently Bluetooth affects red blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells and I haven't seen,</v>

61
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen a lot of like actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>in Vivo research on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know that I feel better when I</v>

63
00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Speaker 1>don't have like the Wifi router going</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

64
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

65
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I turn off all my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

66
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.900
<v Speaker 1>everything at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's kill switches and all the</v>

67
00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>bedrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's bait.</v>

68
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.650
<v Speaker 1>You walk into the house and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>super clean.</v>

69
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's HEPA air filters,</v>

70
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:43.330
<v Speaker 1>negative ion generators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no Wifi,</v>

71
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>no bluetooth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We structure all the water that comes in</v>

72
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:47.021
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.940
<v Speaker 1>so it's the same now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott like that.</v>

74
00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you heard of structured water</v>

75
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:52.510
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just heard about it because Eddie</v>

76
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Bravo just got that installed in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>jet.</v>

77
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea behind it,</v>

78
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cat up at University of Washington</v>

79
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.240
<v Speaker 1>named doctor Gerald and he has done this</v>
<v Speaker 1>research that shows like in plants or</v>

80
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:09.541
<v Speaker 1>vessels like blood vessels for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an exclusion zone of water.</v>

81
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's like a positive charge on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inside and a negative charge on the</v>

82
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>outside and that might be backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be positive on the outside,</v>

83
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>negative on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But either either way it causes fluid to</v>

84
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:25.351
<v Speaker 1>move through vessels in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows it to move more easily.</v>

85
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the water is actually charged.</v>

86
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>So apparently when you drink structured</v>
<v Speaker 1>water hydrates the sell a little bit</v>

87
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

88
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like,</v>

89
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:34.140
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's apparently how,</v>

90
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>how water moves through plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those things that you hear</v>

91
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 1>and then like you talked to a scientist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>

92
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.680
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And they get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

94
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed that guy,</v>

95
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Gerald Pollack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he has compare basically what he's</v>

96
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>compared to like how it moves in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in glass tubes and how can you structure</v>

97
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>it and you watch it like the water moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>up through the glass tube way,</v>

98
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:53.854
<v Speaker 1>way better.</v>

99
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.800
<v Speaker 1>And then I interviewed this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Cowan and he talks about how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart is not really a pump or it doesn't</v>

101
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>act as much like a pump as we're led to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>

102
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you drink structured water,</v>

103
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>apparently the blood moves better</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the vessels.</v>

104
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't seen a ton of research on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

105
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>but I structured my water just in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's cheap.</v>

106
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this tiny little like plastic</v>

107
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>piece that you put on on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your water.</v>

108
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>What exactly is it doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the water passes through a series of</v>

109
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>glass beads like vortex is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after it.</v>

110
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>So it comes out of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and I've got,</v>

111
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I tested my water and I've got a like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria based iron and high levels of</v>

112
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:33.881
<v Speaker 1>manganese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

113
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well water was just all like pristine,</v>

114
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

115
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you drink out of a spring on top</v>

116
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>of a mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

117
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently there's,</v>

118
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 1>there's crap in the well water.</v>

119
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 1>So I filter it and then after it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>filters,</v>

120
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>it passes through the structured water</v>
<v Speaker 1>filter.</v>

121
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I would ask that you would get some</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in the water because if somewhere</v>

122
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>along the line there's like a dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal or beaver fever.</v>

123
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was dead animals all over my head,</v>

124
00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>just piled everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carcasses.</v>

125
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Careful not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well then the other thing is like</v>

126
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>what I get concerned about is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>you see like glyphosate and herbicides</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pesticides,</v>

128
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>they get spread over the crops and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in farmland territory,</v>

129
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on this north facing slope and</v>

130
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>there's all like these farms above me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I figure if that's dropping down</v>

131
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>through the ground into that water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be getting some of it.</v>

132
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 1>So I filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

133
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>that totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy who got bone cancer because</v>

134
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:30.571
<v Speaker 1>he lived off of a golf course and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the golf course is constantly spraying</v>

135
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>stuff on the golf course and it got into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water supply and a bunch of powder.</v>

136
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>They select getting bone cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

137
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Like it happened to more people at a ton</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people in the neighborhood got</v>

138
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

139
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's scary.</v>

140
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Sharese know what I tell people is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people who don't have a well and</v>

141
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>you just live off the municipal water</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplies.</v>

142
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>You use a reverse osmosis water filter</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's a really,</v>

143
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 1>really fine filtration but it takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything out.</v>

144
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Like it takes the bad stuff and the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff out.</v>

145
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>So you want to add minerals back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you filter the water.</v>

146
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>So you get a reverse and you could buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>these on like Amazon.</v>

147
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>So like a reverse osmosis filter with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called re mineralization or you</v>

148
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:08.430
<v Speaker 1>can just use reverse osmosis and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>use like trace liquid minerals or you</v>

149
00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sea salt or anything else to add</v>

150
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>electrolytes back into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people will put like a pinch of</v>

151
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:13.544
<v Speaker 1>Himalayan salt.</v>

152
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I go through so much salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use this,</v>

153
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>this stuff called Mexican Salt Kalema</v>
<v Speaker 1>salt.</v>

154
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I have in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually at a steak house last</v>

155
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People make fun of me cause I pulled up</v>

156
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 1>my big white bag of salt and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprinkle it on everything.</v>

157
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>But I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fiend for salt.</v>

158
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I love salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very good for you.</v>

159
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:30.040
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately there's been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible myth.</v>

160
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 1>It's been perpetrated a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That song gives you high blood pressure</v>

161
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>and it kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>

162
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 1>that's a real tragedy because that's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those ones that it was,</v>

163
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 1>it was spread in like probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>

164
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 1>the sixties or seventies when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>started telling people that salt causes</v>

165
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 1>high blood pressure and no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People still repeated today and they</v>

166
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>don't understand that it's an essential</v>
<v Speaker 1>mineral.</v>

167
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new book out about this.</v>

168
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I forget the name of the book about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

169
00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of this book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of the book,</v>

170
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:58.030
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it depends too because um,</v>

171
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 1>I used to do racing 14 timex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to these iron man triathlons and</v>

172
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>they'd bring people in to test us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would do sweat sodium analyses</v>

173
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>where you actually get a patch put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your skin and it measures the amount of</v>

174
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>sodium released over x surface area of</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

175
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 1>And then there's an algorithm that terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much total sweat you lose say</v>

176
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 1>per hour during exercise and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people lose a copious amount of</v>

177
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 1>sodium in their sweat and some lose</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely any at all.</v>

178
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.450
<v Speaker 1>So you have like a sodium conservation</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism that differs from person to</v>

179
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there might be some people who store</v>

180
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>salt really well who might actually get</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher blood pressure if they,</v>

181
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>if they consume a lot of salt.</v>

182
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in a massive excess of salt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your time,</v>

183
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 1>and my numbers were off the charts</v>
<v Speaker 1>though in terms of how much sodium was I</v>

184
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:40.760
<v Speaker 1>was losing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably why it feels so good.</v>

185
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Well that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're sweating so much,</v>

186
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just going right through</v>

187
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 1>your body now going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tastes amazing.</v>

188
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to die of high blood pressure</v>

189
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>just because of this salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a big fan.</v>

190
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 1>I love kosher so I used to at least to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay it and they pay like Roman soldiers</v>

191
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:55.810
<v Speaker 1>and sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't,</v>

192
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 1>if we went to war for salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take salt.</v>

193
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it was just less than a 200 years</v>

194
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 1>ago that they figured out how to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>make refrigerators and I mean as a</v>

195
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>frigerator from the 1930s I think it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

196
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>when did they first invent those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then before that they had ice boxes.</v>

197
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to get a chunk of ice from</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

198
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have to get me to store stuff.</v>

199
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>And before that they just use salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've heard,</v>

200
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I heard that if you come from an</v>

201
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if your ancestry is from an area</v>

202
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 1>where they did a lot of that fermenting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pickling,</v>

203
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:31.040
<v Speaker 1>curing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salting,</v>

204
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:36.340
<v Speaker 1>that you have more robust sodium loss</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms like which would make sense</v>

205
00:08:36.481 --> 00:08:38.290
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm northern European heritage.</v>

206
00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of like pickling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salting,</v>

207
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>curing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would lose more salt than somebody</v>

208
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Speaker 1>who might've come from let's say like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sub Saharan African or South East Asian</v>

209
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>or somewhere where they might not have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been using so much salt.</v>

210
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that totally makes sense.</v>

211
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this Wifi thing,</v>

212
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:53.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to go back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

213
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 1>cause I've always wondered there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a long history of use of</v>

214
00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>human use of Wifi.</v>

215
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things sounds so stem</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells,</v>

216
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of studies on that other 90 year</v>

217
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 1>old dad is running around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been doing himself,</v>

218
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

219
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Wifi,</v>

220
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>like when it sounds hippy dippy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you go somewhere like Prince of</v>

221
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Wales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska and you're on a mountain top,</v>

222
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 1>it feels different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh it totally does.</v>

223
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:20.310
<v Speaker 1>No radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no Wifi,</v>

224
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.980
<v Speaker 1>there's no direct TV's getting to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing and that fee,</v>

225
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.070
<v Speaker 1>it feels different up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also,</v>

226
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean like your grounding and earthing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

227
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:30.980
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're uh,</v>

228
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you're breathing a lot more negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>ions cause you're outside in the fresh</v>

229
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't have all the emails jumping</v>

230
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.230
<v Speaker 1>out from your inbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

231
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of confounding variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

232
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.300
<v Speaker 1>all I know and I test a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

233
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 1>you're retested heart rate variability.</v>

234
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets the,</v>

235
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:47.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what that is?</v>

236
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:49.030
<v Speaker 1>HRV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of athletes use it,</v>

237
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.250
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know much about what does it</v>
<v Speaker 1>miss the Inter beat individuality,</v>

238
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:56.700
<v Speaker 1>like the variation in the amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>in between each beat of your heart.</v>

239
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like how fast your heart is</v>
<v Speaker 1>beating and how much time is in between</v>

240
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:02.300
<v Speaker 1>each heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can measure that and you're</v>

241
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 1>supposed to have like slight beat to</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat variation in how much time is</v>

242
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 1>between each heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have that,</v>

243
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:12.780
<v Speaker 1>that's high heart rate variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can use that to track your</v>

244
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 1>readiness to train your recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

245
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:17.910
<v Speaker 1>So I use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use like a ring like this or I'll do</v>

246
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>like a heart rate strap in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So aura or a ring actually,</v>

247
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 1>have you heard of this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

248
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 1>but do just going out of my a cracker</v>
<v Speaker 1>jack box.</v>

249
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a power.</v>

250
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a power ring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mood ring.</v>

251
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.210
<v Speaker 1>I've seen one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

252
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.460
<v Speaker 1>someone sent me something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't just use rings,</v>

253
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:37.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like other methods of measuring</v>

254
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:40.650
<v Speaker 1>it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like you can use a bluetooth enabled</v>

255
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:42.150
<v Speaker 1>heart rate monitor strap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it,</v>

256
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 1>that's what I used to do is you wake up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

257
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you put on the stopping and test your</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart rate variability and it tells you,</v>

258
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's low you might say,</v>

259
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 1>okay well today is going to be like a a</v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga day or an easy swim or walk in the</v>

260
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:56.610
<v Speaker 1>sunshine and if it's high then that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a day where you'll do like</v>

261
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 1>kettle bell training or a wad or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever is it you're going to do.</v>

262
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.600
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing you could use</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for is if you,</v>

263
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 1>you'll sometimes purposefully get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>low,</v>

264
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:07.710
<v Speaker 1>like have some athletes that I train</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we'll work them into a state where</v>

265
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 1>they've got really low heart rate</v>
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>

266
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is you taper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

267
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Like you recover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rest,</v>

268
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you super compensate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see a bounce back of nervous</v>

269
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Speaker 1>system recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can use that to purposefully</v>

270
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.910
<v Speaker 1>adjust the training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

271
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you train through a low hrv for</v>
<v Speaker 1>too long,</v>

272
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.590
<v Speaker 1>you can predict illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can predict injury.</v>

273
00:11:26.591 --> 00:11:29.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's a cool way to track training and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can even,</v>

274
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 1>you can look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

275
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a high frequency in a low</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequency when you're saying you could</v>

276
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:37.850
<v Speaker 1>predict illness and injury meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning like my hrv is low but,</v>

277
00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 1>but screw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go train anyways.</v>

278
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 1>But you do that day after day you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>injured.</v>

279
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:45.750
<v Speaker 1>And the weird thing is that you can have</v>
<v Speaker 1>no musculoskeletal soreness,</v>

280
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of time that subsides,</v>

281
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:49.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delayed onset muscle soreness.</v>

282
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:51.120
<v Speaker 1>You see that disappear after like 48</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

283
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 1>And if you've crushed yourself like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could talk about this letter if you</v>

284
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:55.720
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been doing a single set to</v>

285
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 1>failure or a single set to failure</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises where it's just like a 15</v>

286
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.930
<v Speaker 1>minute long workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just full on isometrics.</v>

287
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>As hard as you can go for 60 seconds to</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of metrics isometrics.</v>

288
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:06.460
<v Speaker 1>So you're pushing against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

289
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like this force plate machine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push against and you just generate</v>

290
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:15.811
<v Speaker 1>as much force as you can and it ties to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your iphone and it alerts you when</v>

291
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you've dropped off 60% of what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally producing at the beginning of</v>

292
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 1>the set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's it sets done game over.</v>

293
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.660
<v Speaker 1>So you might do deadlift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squat,</v>

294
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 1>press overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>press pull down,</v>

295
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 1>and that's the whole workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're just recovering in</v>

296
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 1>between each of those sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this plate,</v>

297
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean how you doing a dead lift with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>plate?</v>

298
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a force plate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

299
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you're standing in Ohio like a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

300
00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:42.370
<v Speaker 1>That you're holding onto and the bar is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to the force plate via two</v>

301
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>stands on either like two pillars on</v>
<v Speaker 1>either side of the bar and you pull the</v>

302
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:49.300
<v Speaker 1>bar and then the force plate detects how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much force you're polling and what</v>

303
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're standing on top of the</v>

304
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:54.220
<v Speaker 1>force plate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to choose the hardest</v>

305
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:55.940
<v Speaker 1>position of each exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like half,</v>

306
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.670
<v Speaker 1>if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm bench pressing,</v>

307
00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it's like my elbows are slightly bent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just near the top or a squatting.</v>

308
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:05.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like the knees are bent that about</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 40 degrees.</v>

309
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get into that position,</v>

310
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 1>then you generate as much force as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible for 60 seconds or not.</v>

311
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 1>When I first did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at 30 seconds,</v>

312
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:16.600
<v Speaker 1>now I can go a little bit over a minute</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I can continue to generate as much</v>

313
00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 1>force as possible before it drops off to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just 60% of what I was originally</v>

314
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:21.320
<v Speaker 1>produced.</v>

315
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:21.941
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cool,</v>

316
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 1>efficient way to train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get that sore afterwards.</v>

317
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So musculoskeletal soreness is not a</v>

318
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 1>good indicator of recovery in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases.</v>

319
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's where this hrv thing comes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your nervous system,</v>

320
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your central nervous system,</v>

321
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 1>your neuromuscular system can be really</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat up after a workout even if the</v>

322
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 1>soreness has subsided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where you use something like</v>

323
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:43.360
<v Speaker 1>hrv and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

324
00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not sore but my hrv is still</v>
<v Speaker 1>low.</v>

325
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 1>So this is going to be an easy day for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

326
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to act like a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but explain that one more session.</v>

327
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.590
<v Speaker 1>So if your um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your body is not sore but your hrv is</v>

328
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 1>low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

329
00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 1>what is it showing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's an indication of?</v>

330
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.270
<v Speaker 1>So if your body is not sore but your hrv</v>
<v Speaker 1>is low,</v>

331
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Hrv is measuring your nervous system</v>
<v Speaker 1>recovery.</v>

332
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

333
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.080
<v Speaker 1>so you might not be fully recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying it's like</v>

334
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:13.081
<v Speaker 1>musculoskeletal soreness or discomfort</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not necessarily the best indicator of</v>

335
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 1>whether you're fully recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to test the nervous system too.</v>

336
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.630
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm hearing.</v>

337
00:14:17.631 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Someone that can edit jarvey measurement</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in and and coming full circle.</v>

338
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed when I do those morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>measurements and I'm traveling or I've</v>

339
00:14:24.371 --> 00:14:28.420
<v Speaker 1>got the Wifi enabled at my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hrv is low so it's affecting my</v>

340
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 1>nervous system somehow is the why do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think the Wifi is a mind fuck.</v>

341
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's really doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>

342
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Speaker 1>I think is doing something but then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's in this room there's the placebo</v>

343
00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel it.</v>

344
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I feel real say that's trying to feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

345
00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're a moron right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the Wifi going,</v>

346
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.430
<v Speaker 1>what's going on Jamie?</v>

347
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.670
<v Speaker 1>What do you got the hrv off of my eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you just t what'd you use?</v>

348
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.940
<v Speaker 1>The fingertip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Apple Watch the Apple Watch tests.</v>

349
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Your hrv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's been doing it for the whole time</v>

350
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I've had it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's paradoxical because the apple</v>

351
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:01.640
<v Speaker 1>watch is making Wifi so it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing.</v>

352
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

353
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:04.161
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

354
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:05.670
<v Speaker 1>this ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

355
00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 1>bought this in Finland like three years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago because I wanted like a body</v>

356
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 1>tracking device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to track my hrv and I want to</v>

357
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>track my sleep cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't like sleeping all night</v>

358
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 1>cause like I sleep with my kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hand tucked down by my Dick,</v>

359
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:18.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in,</v>

360
00:15:18.061 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by my cry.</v>

361
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't want something just like sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

362
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sleep on my side,</v>

363
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 1>my hands tucked underneath me and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lily would be like,</v>

364
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:31.730
<v Speaker 1>my right hand is right down around my</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowls basically while I'm sleeping and I</v>

365
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 1>didn't want something just like blasting</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

366
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.580
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping.</v>

367
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 1>So cause it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was on my wrist or on my finger or</v>

368
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 1>wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this has like a built in computer and</v>

369
00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:44.300
<v Speaker 1>you can put it in airplane mode and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll still collect all the hrv data and</v>

370
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when you want to take it out of</v>

371
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 1>airplane mode and sync it to your phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and upload all your sleep data or your</v>

372
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:50.960
<v Speaker 1>hrv data or anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

373
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

374
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.690
<v Speaker 1>that's why I wear this ring instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fitbit or jawbone or,</v>

375
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.550
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Jamie's stupid Apple Watch.</v>

376
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 1>I never know whether or not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous with this stuff.</v>

377
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Like with worrying about phones being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>man like,</v>

378
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.200
<v Speaker 1>but cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

379
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.290
<v Speaker 1>cause it's somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some dude told me that once that he got</v>

380
00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:11.930
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was testing the cancer side</v>

381
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 1>and the guy was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you keep your phone in your right</v>

382
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:14.690
<v Speaker 1>pocket?</v>

383
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:15.620
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I do.</v>

384
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 1>The doctor was telling him that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

385
00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:20.750
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck does the doctor know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not proven stuff.</v>

386
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 1>This is all real speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

387
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's tricky because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can say about the bone cancer</v>

388
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:27.740
<v Speaker 1>on the golf course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

389
00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:28.950
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people that,</v>

390
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a class action lawsuit</v>
<v Speaker 1>it there,</v>

391
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 1>cause I think they tested the water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was whatever the fuck the stuff</v>

392
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 1>that they use for fertilizer or</v>
<v Speaker 1>pesticides.</v>

393
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was concerned about the,</v>

394
00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:44.631
<v Speaker 1>the Dick cancer thing because those stem</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells like a stem cells into your Dick.</v>

395
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the past three,</v>

396
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.290
<v Speaker 1>so men's health magazine just had me</v>
<v Speaker 1>write this article called New Year New</v>

397
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Dick where they have me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

398
00:16:52.201 --> 00:16:53.400
<v Speaker 1>So you get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a,</v>

399
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.630
<v Speaker 1>it's the issue with Marky Mark Wahlberg</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the [inaudible] on the cover.</v>

400
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.870
<v Speaker 1>How appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how to make a small Dick Bigger.</v>

402
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But marky mark on the,</v>

403
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.650
<v Speaker 1>on the cover and now he can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can beat me with his,</v>

404
00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:06.070
<v Speaker 1>with his four foot tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fisticuffs uh,</v>

405
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.080
<v Speaker 1>anyways though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have me go around and doing</v>

406
00:17:09.081 --> 00:17:13.760
<v Speaker 1>everything that I could do to enhance</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual performance or increase the size</v>

407
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:16.870
<v Speaker 1>of your deck or increased blood flow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased orgasm quality or you know,</v>

408
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.180
<v Speaker 1>they just wanted to find out where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything from like fricking gas</v>

409
00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:23.030
<v Speaker 1>station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Pills to which by the way,</v>

410
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.520
<v Speaker 1>those things do not have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what they say they have in</v>

411
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:26.510
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

412
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>

413
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say like epimedium and your role</v>

414
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:34.030
<v Speaker 1>come a long jack and they're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>horny goat weed Algebra.</v>

415
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically for consult benefil</v>

416
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.060
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The active ingredient in Cialis or</v>

417
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Viagra and then a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Phaedra and copious amounts of</v>

418
00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:41.984
<v Speaker 1>caffeine.</v>

419
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.300
<v Speaker 1>So I would take these things and just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

420
00:17:43.301 --> 00:17:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like my head was gonna explode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

421
00:17:45.221 --> 00:17:47.870
<v Speaker 1>it's like drinking 10 cups of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

422
00:17:47.871 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend of ours who predicted</v>

423
00:17:50.191 --> 00:17:53.750
<v Speaker 1>accurately that Jon Jones was taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things when he pissed hot cause he</v>

424
00:17:53.751 --> 00:17:55.230
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things have everything in them.</v>

425
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 1>And he's like a John Jones does coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

426
00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee he's taken dick pills</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually entertaining to read because</v>

427
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>it's all like the like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like arena,</v>

428
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Chinese fortune cookie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

429
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Maximum Potency Vigara and everything's</v>
<v Speaker 1>spelled wrong.</v>

430
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

431
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:11.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have me doing that.</v>

432
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.310
<v Speaker 1>They did analysis of the ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you actually get it tested?</v>

433
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

434
00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.920
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to all these labs.</v>

435
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:21.000
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't let us actually test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently the FDA has tested them.</v>

436
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:24.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to the fda.gov website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like these,</v>

437
00:18:24.261 --> 00:18:26.910
<v Speaker 1>these warnings out about the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredient.</v>

438
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.710
<v Speaker 1>We took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the five that they had warnings about</v>

439
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:31.960
<v Speaker 1>and tested them and the day and day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

440
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:32.863
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel well.</v>

441
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 1>You feel like your head's gonna explode</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your hands get all cold and clammy.</v>

442
00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:36.630
<v Speaker 1>And some of them say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>

443
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:38.070
<v Speaker 1>but they say to take them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

444
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which doesn't to me makes sense.</v>

445
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:43.900
<v Speaker 1>But you take him in the morning and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just feel completely screwed up like</v>

446
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 1>the whole morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're just mainlining coffee.</v>

447
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.080
<v Speaker 1>So they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

448
00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you heard of this?</v>

449
00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Like acoustic sound wave therapy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Dick.</v>

450
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to answer,</v>

451
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

452
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I haven't said this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a clinic in Florida.</v>

453
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.380
<v Speaker 1>It was called gainswave and you'd go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to Florida.</v>

454
00:19:02.381 --> 00:19:05.730
<v Speaker 1>We go down there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I walk in and the first thing they</v>

455
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:08.700
<v Speaker 1>do is they hand me this like syringe</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of the numbing cream and I'm</v>

456
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:10.320
<v Speaker 1>supposed to just like put it everywhere.</v>

457
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smeared it,</v>

458
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my balls,</v>

459
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:15.120
<v Speaker 1>my like I just went everywhere cause I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really know what they were,</v>

460
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.700
<v Speaker 1>what they were going to do and I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it all,</v>

461
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.280
<v Speaker 1>all shields activated going to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this thing.</v>

462
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.700
<v Speaker 1>So I walk into the room and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my Dick's all numb.</v>

463
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 1>They had me lay down and so my legs are</v>
<v Speaker 1>splayed.</v>

464
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm on this exam room table and this gal</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in and she's got like this giant</v>

465
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:33.540
<v Speaker 1>won attached to a machine and they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this for women too by the way.</v>

466
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:35.880
<v Speaker 1>They put like a condom on the end of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

467
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.610
<v Speaker 1>and she just basically goes to town for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20 minutes.</v>

468
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:43.611
<v Speaker 1>Like a Jackhammer was like everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>around 20 minutes supposedly.</v>

469
00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly it breaks open old blood</v>

470
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:51.531
<v Speaker 1>vessels and builds new blood vessels and</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the numbing cream wears off you're</v>

471
00:19:51.631 --> 00:19:53.520
<v Speaker 1>supposed to to perform a lot better.</v>

472
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.800
<v Speaker 1>And then they combine this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how we were,</v>

473
00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:58.560
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about like with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder if you inject it you should do</v>

474
00:19:58.561 --> 00:20:02.760
<v Speaker 1>like electro stammer vibration or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to get the injection deeper</v>

475
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:05.130
<v Speaker 1>into the tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think same thing with this,</v>

476
00:20:05.131 --> 00:20:08.220
<v Speaker 1>they do the PRP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they do prp into your deck and then</v>

477
00:20:08.221 --> 00:20:10.740
<v Speaker 1>they followed up and you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a nerve block first.</v>

478
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

479
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I thought they put the</v>
<v Speaker 1>needle just like right in the pee hole,</v>

480
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 1>which to me made sense but it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

481
00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean you want it in the actual tips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they actually go like up where the</v>

482
00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:24.690
<v Speaker 1>dick attaches like the tissue at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>

483
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.250
<v Speaker 1>two nerve blocks on either side and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prp and later on,</v>

484
00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:31.050
<v Speaker 1>like a couple months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hemi do stem cells.</v>

485
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.710
<v Speaker 1>They actually extracted like four months</v>
<v Speaker 1>later from my back and we did a stem</v>

486
00:20:34.711 --> 00:20:35.310
<v Speaker 1>cell injection.</v>

487
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.030
<v Speaker 1>But this acoustic sound wave therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

488
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:41.640
<v Speaker 1>with the PRP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it wears off and you literally just</v>

489
00:20:41.641 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 1>like get boners all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

490
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 1>like all night long for like a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the acoustic sound therapy's supposed</v>

491
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 1>to be breaking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blood vessel breaks open old board</v>

492
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 1>vessels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gainswave procedure breaks up plaque</v>

493
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 1>formation in blood vessels and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulates the growth of new blood</v>

494
00:20:58.241 --> 00:21:01.980
<v Speaker 1>vessels in the penis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low intensity extra Kapore iol shockwave</v>

495
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to sell a lot of,</v>

496
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:05.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of procedures.</v>

497
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I like the drawing we shot before and</v>
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>

498
00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Before your veins real tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

499
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.690
<v Speaker 1>before it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an old hunched over man.</v>

500
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden vigor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a bodybuilding saying.</v>

501
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do bodybuilding.</v>

502
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:22.090
<v Speaker 1>So is that horrible sport?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's real?</v>

503
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's really doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

504
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 1>I have worked for me and I worked for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

505
00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

506
00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:28.841
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gas station,</v>

507
00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Dick Pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do the acoustic sound wave therapy,</v>

508
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.420
<v Speaker 1>but the [inaudible] injections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had me do like the,</v>

509
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge stem cells with about stem</v>

510
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:37.270
<v Speaker 1>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stem cells.</v>

511
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.280
<v Speaker 1>But that mean that not everybody's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to do that,</v>

512
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:41.320
<v Speaker 1>but that was the best bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

513
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went down to Florida and again,</v>

514
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I think is cause all</v>

515
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:50.720
<v Speaker 1>the old people live in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Dale,</v>

516
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.810
<v Speaker 1>all the people like hunched over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>steering wheel is there,</v>

517
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 1>but all the guys have great Dick's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't drive.</v>

518
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.380
<v Speaker 1>They have their blinker on for like two</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles before they turn,</v>

519
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 1>but their dicks are primed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

520
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:04.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stem cell thing was that the US stem</v>

521
00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:09.451
<v Speaker 1>cell clinic in Florida and I went in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they extract all the fat for</v>

522
00:22:09.581 --> 00:22:11.410
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took the fat on my back.</v>

523
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And what they do is they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

524
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called an enzymatic process where</v>

525
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.520
<v Speaker 1>they use something that breaks down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Collagen in the fat and then they have</v>

526
00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:27.160
<v Speaker 1>the stem cells that get separated from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fat.</v>

527
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.290
<v Speaker 1>And apparently it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high in these angiogenic like,</v>

528
00:22:31.291 --> 00:22:34.100
<v Speaker 1>like vascular vessel building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

529
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.390
<v Speaker 1>compounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you get that it,</v>

530
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:38.320
<v Speaker 1>it's high in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

531
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Mesenchymal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the MSC,</v>

532
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.770
<v Speaker 1>the MSC cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

533
00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 1>which are supposedly the very good ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>to inject in.</v>

534
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.100
<v Speaker 1>So I injected those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

535
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.250
<v Speaker 1>or I had a doctor in spokane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they shipped him to spokane on ice</v>

536
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.870
<v Speaker 1>and they show up at my house at like</v>
<v Speaker 1>7:00 AM right.</v>

537
00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Because you got to get them delivered</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same day.</v>

538
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.270
<v Speaker 1>And then I had my appointment at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor at 9:00 AM and I went to the</v>

539
00:22:58.271 --> 00:23:00.010
<v Speaker 1>doctor and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

540
00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:02.440
<v Speaker 1>it was like Deja Vu from Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I go and do the,</v>

541
00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:03.640
<v Speaker 1>do the numbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

542
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:04.151
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

543
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:05.560
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

544
00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I called him and I want it was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends with the doctor.</v>

545
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:08.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

546
00:23:08.891 --> 00:23:10.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a picture of him in the</v>

547
00:23:10.841 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 1>mega,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they put all sorts of crazy</v>

548
00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:14.440
<v Speaker 1>pictures in the magazine because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't given like infrared light on my</v>

549
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:14.950
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>

550
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.640
<v Speaker 1>And I have look this big thing called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] that they had me</v>

551
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:21.860
<v Speaker 1>standing in front of every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I Jack my light,</v>

552
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you about the stem cells and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what's the chance that,</v>

553
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.170
<v Speaker 1>because it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

554
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>so the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stem cells,</v>

555
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I went to this doctor in spokane and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>injected these,</v>

556
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:38.380
<v Speaker 1>these stem cells from my fat after</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've grown for like several in this</v>

557
00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:39.700
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they were down there for like</v>

558
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.580
<v Speaker 1>eight weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean they,</v>

559
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.420
<v Speaker 1>they can do same day injections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>

560
00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have enough fat cause for me it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was right in the middle of,</v>

561
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I raced professionally and also of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course racing.</v>

562
00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:50.480
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just like lean as hell as I go in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

563
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 1>So they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could barely get enough fat,</v>

564
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:53.750
<v Speaker 1>so they had to grow them for a longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>

565
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times they can inject same day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went into spokane,</v>

566
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this clinic and Spokane,</v>

567
00:23:58.581 --> 00:23:59.960
<v Speaker 1>La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new integrative clinic.</v>

568
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like this osteopathic medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinic with all these,</v>

569
00:24:02.271 --> 00:24:04.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice receptionist when you walk in the</v>

570
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:04.904
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

571
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.380
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doctor who,</v>

572
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done stem cell injections before,</v>

573
00:24:08.571 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 1>but he never actually injected them into</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's deck.</v>

574
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.380
<v Speaker 1>So it was kinda like the Guinea pig for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

575
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to explain to him what areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to do?</v>

576
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.950
<v Speaker 1>He researched it and I think he actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to the folks at the stem cell</v>

577
00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:21.440
<v Speaker 1>clinic beforehand and make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were on the,</v>

578
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.930
<v Speaker 1>on the same page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when I fly all the way back down to</v>

579
00:24:23.931 --> 00:24:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super inconvenient and it's just a</v>

580
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:27.074
<v Speaker 1>deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

581
00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.940
<v Speaker 1>They'll make more Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're growing kidneys and ears.</v>

582
00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.680
<v Speaker 1>They'll grow Dick Someday.</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>my leg and my,</v>

608
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 1>my kids' role now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once a week.</v>

609
00:25:38.931 --> 00:25:40.400
<v Speaker 1>And I buy on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the,</v>

610
00:25:40.401 --> 00:25:42.860
<v Speaker 1>the defense soap from on it and as soon</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they come,</v>

611
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.610
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they come back in the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>

612
00:25:44.611 --> 00:25:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I'd have them go into the shower</v>
<v Speaker 1>upstairs and defense and race down.</v>

613
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sent a bunch of different wipes and</v>

614
00:25:49.761 --> 00:25:52.210
<v Speaker 1>stuff for people that train in a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have a,</v>

615
00:25:52.211 --> 00:25:53.690
<v Speaker 1>a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

616
00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:55.780
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be careful that end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

617
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.120
<v Speaker 1>thieves essential oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like going to a whole bunch of</v>

618
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:02.270
<v Speaker 1>companies make this version of essential</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil called thieves.</v>

619
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:06.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like clove and roads named after</v>
<v Speaker 1>these thieves who apparently never got</v>

620
00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:09.200
<v Speaker 1>clove cinnamon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eucalyptus,</v>

621
00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:10.780
<v Speaker 1>which is really good for staff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosemay.</v>

622
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.120
<v Speaker 1>It's actually named that there's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of like these four thieves</v>

623
00:26:14.121 --> 00:26:18.310
<v Speaker 1>that apparently traveled around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and they would rob Holmes and,</v>

624
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.140
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they never got sick.</v>

625
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Like that's basically the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure this was,</v>

626
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.590
<v Speaker 1>this was some board table at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a multilevel marketing essential oils</v>

627
00:26:27.591 --> 00:26:29.990
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody came up with this story or it</v>

628
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:30.950
<v Speaker 1>could be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

629
00:26:30.951 --> 00:26:32.870
<v Speaker 1>But the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

630
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:34.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stem cells into the Dick that,</v>

631
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.800
<v Speaker 1>that was an interesting one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it did.</v>

632
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think from what I can tell,</v>

633
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 1>looking in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got bigger.</v>

634
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much?</v>

635
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.230
<v Speaker 1>So half inch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

636
00:26:45.231 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 1>like maybe that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like enough to tell and my erections got</v>

637
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:52.500
<v Speaker 1>bigger and my orgasms got a lot better</v>
<v Speaker 1>for how long they,</v>

638
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.010
<v Speaker 1>they're still like that still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

639
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.620
<v Speaker 1>So it fits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the stem cell,</v>

640
00:26:55.621 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like stick with you.</v>

641
00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well last week I got them,</v>

642
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I told you I'm training for the RKC</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kettlebell cert and I was doing the,</v>

643
00:27:03.461 --> 00:27:07.110
<v Speaker 1>the hundred reps in five minutes snatch</v>
<v Speaker 1>test with a,</v>

644
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:10.470
<v Speaker 1>with a one and a half food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I felt something just go,</v>

645
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I was at 84 reps and I felt something go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my back and I got stem cells injected</v>

646
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 1>all up and down my ql,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my multifidus,</v>

647
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:22.770
<v Speaker 1>my rector spinae into my so ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then they also sent them to me,</v>

648
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.670
<v Speaker 1>to my house and I did that same vat sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that's rich and the</v>

649
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Mesenchymal stem cells into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream.</v>

650
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.620
<v Speaker 1>So I did a push ivy into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream.</v>

651
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that you would have to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the country to do a,</v>

652
00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:39.240
<v Speaker 1>normally you're not supposed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's tech.</v>

653
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.510
<v Speaker 1>It's technically not legal for someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to inject you with your own stem cells</v>

654
00:27:42.511 --> 00:27:43.470
<v Speaker 1>into your bloodstream.</v>

655
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.160
<v Speaker 1>But if you get your stem cells extracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're stored and they send them to</v>

656
00:27:47.161 --> 00:27:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can technically inject them.</v>

657
00:27:49.381 --> 00:27:52.320
<v Speaker 1>If you do it yourself where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a friend who's a nurse or whatever</v>

658
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's literally just like a push ivy.</v>

659
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.030
<v Speaker 1>It was like 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

660
00:27:56.031 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 1>we caught it on video for a men's health</v>
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>

661
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.750
<v Speaker 1>so they'll publish a video at some</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

662
00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 1>But I was super nervous because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a few thousand dollars worth of</v>

663
00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 1>stem cells that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

664
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to hit the vein and make sure</v>

665
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:07.920
<v Speaker 1>that they go in the right way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>inject.</v>

666
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:09.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small amount.</v>

667
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 1>What you had to be the most nervous</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them shut in your Dick though.</v>

668
00:28:12.481 --> 00:28:14.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kinda nervous.</v>

669
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

670
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:19.760
<v Speaker 1>That's super experimental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of that though.</v>

671
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of my shtick.</v>

672
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I do a lot of immersive journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of self experimentation and a lot</v>

673
00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:27.680
<v Speaker 1>of a lot of Guinea pig type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

674
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.280
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not dead yet and I still have my</v>

675
00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:30.930
<v Speaker 1>deck so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look great.</v>

676
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

681
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.210
<v Speaker 1>that's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

682
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an image from my website that's</v>

683
00:28:40.651 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 1>not as deep as it got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the worst photo.</v>

684
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 1>The worst one I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Kevin randomness stuff it with</v>

685
00:28:46.231 --> 00:28:48.670
<v Speaker 1>iodine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they have you got a sore?</v>

686
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like these long iodine strips</v>

687
00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:54.540
<v Speaker 1>when you get the [inaudible] and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's flesh eating bacteria.</v>

688
00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's me too.</v>

689
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.470
<v Speaker 1>And they stuffed see that hole in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

690
00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.860
<v Speaker 1>They stuff like iodine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a stick in there,</v>

691
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 1>like a strip that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they literally stuffed it in there</v>

692
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:05.604
<v Speaker 1>and you can feel it.</v>

693
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.290
<v Speaker 1>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were telling me you got dry needling</v>

694
00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:09.930
<v Speaker 1>done and you know like that weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

695
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not like pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a weird pressure from dry</v>

696
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:15.720
<v Speaker 1>needling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like that except pain,</v>

697
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's both the pain and the PR.</v>

698
00:29:17.581 --> 00:29:19.020
<v Speaker 1>It was horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

699
00:29:19.021 --> 00:29:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had some falls and [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff in their leg where they have like</v>

700
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:27.120
<v Speaker 1>all small golf ball size holding their</v>
<v Speaker 1>leg and they literally had a packet full</v>

701
00:29:27.121 --> 00:29:30.300
<v Speaker 1>of that kind of gauze covering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like how you say a small golf</v>

702
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:32.660
<v Speaker 1>golf balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big hole for the back of the leg golf</v>

703
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.860
<v Speaker 1>ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like smaller than a golf ball</v>

704
00:29:34.861 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 1>or go large marble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any hole in the back of the leg.</v>

705
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 1>And my opinion is too big I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

706
00:29:39.271 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Speaker 1>It's Kevin Randleman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if he could find Kevin randleman</v>

707
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:43.660
<v Speaker 1>staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had open holes.</v>

708
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 1>We could see his muscle structure under</v>
<v Speaker 1>his armpit.</v>

709
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.830
<v Speaker 1>It was horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

710
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never really recovered.</v>

711
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.670
<v Speaker 1>He was dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died.</v>

712
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.520
<v Speaker 1>He died young from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what he died from.</v>

713
00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:56.800
<v Speaker 1>But look at the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I still have it.</v>

714
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

715
00:29:58.061 --> 00:30:00.540
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his muscle tissue around it.</v>

716
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.320
<v Speaker 1>What body part is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his underarm.</v>

717
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

718
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how bad it was.</v>

719
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.740
<v Speaker 1>That looks like he got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

720
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was rotting away.</v>

721
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if he didn't treat it</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly enough or I don't know if it was</v>

722
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:18.820
<v Speaker 1>just really aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a real common thing in gyms.</v>

723
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.950
<v Speaker 1>And then once you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stays with you.</v>

724
00:30:20.951 --> 00:30:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Like it stays in your bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I still,</v>

725
00:30:23.141 --> 00:30:27.180
<v Speaker 1>like I have an essential oil diffuser on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my desk and I put thieves in it everyday</v>

726
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.340
<v Speaker 1>and I just diffuse essential oils in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air while I'm working into the,</v>

727
00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a nebulizing essential oil</v>

728
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:33.920
<v Speaker 1>diffuser and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

729
00:30:33.921 --> 00:30:34.840
<v Speaker 1>just to play it safe.</v>

730
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be breathing that in one</v>

731
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in case.</v>

732
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.711
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

733
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:40.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the other thing is I stand in</v>

734
00:30:40.361 --> 00:30:42.040
<v Speaker 1>front of this light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this infrared light,</v>

735
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.150
<v Speaker 1>and this is that Dick Light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

736
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.520
<v Speaker 1>It's called a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

737
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>

738
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.330
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done these studies on testicular</v>

739
00:30:52.331 --> 00:30:55.810
<v Speaker 1>and sperm production and they've found</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a wavelength that's like</v>

740
00:30:55.811 --> 00:31:00.811
<v Speaker 1>600 to 800 nanometers wavelength of</v>
<v Speaker 1>light that if you expose the testicles</v>

741
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:04.270
<v Speaker 1>to that for five to 20 minutes a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's based on this concept of photo</v>

742
00:31:04.271 --> 00:31:08.320
<v Speaker 1>biomodulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I originally got into this whole</v>

743
00:31:08.321 --> 00:31:10.870
<v Speaker 1>photo biomodulation thing when this</v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

744
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.520
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I blog and people just send me</v>

745
00:31:12.521 --> 00:31:17.140
<v Speaker 1>these weird things to my doorstep to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try and they sent me this like nasal</v>

746
00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:20.860
<v Speaker 1>probe that you put up your nose and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got like a helmet on it.</v>

747
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.330
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could look it up Jamie,</v>

748
00:31:22.331 --> 00:31:23.070
<v Speaker 1>if you want us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call them,</v>

749
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>via light.</v>

750
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:29.390
<v Speaker 1>And it produces this light that</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly activates a part of your</v>

751
00:31:29.391 --> 00:31:31.210
<v Speaker 1>metrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have like your electron transport</v>

752
00:31:31.211 --> 00:31:34.450
<v Speaker 1>chain in your Mitochondria and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that called the cytochrome c</v>

753
00:31:34.451 --> 00:31:39.160
<v Speaker 1>oxidase and it apparently activates more</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity in the cytochrome c oxidase to</v>

754
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:41.950
<v Speaker 1>produce more ATP in this case in neural</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue.</v>

755
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Cause you have it on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were using this in dementia and</v>

756
00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:47.620
<v Speaker 1>in Alzheimer's patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out it's almost like a,</v>

757
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.630
<v Speaker 1>like a nootropic for your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

758
00:31:49.631 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 1>That's me at my desk back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when I was back when I was a young</v>

759
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Chinese woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my desk,</v>

760
00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up your nose on your head.</v>

761
00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I like how that guy is just like looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>pensively it's cross rate of the well</v>

762
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.220
<v Speaker 1>and she's reading a book like he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading twilight.</v>

763
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what I originally did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sent me just the nose one and I</v>

764
00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:06.900
<v Speaker 1>felt shorted because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had like the full head.</v>

765
00:32:06.901 --> 00:32:11.250
<v Speaker 1>So ask him for the full head one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking weird and you can feel like</v>

766
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Holtz it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

767
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.020
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the um,</v>

768
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:18.460
<v Speaker 1>it was I think it was MPR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was either radio lab or um,</v>

769
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.310
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other science when the end,</v>

770
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it think it might be radiolab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a study on that or a,</v>

771
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.900
<v Speaker 1>or a story unlike this 10 to 40 hertz</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequency know,</v>

772
00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.200
<v Speaker 1>talked about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tdcs oh nine volts trans</v>

773
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.640
<v Speaker 1>stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one of those to the Trans direct</v>

774
00:32:33.641 --> 00:32:36.640
<v Speaker 1>cranial stimulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that halo device that you wear before a</v>

775
00:32:36.641 --> 00:32:39.440
<v Speaker 1>workout and use that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one at a time,</v>

776
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 1>one at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this photo biomodulation I'm putting</v>

777
00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the probe in my ear and you're</v>

778
00:32:45.111 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 1>not even supposed to use it too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it produces so much atp that if</v>

779
00:32:49.461 --> 00:32:52.040
<v Speaker 1>you amp up cellular activity in neural</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue too much,</v>

780
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:54.230
<v Speaker 1>you produced too many reactive oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

781
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a byproduct of cellular</v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolism.</v>

782
00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just like if you eat too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you produce a lot of byproduct of making</v>

783
00:32:59.931 --> 00:33:03.080
<v Speaker 1>energy and that's why it's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why fasting is good for you.</v>

784
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Like it cleans up the system and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't make as many free radicals.</v>

785
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:08.120
<v Speaker 1>The same reason like Ketosis is good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

786
00:33:08.121 --> 00:33:09.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not burning as much glucose,</v>

787
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you don't produce as many free radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same concept with this.</v>

788
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:15.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to use it all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you get too much activity.</v>

789
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.740
<v Speaker 1>You produce too many free radicals are</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many reactive oxygen species,</v>

790
00:33:18.741 --> 00:33:21.560
<v Speaker 1>but every other day use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So New Year,</v>

791
00:33:21.561 --> 00:33:22.400
<v Speaker 1>new you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new Dick.</v>

792
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 1>How often did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

793
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:27.230
<v Speaker 1>this is from my head and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was like a couple of years ago,</v>

794
00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.600
<v Speaker 1>same thing a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was like a cup of coffee for my</v>

795
00:33:29.601 --> 00:33:31.070
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every time I'd wake up,</v>

796
00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I put this thing out when I'm working at</v>
<v Speaker 1>my desk.</v>

797
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.060
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

798
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.980
<v Speaker 1>this company that makes these lights</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are very similar,</v>

799
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:42.010
<v Speaker 1>activate cytochrome c oxidase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>activates a release of nitric oxide.</v>

800
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:46.400
<v Speaker 1>But if you do it on your testicles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically the cell that it works on</v>

801
00:33:46.401 --> 00:33:49.190
<v Speaker 1>is the Leydig cells in the testes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are responsible for producing</v>

802
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:51.020
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically stimulating the</v>

803
00:33:51.021 --> 00:33:55.040
<v Speaker 1>leydig cells in the testes the same way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'd stimulate like neural tissue</v>

804
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 1>using this one for your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd had success with the thing for my</v>

805
00:33:57.831 --> 00:34:00.170
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tried this one for the balls and</v>

806
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:02.510
<v Speaker 1>the Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I did was I would just Jack my</v>

807
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:05.510
<v Speaker 1>pants down for five to 20 minutes a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I'm saying that,</v>

808
00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:05.691
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

809
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm diffusing my essential oils that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to pick on my head.</v>

810
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.710
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

811
00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:12.530
<v Speaker 1>and it works like you actually get more</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood flow.</v>

812
00:34:12.531 --> 00:34:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

813
00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do a control study just pulling</v>
<v Speaker 1>my pants down and standing there for</v>

814
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.390
<v Speaker 1>five to 20 minutes south.</v>

815
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.430
<v Speaker 1>It without the light on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should,</v>

816
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I should do that at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause maybe it's just like the whole,</v>

817
00:34:21.981 --> 00:34:24.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like supposedly going combat style</v>

818
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.320
<v Speaker 1>is supposed to be good for your Dick to</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat style.</v>

819
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.170
<v Speaker 1>So there's you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's me balls out.</v>

820
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm standing on standing on my wobble</v>
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>

821
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I got my ball of light and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually not my office.</v>

822
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't one of my friend's houses cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had one.</v>

823
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.580
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

824
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

825
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.450
<v Speaker 1>obviously I'm not naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but normally I would,</v>

826
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be nude and uh,</v>

827
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

828
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.520
<v Speaker 1>and you just basically new your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

829
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:53.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a warm teddy bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Increased vascularity,</v>

830
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:54.590
<v Speaker 1>better size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better orgasms.</v>

831
00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all this stuff.</v>

832
00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.340
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all of this stuff seems to make your</v>

833
00:34:58.341 --> 00:35:00.860
<v Speaker 1>day had some kind of where it had some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of an effect.</v>

834
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

835
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>PRP injections,</v>

836
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:05.330
<v Speaker 1>acoustic sound wave therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stem cells,</v>

837
00:35:05.331 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Speaker 1>the infrared light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gas station,</v>

838
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Dick Pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the one I would not repeat.</v>

839
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they had me do some ayurvedic</v>

840
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:13.820
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the no ejaculation thing.</v>

841
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.310
<v Speaker 1>We just kind of like where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where Tantra have sex.</v>

842
00:35:16.311 --> 00:35:20.150
<v Speaker 1>But you pull out the river like the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a book,</v>

843
00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:24.500
<v Speaker 1>it's called the the multiorgasmic men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I read that and learned how to like,</v>

844
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:25.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull back,</v>

845
00:35:25.521 --> 00:35:28.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not actually orgasm and you're like</v>

846
00:35:28.071 --> 00:35:30.770
<v Speaker 1>pull it inside and then you finish up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're just like pissed off the rest</v>

847
00:35:30.771 --> 00:35:33.050
<v Speaker 1>of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tell he can't sleep at night because</v>

848
00:35:33.051 --> 00:35:34.070
<v Speaker 1>you're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just thought why?</v>

849
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:38.340
<v Speaker 1>So you could see how it would work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me it's like I got kids and my</v>

850
00:35:38.341 --> 00:35:40.820
<v Speaker 1>wife and I sneak away to get it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wanna I want,</v>

851
00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I want the full meal deal.</v>

852
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:44.420
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

853
00:35:44.421 --> 00:35:48.870
<v Speaker 1>the no ejaculate reverse orgasm thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's supposed to do like when you</v>

854
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:52.260
<v Speaker 1>internalize the orgasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you keep it inside.</v>

855
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.190
<v Speaker 1>So this is all based on Chinese medicine</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>

856
00:35:56.191 --> 00:35:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called your gin or your</v>

857
00:35:58.561 --> 00:36:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Djing or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

858
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.690
<v Speaker 1>you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this energy,</v>

859
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

860
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:07.560
<v Speaker 1>your ci or your Pronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Chakra,</v>

861
00:36:07.561 --> 00:36:11.770
<v Speaker 1>your life force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently orgasming is an in and</v>

862
00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.840
<v Speaker 1>coming like ejaculating is supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways that you give some of</v>

863
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 1>that life force away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you release some of your vitality</v>

864
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:23.750
<v Speaker 1>and by having sex but then not coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually creating that same</v>

865
00:36:23.941 --> 00:36:27.570
<v Speaker 1>hormonal response of oxytocin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone and all these things that</v>

866
00:36:27.571 --> 00:36:30.240
<v Speaker 1>we release when we're having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way ejaculate,</v>

867
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:33.120
<v Speaker 1>but without actually giving up that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that vitality,</v>

868
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.750
<v Speaker 1>that life force there was even like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>found,</v>

869
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I found like a tables were like based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your age,</v>

870
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain frequency with which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to ejaculate.</v>

871
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the younger you are,</v>

872
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:44.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like every two days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every three days.</v>

873
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:46.780
<v Speaker 1>And the older you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it gets to a certain point where</v>

874
00:36:46.781 --> 00:36:48.270
<v Speaker 1>you're like 70 years old and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

875
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:50.970
<v Speaker 1>every month or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

876
00:36:50.971 --> 00:36:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of interesting.</v>

877
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:53.340
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

878
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want,</v>

879
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to finish.</v>

880
00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.750
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preconceived prejudice that you have</v>

881
00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:02.370
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a wonder if you just went into it</v>

882
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 1>like completely objectively would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a benefit.</v>

883
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you'd just get like mineral</v>

884
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.900
<v Speaker 1>depleted and you lose all your zinc and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else you need to make sperm</v>

885
00:37:09.901 --> 00:37:12.030
<v Speaker 1>and you'll start to cramp up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

886
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.710
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be ejaculate in a lot,</v>

887
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you were doing all these</v>

888
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:16.950
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of a time,</v>

889
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.400
<v Speaker 1>like how much of a buffer did you give</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in between each thing?</v>

890
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.410
<v Speaker 1>So it was not a well controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment at all.</v>

891
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.700
<v Speaker 1>It was like three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

892
00:37:23.701 --> 00:37:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

893
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we try this?</v>

894
00:37:25.231 --> 00:37:25.681
<v Speaker 1>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

895
00:37:25.681 --> 00:37:28.020
<v Speaker 1>the articles coming out soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should toss this in there too.</v>

896
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So they probably compounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not a well controlled experiment</v>

897
00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:33.420
<v Speaker 1>and I did a lot over three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it would have been a lot better and</v>

898
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:35.760
<v Speaker 1>just try one thing at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

899
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.610
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am well hung and very vascular</v>

900
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:40.110
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Credulous will experiment.</v>

901
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:41.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's that.</v>

902
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

903
00:37:42.391 --> 00:37:43.740
<v Speaker 1>it's called New Year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so new year,</v>

904
00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:45.630
<v Speaker 1>new deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really did make your Dick Bigger.</v>

905
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.450
<v Speaker 1>So do you think there's any help out</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope out there?</v>

906
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Asking for a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys who have microdex micro,</v>

907
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.090
<v Speaker 1>what's a micro Dick [inaudible] small</v>
<v Speaker 1>penis.</v>

908
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine there's whole pantry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could be like great politicians or</v>

909
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 1>influential and that there's gotta be</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of trade off,</v>

910
00:38:03.241 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

911
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have sickle cell anemia,</v>

912
00:38:06.301 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 1>apparently it keep protected from</v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria.</v>

913
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So maybe if you have a small Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it protects you from some kind of</v>

914
00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:14.070
<v Speaker 1>horrible accident later on in lighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think so.</v>

915
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:16.920
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a way to fix that and people,</v>

916
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:19.890
<v Speaker 1>if maybe this was the way it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt like that's gotta be</v>

917
00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:21.610
<v Speaker 1>one of the saddest things yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

918
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.330
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you never know.</v>

919
00:38:24.331 --> 00:38:27.140
<v Speaker 1>There could be a bunch of nine year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>man walking around with Dick Cancer 60</v>

920
00:38:27.141 --> 00:38:30.090
<v Speaker 1>years from now who heard this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went and got injected.</v>

921
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:32.730
<v Speaker 1>So I will not attest to the safety of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

922
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.060
<v Speaker 1>but kind of test the efficacy of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

923
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.510
<v Speaker 1>so some of those things would work for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

924
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 1>For All those people walking around</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

925
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 1>All of your listeners have small dicks</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave them salvation.</v>

926
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.380
<v Speaker 1>There's old fellows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's hope.</v>

927
00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:45.011
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

928
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:49.050
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like you're,</v>

929
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.420
<v Speaker 1>you're saying it's still works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

930
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.030
<v Speaker 1>how long ago did you do this experiment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

931
00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magazine is still on the shelves.</v>

932
00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Like it just kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

933
00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.880
<v Speaker 1>how long is it was like [inaudible] was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like starting,</v>

934
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I got the stem cells extracted in August</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 2017 so this is like the end of</v>

935
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.000
<v Speaker 1>January,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight weeks later I got those shot into</v>

936
00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:11.890
<v Speaker 1>the deck and we only made a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>

937
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:15.700
<v Speaker 1>months later after they really grow in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of these Mesenchymal mesenchymal</v>

938
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.250
<v Speaker 1>stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got them injected into my bloodstream</v>

939
00:39:18.251 --> 00:39:21.190
<v Speaker 1>and in the like that injury that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting in my back right now.</v>

940
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd done some other things before</v>

941
00:39:24.191 --> 00:39:25.530
<v Speaker 1>that for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the backend,</v>

942
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.610
<v Speaker 1>for tissue like peptides like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

943
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the bpc one 57 that we were just talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about before.</v>

944
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

945
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Which is really interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

946
00:39:33.281 --> 00:39:36.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not intended for human consumption,</v>

947
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not banned by water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

948
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually it's legal to use and it's a</v>

949
00:39:42.611 --> 00:39:44.230
<v Speaker 1>peptide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

950
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 1>it's called body protection compound bpc</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 57,</v>

951
00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:53.110
<v Speaker 1>and the one 57 refers to like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of amino acids that makes up</v>

952
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:57.730
<v Speaker 1>the actual compound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can buy it and reconstitute it.</v>

953
00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:01.780
<v Speaker 1>And then if you inject it into an area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't even have to be like a</v>

954
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:05.290
<v Speaker 1>painful intramuscular injection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be like a subcutaneous injection.</v>

955
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.850
<v Speaker 1>BPC supposedly stimulates angiogenesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's an,</v>

956
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:11.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a natural compound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find it in the human gut.</v>

957
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 1>So they took this same thing that helps</v>
<v Speaker 1>to heal the human gut,</v>

958
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.740
<v Speaker 1>which is why if you were to consume this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drinking water,</v>

959
00:40:17.741 --> 00:40:20.110
<v Speaker 1>it supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is an in rodent models,</v>

960
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:23.200
<v Speaker 1>it apparently works to like heal up an</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflamed gut,</v>

961
00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Colitis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ibd,</v>

962
00:40:24.521 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 1>ibs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

963
00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.940
<v Speaker 1>But you can inject it into a joint or</v>
<v Speaker 1>subcutaneously into an area around the</v>

964
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:33.490
<v Speaker 1>joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's supposedly stimulates the,</v>

965
00:40:33.491 --> 00:40:35.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this is a repetitive phrase</v>

966
00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:37.570
<v Speaker 1>on this show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The growth of new blood vessels.</v>

967
00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.180
<v Speaker 1>So angio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angiogenesis,</v>

968
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:44.410
<v Speaker 1>and then there's another one called tb</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 that they use in race horses,</v>

969
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.810
<v Speaker 1>the thymus in Beta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one is banned by water,</v>

970
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 1>but same similar principle except that</v>
<v Speaker 1>one acts on the actin and myocin fibers</v>

971
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.470
<v Speaker 1>and actually causes regeneration of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

972
00:40:53.471 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 1>So you could do both and he get</v>
<v Speaker 1>angiogenesis and then also fiber</v>

973
00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:57.160
<v Speaker 1>regrowth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

974
00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.620
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a strategy that would be like</v>

975
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:01.810
<v Speaker 1>pennies on the dollar compared to stem</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>

976
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:02.891
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

977
00:41:02.891 --> 00:41:05.770
<v Speaker 1>a far less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm far less intensive procedure in</v>

978
00:41:05.771 --> 00:41:07.510
<v Speaker 1>terms of collecting your stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

979
00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

980
00:41:08.831 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

981
00:41:10.211 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a fat for the stem cells and</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I understand,</v>

982
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:16.060
<v Speaker 1>if you're going after the anti aging</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

983
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:19.750
<v Speaker 1>like the bone is better like the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bone marrow.</v>

984
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:23.800
<v Speaker 1>So I had mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my bone marrow extracted at this</v>

985
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:26.770
<v Speaker 1>place called forever labs in Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

986
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.280
<v Speaker 1>And they store that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what I can do is I can just</v>

987
00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:35.310
<v Speaker 1>inject the 35 year old me into my body</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year or every five years or</v>

988
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 1>whenever I want to put that back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've got bone marrow and fat marrow</v>

989
00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:42.560
<v Speaker 1>stored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they take the bone marrow and how do</v>

990
00:41:42.561 --> 00:41:45.480
<v Speaker 1>they have enough to just keep going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they replicate it?</v>

991
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The protocol that used to grow this</v>

992
00:41:48.341 --> 00:41:49.400
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know the fat one,</v>

993
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:53.600
<v Speaker 1>they use like a collagenase procedure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that enzymatically breaks down the</v>

994
00:41:53.601 --> 00:41:58.070
<v Speaker 1>college and from the fat and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrates the stem cells and you can</v>

995
00:41:58.071 --> 00:42:00.260
<v Speaker 1>actually grow them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can actually multiply them.</v>

996
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming it's something similar for</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone and the bone would be more for like</v>

997
00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:10.370
<v Speaker 1>longevity and anti aging and in the fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be more for for joints.</v>

998
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.310
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people got the bone</v>
<v Speaker 1>marrow done for injuries.</v>

999
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1000
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's supposed to be too painful.</v>

1001
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Was it painful for you and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>extracted the bone?</v>

1002
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Not compared to the Dick injections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all relative.</v>

1003
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.863
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1004
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been obstacle course racing and</v>

1005
00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:27.650
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was triathlete before that and did</v>

1006
00:42:27.651 --> 00:42:29.990
<v Speaker 1>body build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've always done all this masochistic</v>

1007
00:42:29.991 --> 00:42:31.190
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So getting,</v>

1008
00:42:31.191 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I think my pain tolerance is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1009
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.820
<v Speaker 1>hi Don.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1010
00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:35.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bone marrow,</v>

1011
00:42:35.721 --> 00:42:36.760
<v Speaker 1>it didn't hurt that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1012
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 1>it was that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They numb it.</v>

1013
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:39.200
<v Speaker 1>They go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1014
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.150
<v Speaker 1>the Dick one was where there was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that weird pressure.</v>

1015
00:42:41.151 --> 00:42:43.940
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the iodine packing into</v>

1016
00:42:43.941 --> 00:42:45.500
<v Speaker 1>the staph infection that you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1017
00:42:45.501 --> 00:42:46.790
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was up there.</v>

1018
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yang Ufc light heavyweight champion,</v>

1019
00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 1>had it done with the bone marrow and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was telling me it was painful as hell</v>

1020
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:54.170
<v Speaker 1>and he's about as tough name getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>a's.</v>

1021
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I checked it again and just hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it's,</v>

1022
00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a big needle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was limping around.</v>

1023
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.460
<v Speaker 1>He said for awhile when I did the stem</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell injections,</v>

1024
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:04.220
<v Speaker 1>that was cool cause they used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used a digital thermography.</v>

1025
00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:05.660
<v Speaker 1>She can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an ultrasound.</v>

1026
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:07.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like what you would use to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a baby.</v>

1027
00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't,</v>

1028
00:43:08.751 --> 00:43:11.310
<v Speaker 1>you can see the tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the areas where there's</v>

1029
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.420
<v Speaker 1>swelling or there's like a black area</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

1030
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.360
<v Speaker 1>where the tissue is torn up or whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a Dema or inflammation and you</v>

1031
00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:18.820

1033
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:23.900
<v Speaker 1>the injections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see the needle like going into</v>

1034
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:24.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1035
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you can micro target exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly where you want to put the cells.</v>

1036
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:29.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

1037
00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cool procedure.</v>

1038
00:43:30.411 --> 00:43:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to use that.</v>

1039
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thermography.</v>

1040
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1041
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done Regena keen?</v>

1042
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're aware of it.</v>

1043
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.480
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1044
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:41.390
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that a lot of pro</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes are going to Germany to get</v>

1045
00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:42.260
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1046
00:43:42.261 --> 00:43:46.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of platelet rich plasma</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the heat it up and by heating up</v>

1047
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:47.391
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1048
00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:50.420
<v Speaker 1>the plasma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it produces this radical</v>

1049
00:43:50.421 --> 00:43:53.270
<v Speaker 1>anti-inflammatory property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they extract it into this</v>

1050
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:55.490
<v Speaker 1>yellow serum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spin it in a centrifuge.</v>

1051
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:58.190
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to get it done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had it done on how is that</v>

1052
00:43:58.191 --> 00:44:00.290
<v Speaker 1>different than just normal prp?</v>
<v Speaker 1>More powerful.</v>

1053
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.450
<v Speaker 1>More poorly because it's it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Cause some PRP before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I have as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.320
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1057
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:07.580
<v Speaker 1>obviously I'm not doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1058
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to these doctors that do it,</v>

1059
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:13.940
<v Speaker 1>and there's a place in Santa Monica that</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it called lifespan medicine.</v>

1060
00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I've had it done really for the longest</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1061
00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:19.040
<v Speaker 1>You had to go to Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dana white flew to Germany to get</v>

1062
00:44:19.041 --> 00:44:23.060
<v Speaker 1>it done because it was illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hadn't,</v>

1063
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had an interest,</v>

1064
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.990
<v Speaker 1>but can go on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going over to,</v>

1065
00:44:26.991 --> 00:44:27.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1066
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venice beach.</v>

1067
00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be done by there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to these cats.</v>

1068
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.550
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that place I was talking about the human</v>

1069
00:44:32.551 --> 00:44:34.540
<v Speaker 1>garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting place.</v>

1070
00:44:34.541 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I really want to talk to the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it.</v>

1071
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.960
<v Speaker 1>My friend Doctor Ben [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is the guy who performed the</v>

1072
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:41.160
<v Speaker 1>procedures down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>

1073
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:42.210
<v Speaker 1>He would love to talk to you too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1074
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:43.140
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1075
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.670
<v Speaker 1>You'd get a kick out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty interesting.</v>

1076
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Some day I'll run out of stuff so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>inject it into joints,</v>

1077
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:49.350
<v Speaker 1>but for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it really helped me heal a</v>

1078
00:44:49.351 --> 00:44:50.640
<v Speaker 1>bulging disc in my neck.</v>

1079
00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Rarely they go right into the spinal</v>
<v Speaker 1>cord.</v>

1080
00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 1>It's great for people that have pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious neck injuries and back injuries.</v>

1081
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

1082
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:00.840
<v Speaker 1>it's pet AECON is a company that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1083
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:05.841
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a neck traction device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one hanging him that in a yoga</v>

1084
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 1>trapeze and so all your hands and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all hanging by the neck.</v>

1085
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I do this when I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get up and I put like a bunch of</v>

1086
00:45:12.271 --> 00:45:16.170
<v Speaker 1>magnesium on my neck and my back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>relax all the tissue.</v>

1087
00:45:16.171 --> 00:45:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And once you get really relaxed and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1088
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:18.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1089
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 1>this vibrator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1090
00:45:20.521 --> 00:45:24.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like a car buffer for your body so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can vibrate your neck and your back</v>

1091
00:45:24.481 --> 00:45:27.900
<v Speaker 1>and then you get really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really relaxed and it's perfect for,</v>

1092
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like doing your own deep tissue</v>

1093
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.320
<v Speaker 1>therapy but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it vibrate.</v>

1094
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.750
<v Speaker 1>So I'll do that on my body and I go hang</v>
<v Speaker 1>from this neck thing and you get all of</v>

1095
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 1>these pops up and down in your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1096
00:45:36.361 --> 00:45:39.690
<v Speaker 1>and it apparently realigns the atlas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the axis and some of the cervical</v>

1097
00:45:39.691 --> 00:45:42.570
<v Speaker 1>vertebra and there's probably a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chiropractic docs who are,</v>

1098
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.660
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1099
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.070
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1100
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.940
<v Speaker 1>pissed off right now because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing this incorrectly.</v>

1101
00:45:47.941 --> 00:45:49.290
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels amazing.</v>

1102
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Like it just adjusts everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I hang from the yoga trapeze</v>

1103
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it definitely seems like five</v>

1104
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:54.780
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1105
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.100
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decompresses your,</v>

1106
00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all that other</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense,</v>

1107
00:45:57.661 --> 00:46:00.300
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stretching out those muscles and</v>

1108
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:03.360
<v Speaker 1>alleviating some of the stress that</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from bad posture.</v>

1109
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.650
<v Speaker 1>And for me it was a lot of grappling</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your neck cranked and squished</v>

1110
00:46:07.651 --> 00:46:10.020
<v Speaker 1>and resisting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1111
00:46:10.021 --> 00:46:12.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kinda similar to traction and I</v>

1112
00:46:12.941 --> 00:46:14.130
<v Speaker 1>really been getting into that.</v>

1113
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of [inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 1>E?</v>

1114
00:46:15.571 --> 00:46:16.051
<v Speaker 1>L?</v>
<v Speaker 1>D?</v>

1115
00:46:16.051 --> 00:46:16.560
<v Speaker 1>O?</v>
<v Speaker 1>H?</v>

1116
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a form of stretching where I</v>

1117
00:46:20.461 --> 00:46:24.210
<v Speaker 1>actually had a guy come to my house for</v>
<v Speaker 1>two days and he stayed in my basement.</v>

1118
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:27.060
<v Speaker 1>And the way we wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done this a few times,</v>

1119
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:29.670
<v Speaker 1>we'll have people come over to me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like teach it.</v>

1120
00:46:29.671 --> 00:46:31.830
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another guy who mashes it like</v>

1121
00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:34.350
<v Speaker 1>use a walker and just like mash up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>down your body.</v>

1122
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.840
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is El Della,</v>

1123
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 1>so l Doa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll like push a joint out this way</v>

1124
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.310
<v Speaker 1>and then out this way and then your feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be splayed in both directions.</v>

1125
00:46:44.311 --> 00:46:46.140
<v Speaker 1>There's like 20 different poses that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

1126
00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:48.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's a form of self traction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1127
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1128
00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:54.090
<v Speaker 1>it's similar to like if you were to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>a monster band to traction a join,</v>

1129
00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:54.810
<v Speaker 1>have you ever done that?</v>

1130
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Like traction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hip with a real tie,</v>

1131
00:46:57.151 --> 00:47:02.151
<v Speaker 1>a monster band around your hip and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>attach it to I have not potassium and</v>

1132
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.361
<v Speaker 1>joint apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1133
00:47:03.361 --> 00:47:07.200
<v Speaker 1>That's all Doa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that Adam from mine pump that is that</v>

1134
00:47:07.201 --> 00:47:09.000
<v Speaker 1>the mind pump that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's my buddy Adam.</v>

1135
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.120
<v Speaker 1>It says spinal health l.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

1136
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:13.860
<v Speaker 1>O.</v>
<v Speaker 1>N.</v>

1137
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:13.860
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>
<v Speaker 1>L.</v>

1138
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 1>O.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D.</v>

1139
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1140
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.440
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the ones I do in the</v>

1141
00:47:16.441 --> 00:47:18.480
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's l five s one so that,</v>

1142
00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:21.960
<v Speaker 1>so they all work on a specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like part of the back,</v>

1143
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:23.340
<v Speaker 1>the part of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say it again.</v>

<v Speaker 1>stressing this goes back.</v>

1157
00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:00.510
<v Speaker 1>This is like some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some French guy invented it and uh,</v>

1158
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how I heard about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1159
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 1>or I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1160
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.510
<v Speaker 1>interview this guy named Jacob Shawn on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my podcast and he taught me all these</v>

1161
00:48:07.511 --> 00:48:10.090
<v Speaker 1>moves and getting my house and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1162
00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:12.400
<v Speaker 1>it's another one of those really cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of stretching.</v>

1163
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like you do yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

1164
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sauna.</v>

1165
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.990
<v Speaker 1>You Do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have do like an infrared sauna.</v>

1166
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:22.420
<v Speaker 1>We have a regular sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use,</v>

1167
00:48:22.421 --> 00:48:23.081
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1168
00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:25.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a near far infrared sauna.</v>

1169
00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:27.070
<v Speaker 1>And I go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're,</v>

1170
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:30.130
<v Speaker 1>your tissue gets very pliable and hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a,</v>

1171
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:34.690
<v Speaker 1>I had a crane drop a 19 foot and endless</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool out in the forest back behind my</v>

1172
00:48:34.691 --> 00:48:38.590
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I keep this thing just like super</v>

1173
00:48:38.591 --> 00:48:39.580
<v Speaker 1>duper cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1174
00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:41.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's like 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 degrees.</v>

1175
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:45.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my cryotherapy cold water immersion.</v>

1176
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Well during the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the winter and the fall just</v>

1177
00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:49.690
<v Speaker 1>stays that cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just keep the lid off.</v>

1178
00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:52.510
<v Speaker 1>And then during the summer when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back home and I'm going by the</v>

1179
00:48:52.511 --> 00:48:54.700
<v Speaker 1>gas station up the up the hill before my</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

1180
00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I stopped and I buy ice bags and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumped them in there.</v>

1181
00:48:56.981 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's so it stays relatively cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1182
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:04.110
<v Speaker 1>what I do in the mornings when I'm home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I do this sauna and you asked about</v>

1183
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.730
<v Speaker 1>yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go in there and this is when I do a</v>

1184
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:07.480
<v Speaker 1>lot of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1185
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll do some of my yoga moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my elders.</v>

1186
00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.350
<v Speaker 1>There was another really good form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretching called core foundation,</v>

1187
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doc named Eric Goodman.</v>

1188
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a form of decompression</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the spine.</v>

1189
00:49:19.671 --> 00:49:22.420
<v Speaker 1>And he works with a lot of athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like turns on your glutes</v>

1190
00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.540
<v Speaker 1>decompresses your spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1191
00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I just use a mash up of all these little</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves and I'll be in my sauna for like</v>

1192
00:49:28.841 --> 00:49:31.180
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm producing all the,</v>

1193
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.090
<v Speaker 1>all the heat shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting the nitric oxide,</v>

1194
00:49:34.091 --> 00:49:36.730
<v Speaker 1>get in the blood flow and you just feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel good.</v>

1195
00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:40.970
<v Speaker 1>We did a sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I get all sweaty and I get kind of,</v>

1196
00:49:40.971 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 1>we will sprinkle essential oils in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll burn like Palo Santo incense</v>

1197
00:49:44.771 --> 00:49:47.350
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on burn incense inside the song</v>

1198
00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:47.921
<v Speaker 1>feeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1199
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:49.600
<v Speaker 1>it smells really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1200
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.070
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1201
00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.190
<v Speaker 1>like binaural beats.</v>

1202
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:53.680
<v Speaker 1>So there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy named,</v>

1203
00:49:53.681 --> 00:49:55.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Tyrrell,</v>

1204
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.560
<v Speaker 1>and he makes these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these cds and these tracks that you said</v>

1205
00:49:59.561 --> 00:50:00.630
<v Speaker 1>his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you load your vote.</v>

1206
00:50:00.631 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 1>When Michael Tyrrell retirees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's amazing tracks and they're,</v>

1207
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:06.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1208
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:09.400
<v Speaker 1>they vibrate at specific hertz</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequencies right there.</v>

1209
00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:11.810
<v Speaker 1>So there's this whole idea that like</v>
<v Speaker 1>your root Chakra,</v>

1210
00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 1>like your fourth chalky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your heart shock or vibrates it 528</v>

1211
00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:16.780
<v Speaker 1>hertz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

1212
00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:19.720
<v Speaker 1>there's different hertz frequencies</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with different positive</v>

1213
00:50:19.721 --> 00:50:21.540
<v Speaker 1>aspects of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of euro.</v>

1214
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this,</v>

1215
00:50:22.391 --> 00:50:23.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1216
00:50:23.501 --> 00:50:24.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1217
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.680
<v Speaker 1>a Chakra like oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1218
00:50:26.681 --> 00:50:28.550
<v Speaker 1>have you tried to debunk any of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel really good.</v>

1219
00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1220
00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.330
<v Speaker 1>If I feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to be deep us to do it.</v>

1221
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My notes.</v>

1222
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Are you doing this with headsets on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1223
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:36.250
<v Speaker 1>that song it has like surround speakers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I just,</v>

1224
00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I play that through the speakers.</v>

1225
00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.380
<v Speaker 1>No Bluetooth and no Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay May just like,</v>

1226
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:44.660
<v Speaker 1>it's just like my little shitty little</v>
<v Speaker 1>ipod shuffle that I plug it and play.</v>

1227
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:47.930
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I play that while I'm in the sauna</v>

1228
00:50:47.931 --> 00:50:51.950
<v Speaker 1>and I'm doing all my moves and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk out of my house,</v>

1229
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:54.050
<v Speaker 1>go through my office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked through the forest and I go and</v>

1230
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:56.490
<v Speaker 1>jump in the pool and swim in there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fights,</v>

1231
00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:00.560
<v Speaker 1>like 50 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not jumped the other one to the</v>

1232
00:51:00.561 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Speaker 1>other and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too much to go back and forth.</v>

1233
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I've tried to just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to keep things somewhat cause this</v>

1234
00:51:06.621 --> 00:51:09.440
<v Speaker 1>is getting kind of complex between like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light in the balls and the essential</v>

1235
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.510
<v Speaker 1>oils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta you gotta draw the line</v>

1236
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:14.690
<v Speaker 1>somewhere ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll have friends over and,</v>

1237
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.860
<v Speaker 1>and we'll vapor will smoke in the sauna</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll go out to the pool and</v>

1238
00:51:18.861 --> 00:51:20.060
<v Speaker 1>then go roll around in the snow.</v>

1239
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 1>They get back in the pool and go back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sauna.</v>

1240
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.370
<v Speaker 1>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do this and my wife is inside making</v>

1241
00:51:25.371 --> 00:51:27.460
<v Speaker 1>dinner and we just feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1242
00:51:27.461 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 1>we got the hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got the cold and then we'd go in and</v>

1243
00:51:29.661 --> 00:51:31.250
<v Speaker 1>we eat dinner and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

1244
00:51:31.251 --> 00:51:32.660
<v Speaker 1>It's my favorite thing to do with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

1245
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the morning and do the sauna and</v>

1246
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.060
<v Speaker 1>the ice and then or there or the cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool.</v>

1247
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.630
<v Speaker 1>And then I finished with a quick dip in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hot tub out in the trees cause I put</v>

1248
00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:45.080
<v Speaker 1>a hot tub next to the cold pool and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's like super clean.</v>

1249
00:51:45.081 --> 00:51:47.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cleaned with ozone and minerals</v>

1250
00:51:47.151 --> 00:51:49.280
<v Speaker 1>instead of chlorine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you just feel really,</v>

1251
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:51.620
<v Speaker 1>really clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I walk in and start my day.</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1265
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I was just based on how you feel while I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was speaking in,</v>

1266
00:52:25.671 --> 00:52:27.290
<v Speaker 1>in code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm down here and speak in</v>

1267
00:52:27.291 --> 00:52:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Costa Mesa and a couple of days ago and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like this,</v>

1268
00:52:30.921 --> 00:52:33.260
<v Speaker 1>this banquet dinner as part of the event</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll sit next to this guy.</v>

1269
00:52:33.261 --> 00:52:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what do you do for your fitness</v>

1270
00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:35.834
<v Speaker 1>routine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Et cetera.</v>

1271
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:39.290
<v Speaker 1>He does Bikram Yoga every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the Bikram Yoga,</v>

1272
00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:42.920
<v Speaker 1>like all of the poses that are part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger meal because it's a set series of</v>

1273
00:52:42.921 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 1>routines.</v>

1274
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.870
<v Speaker 1>You've done bikram before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1275
00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:48.910
<v Speaker 1>he has like 90 minutes and he does that</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single day at nine days in a row.</v>

1276
00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1277
00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been doing it for like years every</v>

1278
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:53.151
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm impressed.</v>

1279
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Cause we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did sober October,</v>

1280
00:52:54.981 --> 00:52:57.590
<v Speaker 1>we had to do 15 about a month mean a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of my friends.</v>

1281
00:52:57.610 --> 00:52:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to burn it out.</v>

1282
00:52:59.811 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 1>So the last nine days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I had a few days to go but for nine</v>

1283
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:05.300
<v Speaker 1>days I just said let me just get these</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the way.</v>

1284
00:53:05.301 --> 00:53:07.730
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day I did 90 minutes and it was</v>

1285
00:53:07.731 --> 00:53:09.740
<v Speaker 1>like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting because you realize</v>

1286
00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:14.150
<v Speaker 1>that your body can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to Overdo it though because</v>

1287
00:53:14.151 --> 00:53:17.350
<v Speaker 1>it's static stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that that can decrease forced</v>

1288
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:19.310
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it can decrease power production</v>

1289
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.590
<v Speaker 1>for the calm too pliable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flexible.</v>

1290
00:53:21.591 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the case though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Preworkout like well the workout,</v>

1291
00:53:26.191 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 1>but chronically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you elongate tissue,</v>

1292
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:32.430
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if they've actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>done any studies on people who have done</v>

1293
00:53:32.431 --> 00:53:35.420
<v Speaker 1>yoga for a really long time and compared</v>
<v Speaker 1>like their,</v>

1294
00:53:35.421 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 1>their vertical jump right before and</v>
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>

1295
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:41.970
<v Speaker 1>But I just feel almost too stretchy if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>get too into it.</v>

1296
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like when I run it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more like gumby running</v>

1297
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.390
<v Speaker 1>versus limiting the amount of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1298
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:52.620
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely static stretching prior to</v>

1299
00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:55.120
<v Speaker 1>force production is not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1300
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Like prior to things like squats or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1301
00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.700
<v Speaker 1>It was like when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the lights went out during the</v>

1302
00:53:59.701 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 1>superbowl a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember that.</v>

1303
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:05.460
<v Speaker 1>And you could see on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both teams were just like standing on</v>

1304
00:54:05.461 --> 00:54:08.520
<v Speaker 1>the sidelines or setting on the silent</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing these long hamstrings,</v>

1305
00:54:08.521 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 1>static stretches and Anne and I wondered</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they were doing it because they were</v>

1306
00:54:12.571 --> 00:54:16.440
<v Speaker 1>about to get back in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and engage in a very powerful explosive</v>

1307
00:54:16.441 --> 00:54:18.090
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1308
00:54:18.091 --> 00:54:19.800
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dynamic stretching.</v>

1309
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Definitely price prior to force</v>
<v Speaker 1>production activities.</v>

1310
00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:23.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1311
00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:25.080
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they just have really old school</v>

1312
00:54:25.081 --> 00:54:28.340
<v Speaker 1>trainers or something like that are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware or maybe they just doing it on our</v>

1313
00:54:28.341 --> 00:54:30.570
<v Speaker 1>own before I do that isometric training.</v>

1314
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1315
00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.120
<v Speaker 1>for power production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got two things.</v>

1316
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I bought this stuff called them those</v>
<v Speaker 1>torque on Amazon.</v>

1317
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:39.480
<v Speaker 1>You heard this stuff's towards like</v>
<v Speaker 1>smelling salts on steroids.</v>

1318
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:43.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power lifter told me about it and he</v>

1319
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.670
<v Speaker 1>would sniff it before he'll go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1320
00:54:44.671 --> 00:54:47.510
<v Speaker 1>rip a 700 pound bar off the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1321
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you snort that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you open up the cap on this stuff and</v>

1322
00:54:51.241 --> 00:54:55.410
<v Speaker 1>it's just like releasing a wild animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the room and it released the cap.</v>

1323
00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:58.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like smelling salts on steroids and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you smell and you just want to go kill</v>

1324
00:54:58.741 --> 00:55:00.230
<v Speaker 1>somebody or find somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1325
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:04.460
<v Speaker 1>It's called nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nose torque or knows Turk toward however</v>

1326
00:55:04.461 --> 00:55:06.600
<v Speaker 1>it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no knows torque.</v>

1327
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:08.840

<v Speaker 1>And so I do that.</v>

1329
00:55:10.801 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 1>And then the other one that I just made</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can buy this for like pennies on</v>

1330
00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:15.360
<v Speaker 1>the dollar on Amazon.</v>

1331
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:17.010

1332
00:55:17.011 --> 00:55:19.320
<v Speaker 1>inhalers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's some guy just smelled it.</v>

1333
00:55:19.321 --> 00:55:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got it.</v>

1335
00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:22.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1336
00:55:22.651 --> 00:55:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard like gift packs of Bud.</v>

1337
00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Did he just do it or is he getting ready</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it?</v>

1338
00:55:27.221 --> 00:55:28.530
<v Speaker 1>It's opened it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like smelling.</v>

1339
00:55:28.531 --> 00:55:29.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's ammonia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1340
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:33.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know chemically like I would</v>

1341
00:55:33.811 --> 00:55:37.230
<v Speaker 1>imagine it just put your sympathetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system into overdrive when you</v>

1342
00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:40.170
<v Speaker 1>sniff all that ammonia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] he's been really ginger.</v>

1343
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:41.320
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1344
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get some of my friends at</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants.</v>

1345
00:55:45.031 --> 00:55:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I carried around some times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus going into a restaurant.</v>

1346
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I have smelt my bouquets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

1347
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:50.640
<v Speaker 1>You could smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go get it.</v>

1348
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now you want to,</v>

1349
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:54.450
<v Speaker 1>you want to sniff it right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1350
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.400
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1351
00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Knows torque.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's out in the car.</v>

1352
00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I was in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>

1353
00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:00.230
<v Speaker 1>you know what we'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it after.</v>

1354
00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:01.980
<v Speaker 1>It'd be boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Podcasting.</v>

1355
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Plus if people weren't really want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try it,</v>

1356
00:56:03.711 --> 00:56:05.840
<v Speaker 1>they can just buy it on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1357
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.630
<v Speaker 1>the other one is up and excites you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows you to,</v>

1358
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:12.750
<v Speaker 1>so they should be on the field doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that before they,</v>

1359
00:56:12.751 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I would recommend that.</v>

1360
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.250
<v Speaker 1>You're probably seeing guys like</v>
<v Speaker 1>nosebleeds and heart attacks.</v>

1361
00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:21.210
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1362
00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:24.940
<v Speaker 1>the other one is a peppermint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever used like peppermint oil</v>

1363
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.710
<v Speaker 1>in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they've done studies on this,</v>

1364
00:56:26.711 --> 00:56:28.870
<v Speaker 1>on peppermint oil and athletic</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

1365
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:30.990
<v Speaker 1>And what I have is this little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1366
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:32.990
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a little Tampon or you can</v>

1367
00:56:32.991 --> 00:56:35.920
<v Speaker 1>buy these on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're called aroma therapy inhalers</v>

1368
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.700
<v Speaker 1>and it's like this little cotton wick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you put it,</v>

1369
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.830
<v Speaker 1>you put essential oil on the cotton</v>
<v Speaker 1>wick,</v>

1370
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:44.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it absorbs into the wic and then you</v>

1371
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:47.620
<v Speaker 1>put the cap on and you can carry this</v>
<v Speaker 1>around in the gym in your pocket.</v>

1372
00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Or I played tennis on Wednesday night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I bring it to my tennis matches and</v>

1373
00:56:51.161 --> 00:56:53.500
<v Speaker 1>while I'm playing tennis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll stop sometimes and sniff this</v>

1374
00:56:53.501 --> 00:56:55.920
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of say like awake and alert and do</v>

1375
00:56:55.921 --> 00:56:58.150
<v Speaker 1>it like it is just peppermint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just peppermint.</v>

1376
00:56:58.151 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 1>But it has this amazing effect.</v>

1377
00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:01.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like this wakefulness promoting</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>

1378
00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Peppermint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peppermint is amazing.</v>

1379
00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:06.620
<v Speaker 1>I put like if you get bloating or gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can smear that around your,</v>

1380
00:57:06.621 --> 00:57:10.690
<v Speaker 1>your stomach and it makes it go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes one of my favorite oils to use.</v>

1381
00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How it gets absorbed through the skin.</v>

1382
00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:13.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1383
00:57:13.991 --> 00:57:17.680
<v Speaker 1>this is skin is skin is a out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the internal organs,</v>

1384
00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it actually goes into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual stomach like in like like</v>

1385
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:24.040
<v Speaker 1>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the epithelial lining and into</v>

1386
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:25.960
<v Speaker 1>the end of the actual intestine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like it,</v>

1387
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 1>it has an effect for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of what I just started using</v>

1388
00:57:29.351 --> 00:57:34.350
<v Speaker 1>recently is topical cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Topical Cbd and the lack a role on</v>

1389
00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 1>almost like a deal on rent roll on kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a thing.</v>

1390
00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.200
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The CBD,</v>

1391
00:57:38.201 --> 00:57:39.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one,</v>

1392
00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:42.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1393
00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:47.551
<v Speaker 1>it's Tumeric or curcumin with CVD and</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

1394
00:57:48.341 --> 00:57:49.000

<v Speaker 1>speaking of the,</v>

1398

<v Speaker 1>while they're not suppository,</v>

1404
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:13.510
<v Speaker 1>their demand for swallowing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

1405
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a normal route of delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can shove them up your butt like</v>

1406

<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cheesy though.</v>

1434
00:59:28.311 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 1>She she looks like a news anchor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

1435
00:59:30.591 --> 00:59:31.341
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:59:31.341 --> 00:59:32.360
<v Speaker 1>This is like for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1437
00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grapes and there we go.</v>

1438
00:59:34.131 --> 00:59:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I called it the grapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say yeah,</v>

1439
00:59:36.051 --> 00:59:38.450
<v Speaker 1>that it's actually a cool spa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never done the wine,</v>

1440
00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

1441
00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you'd get drunk from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>

1442
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it would actually wind</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in your,</v>

1443
00:59:44.451 --> 00:59:46.860
<v Speaker 1>in your set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they use antioxidant rich temper neo</v>

1444
00:59:46.861 --> 00:59:49.940
<v Speaker 1>grapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well how could you not get some sort of</v>

1445
00:59:49.941 --> 00:59:53.270
<v Speaker 1>absorption?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you would get something about</v>

1446
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:56.270
<v Speaker 1>the sensory deprivation tank is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the epsom salts,</v>

1447
00:59:56.271 --> 00:59:58.140
<v Speaker 1>your body absorbs a lot of magnesium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1448
00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I like the magnesium chloride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like using actual magnesium and said,</v>

1449
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:04.040
<v Speaker 1>and I like that cause you can get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1450
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what they used to melt</v>
<v Speaker 1>ice.</v>

1451
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Like you can just buy this stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>rocks hall.</v>

1452
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I know you guys don't melt a lot of ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>in California,</v>

1453
01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>but like in Washington state you can buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnesium chloride about like a fricking</v>

1454
01:00:13.471 --> 01:00:16.370
<v Speaker 1>like concrete size bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know concrete mixed size bag of it.</v>

1455
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:19.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same stuff that they sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>on these expensive websites as like</v>

1456
01:00:19.791 --> 01:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>magnesium salts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just magnesium chloride and you can</v>

1457
01:00:22.701 --> 01:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>dump that into your year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more magnesium than you get from</v>

1458
01:00:25.161 --> 01:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>epsom salts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's really what you want is the</v>

1459
01:00:27.471 --> 01:00:29.980
<v Speaker 1>magnesium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's displacing the calcium.</v>

1460
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:31.630
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty soon the relaxing effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1461
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1462
01:00:32.091 --> 01:00:34.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should add that to my tank</v>

1463
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>magnesium because I've already got</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves first to make sure it's not</v>

1464
01:00:39.141 --> 01:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>going to mess up the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there like a filtration mechanism on</v>

1465
01:00:41.811 --> 01:00:43.760
<v Speaker 1>the 10 yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some pretty heavy filtration</v>

1466
01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it filters out the epson salts have</v>

1467
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>an idea for float tanks.</v>

1468
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>You know her my idea of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's where I just get it.</v>

1469
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I get really bored and float tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1470
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Copaiba Oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've heard of this.</v>

1485
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:32.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Copaiba oil acts on the endocannabinoid</v>

1486
01:01:32.661 --> 01:01:36.650
<v Speaker 1>receptors very similarly to thc and cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has what's called like an</v>

1487
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:40.370
<v Speaker 1>entourage effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning it enhances the effects of CBD</v>

1488
01:01:40.371 --> 01:01:40.910
<v Speaker 1>and thc.</v>

1489
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:42.920
<v Speaker 1>So like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're vaping,</v>

1490
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>you can add like a couple of drops of</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil over the top of the herbs,</v>

1491
01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can mix it into like an edible</v>

1492
01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>cakes that you make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1493
01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1494
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My sister accidentally took one last</v>

1495
01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.860
<v Speaker 1>week and said she had the best night of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep of her life.</v>

1496
01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1497
01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't travel with them cause they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell like you just open up a,</v>

1498
01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>a what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bass can full of weed.</v>

1499
01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1500
01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't want those in the bouquets</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're traveling dogs.</v>

1501
01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1502
01:02:08.811 --> 01:02:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Every time I pull line of dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow me through the airport.</v>

1503
01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>We're like Oj Simpson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways though,</v>

1504
01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.130
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1505
01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mix.</v>

1506
01:02:17.661 --> 01:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I use coconut oil and g and dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolate and a little bit of Stevia.</v>

1507
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Like I have this butterscotch toffees</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stevia.</v>

1508
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1509
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I travel everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it in sparkling water.</v>

1510
01:02:26.401 --> 01:02:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I put it in coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an organic butter,</v>

1511
01:02:29.071 --> 01:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Scotch toffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stevia addicted to it.</v>

1512
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a company called,</v>

1513
01:02:33.001 --> 01:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Micah organics.</v>

1514
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I actually get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a three pack.</v>

1515
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>O,</v>
<v Speaker 1>m I c a I get off Amazon is,</v>

1516
01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>was vanilla butterscotch toffee and</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane.</v>

1517
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Like if you just don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to sweeten something but you</v>

1518
01:02:44.581 --> 01:02:46.990
<v Speaker 1>don't want those extra flavors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best best dba.</v>

1519
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So I put all this in the edible and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this countertop immersion blender</v>

1520
01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:51.290
<v Speaker 1>called the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1521
01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:55.250
<v Speaker 1>a magical butter machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

1522
01:02:55.251 --> 01:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>you blend this and it blends on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your counter for like eight hours and</v>

1523
01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:01.770
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff that makes us together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you pour it into molds and you</v>

1524
01:03:01.771 --> 01:03:03.300
<v Speaker 1>can just put it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the freezer.</v>

1525
01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And then I keep it in these like little</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miron glass jars so it doesn't degrade</v>

1526
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.060
<v Speaker 1>and it's just like the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best edible.</v>

1527
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>So I should try something before float</v>
<v Speaker 1>tanks.</v>

1528
01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Returned to my float tank idea.</v>

1529
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get these ideas when I'm in the</v>

1530
01:03:18.811 --> 01:03:22.620
<v Speaker 1>float tank and I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and usually it's like five or 10 minutes</v>

1531
01:03:22.621 --> 01:03:26.030
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I spend the next 50 minutes trying to</v>

1532
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.060
<v Speaker 1>remit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't forget this,</v>

1533
01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:28.710
<v Speaker 1>don't forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I try to like these little mnemonic</v>

1534
01:03:28.711 --> 01:03:30.900
<v Speaker 1>techniques where you imagine like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1535
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:31.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1536
01:03:31.871 --> 01:03:34.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an image of what you remembered is</v>

1537
01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:36.600
<v Speaker 1>waiting for you outside the door as soon</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you opened the float tank.</v>

1538
01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:38.700
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might work for you to remember and,</v>

1539
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.350
<v Speaker 1>but basically it just kind of screws up</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole ability to be able to just like</v>

1540
01:03:43.351 --> 01:03:47.040
<v Speaker 1>let thoughts come and go and relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my idea is this,</v>

1541
01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:51.940
<v Speaker 1>why not have some kind of a recorder</v>
<v Speaker 1>going forward or you thought we made a</v>

1542
01:03:51.941 --> 01:03:53.450
<v Speaker 1>record and you can get those shit?</v>

1543
01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.580
<v Speaker 1>I was the first one to the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1544
01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing,</v>

1545
01:03:57.071 --> 01:03:57.710
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1546
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:59.550
<v Speaker 1>so like a voice activated recording.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1547
01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you have one like I never did</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1548
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:05.150
<v Speaker 1>and then you walk out and you just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>an MP three play buck.</v>

1549
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought of.</v>

1550
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to figure out what a</v>

1551
01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:12.270
<v Speaker 1>good one would be and how to set it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there with all the salts and not have</v>

1552
01:04:12.271 --> 01:04:15.960
<v Speaker 1>it degrade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think you could figure it out.</v>

1553
01:04:15.961 --> 01:04:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean my thoughts are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought is a Velcro,</v>

1554
01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:22.530
<v Speaker 1>velcro patch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slap it in when you go in there and then</v>

1555
01:04:22.531 --> 01:04:24.690
<v Speaker 1>activate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever see those voice activated ones</v>

1556
01:04:24.691 --> 01:04:26.700
<v Speaker 1>with a red light and seeing voice</v>
<v Speaker 1>activated recorders?</v>

1557
01:04:26.701 --> 01:04:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to break the lie.</v>

1558
01:04:27.691 --> 01:04:29.130
<v Speaker 1>You super easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Well they make these led.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1560
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1561
01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:33.391
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1562
01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:34.081
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1563
01:04:34.081 --> 01:04:35.580
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I travel I don't like to get all</v>

1564
01:04:35.581 --> 01:04:38.190
<v Speaker 1>the blue light and the hotel rooms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll unplug things.</v>

1565
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Try to make the hotel room dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1566
01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Cause when you flip off the lights in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel room,</v>

1567
01:04:41.401 --> 01:04:43.290
<v Speaker 1>it's just like fricking Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1568
01:04:43.291 --> 01:04:47.400
<v Speaker 1>There's blue lights on the TV and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>flashing all over the place.</v>

1569
01:04:47.401 --> 01:04:49.250
<v Speaker 1>So they make these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had it for awhile.</v>

1570
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't travel with it any more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a black tape you can put</v>

1571
01:04:51.301 --> 01:04:53.910
<v Speaker 1>over over things that light up in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

1572
01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:54.780
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1573
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.360
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1574
01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:58.141
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1575
01:04:58.141 --> 01:04:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1576
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:03.090
<v Speaker 1>they're like led light blockers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like tape basically,</v>

1577
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.750
<v Speaker 1>but you just put it over the cover of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that lights up.</v>

1578
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.030
<v Speaker 1>You can use something like that on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital recorder.</v>

1579
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get to sell this for millions of</v>

1580
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.500
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think the digital recorded thing</v>

1581
01:05:13.501 --> 01:05:15.900
<v Speaker 1>is a really good idea and someone needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1582
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I need to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have my idea.</v>

1583
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:18.933
<v Speaker 1>It was not your idea.</v>

1584
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you first start doing it all?</v>

1585
01:05:21.761 --> 01:05:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like two years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had one of them.</v>

1586
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.220
<v Speaker 1>I've had a tank since 2002 early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1587
01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1588
01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I raced an ironman triathlon for eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and just got tons of sensory dep</v>

1589
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just staring at that black line at the</v>

1590
01:05:36.101 --> 01:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to just like get in</v>

1591
01:05:38.681 --> 01:05:41.590
<v Speaker 1>water and relax and not feel like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to swim or I just,</v>

1592
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I've never been able to get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxed.</v>

1593
01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.261
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1594
01:05:44.261 --> 01:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>So you associate like water with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement because associate water with</v>

1595
01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:48.821
<v Speaker 1>swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1596
01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I get in water and I won it and I love</v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

1597
01:05:50.841 --> 01:05:51.430
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

1598
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I free dive and I spear fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this book,</v>

1599
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep by James Nest Door,</v>

1600
01:05:57.070 --> 01:06:00.820
<v Speaker 1>amazing book about all these cool things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that going when you go down deep and he</v>

1601
01:06:00.821 --> 01:06:03.580
<v Speaker 1>talks about how Olympic athletes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>using this now to enhance the</v>

1602
01:06:03.581 --> 01:06:06.430
<v Speaker 1>performance because your spleen</v>
<v Speaker 1>compresses and you produce more</v>

1603
01:06:06.431 --> 01:06:08.410
<v Speaker 1>renewable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten more red blood cells.</v>

1604
01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Same thing that you produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1605
01:06:09.851 --> 01:06:10.690
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sauna,</v>

1606
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.450
<v Speaker 1>like if you do a workout and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hot and then you go in the sauna</v>

1607
01:06:13.451 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 1>after they've done studies on this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found that 30 minutes of heat</v>

1608
01:06:16.901 --> 01:06:18.940
<v Speaker 1>therapy after you've already gotten the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body hot,</v>

1609
01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you produce hipo the same as if you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use the performance enhancing drug.</v>

1610
01:06:23.381 --> 01:06:24.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because there was a</v>

1611
01:06:24.611 --> 01:06:28.020
<v Speaker 1>statistic just came out about</v>
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy and this is this echo</v>

1612
01:06:28.021 --> 01:06:31.240
<v Speaker 1>something that Rhonda Patrick was saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you do Cryo,</v>

1613
01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:36.540
<v Speaker 1>her advice was you should wait at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour after a workout before you do it</v>

1614
01:06:36.821 --> 01:06:40.210
<v Speaker 1>and allow your body to have some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

1615
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1616
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.720
<v Speaker 1>from the exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Sauna,</v>

1617
01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.270
<v Speaker 1>they're saying you should do almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately after.</v>

1618
01:06:46.271 --> 01:06:47.650
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea with this,</v>

1619
01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:50.710
<v Speaker 1>and there was a brand new study that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just came out like three days ago where</v>

1620
01:06:50.711 --> 01:06:55.090
<v Speaker 1>they showed that heat post exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhanced the effects of exercise,</v>

1621
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.680
<v Speaker 1>whereas cold blunted the hormetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>response to exercise,</v>

1622
01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.530
<v Speaker 1>which makes sense.</v>

1623
01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing side of a window</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1624
01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:03.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a window of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1625
01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:05.320
<v Speaker 1>so the deal is you don't want to blunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hermetic response.</v>

1626
01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Sexualized high dose antioxidants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy,</v>

1627
01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.680
<v Speaker 1>cold immersion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that can do this.</v>

1628
01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:15.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem with but fighters cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fighters are getting into cold</v>

1629
01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:19.540
<v Speaker 1>immersion like immediately afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what you'd want to wait until</v>

1630
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:22.480
<v Speaker 1>later on in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no research on the amount of</v>

1631
01:07:22.481 --> 01:07:25.360
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me what I do it same thing when I do</v>

1632
01:07:25.361 --> 01:07:28.480
<v Speaker 1>like a hard afternoon and work out a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to couple hours afterwards cause you get</v>

1633
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:33.460
<v Speaker 1>a bigger testosterone and growth hormone</v>
<v Speaker 1>response when you wait after work out to</v>

1634
01:07:33.461 --> 01:07:34.870
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>

1635
01:07:34.871 --> 01:07:37.780
<v Speaker 1>actually actually mark Sisson was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first guy who told me about this and it</v>

1636
01:07:37.781 --> 01:07:40.960
<v Speaker 1>turns out that there actually is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better hormonal response when you fast</v>

1637
01:07:40.961 --> 01:07:41.794
<v Speaker 1>post exercise.</v>

1638
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with antioxidants and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were a couple of exceptions I can tell</v>

1639
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:49.450
<v Speaker 1>you about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with a cryotherapy,</v>

1640
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:54.430
<v Speaker 1>not the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you finish up a hard afternoon or</v>

1641
01:07:54.431 --> 01:07:55.990
<v Speaker 1>especially like an early evening</v>
<v Speaker 1>workout,</v>

1642
01:07:55.991 --> 01:08:00.580
<v Speaker 1>you have a very high body temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my theory is that a brief dose of</v>

1643
01:08:00.581 --> 01:08:02.050
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all jump in the cold pool and get</v>

1644
01:08:02.051 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 1>out and not if not a phone call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just enough to decrease the core body</v>

1645
01:08:05.111 --> 01:08:07.090
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the ways that you</v>

1646
01:08:07.091 --> 01:08:10.330
<v Speaker 1>enhanced deep sleep cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I also sleep on this thing called the</v>

1647
01:08:10.331 --> 01:08:14.520
<v Speaker 1>chilly pad that circulates like cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>water underneath my body wirelessly</v>

1648
01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.140
<v Speaker 1>start sent me one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cool thing is like your partner</v>

1649
01:08:18.141 --> 01:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>can put their temperature on and I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>put my temperature on and you can,</v>

1650
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:23.800
<v Speaker 1>you can sleep or whatever temp you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sleep with this thing as cooking</v>

1651
01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:25.340
<v Speaker 1>oil at 55 degrees.</v>

1652
01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

1653
01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>it's like background noise cause I sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all these binaries and everything.</v>

1654
01:08:30.021 --> 01:08:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use the strict codes called sleep</v>

1655
01:08:32.331 --> 01:08:34.220
<v Speaker 1>stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Dj for sleep.</v>

1656
01:08:34.221 --> 01:08:37.370
<v Speaker 1>So I put my phone in airplane mode and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I have these,</v>

1657
01:08:37.371 --> 01:08:40.040
<v Speaker 1>these noise blocking headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a side sleeper,</v>

1658
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you can use these things called sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>

1659
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.880
<v Speaker 1>which is like a headband that goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>around your head.</v>

1660
01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways though back to the,</v>

1661
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>to the not doing the cold after</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

1662
01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:52.550
<v Speaker 1>So you wait a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think decreasing the body's core</v>

1663
01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>temperature is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a cold shower,</v>

1664
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.910
<v Speaker 1>cold water immersion also beats out</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd therapy because yeah,</v>

1665
01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 1>it's actually more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a study they did last</v>

1666
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.110
<v Speaker 1>month on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cold water immersion was very</v>

1667
01:09:03.111 --> 01:09:06.680
<v Speaker 1>effective in reducing postworkout muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>soreness and that inflammatory response</v>

1668
01:09:06.681 --> 01:09:09.260
<v Speaker 1>to exercise compared to cryotherapy.</v>

1669
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:10.880
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should wait a little bit before you</v>

1670
01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.170
<v Speaker 1>do it each way a little bit before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1671
01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:15.530
<v Speaker 1>But I think part of that is due to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get like this hydrostatic pressure of</v>

1672
01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:17.060
<v Speaker 1>water against the skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1673
01:09:17.061 --> 01:09:19.940
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of pushes the cold against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skin a little bit better.</v>

1674
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other reason is that when</v>

1675
01:09:22.311 --> 01:09:24.920
<v Speaker 1>your head gets wet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're head goes under,</v>

1676
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:26.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing as you would get with a cold</v>

1677
01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:28.310
<v Speaker 1>shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get like this Mammalian dive reflex,</v>

1678
01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:31.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that sharp intake of breath and</v>

1679
01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:35.990
<v Speaker 1>that activates your vagus nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we talked about HRV and heart rate</v>

1680
01:09:35.991 --> 01:09:39.260
<v Speaker 1>variability tracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you do something like that that</v>

1681
01:09:39.261 --> 01:09:43.100
<v Speaker 1>improves the tone of the Vegas nerve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would actually improve your ability</v>

1682
01:09:43.101 --> 01:09:45.140
<v Speaker 1>to recover and improve the strength of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1683
01:09:45.141 --> 01:09:48.020
<v Speaker 1>of your nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they sell like vagal nerve</v>

1684
01:09:48.021 --> 01:09:53.021
<v Speaker 1>stimulators and they've looked into like</v>
<v Speaker 1>chanting humming a singing,</v>

1685
01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jaw,</v>

1686
01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:59.840
<v Speaker 1>they call it jaw realignment therapy</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently removes the pressure that the</v>

1687
01:09:59.841 --> 01:10:02.150
<v Speaker 1>trigeminal nerve can place on the vegas</v>
<v Speaker 1>nerve.</v>

1688
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:05.750
<v Speaker 1>There's all these things you can do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance the health of the vegas nerve</v>

1689
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:09.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve your hrv or your heart rate</v>

1690
01:10:09.111 --> 01:10:12.080
<v Speaker 1>variability allows your sympathetic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your parasympathetic nervous system</v>

1691
01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.780
<v Speaker 1>tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean by that?</v>

1692
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.930
<v Speaker 1>The tone of the nerve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1693
01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:19.500
<v Speaker 1>it would basically be synonymous with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1694
01:10:19.501 --> 01:10:21.200
<v Speaker 1>the health of the nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

1695
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:22.400
<v Speaker 1>what's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's,</v>

1696
01:10:22.401 --> 01:10:24.070
<v Speaker 1>if it's changing like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1697
01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:24.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1698
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.780
<v Speaker 1>what do you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The myelin sheath of the nerve or</v>

1699
01:10:26.781 --> 01:10:27.770
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

1700
01:10:27.771 --> 01:10:29.720
<v Speaker 1>when you're increasing the tone of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nerve,</v>

1701
01:10:29.721 --> 01:10:33.200
<v Speaker 1>but more or less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's healthy for the vegas nerve when</v>

1702
01:10:33.201 --> 01:10:35.570
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get your head wet or</v>

1703
01:10:35.571 --> 01:10:37.520
<v Speaker 1>underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I go in my cold pool,</v>

1704
01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>after workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put my head under and then come up</v>

1705
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:43.190
<v Speaker 1>like five or 10 times just to go up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and up and down.</v>

1706
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Then I get out and if I'm going to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer cold soak,</v>

1707
01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:48.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not right after a workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1708
01:10:48.891 --> 01:10:53.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two studies I found on antioxidant</v>

1709
01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.220
<v Speaker 1>use after workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1710
01:10:55.221 --> 01:10:57.500
<v Speaker 1>High dose antioxidants like vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin E,</v>

1711
01:10:57.501 --> 01:10:59.600
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's supposedly blunts the hermetic</v>

1712
01:10:59.601 --> 01:11:02.930
<v Speaker 1>response to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was one study that shows that</v>

1713
01:11:02.931 --> 01:11:06.860
<v Speaker 1>green tea polyphenols don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So green tea would allow you to fight</v>

1714
01:11:06.861 --> 01:11:09.890
<v Speaker 1>off the inflammatory effects of exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>without blunting.</v>

1715
01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:13.530
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satellite cell proliferation or of new</v>

1716
01:11:13.531 --> 01:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria are all of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to happen.</v>

1717
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:20.190
<v Speaker 1>And the other one was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

1718
01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:22.170
<v Speaker 1>this is a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not a lot of people are talking</v>

1719
01:11:22.171 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>about this now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like hydrogen rich compounds.</v>

1720
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it hydrogen rich water.</v>

1721
01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And there's these companies now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like four or five of them.</v>

1722
01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:33.220
<v Speaker 1>They sell like these tablets that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can dissolve in water and there's a,</v>

1723
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the molecular hydrogen foundation,</v>

1724
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:40.050
<v Speaker 1>they do research on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this hydrogen and they're not,</v>

1725
01:11:40.051 --> 01:11:42.420
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a financial affiliation</v>
<v Speaker 1>with any of these companies.</v>

1726
01:11:42.421 --> 01:11:46.020
<v Speaker 1>So I respect some of the research that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do and they've found that it</v>

1727
01:11:46.021 --> 01:11:49.980
<v Speaker 1>actually blunts the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it allows for antiinflammatory and</v>

1728
01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:53.010
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant effects to shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the inflammatory response to</v>

1729
01:11:53.011 --> 01:11:55.720
<v Speaker 1>exercise without blunting the hormetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

1730
01:11:55.721 --> 01:11:59.220
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be like green tea and molecular</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen would be the two things that I</v>

1731
01:11:59.221 --> 01:12:04.221
<v Speaker 1>know of that you could do postworkout to</v>
<v Speaker 1>blunt that inflammatory response without</v>

1732
01:12:04.441 --> 01:12:05.910
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1733
01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:10.170
<v Speaker 1>blunting the hormetic response to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise so it'll enhance without</v>

1734
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:12.360
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1735
01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Have your cake and eat it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I think that's</v>

1736
01:12:14.521 --> 01:12:17.280
<v Speaker 1>probably really good about cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>immersion therapy also,</v>

1737
01:12:17.281 --> 01:12:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a meditative aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into that incredible cold and</v>

1738
01:12:21.841 --> 01:12:23.760
<v Speaker 1>just relaxing and calming.</v>

1739
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.530
<v Speaker 1>And I think it does something for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

1740
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the nervous system right?</v>

1741
01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Like what I tell people is you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

1742
01:12:30.661 --> 01:12:33.360
<v Speaker 1>and I take my kids out that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've trained them at a very early</v>

1743
01:12:33.361 --> 01:12:35.760
<v Speaker 1>age to go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jump in the cold pool,</v>

1744
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:39.720
<v Speaker 1>but they'll stand in front of the cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool and calm their nervous system,</v>

1745
01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.970
<v Speaker 1>call them their heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have them visit like one of them</v>

1746
01:12:41.971 --> 01:12:43.770
<v Speaker 1>visualizes a sea otter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1747
01:12:43.771 --> 01:12:45.550
<v Speaker 1>And the other one does a polar bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1748
01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:49.530
<v Speaker 1>so they'll visualize these animals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just like impervious to cold,</v>

1749
01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they get in the water and they</v>

1750
01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:53.640
<v Speaker 1>know there's no sharp intake of breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no</v>

1751
01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:56.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people do when they take a cold</v>

1752
01:12:56.941 --> 01:12:59.820
<v Speaker 1>shower a lot of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can get your body that point,</v>

1753
01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that it probably has a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good indicator that you're</v>

1754
01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:06.030
<v Speaker 1>building that nervous system resilience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1755
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Like if you can just get in cold and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>freak out.</v>

1756
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I think people who do</v>

1757
01:13:10.501 --> 01:13:12.810
<v Speaker 1>cold should train themselves to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1758
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that argument about the sauna</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

1759
01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.590
<v Speaker 1>It also builds like a mental toughness</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to just sit in there and calm</v>

1760
01:13:19.591 --> 01:13:23.940
<v Speaker 1>yourself and get used to the adverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the point where you want to bang</v>

1761
01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:25.920
<v Speaker 1>down the door and climb out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

1762
01:13:25.921 --> 01:13:29.040
<v Speaker 1>that's what I like to get myself to in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the song because obviously you get a</v>

1763
01:13:29.041 --> 01:13:32.010
<v Speaker 1>bigger expression of heat shock protein</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more blood flow when you get really</v>

1764
01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:33.030
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1765
01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a mental effect too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with the water is talking</v>

1766
01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:38.130
<v Speaker 1>about that book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the book deep and how I got into</v>

1767
01:13:38.131 --> 01:13:40.310
<v Speaker 1>like free diving and spear fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1768
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Dph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you would love to do it.</v>

1769
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I told you I'm going to go hunt down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was telling me that it's like hunting</v>

1770
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:47.630
<v Speaker 1>underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1771
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1772
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:50.461
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1773
01:13:50.461 --> 01:13:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Aubrey and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Auburn and I spear fished in a,</v>

1774
01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:53.910
<v Speaker 1>and Kona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1775
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:55.380
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1776
01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:58.290
<v Speaker 1>he and Whitney and I went down there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just using like the little three</v>

1777
01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:01.020
<v Speaker 1>pronged guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't full on like 80 feet deep.</v>

1778
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:03.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big ass guns after Mina,</v>

1779
01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:06.030
<v Speaker 1>after tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1780
01:14:06.031 --> 01:14:07.410
<v Speaker 1>People go out there like dee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1781
01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I've never done deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good enough.</v>

1782
01:14:09.421 --> 01:14:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm under water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I attached to a tune a high,</v>

1783
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 1>well what you do is you have a real and</v>
<v Speaker 1>real is attached to a float,</v>

1784
01:14:16.710 --> 01:14:19.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so after you shoe and you spiro big</v>

1785
01:14:19.451 --> 01:14:21.430
<v Speaker 1>fish like a tuna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not dragging you.</v>

1786
01:14:21.431 --> 01:14:24.610
<v Speaker 1>It's dragging the float.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all you have to do is wait for that</v>

1787
01:14:24.611 --> 01:14:27.010
<v Speaker 1>float to pop back up wherever it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pop up.</v>

1788
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:28.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't done that.</v>

1789
01:14:28.781 --> 01:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>But that's like on my bucket list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Time.</v>

1790
01:14:31.031 --> 01:14:34.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going back to Kona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going back to Kona in April and</v>

1791
01:14:34.481 --> 01:14:36.430
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be more shallow water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spear fishing.</v>

1792
01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:38.680
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to hunt for a scrub</v>
<v Speaker 1>cattle.</v>

1793
01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Sheep go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the pig there was amazing.</v>

1794
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:42.650
<v Speaker 1>They have a scrub cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1795
01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:46.960
<v Speaker 1>And the pig feet on like macadamia nuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and avocado and explaining the old scrub</v>

1796
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:49.600
<v Speaker 1>catalyst and scrub calendar this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apparently it tastes amazing.</v>

1797
01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:53.110
<v Speaker 1>What's Grub Bulls are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're essentially domestic cattle that</v>

1798
01:14:53.111 --> 01:14:56.470
<v Speaker 1>have gone feral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some time in the past,</v>

1799
01:14:56.471 --> 01:14:58.600
<v Speaker 1>whether it's 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 generations back,</v>

1800
01:14:58.601 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they busted through some fences and now</v>

1801
01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:02.500
<v Speaker 1>they're wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1802
01:15:02.501 --> 01:15:06.370
<v Speaker 1>in Australia they hunt and they are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

1803
01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they are the most aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowls bringing on,</v>

1804
01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait gotta be real careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam Green trees buddies got gored real</v>

1805
01:15:13.481 --> 01:15:16.240
<v Speaker 1>bad and you had to be medivaced out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1806
01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:19.630
<v Speaker 1>He was in the the northern country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to play a Shitload of</v>

1807
01:15:19.631 --> 01:15:21.970
<v Speaker 1>techno hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1808
01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:23.380
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the book,</v>

1809
01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I read this book by James Nest Door and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1810
01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I had him on my podcast and I'm like</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1811
01:15:28.271 --> 01:15:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I want to learn how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

1812
01:15:29.381 --> 01:15:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I want to learn how to like compress the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spleen and go under and learn how to</v>

1813
01:15:32.621 --> 01:15:35.400
<v Speaker 1>hold my breath and get all these nervous</v>
<v Speaker 1>system benefits,</v>

1814
01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.110
<v Speaker 1>spleen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spleen just gets compelling.</v>

1815
01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll learn how to get deep enough cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even as an Ironman</v>

1816
01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.210
<v Speaker 1>triathlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't go deeper than 15 feet</v>

1817
01:15:43.211 --> 01:15:44.720
<v Speaker 1>without freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause like my,</v>

1818
01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:46.690
<v Speaker 1>my ears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd get the pressure in them and I</v>

1819
01:15:46.691 --> 01:15:48.070
<v Speaker 1>could do the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it,</v>

1820
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1821
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:52.870
<v Speaker 1>when you equalize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the Frenzel technique but the,</v>

1822
01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:53.530
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1823
01:15:53.530 --> 01:15:54.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1824
01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:55.210
<v Speaker 1>when you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1825
01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm forgetting the name of pop your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ears,</v>

1826
01:15:57.490 --> 01:16:01.090
<v Speaker 1>pop your ears technique that most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>do when they get into the water.</v>

1827
01:16:01.091 --> 01:16:04.180
<v Speaker 1>But there's another technique called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frenzel technique where you'll,</v>

1828
01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:06.190
<v Speaker 1>you'll pull the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1829
01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:09.310
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're doing it just to see like your</v>

1830
01:16:09.311 --> 01:16:12.400
<v Speaker 1>dose by dose goes out like that.</v>

1831
01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.590
<v Speaker 1>You do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can equalize it like 20 feet,</v>

1832
01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:19.120
<v Speaker 1>30 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 feet.</v>

1833
01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:21.610
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can I go learn from?</v>

1834
01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:21.911
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1835
01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:24.780
<v Speaker 1>you gotta go see this cat down in Fort</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lauderdale named Ted Hardcore.</v>

1836
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:26.530
<v Speaker 1>It's Florida and got to go back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

1837
01:16:26.531 --> 01:16:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Everything absolutely explains Dick</v>
<v Speaker 1>shocks to the stem cells.</v>

1838
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Got to learn how to do the splitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1839
01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:33.700
<v Speaker 1>So I go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunately,</v>

1840
01:16:33.701 --> 01:16:35.320
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother lives in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

1841
01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I have a place to stay when I go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that at least.</v>

1842
01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I take this free diving course and</v>

1843
01:16:41.861 --> 01:16:46.270
<v Speaker 1>he gets me from holding my breath for</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a minute and 45 seconds.</v>

1844
01:16:46.271 --> 01:16:49.510
<v Speaker 1>He got me up to four 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four magnum breath for five seconds.</v>

1845
01:16:49.511 --> 01:16:54.010
<v Speaker 1>It took me from 15 fee over five days</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to 80 feet where you're like trout,</v>

1846
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.970
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually,</v>

1847
01:16:54.971 --> 01:16:59.430
<v Speaker 1>they put a rope in the water and you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>vertical and you have like your bit,</v>

1848
01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you know the big thins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have the big fins and you have</v>

1849
01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Hamas that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen those on people,</v>

1850
01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:07.750
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like path as long as that flag,</v>

1851
01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:08.380
<v Speaker 1>what's that like?</v>

1852
01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Like three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four feet.</v>

1853
01:17:09.741 --> 01:17:10.191
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1854
01:17:10.191 --> 01:17:11.840
<v Speaker 1>they're like these big carbon fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1855
01:17:11.841 --> 01:17:13.640
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just tell me all of the best things to</v>

1856
01:17:13.641 --> 01:17:15.570
<v Speaker 1>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I contacted the editor of carbon,</v>

1857
01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:18.920
<v Speaker 1>so they're stiff and their car when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stiff and you just swim soul</v>

1858
01:17:18.921 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 1>fast in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I contacted the editor of spearing</v>

1859
01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:23.810
<v Speaker 1>magazine and asking me what's the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun to buy,</v>

1860
01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:24.670
<v Speaker 1>what are the best fans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1861
01:17:24.690 --> 01:17:26.960
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got outfitted with all this stuff and</v>

1862
01:17:26.961 --> 01:17:29.660
<v Speaker 1>then I went down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to hold my breath,</v>

1863
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:34.670
<v Speaker 1>learn how to equalize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now when I spear fish and I still,</v>

1864
01:17:34.671 --> 01:17:35.840
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got to the point where I've</v>

1865
01:17:35.841 --> 01:17:37.640
<v Speaker 1>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I go after the group or,</v>

1866
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:40.100
<v Speaker 1>and the parrot fish and like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little ones,</v>

1867
01:17:40.101 --> 01:17:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gotten to the point now where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hunting.</v>

1868
01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:46.691
<v Speaker 1>The big fish is very similar to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the very first time I went after</v>

1869
01:17:46.851 --> 01:17:49.190
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got two at once to groupers at once</v>

1870
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.110
<v Speaker 1>and apparently it wasn't group per</v>
<v Speaker 1>season,</v>

1871
01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:53.300
<v Speaker 1>so they had me put him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put him back.</v>

1872
01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not as big of a deal is like if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot an elk and you know,</v>

1873
01:17:56.551 --> 01:17:57.384
<v Speaker 1>I'm a tag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

1874
01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:59.130
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet they have a group person.</v>

1875
01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean not put them back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like take them down to their</v>

1876
01:18:01.191 --> 01:18:03.790
<v Speaker 1>little group or nest and them away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're dead.</v>

1877
01:18:03.791 --> 01:18:04.980
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1878
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you just leap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1879
01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 1>You just lead them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems ridiculous.</v>

1880
01:18:07.281 --> 01:18:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just didn't want to get fine.</v>

1881
01:18:09.591 --> 01:18:10.940
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1882
01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.670
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

1883
01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.960
<v Speaker 1>the spearfishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

1884
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And this whole like free diving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1885
01:18:16.671 --> 01:18:18.350
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got on this topic from the float</v>

1886
01:18:18.351 --> 01:18:20.060
<v Speaker 1>tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar experience.</v>

1887
01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Like you're just at peace under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

1888
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.230
<v Speaker 1>You're not wearing all the scuba</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment.</v>

1889
01:18:24.231 --> 01:18:28.130
<v Speaker 1>So fish swim up to you and you can kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like lay on the bottom of the water</v>

1890
01:18:28.131 --> 01:18:30.070
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot something as it comes.</v>

1891
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I go with my kids and they like sit on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shore with like buckets and and</v>

1892
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.580
<v Speaker 1>dives and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll help,</v>

1893
01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.590
<v Speaker 1>help bring the fish and then we'd take</v>
<v Speaker 1>it back.</v>

1894
01:18:36.591 --> 01:18:39.590
<v Speaker 1>And you have like fish cook offs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

1895
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:43.310
<v Speaker 1>He's very similar to but very similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>field of bow hunting except it's like</v>

1896
01:18:43.311 --> 01:18:47.930
<v Speaker 1>that peaceful setting in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably intensely physical while</v>

1897
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:49.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a great workout cause you're not on</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1898
01:18:49.570 --> 01:18:51.080
<v Speaker 1>you're cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're getting all the benefits of</v>

1899
01:18:51.081 --> 01:18:52.340
<v Speaker 1>cold thermogenesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1900
01:18:52.341 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 1>like the white adipose to Brown fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversion and the,</v>

1901
01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:58.010
<v Speaker 1>and the shivering and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the calorie burning.</v>

1902
01:18:58.011 --> 01:19:01.250
<v Speaker 1>And you know that angiogenesis and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff you get from cold.</v>

1903
01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.140
<v Speaker 1>But then you're also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're freaking hunting,</v>

1904
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:05.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not sitting on the edge like with</v>

1905
01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:07.640
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a fishing pole over a boat,</v>

1906
01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:09.230
<v Speaker 1>which I find intensely boring.</v>

1907
01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.790
<v Speaker 1>You're actually in there and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing all while you're holding with the</v>

1908
01:19:11.791 --> 01:19:13.490
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it all while you're holding your</v>

1909
01:19:13.491 --> 01:19:16.010
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Scuba equipment and people will do</v>

1910
01:19:16.011 --> 01:19:17.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I do breath hold walks.</v>

1911
01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.820
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well go on a walk and every time I pass</v>

1912
01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:22.040
<v Speaker 1>a telephone pole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just like take a breath and I'll</v>

1913
01:19:22.041 --> 01:19:23.760
<v Speaker 1>hold my breath as long as possible in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pasta.</v>

1914
01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Tell it when I passed the telephone pole</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll breathe through my nose to</v>

1915
01:19:26.811 --> 01:19:28.160
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I get to the next</v>

1916
01:19:28.161 --> 01:19:29.690
<v Speaker 1>telephone pole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll hold my breath.</v>

1917
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Probably gonna die some day like next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bus stop.</v>

1918
01:19:33.261 --> 01:19:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Like a car blue in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1919
01:19:36.891 --> 01:19:38.180
<v Speaker 1>spear fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd like it.</v>

1920
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think you'd dig it.</v>

1921
01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like an interesting mental</v>

1922
01:19:41.421 --> 01:19:44.050
<v Speaker 1>exercise table because you have to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shit together while you're at the</v>

1923
01:19:44.051 --> 01:19:45.710
<v Speaker 1>water and you're wanting to take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>

1924
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.120
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people die.</v>

1925
01:19:47.121 --> 01:19:49.520
<v Speaker 1>People do shallow water blackout and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I learned.</v>

1926
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.310
<v Speaker 1>That's why I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy sent me down to Fort Lauderdale</v>

1927
01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:54.410
<v Speaker 1>because this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he teaches safety,</v>

1928
01:19:54.411 --> 01:19:56.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't do like the Wim Hoff breathing</v>

1929
01:19:56.331 --> 01:19:59.360
<v Speaker 1>and blow off all the carbon dioxide so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hold your breath longer,</v>

1930
01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:01.490
<v Speaker 1>which is great for holding your breath</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

1931
01:20:01.491 --> 01:20:04.490
<v Speaker 1>But carbon dioxide is your body's signal</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take a breath.</v>

1932
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:06.230
<v Speaker 1>If you're real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your carbon dioxide,</v>

1933
01:20:06.231 --> 01:20:09.280
<v Speaker 1>then here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to have walk out.</v>

1934
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:12.840
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're floating on the water before</v>

1935
01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:15.450
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take a dive down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She kind of like watching the water,</v>

1936
01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:20.630
<v Speaker 1>you're watching the fish and you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>do like a two count breath in to count</v>

1937
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:24.180
<v Speaker 1>hold and then 10 count breath out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>count hold.</v>

1938
01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.190
<v Speaker 1>And you're just like getting the heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate down.</v>

1939
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.740
<v Speaker 1>You're getting the nervous system calm.</v>

1940
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.580
<v Speaker 1>You're not even supposed to do like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of caffeine which jacks up the</v>

1941
01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:35.130
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] system and cause you to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to hold your breath as long</v>

1942
01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:37.920
<v Speaker 1>dairy makes the mucus more thick and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1943
01:20:37.921 --> 01:20:39.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't hold your breath as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do a of dairy.</v>

1944
01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:41.850
<v Speaker 1>So you don't do a lot of dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't do a lot of caffeine and then</v>

1945
01:20:41.851 --> 01:20:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you just dive down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did,</v>

1946
01:20:43.651 --> 01:20:46.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought ketones down because a lot of</v>

1947
01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:48.890
<v Speaker 1>like a dominique d'agostino has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

1948
01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done research on like a divers and</v>

1949
01:20:51.451 --> 01:20:55.530
<v Speaker 1>reducing a lot of the effects of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced a reduced flow of oxygen to the</v>

1950
01:20:55.531 --> 01:20:58.920
<v Speaker 1>brain that apparently these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these navy seal divers get and he does</v>

1951
01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:02.010
<v Speaker 1>research on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the use of Ketosis and ketones.</v>

1952
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:03.600
<v Speaker 1>And one of the days that we were out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1953
01:21:03.601 --> 01:21:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I actually took a key tones and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased my breath hold time just using</v>

1954
01:21:07.471 --> 01:21:09.450
<v Speaker 1>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these exogenous ketones.</v>

1955
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So apparently they have an effect as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1956
01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's because the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>is using more,</v>

1957
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:17.130
<v Speaker 1>more of the ketones and the glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they increase breath hold time that,</v>

1958
01:21:17.131 --> 01:21:17.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1959
01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:19.620
<v Speaker 1>they came up with that for rebreathers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1960
01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Like that's when they started getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people maybe seal divers when they're</v>

1961
01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.700
<v Speaker 1>using rebreathers apparently in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain percentage of them are</v>

1962
01:21:25.701 --> 01:21:27.250
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to seizures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And they use a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well two things,</v>

1964
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:31.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketosis and,</v>

1965
01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.110
<v Speaker 1>and cbd are two things that are used for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1966
01:21:34.111 --> 01:21:36.280
<v Speaker 1>for like epilepsy and seizures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1967
01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ketosis supposedly has an amazing effect</v>

1968
01:21:38.521 --> 01:21:40.900
<v Speaker 1>with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and did a seizures.</v>

1969
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I did 12 months of like strict Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a four study for a lab study in Florida.</v>

1970
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:49.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

1971
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a university of Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy named um,</v>

1972
01:21:54.970 --> 01:21:56.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Volak.</v>

1973
01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.720
<v Speaker 1>He does a lot of like ketone research</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had one group of athletes follow</v>

1974
01:22:00.721 --> 01:22:05.640
<v Speaker 1>just a normal and Darren's athlete Diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 12 months and another group follow</v>

1975
01:22:05.641 --> 01:22:10.230
<v Speaker 1>like a high fat low carb Ketogenic Diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 12 months because he wanted to see</v>

1976
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:15.180
<v Speaker 1>if you would maintain your glycogen</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels and if you would,</v>

1977
01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:17.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your performance would be synonymous</v>

1978
01:22:17.401 --> 01:22:19.320
<v Speaker 1>to the group that did not eat the high</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

1979
01:22:19.321 --> 01:22:22.050
<v Speaker 1>low carb Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would happen to inflammatory</v>

1980
01:22:22.051 --> 01:22:22.560
<v Speaker 1>markers?</v>

1981
01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:25.090
<v Speaker 1>What would happen to the gut microbiome?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1982
01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.930
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted like a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies on high fat,</v>

1983
01:22:27.931 --> 01:22:30.900
<v Speaker 1>low carb diets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll follow people for like two weeks</v>

1984
01:22:30.901 --> 01:22:32.700
<v Speaker 1>or three days and have meat like high</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

1985
01:22:32.701 --> 01:22:36.630
<v Speaker 1>low carb and then see what happens when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go jam on a bike for 30 minutes or</v>

1986
01:22:36.631 --> 01:22:38.660
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they want to do like a longterm</v>

1987
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:43.670
<v Speaker 1>study to see if the body can adapt to</v>
<v Speaker 1>burning fats as a fuel with long term</v>

1988
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:48.090
<v Speaker 1>utilization of a high fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't do any more by the way.</v>

1989
01:22:48.170 --> 01:22:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1990
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I save all my carbohydrates for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>evening.</v>

1991
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Then I eat a bunch of carbohydrates in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evening.</v>

1992
01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.450
<v Speaker 1>What kind of carbs you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1993
01:22:54.451 --> 01:22:56.960
<v Speaker 1>like a red wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dark chocolate too.</v>

1994
01:22:56.961 --> 01:22:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Or starches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yams,</v>

1995
01:22:58.171 --> 01:22:59.070
<v Speaker 1>sweet potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You my,</v>

1996
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.470
<v Speaker 1>my wife's a cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she does like this amazing like slow</v>

1997
01:23:01.471 --> 01:23:04.930
<v Speaker 1>fermented sourdough bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which pre digest all the gluten and the</v>

1998
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:05.200
<v Speaker 1>doors.</v>

1999
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:09.490
<v Speaker 1>The glycaemic index,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pretty much keen wa Amaranth,</v>

2000
01:23:09.491 --> 01:23:11.320
<v Speaker 1>millet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't follow a specific diet in terms</v>

2001
01:23:11.321 --> 01:23:15.280
<v Speaker 1>of like restricting certain food groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My philosophy is you just make them</v>

2002
01:23:15.281 --> 01:23:19.780
<v Speaker 1>digestible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating carbs at night that it's good</v>

2003
01:23:19.781 --> 01:23:23.440
<v Speaker 1>thing to relax you as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically you're more insulin</v>

2004
01:23:23.441 --> 01:23:28.441
<v Speaker 1>sensitive in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can make yourself more insulin</v>

2005
01:23:28.841 --> 01:23:33.010
<v Speaker 1>sensitive in the evening and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of that is if you consume a</v>

2006
01:23:33.011 --> 01:23:35.110
<v Speaker 1>bunch of your carbohydrates in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning when you're in an insulin</v>

2007
01:23:35.111 --> 01:23:37.540
<v Speaker 1>sensitive state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to rely upon as your</v>

2008
01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:41.110
<v Speaker 1>primary fuel during the rest of the day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karma hydrates,</v>

2009
01:23:41.111 --> 01:23:42.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of teaching your body how to be</v>

2010
01:23:42.581 --> 01:23:45.430
<v Speaker 1>a fat burning machine and tap into fats</v>
<v Speaker 1>and generate ketones.</v>

2011
01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:49.150
<v Speaker 1>So you save your carbohydrate intake for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day.</v>

2012
01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:52.690
<v Speaker 1>But I also saved my hard workout for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the day,</v>

2013
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:56.170
<v Speaker 1>which is when your body temperature</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaks and your grip strength peaks and</v>

2014
01:23:56.530 --> 01:23:57.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2015
01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.271
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2016
01:23:58.271 --> 01:23:59.770
<v Speaker 1>you can do a hard workout.</v>

2017
01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.410
<v Speaker 1>And anybody who's rolls out of bed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to do a crossfit wad versus doing</v>

2018
01:24:02.411 --> 01:24:02.810
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2019
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:05.530
<v Speaker 1>the 5:00 PM the afternoon knows this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can do it pretty good hard</v>

2020
01:24:05.531 --> 01:24:08.110
<v Speaker 1>workout like in the later afternoon or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evening when you're warmed up.</v>

2021
01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.160
<v Speaker 1>But that also upregulates insulin</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity and the activity of these</v>

2022
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:16.180
<v Speaker 1>glute four transporters that can shove</v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose in the muscle tissue for</v>

2023
01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:18.880
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can have your cake and</v>

2024
01:24:18.881 --> 01:24:19.590
<v Speaker 1>eat it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2025
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:22.090
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you create your own insulin sensitive</v>

2026
01:24:22.091 --> 01:24:25.500
<v Speaker 1>state and then you go off and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and typically I'll finish that workout</v>

2027
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:27.190
<v Speaker 1>around like six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six 30 right?</v>

2028
01:24:27.191 --> 01:24:29.710
<v Speaker 1>And like I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat dinner for a couple hours</v>

2029
01:24:29.711 --> 01:24:34.060
<v Speaker 1>after the workout is like a eight 30 we</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down to a family dinner and I'll</v>

2030
01:24:34.061 --> 01:24:37.120
<v Speaker 1>just use as many carbohydrates as I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm in an insulin sensitive</v>

2031
01:24:37.121 --> 01:24:40.060
<v Speaker 1>state by the next morning and I tested</v>
<v Speaker 1>this for a while.</v>

2032
01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I did like the blood ketone and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>breath ketone testing.</v>

2033
01:24:42.341 --> 01:24:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm back in a fat burning state by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next morning,</v>

2034
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:49.720
<v Speaker 1>but also with the bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also replenish my glycogen stores</v>

2035
01:24:49.721 --> 01:24:53.650
<v Speaker 1>and my liver and my muscle to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the next days.</v>

2036
01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Hard workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2037
01:24:54.911 --> 01:24:58.240
<v Speaker 1>So I like this strategy for athletes</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can get all the benefits of</v>

2038
01:24:58.241 --> 01:25:00.850
<v Speaker 1>a fat burning state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reduced free radical production from</v>

2039
01:25:00.851 --> 01:25:04.530
<v Speaker 1>excess glucose intake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reduced young glycaemic variability,</v>

2040
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.360
<v Speaker 1>which is honestly a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2041
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:09.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty big marker for in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>

2042
01:25:09.011 --> 01:25:12.940
<v Speaker 1>like like your risk factor for a host of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic diseases like spiking your blood</v>

2043
01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:16.060
<v Speaker 1>glucose multiple times during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead you just don't eat</v>

2044
01:25:16.061 --> 01:25:18.700
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a hard workout at the end of the day</v>

2045
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:21.790
<v Speaker 1>and then have your carbohydrates to</v>
<v Speaker 1>replenish all your energy levels.</v>

2046
01:25:21.791 --> 01:25:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Then you go into the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what's your primary food source</v>

2047
01:25:24.701 --> 01:25:25.120
<v Speaker 1>during the day?</v>

2048
01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have like standards so you,</v>

2049
01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:30.880
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of like really good wild</v>

2050
01:25:30.881 --> 01:25:32.470
<v Speaker 1>plants that grow up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our land.</v>

2051
01:25:32.471 --> 01:25:34.870
<v Speaker 1>So I have 10 acres up there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington state and we've got like</v>

2052
01:25:34.871 --> 01:25:38.020
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all and meant and plantation and</v>

2053
01:25:38.021 --> 01:25:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Oregon grape root and comfrey and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these amazing plants.</v>

2054
01:25:41.231 --> 01:25:46.020
<v Speaker 1>So we also have eight raised garden beds</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we grow Kale and Bok Choy,</v>

2055
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Swiss chard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so raise them so that they don't</v>

2056
01:25:48.621 --> 01:25:50.620
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not as obsessed stubble to</v>

2057
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:53.680
<v Speaker 1>ground frost or like when you raise a</v>
<v Speaker 1>garden bed,</v>

2058
01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:57.330
<v Speaker 1>you can just add whatever type of soil</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want versus digging down,</v>

2059
01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:00.220
<v Speaker 1>cause my wife does a lot of composting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we have chickens and goats.</v>

2060
01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:02.980
<v Speaker 1>So she used a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the dung from the chickens and</v>

2061
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:04.790
<v Speaker 1>the goats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the leftover food from inside and</v>

2062
01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:05.780
<v Speaker 1>does composting.</v>

2063
01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:08.450
<v Speaker 1>And so we use a lot of this and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised garden beds.</v>

2064
01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started gardening this year.</v>

2065
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Indoors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm growing something called spilanthes,</v>

2066
01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:14.210
<v Speaker 1>which I can tell you about later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2067
01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:17.000
<v Speaker 1>I found an inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the um,</v>

2068
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.970
<v Speaker 1>the what I do during the day and eat a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of wild plants,</v>

2069
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.481
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2070
01:26:20.481 --> 01:26:23.360
<v Speaker 1>so I'll come in when I'm coming in from</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that cold pool in the morning.</v>

2071
01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:27.050
<v Speaker 1>I like gathering some plants and I throw</v>
<v Speaker 1>those in a blender with like some,</v>

2072
01:26:27.051 --> 01:26:29.750
<v Speaker 1>some fats like coconut milk or coconut</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>

2073
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:30.831
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

2074
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:35.450
<v Speaker 1>like some bone broth and some lemon</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you mix the vitamin C with</v>

2075
01:26:35.451 --> 01:26:38.030
<v Speaker 1>college and you make the college and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot more absorbable.</v>

2076
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:40.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'll mix the vitamin C with bone</v>
<v Speaker 1>broth.</v>

2077
01:26:40.251 --> 01:26:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll put that into the blender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A whole bunch of superfoods.</v>

2078
01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Don't blend it for like two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you blend it for a long time,</v>

2079
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:47.960
<v Speaker 1>it gets like a texture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Wendy's frosty.</v>

2080
01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can like eat it with,</v>

2081
01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:50.541
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2082
01:26:50.541 --> 01:26:52.720
<v Speaker 1>one of those long you've had a wendy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>frosty for,</v>

2083
01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:53.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2084
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:55.340
<v Speaker 1>You look confused when I said Wendy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fries.</v>

2085
01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of horrible life you led.</v>

2086
01:26:58.481 --> 01:27:01.490
<v Speaker 1>What did your parents do to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never had a wendy's frosty,</v>

2087
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:03.530
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it gets like this Wendy's frosty like</v>

2088
01:27:03.531 --> 01:27:05.810
<v Speaker 1>consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bunch of wild plants and</v>

2089
01:27:05.811 --> 01:27:08.210
<v Speaker 1>fats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I put like that Stevia in there.</v>

2090
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I put a little bit of mccowen there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2091
01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.380
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we'll do like a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>whey protein,</v>

2092
01:27:12.381 --> 01:27:15.290
<v Speaker 1>like a good like grass fed whey or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of protein source.</v>

2093
01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:20.800
<v Speaker 1>And then I put like a crunchy things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I put it all in a bowl with a spatula</v>

2094
01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.090
<v Speaker 1>crunchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2095
01:27:23.091 --> 01:27:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Like coconut flakes and could count</v>
<v Speaker 1>hibbs and uh,</v>

2096
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:29.660
<v Speaker 1>like I use like these little spiralina</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chlorella tablets.</v>

2097
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:34.280
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like eating a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you go to a yogurt store</v>

2098
01:27:34.281 --> 01:27:36.440
<v Speaker 1>and you get the yogurt and you get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>toppings on top of it,</v>

2099
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's like this amazing Kenogenic</v>
<v Speaker 1>superfood rich meal.</v>

2100
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:43.790
<v Speaker 1>And by blending it all together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>blending the fats with all the,</v>

2101
01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:45.830
<v Speaker 1>all the ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually enhancing the</v>

2102
01:27:45.831 --> 01:27:47.540
<v Speaker 1>absorption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2103
01:27:47.541 --> 01:27:50.060
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I have for breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should open a cafe.</v>

2104
01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:53.270
<v Speaker 1>So that sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm trying to like,</v>

2105
01:27:53.271 --> 01:27:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make it into like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2106
01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.460
<v Speaker 1>like a drinkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drinkable form.</v>

2107
01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Something that is the same thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2108
01:28:00.450 --> 01:28:02.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going over to see,</v>

2109
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:02.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2110
01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Rick Ruben after this over in Malibu and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does the same thing for breakfast.</v>

2111
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:09.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about how we can make this</v>

2112
01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:10.910
<v Speaker 1>no so random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>

2113
01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:14.120
<v Speaker 1>we go sauna together over there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malibu and we were,</v>

2114
01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:17.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we both do the same thing.</v>

2115
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:18.051
<v Speaker 1>Like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

2116
01:28:18.051 --> 01:28:19.740
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his is a little bit different.</v>

2117
01:28:19.741 --> 01:28:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Like he put some different things in it</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same thing and it's an amazing</v>

2118
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:25.910
<v Speaker 1>breakfast cause you can sit there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I do a lot of dictation on my</v>

2119
01:28:25.911 --> 01:28:27.770
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll sit there and I'll dictate</v>

2120
01:28:27.771 --> 01:28:29.260
<v Speaker 1>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But while I'm eating my,</v>

2121
01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.460
<v Speaker 1>my smoothie with a spoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

2122
01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:34.700
<v Speaker 1>And then I do a salad for breakfast or</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lunch,</v>

2123
01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:35.990
<v Speaker 1>a big ass salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2124
01:28:35.991 --> 01:28:39.170
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of wild plants and I'll put</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sardines,</v>

2125
01:28:39.171 --> 01:28:40.280
<v Speaker 1>seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts,</v>

2126
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2127
01:28:40.611 --> 01:28:42.380
<v Speaker 1>just good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good fats on them.</v>

2128
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2129
01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:46.550
<v Speaker 1>then I have like these Nori wraps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2130
01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:48.740
<v Speaker 1>which is like a seaweed wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really good in iodine.</v>

2131
01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Really nutrient dense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm gonna use miracle noodles.</v>

2132
01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Have you had miracle noodles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2133
01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.580
<v Speaker 1>So they're made out of Japanese Yam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they called them.</v>

2134
01:28:55.581 --> 01:28:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talky noodles.</v>

2135
01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:59.870
<v Speaker 1>It's in my kids make pad Thai out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and they have like a cooking</v>

2136
01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 1>podcast where they do all these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy meals.</v>

2137
01:29:02.730 --> 01:29:04.950
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things they use a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>are these shirataki noodles.</v>

2138
01:29:04.951 --> 01:29:09.510
<v Speaker 1>So I make these Japanese Yam and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put him on top of the salad and then I</v>

2139
01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:11.490
<v Speaker 1>roll that up and like a noi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burrito wrap.</v>

2140
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And I eat that like a Burrito for lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then dinner,</v>

2141
01:29:14.881 --> 01:29:15.810
<v Speaker 1>like I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2142
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:17.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever my wife happens because dinner</v>

2143
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:19.080
<v Speaker 1>is Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my free mail.</v>

2144
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just whatever I want to have.</v>

2145
01:29:20.611 --> 01:29:24.330
<v Speaker 1>But for this study for Jeff Volek Slab</v>
<v Speaker 1>is 12 months strict ketosis and they</v>

2146
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:26.190
<v Speaker 1>brought us into the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2147
01:29:26.191 --> 01:29:28.770
<v Speaker 1>they had me in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the group of Kenogenic athletes and</v>

2148
01:29:28.771 --> 01:29:31.230
<v Speaker 1>also the whole group of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of endurance athletes following a</v>

2149
01:29:31.231 --> 01:29:34.080
<v Speaker 1>traditional carbohydrate rich diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2150
01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:36.780
<v Speaker 1>do a vo two Max test the night that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>got there.</v>

2151
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.900
<v Speaker 1>And then the next morning they punched a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of holes and our thighs with</v>

2152
01:29:39.901 --> 01:29:43.500
<v Speaker 1>needles and did a biopsy of the muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see how much glycogen was in the</v>

2153
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:44.334
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>

2154
01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:47.040
<v Speaker 1>And then with these big holes in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our muscles,</v>

2155
01:29:47.041 --> 01:29:48.960
<v Speaker 1>we had to go run on a treadmill for</v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours.</v>

2156
01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:53.240
<v Speaker 1>So I ran 22 miles on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the whole like look up,</v>

2157
01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:54.720
<v Speaker 1>like wanting to see how much do they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see,</v>

2158
01:29:54.721 --> 01:29:56.910
<v Speaker 1>how much glycogen they pull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a muscle biopsy.</v>

2159
01:29:56.911 --> 01:29:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little bleak Ghia team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal,</v>

2160
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:02.790
<v Speaker 1>especially when you go pound on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>treadmill after you've had these,</v>

2161
01:30:02.791 --> 01:30:06.570
<v Speaker 1>these needle biopsies and your thighs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they did fat biopsy because</v>

2162
01:30:06.571 --> 01:30:09.300
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to look at fat content up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>either side of the hips.</v>

2163
01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:13.290
<v Speaker 1>And then I ran for three hours on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>treadmill and it was horrible.</v>

2164
01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:15.020
<v Speaker 1>There was like no TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

2165
01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:17.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a white wall on the treadmill.</v>

2166
01:30:17.851 --> 01:30:18.610
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2167
01:30:18.610 --> 01:30:21.050
<v Speaker 1>and I was hooked up to like a a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2168
01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:21.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2169
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:25.050
<v Speaker 1>a blood collection device because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2170
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.270
<v Speaker 1>what am I in the night I had a Walkman</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>

2171
01:30:28.330 --> 01:30:30.030
<v Speaker 1>I had my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my mouth,</v>

2172
01:30:30.031 --> 01:30:34.770
<v Speaker 1>my aerobics socks on like Jane Fonda</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day.</v>

2173
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2174
01:30:35.731 --> 01:30:37.950
<v Speaker 1>And my running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just running single hour staring</v>

2175
01:30:37.951 --> 01:30:40.550
<v Speaker 1>at the walls around for three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stats gotta be the worst part of it is</v>

2176
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.393
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2177
01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know going in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked in the room and I'm like,</v>

2178
01:30:43.321 --> 01:30:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I would have brought,</v>

2179
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:47.460
<v Speaker 1>you know like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just something to watch.</v>

2180
01:30:47.461 --> 01:30:52.461
<v Speaker 1>But I ran and they were testing fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>oxidation rates at rest and an exercise.</v>

2181
01:30:52.801 --> 01:30:54.360
<v Speaker 1>So I'm wearing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mask,</v>

2182
01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:56.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does what's called indirect</v>

2183
01:30:56.011 --> 01:30:59.070
<v Speaker 1>calorimetry where based on the carbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>dioxide that you breathe out,</v>

2184
01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:02.130
<v Speaker 1>the oxygen that you consume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it approximates your carbohydrate and</v>

2185
01:31:02.131 --> 01:31:02.990
<v Speaker 1>your fat burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2186
01:31:02.991 --> 01:31:05.830
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda like the gold standard of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of metabolic testing in laboratory</v>

2187
01:31:05.831 --> 01:31:08.760
<v Speaker 1>testing situations like in an exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiology lab.</v>

2188
01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.880
<v Speaker 1>And so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're testing how much fat you're</v>

2189
01:31:11.881 --> 01:31:14.130
<v Speaker 1>burning during exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much carbohydrate you're burning</v>

2190
01:31:14.131 --> 01:31:15.680
<v Speaker 1>during exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called your,</v>

2191
01:31:15.681 --> 01:31:17.520
<v Speaker 1>your respiratory exchange ratio.</v>

2192
01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the prevailing uh,</v>

2193
01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:27.510
<v Speaker 1>research and the literature suggests</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can burn about 1.0 grams of fat</v>

2194
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:30.660
<v Speaker 1>per minute during exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that would be about how much fat</v>

2195
01:31:30.661 --> 01:31:32.550
<v Speaker 1>you would burn 1.0 grams of fat per</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

2196
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:35.280
<v Speaker 1>When they tested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was called the faster study f.</v>

2197
01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:36.450
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S.</v>

2198
01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:36.450
<v Speaker 1>T.</v>
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>

2199
01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:38.190
<v Speaker 1>R.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found that the folks who fall at a</v>

2200
01:31:38.191 --> 01:31:41.400
<v Speaker 1>high fat diet like me and these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were eating high fat diet,</v>

2201
01:31:41.401 --> 01:31:46.080
<v Speaker 1>we were burning 1.5 to 1.7 grams of fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>per minute during exercise.</v>

2202
01:31:46.081 --> 01:31:49.140
<v Speaker 1>During this three hour treadmill run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had no deficit in performance.</v>

2203
01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Our Vo Two max is we're just as high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we maintained our levels of muscle</v>

2204
01:31:53.761 --> 01:31:56.730
<v Speaker 1>glycogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so basically there was no,</v>

2205
01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.770
<v Speaker 1>we didn't go any faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not saying like,</v>

2206
01:31:58.810 --> 01:32:01.630
<v Speaker 1>like a Kenogenic diet is going to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>better at endurance sports cause I've</v>

2207
01:32:01.631 --> 01:32:03.220
<v Speaker 1>never seen any evidence that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>

2208
01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:07.900
<v Speaker 1>But we did go just as fast and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually burnt,</v>

2209
01:32:07.901 --> 01:32:11.140
<v Speaker 1>we turned our bodies into fat burning</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines over the course of 12 months.</v>

2210
01:32:11.141 --> 01:32:14.050
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a really cool study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the benefits would not be necessarily</v>

2211
01:32:14.051 --> 01:32:17.180
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the benefits are more health tips.</v>

2212
01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:18.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2213
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:22.630
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people like they get gut rot</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fermentation from eating a lot of</v>

2214
01:32:22.631 --> 01:32:25.180
<v Speaker 1>fermentable carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people get small intestinal</v>

2215
01:32:25.181 --> 01:32:26.920
<v Speaker 1>bacterial overgrowth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2216
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:29.650
<v Speaker 1>some people get blood glucose</v>
<v Speaker 1>fluctuations.</v>

2217
01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

2218
01:32:30.641 --> 01:32:32.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a drop in what's called the</v>

2219
01:32:32.561 --> 01:32:35.170
<v Speaker 1>first phase insulin response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like normally you're supposed to produce</v>

2220
01:32:35.171 --> 01:32:38.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot of insulin when you eat a meal or</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least enough to be able to shove that</v>

2221
01:32:38.651 --> 01:32:42.280
<v Speaker 1>sub straight into storage tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And normally you'd be able to produce</v>

2222
01:32:42.281 --> 01:32:44.260
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by getting a lot of glycaemic</v>

2223
01:32:44.261 --> 01:32:47.230
<v Speaker 1>variability during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eventually produce insulin</v>

2224
01:32:47.231 --> 01:32:48.130
<v Speaker 1>insensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2225
01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have that normal first</v>
<v Speaker 1>phase insulin response and you can,</v>

2226
01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:52.653
<v Speaker 1>you can restore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2227
01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:55.860
<v Speaker 1>you can use things like bitters and chew</v>
<v Speaker 1>your food a lot and you know,</v>

2228
01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:58.270
<v Speaker 1>strength trained before you eat a</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate rich meal and you know,</v>

2229
01:32:58.271 --> 01:33:00.850
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately,</v>

2230
01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:02.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2231
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.030
<v Speaker 1>it's more of like a health and longevity</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2232
01:33:04.031 --> 01:33:07.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a like eating low</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate makes you faster.</v>

2233
01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:10.360
<v Speaker 1>It's just that you avoid a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential issues,</v>

2234
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:13.810
<v Speaker 1>the potential health issues that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>come with a large amount of glucose</v>

2235
01:33:13.811 --> 01:33:17.620
<v Speaker 1>fluctuations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's exceptions to that rule.</v>

2236
01:33:17.650 --> 01:33:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Or like you could go get your genetics</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested and you might find out,</v>

2237
01:33:20.471 --> 01:33:22.870
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say familial hypercholesterolemia,</v>

2238
01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In which case if you eat like a key</v>

2239
01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:28.330
<v Speaker 1>topic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll produce a lot of like oxidized</v>

2240
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:30.190
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see people with cholesterol</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 400,</v>

2241
01:33:30.191 --> 01:33:34.570
<v Speaker 1>500 and really high lp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little a and all these issues with a</v>

2242
01:33:34.571 --> 01:33:39.220
<v Speaker 1>high amount of fat consumption because</v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies are unable to deal with</v>

2243
01:33:39.221 --> 01:33:40.810
<v Speaker 1>that amount of cholesterol.</v>

2244
01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big point.</v>

2245
01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a big point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The customers can't stress that enough.</v>

2246
01:33:44.981 --> 01:33:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Is it human beings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very so.</v>

2247
01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And the huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2248
01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:49.000
<v Speaker 1>huge amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a,</v>

2249
01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:51.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a great book that Brian Count</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned me onto that I'm reading right</v>

2250
01:33:51.791 --> 01:33:56.560
<v Speaker 1>now called Sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the origins of human beings.</v>

2251
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:58.870
<v Speaker 1>It's completely fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2252
01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:00.880
<v Speaker 1>There's another book called biochemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuality.</v>

2253
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:02.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like an old book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking through,</v>

2254
01:34:02.711 --> 01:34:05.230
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's like 12 different shapes of</v>

2255
01:34:05.231 --> 01:34:08.590
<v Speaker 1>the stomach and like seven different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that the hardest shaped and certain</v>

2256
01:34:08.591 --> 01:34:13.300
<v Speaker 1>people will excrete copious amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D and need a lot more vitamin D</v>

2257
01:34:13.301 --> 01:34:17.590
<v Speaker 1>intake and other people develop vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 1>D toxicity in response like the 2000 and</v>

2258
01:34:17.591 --> 01:34:20.230
<v Speaker 1>4,000 international units that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are popping in these days.</v>

2259
01:34:20.231 --> 01:34:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Certain people develop high cholesterol</v>
<v Speaker 1>and high triglycerides and high</v>

2260
01:34:23.921 --> 01:34:28.540
<v Speaker 1>inflammation in response to to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic diet and some people don't.</v>

2261
01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And so like we live in an era where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's cheap to get your genes tested</v>

2262
01:34:34.150 --> 01:34:35.800
<v Speaker 1>and it's only going to get cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2263
01:34:35.801 --> 01:34:39.190
<v Speaker 1>it's also theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to really find a good expert</v>

2264
01:34:39.191 --> 01:34:42.030
<v Speaker 1>that really understands what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in the genetic variability</v>

2265
01:34:42.031 --> 01:34:42.570
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

2266
01:34:42.570 --> 01:34:44.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like otherwise you're just</v>

2267
01:34:44.741 --> 01:34:46.870
<v Speaker 1>testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're trying to ketogenetic diet,</v>

2268
01:34:46.930 --> 01:34:49.300
<v Speaker 1>testing out your blood work and trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure it out.</v>

2269
01:34:49.301 --> 01:34:52.450
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the lay person it is.</v>

2270
01:34:52.451 --> 01:34:54.850
<v Speaker 1>But I mean like in very simplistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>

2271
01:34:54.851 --> 01:34:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I've told some people that that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could at least test your genetics</v>

2272
01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:00.150
<v Speaker 1>and there's actually a really good book</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this called uh,</v>

2273
01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:03.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jungle effect by Doctor Daphne</v>

2274
01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes into how like she'll put</v>

2275
01:35:05.001 --> 01:35:07.730
<v Speaker 1>like her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her Hispanic clients on like a</v>

2276
01:35:07.731 --> 01:35:11.090
<v Speaker 1>traditional Mexican diet comprised of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2277
01:35:11.091 --> 01:35:12.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2278
01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:15.380
<v Speaker 1>soaked and sprouted legumes and low</v>
<v Speaker 1>glycemic index,</v>

2279
01:35:15.381 --> 01:35:18.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tortillas and non gmo corn and take them</v>

2280
01:35:18.771 --> 01:35:21.020
<v Speaker 1>back to what their ancestors would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten.</v>

2281
01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Like she'll literally take like what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tar Mahara Indian drive is eating and</v>

2282
01:35:24.411 --> 01:35:26.870
<v Speaker 1>South America and put her Hispanic</v>
<v Speaker 1>clients on that.</v>

2283
01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Or she'll put like her African American</v>
<v Speaker 1>clients on a fiber rich fermented like</v>

2284
01:35:31.941 --> 01:35:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Cambodian diet and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could easily do it like it's not</v>

2285
01:35:35.601 --> 01:35:36.351
<v Speaker 1>rocket science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2286
01:35:36.351 --> 01:35:37.580
<v Speaker 1>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your genetics tested,</v>

2287
01:35:37.581 --> 01:35:41.330
<v Speaker 1>you see where your ancestors came from</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you try to approximate,</v>

2288
01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:45.830
<v Speaker 1>and obviously we're a genetic melting</v>
<v Speaker 1>pot in America and there's gonna be some</v>

2289
01:35:45.831 --> 01:35:47.750
<v Speaker 1>people who are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh crap I came from,</v>

2290
01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I come from Japan and Europe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia.</v>

2291
01:35:51.711 --> 01:35:53.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's some people who come from</v>

2292
01:35:53.421 --> 01:35:55.100
<v Speaker 1>all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case you would have to take a</v>

2293
01:35:55.101 --> 01:35:55.970
<v Speaker 1>deeper dive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2294
01:35:55.971 --> 01:35:58.130
<v Speaker 1>You can get blood work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get,</v>

2295
01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.910
<v Speaker 1>what I tell people is get your genes</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested like a comprehensive blood</v>

2296
01:36:01.911 --> 01:36:04.490
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get your gut tested,</v>

2297
01:36:04.491 --> 01:36:04.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2298
01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:06.770
<v Speaker 1>So you could look at your bacterial</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>

2299
01:36:06.771 --> 01:36:08.420
<v Speaker 1>presence of parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeast,</v>

2300
01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:10.410
<v Speaker 1>fungus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those kinds of little things that</v>

2301
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:14.810
<v Speaker 1>that affect gut health and personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything else at the microbiome</v>

2302
01:36:14.811 --> 01:36:16.160
<v Speaker 1>affects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2303
01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:18.260
<v Speaker 1>and then like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a urine test for hormones,</v>

2304
01:36:18.261 --> 01:36:19.970
<v Speaker 1>which is more accurate than a blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

2305
01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:22.460
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you really,</v>

2306
01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:26.060
<v Speaker 1>really truly want to dial things in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic testing,</v>

2307
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:28.700
<v Speaker 1>it's blood testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>urinary testing for hormones.</v>

2308
01:36:28.730 --> 01:36:29.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a test called a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2309
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:32.540
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tests like your testosterone all</v>

2310
01:36:32.541 --> 01:36:35.330
<v Speaker 1>throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The metabolites of testosterone and your</v>

2311
01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:38.060
<v Speaker 1>cortisol all throughout the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the metabolites of Cortisol.</v>

2312
01:36:38.061 --> 01:36:40.030
<v Speaker 1>So you could actually see like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2313
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:43.550
<v Speaker 1>do I really have high cortisol or am I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not breaking it down quickly</v>

2314
01:36:43.551 --> 01:36:44.600
<v Speaker 1>enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

2315
01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I just wish there was a place that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could go that was very comprehensive</v>

2316
01:36:48.051 --> 01:36:51.200
<v Speaker 1>that the average person go to where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do all this stuff for you and</v>

2317
01:36:51.201 --> 01:36:52.190
<v Speaker 1>break it down for you.</v>

2318
01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:54.630
<v Speaker 1>That seems like there's more and more of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a market of that test.</v>

2319
01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Every thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the Hue.</v>

2320
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a place like it's like the</v>

2321
01:36:57.861 --> 01:36:59.260
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2322
01:36:59.290 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these guys who were like trying</v>

2323
01:37:00.561 --> 01:37:01.420
<v Speaker 1>to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2324
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:03.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of them is,</v>

2325
01:37:03.111 --> 01:37:05.120
<v Speaker 1>is Peter Diamandis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2326
01:37:05.121 --> 01:37:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Craig venter I think is another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like the human human longevity</v>

2327
01:37:09.321 --> 01:37:10.850
<v Speaker 1>institute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called.</v>

2328
01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:11.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of these,</v>

2329
01:37:11.961 --> 01:37:13.100
<v Speaker 1>some of these rich dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2330
01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of these billionaires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to this place as and in</v>

2331
01:37:15.861 --> 01:37:17.910
<v Speaker 1>getting like the comprehensive blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing done.</v>

2332
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of that myself just by</v>

2333
01:37:20.271 --> 01:37:21.320
<v Speaker 1>ordering it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2334
01:37:21.321 --> 01:37:24.650
<v Speaker 1>from like direct labs are these little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a deep understanding and</v>

2335
01:37:24.651 --> 01:37:27.260
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different than the average price on</v>

2336
01:37:27.261 --> 01:37:31.070
<v Speaker 1>injecting stem cells into the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think for the average person</v>

2337
01:37:31.071 --> 01:37:32.390
<v Speaker 1>that's listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

2338
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:36.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a little confusing and maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little frustrating because it would be</v>

2339
01:37:36.621 --> 01:37:38.000
<v Speaker 1>nice if there was a place that you'd go</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

2340
01:37:38.001 --> 01:37:40.220
<v Speaker 1>like the dentist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to the dentist,</v>

2341
01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Hey bob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a cavity.</v>

2342
01:37:42.090 --> 01:37:45.150
<v Speaker 1>It's all pretty straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly that will,</v>

2343
01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:47.020
<v Speaker 1>there's companies working on that right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2344
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an actual dashboard where you get a</v>

2345
01:37:49.221 --> 01:37:53.210
<v Speaker 1>home test kit done and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually like microneedles now</v>

2346
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:56.610
<v Speaker 1>that you can attach to the scan that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>patch it on yourself,</v>

2347
01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.890
<v Speaker 1>you send off a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny amount of blood and you'd get a</v>

2348
01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:03.300
<v Speaker 1>host of blood values back and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be able to see like what you have</v>

2349
01:38:03.301 --> 01:38:05.940
<v Speaker 1>deficits in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could totally see them pairing</v>

2350
01:38:05.941 --> 01:38:08.760
<v Speaker 1>that with like food delivery companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>

2351
01:38:08.761 --> 01:38:09.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just like printouts.</v>

2352
01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:10.800
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your protein,</v>

2353
01:38:10.801 --> 01:38:12.130
<v Speaker 1>carb fat ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2354
01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It'll happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2355
01:38:13.891 --> 01:38:16.500
<v Speaker 1>when you were on the strict Ketogenic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet for 12 months,</v>

2356
01:38:16.501 --> 01:38:19.190
<v Speaker 1>what was your diet like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you basically eat?</v>

2357
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:20.513
<v Speaker 1>No Italian.</v>

2358
01:38:22.690 --> 01:38:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you got off,</v>

2359
01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I remember what I was like my</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding days where like you go way</v>

2360
01:38:30.391 --> 01:38:34.440
<v Speaker 1>in like in the morning before the show</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the rest of the day you eat</v>

2361
01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:39.441
<v Speaker 1>like freaking ice cream and bread and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look like just like an Olympic God</v>

2362
01:38:39.751 --> 01:38:41.790
<v Speaker 1>when you get up on stage cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's popping right.</v>

2363
01:38:41.791 --> 01:38:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Like all that glycogen gets restored</v>
<v Speaker 1>after about eight hours.</v>

2364
01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2365
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:47.620
<v Speaker 1>how does that work on my first meal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2366
01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:51.510
<v Speaker 1>when you don't eat many carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you upregulate levels was something</v>

2367
01:38:51.511 --> 01:38:54.660
<v Speaker 1>called glycogen synthase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an enzyme responsible for</v>

2368
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:56.640
<v Speaker 1>helping to get glycogen in the muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue.</v>

2369
01:38:56.641 --> 01:38:58.320
<v Speaker 1>This would be a process that you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>do before,</v>

2370
01:38:58.530 --> 01:39:02.430
<v Speaker 1>like Aj and depletion followed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>glycogen restoration causes this big</v>

2371
01:39:02.431 --> 01:39:05.610
<v Speaker 1>surge in glycogen plus going into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

2372
01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:10.530
<v Speaker 1>you're restricting carbohydrates anyways</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's hard to get very,</v>

2373
01:39:10.531 --> 01:39:13.560
<v Speaker 1>very low body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you see bodybuilders eating</v>

2374
01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:15.590
<v Speaker 1>fricking like chicken and Broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2375
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:16.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2376
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:18.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

2377
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:20.520
<v Speaker 1>It's something I did when I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>triathlon.</v>

2378
01:39:20.521 --> 01:39:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll like carbohydrate deplete the</v>

2379
01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:24.480
<v Speaker 1>weekend before a race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I used to do this.</v>

2380
01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:29.481
<v Speaker 1>You'd eat no carbohydrates on Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Sunday for a race that follows the</v>

2381
01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:32.220
<v Speaker 1>next Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Monday you'd start to eat more</v>

2382
01:39:32.221 --> 01:39:35.910
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates Tuesday even more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by like Saturday before the Ray</v>

2383
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Street and like 90% carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I did before I kind of</v>

2384
01:39:38.690 --> 01:39:40.040
<v Speaker 1>trained my body to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2385
01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.780
<v Speaker 1>ketosis and function while on a low carb</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

2386
01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:44.130
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

2387
01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're jacked up chock full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>glycogen cause you upregulate that</v>

2388
01:39:47.881 --> 01:39:49.710
<v Speaker 1>enzyme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a,</v>

2389
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:51.030
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carbohydrate.</v>

2390
01:39:51.031 --> 01:39:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Let's just basically carbohydrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>depletion,</v>

2391
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:55.620
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate loading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was there any benefit of that</v>

2392
01:39:55.621 --> 01:39:57.840
<v Speaker 1>performance wise versus what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing now?</v>

2393
01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2394
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:07.790
<v Speaker 1>there's not necessarily a benefit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

2395
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:12.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go faster if you've trained your</v>

2396
01:40:12.481 --> 01:40:15.570
<v Speaker 1>body how to operate well on a low</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate diet.</v>

2397
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2398
01:40:17.221 --> 01:40:21.300
<v Speaker 1>seen any evidence that like a low</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate ketogenetic diet makes you</v>

2399
01:40:21.301 --> 01:40:26.250
<v Speaker 1>go faster than if you were eating like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular like carbohydrate rich diet.</v>

2400
01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:30.360
<v Speaker 1>But I also haven't seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do like I did and follow it</v>

2401
01:40:30.361 --> 01:40:33.720
<v Speaker 1>strict for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of evidence that makes</v>

2402
01:40:33.721 --> 01:40:36.090
<v Speaker 1>you go slower either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of like,</v>

2403
01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:37.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like even as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2404
01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:40.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a health longevity Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more of like,</v>

2405
01:40:40.951 --> 01:40:42.990
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can live a longer time and feel</v>

2406
01:40:42.991 --> 01:40:47.310
<v Speaker 1>better and produce less reactive oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 1>species by doing this versus the high</v>

2407
01:40:47.311 --> 01:40:50.460
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate intake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then why not do it?</v>

2408
01:40:50.461 --> 01:40:53.800
<v Speaker 1>And I mean when you look at like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nike project and how they were to break</v>

2409
01:40:53.801 --> 01:40:57.880
<v Speaker 1>the marathon record in Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were using like these crazy</v>

2410
01:40:57.881 --> 01:41:00.970
<v Speaker 1>engineered forms of carbohydrate where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went way above like these</v>

2411
01:41:00.971 --> 01:41:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Maltodextrin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fructose blends that a lot of companies</v>

2412
01:41:03.941 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2413
01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:07.420
<v Speaker 1>like gatorade use and they were using</v>
<v Speaker 1>these super engineered carbs.</v>

2414
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:10.990
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that some of these newer</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates that are engineered for</v>

2415
01:41:10.991 --> 01:41:14.200
<v Speaker 1>extremely high absorption could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could beat out.</v>

2416
01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Like if we were to study those in like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2417
01:41:16.031 --> 01:41:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high fat,</v>

2418
01:41:17.051 --> 01:41:19.990
<v Speaker 1>low carb athlete who had followed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet for a long period of time versus</v>

2419
01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:23.020
<v Speaker 1>like a traditionally fueled athlete who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was eating these new fangled engineered</v>

2420
01:41:23.021 --> 01:41:25.450
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible the new fangled engineered</v>

2421
01:41:25.451 --> 01:41:28.630
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates could make you go faster</v>
<v Speaker 1>button unless your paycheck is on the</v>

2422
01:41:28.631 --> 01:41:31.120
<v Speaker 1>line and you're a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still say,</v>

2423
01:41:31.610 --> 01:41:34.660
<v Speaker 1>why not get that balance between health</v>
<v Speaker 1>and longevity and speed.</v>

2424
01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.960
<v Speaker 1>My thyroid though did not like that high</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat ketogenic diet director paired with</v>

2425
01:41:41.170 --> 01:41:43.990
<v Speaker 1>high levels of physical activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My testosterone went down were like</v>

2426
01:41:43.991 --> 01:41:46.540
<v Speaker 1>there were some issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating because usually you</v>

2427
01:41:46.541 --> 01:41:49.060
<v Speaker 1>hear the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People with thyroid disease,</v>

2428
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:51.700
<v Speaker 1>they recommend a ketogenic diet to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2429
01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2430
01:41:52.570 --> 01:41:56.860
<v Speaker 1>But look at it this way and I explained</v>
<v Speaker 1>this to to a lot of athletes who I work</v>

2431
01:41:56.861 --> 01:41:58.630
<v Speaker 1>with who wanted to do the ketogenic diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2432
01:41:58.631 --> 01:41:59.320
<v Speaker 1>You read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2433
01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read a book like a,</v>

2434
01:42:01.031 --> 01:42:02.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some fantastic ketogenic diets</v>

2435
01:42:02.831 --> 01:42:05.710
<v Speaker 1>out there that are plant rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of ketogenetic diets aren't</v>

2436
01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there'll be like coconut oil and</v>

2437
01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:11.470
<v Speaker 1>butter and that actually creates a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of gastric inflammation.</v>

2438
01:42:11.471 --> 01:42:12.850
<v Speaker 1>In the absence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>

2439
01:42:12.851 --> 01:42:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high amount of polyphenols and</v>

2440
01:42:14.321 --> 01:42:17.410
<v Speaker 1>flavonoids and high fiber and planning</v>
<v Speaker 1>type like you want both.</v>

2441
01:42:17.411 --> 01:42:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an article about this called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark side of coconut oil that gets into</v>

2442
01:42:20.771 --> 01:42:22.720
<v Speaker 1>the fact that if you're going to do like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high fat,</v>

2443
01:42:22.721 --> 01:42:26.380
<v Speaker 1>low carb Ketogenic type of diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would want to include a lot of</v>

2444
01:42:26.381 --> 01:42:29.950
<v Speaker 1>plants and like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Dr. Terry Walls is a book called the</v>

2445
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:32.620
<v Speaker 1>walls protocol that's got a plant rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>kenogenic version it.</v>

2446
01:42:32.650 --> 01:42:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven gundry has his book,</v>

2447
01:42:34.301 --> 01:42:37.930
<v Speaker 1>the plant paradox and he has like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has like a ketogenic version in that</v>

2448
01:42:37.931 --> 01:42:40.930
<v Speaker 1>book that's like very plant rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

2449
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:44.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're eating like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a plant rich keto genic diet and</v>

2450
01:42:44.861 --> 01:42:46.780
<v Speaker 1>you're following what a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people I've written,</v>

2451
01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:50.620
<v Speaker 1>you generally be advised he like 30 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 grams of carbohydrates per day,</v>

2452
01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:54.130
<v Speaker 1>which is fine if you have thyroid</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease or you have some other issue,</v>

2453
01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:55.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pre diabetes,</v>

2454
01:42:55.151 --> 01:42:56.470
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to control it with a</v>

2455
01:42:56.471 --> 01:43:00.010
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then once you throw copious amounts</v>

2456
01:43:00.011 --> 01:43:01.540
<v Speaker 1>of physical activity into the mix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2457
01:43:01.541 --> 01:43:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Your crossfit or you're an Ironman</v>
<v Speaker 1>triathlete and you go read the one of</v>

2458
01:43:03.971 --> 01:43:06.220
<v Speaker 1>these books and you read the supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be 50 grams of carbohydrates,</v>

2459
01:43:06.221 --> 01:43:08.470
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the authors of those books,</v>

2460
01:43:08.471 --> 01:43:13.230
<v Speaker 1>to my knowledge are not out racing</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironman triathlons and doing marathons</v>

2461
01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:15.460
<v Speaker 1>and copious amounts of physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

2462
01:43:15.670 --> 01:43:18.250
<v Speaker 1>So you have to up the carbohydrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>intake.</v>

2463
01:43:18.251 --> 01:43:19.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2464
01:43:19.691 --> 01:43:22.840
<v Speaker 1>so for me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hundred to 200 grams of</v>

2465
01:43:22.841 --> 01:43:25.210
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still bad tanky carbohydrate feed.</v>

2466
01:43:25.211 --> 01:43:27.970
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day I'll still</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain ketosis.</v>

2467
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.390
<v Speaker 1>And so you again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your cake and eat it too.</v>

2468
01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:33.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a radical physical output though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're taking.</v>

2469
01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have like a thyroid issue and</v>

2470
01:43:36.611 --> 01:43:39.370
<v Speaker 1>you're highly active and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow Ketogenic Diet,</v>

2471
01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:42.550
<v Speaker 1>then you need to include more</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates than it would be</v>

2472
01:43:42.551 --> 01:43:46.350
<v Speaker 1>recommended in let's say like a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>sedentary type of ketone giant die</v>

2473
01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:50.200
<v Speaker 1>because you're always reading these</v>
<v Speaker 1>diets based on just the average person</v>

2474
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.930
<v Speaker 1>and the average person is just not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put out that kind of APP.</v>

2475
01:43:52.931 --> 01:43:55.640
<v Speaker 1>You want to include a lot of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that you tend to build up deficits</v>

2476
01:43:55.641 --> 01:44:00.130
<v Speaker 1>in like potassium and magnesium or two</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggies and you dump a lot of glycogen</v>

2477
01:44:00.131 --> 01:44:02.240
<v Speaker 1>and glycogen stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of water and it stores a bunch</v>

2478
01:44:02.241 --> 01:44:02.930
<v Speaker 1>of electrolytes.</v>

2479
01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:06.020
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out how to replace</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and now people are using,</v>

2480
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:08.390
<v Speaker 1>you know these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these exogenous ketones,</v>

2481
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:13.830
<v Speaker 1>the ketone salts or Ketone esters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the danger with those is now you can</v>

2482
01:44:14.391 --> 01:44:18.740
<v Speaker 1>like get into ketosis but still also</v>
<v Speaker 1>have high blood glucose and that's</v>

2483
01:44:18.741 --> 01:44:20.090
<v Speaker 1>something that we haven't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>studied.</v>

2484
01:44:20.091 --> 01:44:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not like our ancestors out</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting right for that.</v>

2485
01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not like were in ketosis</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were burning a lot of their</v>

2486
01:44:28.191 --> 01:44:30.740
<v Speaker 1>own body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generating keytones as a byproduct.</v>

2487
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:34.730
<v Speaker 1>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in just like a natural state</v>

2488
01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:37.370
<v Speaker 1>cause they weren't eating a lot of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes just,</v>

2489
01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not stuffing their face with</v>

2490
01:44:39.171 --> 01:44:42.560
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now people are able to eat a normal</v>

2491
01:44:42.561 --> 01:44:46.580
<v Speaker 1>western diet and like buy one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketone supplements and also be in</v>

2492
01:44:46.581 --> 01:44:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're hyperglycemic and</v>

2493
01:44:48.531 --> 01:44:51.230
<v Speaker 1>hyperkeratotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've like,</v>

2494
01:44:51.231 --> 01:44:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I did that before race and I felt like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on steroids.</v>

2495
01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like rocket fuel because my</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood glucose was jacked through the</v>

2496
01:44:57.441 --> 01:45:00.230
<v Speaker 1>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so I did a bunch of like fructose</v>

2497
01:45:00.231 --> 01:45:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Maltodextrin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy based gels,</v>

2498
01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:04.700
<v Speaker 1>and then I drank a bottle of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketone esters,</v>

2499
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.150
<v Speaker 1>which basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

2500
01:45:06.151 --> 01:45:08.210
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you measure your ketones,</v>

2501
01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:10.070
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll know that this is high.</v>

2502
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:13.310
<v Speaker 1>But within 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my values were above seven millimolar,</v>

2503
01:45:13.311 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 1>which is just off the charts for</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones.</v>

2504
01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:17.960
<v Speaker 1>But my blood glucose was also off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>charts.</v>

2505
01:45:18.230 --> 01:45:21.710
<v Speaker 1>And I felt like my cells had like both</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of fuel they'd ever need,</v>

2506
01:45:21.711 --> 01:45:25.040
<v Speaker 1>both ketones and glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I felt amazing.</v>

2507
01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:27.410
<v Speaker 1>But all bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's similar like diabetic</v>

2508
01:45:27.411 --> 01:45:28.820
<v Speaker 1>ketoacidosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2509
01:45:28.821 --> 01:45:30.920
<v Speaker 1>if you're in that state all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're using all these ketone</v>

2510
01:45:30.921 --> 01:45:34.220
<v Speaker 1>supplements and just eating your diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and using these cause your quote in</v>

2511
01:45:34.221 --> 01:45:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Ketosis Unquote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's healthy.</v>

2512
01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it would be great though</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance wise,</v>

2513
01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:41.570
<v Speaker 1>like for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2514
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:44.090
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel unstoppable.</v>

2515
01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I would think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if athletes I've tried and as</v>

2516
01:45:47.181 --> 01:45:49.280
<v Speaker 1>long as you use that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

2517
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:50.570
<v Speaker 1>it's like you use it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2518
01:45:50.571 --> 01:45:53.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like heard somebody say when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sugars are sometimes drug,</v>

2519
01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it does like you can feel it and</v>

2520
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.660
<v Speaker 1>can give you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're,</v>

2521
01:45:56.690 --> 01:45:59.330
<v Speaker 1>if you're not fat adapted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean carbohydrates give you a pretty</v>

2522
01:45:59.331 --> 01:46:02.330
<v Speaker 1>big boost in performance and energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus not having them on board and</v>

2523
01:46:02.331 --> 01:46:06.440
<v Speaker 1>you're exercising and especial or</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercising hard and this would be like</v>

2524
01:46:06.441 --> 01:46:06.830
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2525
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were to use that as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes drug and be careful with it.</v>

2526
01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that being a huge,</v>

2527
01:46:12.261 --> 01:46:14.060
<v Speaker 1>like it was kind of a bump where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to like,</v>

2528
01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:16.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't quantify it.</v>

2529
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:17.320
<v Speaker 1>If you try to use it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2530
01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:22.580
<v Speaker 1>it was a tough mudder in Vegas and all I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know is I felt way,</v>

2531
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:27.590
<v Speaker 1>way more.like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had the cognitive high that you</v>

2532
01:46:27.591 --> 01:46:29.990
<v Speaker 1>get from ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the original reason that I</v>

2533
01:46:29.991 --> 01:46:32.330
<v Speaker 1>started doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I started doing this ketosis thing</v>

2534
01:46:32.331 --> 01:46:35.300
<v Speaker 1>like seven years ago when I was getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to race iron man Canada.</v>

2535
01:46:35.630 --> 01:46:38.480
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to see what it would feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to have those readily available</v>

2536
01:46:38.481 --> 01:46:42.230
<v Speaker 1>fuel sources for the liver and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>diaphragm and the heart and kind of the</v>

2537
01:46:42.231 --> 01:46:45.260
<v Speaker 1>focus that comes with high levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones when you're on a bike for five</v>

2538
01:46:45.261 --> 01:46:47.750
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had that when I took these</v>

2539
01:46:47.751 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 1>exogenous ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I also had all the energy that</v>

2540
01:46:50.161 --> 01:46:50.971
<v Speaker 1>you get when you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2541
01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:53.820
<v Speaker 1>like after you've had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a candy bar,</v>

2542
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2543
01:46:54.150 --> 01:46:55.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2544
01:46:55.021 --> 01:46:56.760
<v Speaker 1>your high blood sugar and high blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones.</v>

2545
01:46:56.761 --> 01:46:58.770
<v Speaker 1>So you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd just feel focused,</v>

2546
01:46:58.950 --> 01:47:01.920
<v Speaker 1>but you also have high levels of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds amazing.</v>

2547
01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:06.180
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like the stem cells in the tech</v>

2548
01:47:06.181 --> 01:47:07.830
<v Speaker 1>cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2549
01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I don't die.</v>

2550
01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like though if you were</v>

2551
01:47:11.701 --> 01:47:15.450
<v Speaker 1>doing a big event and if you didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up to the like,</v>

2552
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I like what you're doing is in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet wise it seems like it makes sense.</v>

2553
01:47:18.691 --> 01:47:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I've got a really good balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a big event that sounds like</v>

2554
01:47:22.081 --> 01:47:24.690
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a really good thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look it up on carbohydrates,</v>

2555
01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:26.520
<v Speaker 1>load up on the ketone esters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2556
01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.580
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tonessa ketone esters are expensive.</v>

2557
01:47:29.610 --> 01:47:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of these ketone salts you</v>

2558
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:32.820
<v Speaker 1>don't like about the ketone salts too</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2559
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen a lot of resources at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketone esters are necessarily that much</v>

2560
01:47:36.211 --> 01:47:36.480
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2561
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.280
<v Speaker 1>And the ketone salts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get electrolytes with them too.</v>

2562
01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things that you</v>

2563
01:47:39.271 --> 01:47:40.110
<v Speaker 1>get depleted on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2564
01:47:40.111 --> 01:47:43.630
<v Speaker 1>what ketogenetic do you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what brand you're using for your ketone</v>

2565
01:47:43.631 --> 01:47:44.970
<v Speaker 1>supplements?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2566
01:47:44.971 --> 01:47:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I told you I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a blogger I get these packages sent</v>

2567
01:47:48.271 --> 01:47:50.070
<v Speaker 1>to my house every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like you probably get the same</v>

2568
01:47:50.071 --> 01:47:52.080
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like cardboard boxes full of boxes</v>

2569
01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:55.020
<v Speaker 1>and occasional little paper bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something that somebody made in</v>

2570
01:47:55.021 --> 01:47:58.890
<v Speaker 1>their kitchen that they sent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody gave me.</v>

2571
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when we gave me,</v>

2572
01:48:00.571 --> 01:48:01.650

<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>

2573
01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.810
<v Speaker 1>where was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was an Asheville doing a race</v>

2574
01:48:03.811 --> 01:48:07.590
<v Speaker 1>and Asheville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Carolina at Asheville fricking</v>

<v Speaker 1>there and you go up and down the street</v>

2582

<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went there during the yoga festival</v>

2589
01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.150
<v Speaker 1>like wine that they infused with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2598
01:49:03.930 --> 01:49:06.910

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2599
01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:07.861
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

2605
01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:29.220

<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who's a world champion</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxer who micro doses every day and</v>

2612
01:49:46.501 --> 01:49:49.810
<v Speaker 1>he says it him almost telepathic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you says it makes his,</v>

2613
01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:53.500
<v Speaker 1>his response time to sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he sees things before they</v>

2614
01:49:53.501 --> 01:49:57.160
<v Speaker 1>happen or sensory perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in nature settings,</v>

2615
01:49:57.670 --> 01:49:58.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2616
01:49:58.091 --> 01:50:00.400
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like this synthetic chemical,</v>

2617
01:50:00.401 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 1>ella chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>LSD or pls.</v>

2618
01:50:03.071 --> 01:50:05.650
<v Speaker 1>LSD is like the one a lot of people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>using now cause you get it for a lot</v>

2619
01:50:05.651 --> 01:50:08.850
<v Speaker 1>less expensive and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has the same effect as,</v>

2620
01:50:08.851 --> 01:50:10.030
<v Speaker 1>as LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2621
01:50:10.031 --> 01:50:11.890
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot cheaper and you get both and</v>

2622
01:50:11.891 --> 01:50:14.420
<v Speaker 1>you don't like these websites where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>use cryptocurrency to,</v>

2623
01:50:14.421 --> 01:50:15.790
<v Speaker 1>to purchase the compound.</v>

2624
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:18.290
<v Speaker 1>But the FBI sent it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2625
01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.880
<v Speaker 1>They dunt dunt dunt Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2626
01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:25.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very synthetic and there's like a</v>

2627
01:50:25.181 --> 01:50:27.790
<v Speaker 1>merging of the left and right</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemispheres of the brain and you get</v>

2628
01:50:27.791 --> 01:50:30.940
<v Speaker 1>very creative and focus simultaneously</v>
<v Speaker 1>doses you,</v>

2629
01:50:30.941 --> 01:50:32.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Lsd,</v>

2630
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:35.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to volume metrically dose,</v>

2631
01:50:35.681 --> 01:50:38.020
<v Speaker 1>which means like if you get a blotter of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lsd,</v>

2632
01:50:38.021 --> 01:50:40.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like a hundred micrograms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a square.</v>

2633
01:50:40.721 --> 01:50:43.030
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people will cut that into</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 pieces.</v>

2634
01:50:43.031 --> 01:50:45.190
<v Speaker 1>So that one piece would be 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>micrograms.</v>

2635
01:50:45.191 --> 01:50:48.610
<v Speaker 1>But you don't know if that piece has</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20 or five on it.</v>

2636
01:50:48.670 --> 01:50:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take a hundred a hundred</v>

2637
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.660
<v Speaker 1>microgram tab and you put that in like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little like a,</v>

2638
01:50:55.690 --> 01:51:00.520
<v Speaker 1>like a glass dropper bottle and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would add like 10 milliliters of</v>

2639
01:51:00.521 --> 01:51:03.670
<v Speaker 1>everclear or vodka or some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol to it.</v>

2640
01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:09.090
<v Speaker 1>And then you know that for every one</v>
<v Speaker 1>milliliter of alcohol in that little</v>

2641
01:51:09.311 --> 01:51:13.120
<v Speaker 1>dropper bottle that you consume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting exactly 10 micrograms of</v>

2642
01:51:13.121 --> 01:51:17.860
<v Speaker 1>LSD and about 10 to 20 micrograms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one to two dropper bottles full.</v>

2643
01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:20.440
<v Speaker 1>That would be considered a microdose for</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people.</v>

2644
01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:24.550
<v Speaker 1>But you don't like returning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin.</v>

2645
01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Silicide produces like this sensory</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>

2646
01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:31.730
<v Speaker 1>very natural feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2647
01:51:32.170 --> 01:51:35.510
<v Speaker 1>improvement in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your cognition and your senses that,</v>

2648
01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:37.590
<v Speaker 1>that it just feels more natural rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

2649
01:51:37.890 --> 01:51:41.630
<v Speaker 1>you would take it before you go on on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hike or you would take it when you're in</v>

2650
01:51:41.631 --> 01:51:42.960
<v Speaker 1>like a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very natural,</v>

2651
01:51:43.150 --> 01:51:47.770
<v Speaker 1>like a nature setting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for something like a day at the</v>

2652
01:51:47.771 --> 01:51:49.570
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it seems like Lsd is like a more</v>

2653
01:51:49.571 --> 01:51:51.310
<v Speaker 1>natural choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But suicide is really interesting for</v>

2654
01:51:51.311 --> 01:51:51.850
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2655
01:51:51.850 --> 01:51:53.390
<v Speaker 1>nature based setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiking.</v>

2656
01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about it is you feel like you,</v>

2657
01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you're getting readings from trees and</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>

2658
01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a weird feeling from the,</v>

2659
01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:04.690
<v Speaker 1>you don't normally get like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh now I'm tuned into whatever frequency</v>

2660
01:52:04.691 --> 01:52:07.720
<v Speaker 1>you guys are operating and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel alive.</v>

2661
01:52:08.110 --> 01:52:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Whereas trees just feel like trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally I walk by like they look</v>

2662
01:52:11.111 --> 01:52:13.870
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't feel them write the same</v>

2663
01:52:13.871 --> 01:52:14.704
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2664
01:52:14.710 --> 01:52:15.531
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2665
01:52:15.531 --> 01:52:16.510
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to,</v>

2666
01:52:16.570 --> 01:52:19.660
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to make yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on finding a tree beautiful by</v>

2667
01:52:19.661 --> 01:52:22.470
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you have silicide even a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful turn blood stream.</v>

2668
01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Like it's communicating with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2669
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:27.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like exactly like they're giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>you information,</v>

2670
01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you save it for those settings when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want nature to be really special.</v>

2671
01:52:30.850 --> 01:52:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Because my wife gives me a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes she was like,</v>

2672
01:52:32.711 --> 01:52:34.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you gotta take psilocybin for,</v>

2673
01:52:34.321 --> 01:52:35.350
<v Speaker 1>I got to go on a hike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2674
01:52:35.351 --> 01:52:37.540
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just go on a hike?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I told her,</v>

2675
01:52:37.541 --> 01:52:39.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's more interesting.</v>

2676
01:52:39.071 --> 01:52:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you see things you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally otherwise see.</v>

2677
01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:42.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2678
01:52:42.821 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I go to bed and I've got like my</v>
<v Speaker 1>binaural beats and my sleep mask and you</v>

2679
01:52:47.781 --> 01:52:49.160
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got like that little grounding</v>

2680
01:52:49.190 --> 01:52:54.090
<v Speaker 1>earthing device under my body and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>chilly pad and uh,</v>

2681
01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:56.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue light blocking glasses and,</v>

2682
01:52:56.230 --> 01:52:58.670
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get in bed with all these wires</v>

2683
01:52:58.671 --> 01:53:01.910
<v Speaker 1>sticking up out of my head and my wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gets in bed and just like sleeps</v>

2684
01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:03.480
<v Speaker 1>cause just got nothing on her side.</v>

2685
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:05.990
<v Speaker 1>So we're very yin and Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're still involved like</v>

2686
01:53:05.991 --> 01:53:07.610
<v Speaker 1>everything you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very involved.</v>

2687
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Does it ever feel overwhelming that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have all this stuff?</v>

2688
01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously it's what you do cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2689
01:53:12.241 --> 01:53:14.000
<v Speaker 1>you systematize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2690
01:53:14.001 --> 01:53:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Like when I walk into my office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I'm spending 20 minutes</v>

2691
01:53:17.091 --> 01:53:21.170
<v Speaker 1>like turning on the turning on the Jews</v>
<v Speaker 1>of light and putting on the essential</v>

2692
01:53:21.171 --> 01:53:24.370
<v Speaker 1>oil diffuser and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2693
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:25.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got like a,</v>

2694
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:27.230
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this device that creates like special</v>

2695
01:53:27.231 --> 01:53:28.820
<v Speaker 1>water that you breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2696
01:53:28.821 --> 01:53:31.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humidifies the water that you breathe</v>

2697
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:34.130
<v Speaker 1>while you're working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've got like,</v>

2698
01:53:34.131 --> 01:53:35.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue light generating devices on the</v>

2699
01:53:35.841 --> 01:53:38.000
<v Speaker 1>ceiling and all this stuff in my office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I walk in there,</v>

2700
01:53:38.001 --> 01:53:38.811
<v Speaker 1>it's just like click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

2701
01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:41.300
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go to work right it with the thing</v>

2702
01:53:41.301 --> 01:53:42.230
<v Speaker 1>on my head or whatever.</v>

2703
01:53:42.230 --> 01:53:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you systematize it,</v>

2704
01:53:44.130 --> 01:53:46.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're doing a lot to</v>

2705
01:53:46.971 --> 01:53:51.560
<v Speaker 1>actually improve your body or you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Bilac your body while you're,</v>

2706
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:53.900
<v Speaker 1>while you're at work during a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff just become systematized,</v>

2707
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:55.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like putting on your pants in the</v>

2708
01:53:55.071 --> 01:53:57.980
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The words about done,</v>

2709
01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm about done with that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biohack were beaten up that word.</v>

2710
01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Now what I would consider to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>biohacking is,</v>

2711
01:54:04.821 --> 01:54:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these dudes that like in jet chlorella</v>

2712
01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:09.650
<v Speaker 1>into their eyes so that they could get</v>
<v Speaker 1>night vision.</v>

2713
01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:11.540
<v Speaker 1>You should pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

2714
01:54:11.541 --> 01:54:12.320
<v Speaker 1>or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2715
01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Warrick,</v>

2716
01:54:13.471 --> 01:54:17.730
<v Speaker 1>like he was like the original Cyborg guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who got like a chip implanted under the</v>

2717
01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:21.770
<v Speaker 1>skin or the people who will inject like</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnets in their fingertips to be able</v>

2718
01:54:21.771 --> 01:54:25.130
<v Speaker 1>to interact with devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they would use the human body is what</v>

2719
01:54:25.131 --> 01:54:27.120
<v Speaker 1>they call wet ware and then install</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardware.</v>

2720
01:54:27.170 --> 01:54:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Like to me that's a true biohacker for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to blend like curcumin with olive oil</v>

2721
01:54:33.801 --> 01:54:35.690
<v Speaker 1>and bone broth and vitamin C and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoothie.</v>

2722
01:54:35.691 --> 01:54:37.430
<v Speaker 1>That's not like a biohack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a health,</v>

2723
01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:38.740
<v Speaker 1>just like making a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2724
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:39.583
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2725
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:40.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2726
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:45.140
<v Speaker 1>So I took it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are trending through bio hackers</v>

2727
01:54:45.141 --> 01:54:50.141
<v Speaker 1>out there who actually hacked their</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology but injecting chlorella in your</v>

2728
01:54:50.871 --> 01:54:51.910
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2729
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.440
<v Speaker 1>it seems super risky actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2730
01:54:54.450 --> 01:54:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I think its chlorophyll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>

2731
01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:00.350
<v Speaker 1>which is the green active component that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would find something like Chlorella,</v>

2732
01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:03.290
<v Speaker 1>but his eyes were all black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really where you should pull it up,</v>

2733
01:55:03.291 --> 01:55:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like dude injected ever.</v>

2734
01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:09.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think he could suck the</v>

2735
01:55:09.081 --> 01:55:12.920
<v Speaker 1>chlorophyll back out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has night vision now or the guy</v>

2736
01:55:12.921 --> 01:55:14.830
<v Speaker 1>who is goat man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about Goldman?</v>

2737
01:55:15.210 --> 01:55:15.410
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2738
01:55:15.410 --> 01:55:16.101
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's one,</v>

2739
01:55:16.101 --> 01:55:18.370
<v Speaker 1>one step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're almost manic and it's like,</v>

2740
01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I've got another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got another one.</v>

2741
01:55:19.590 --> 01:55:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy has permanent black in his</v>

2742
01:55:23.871 --> 01:55:26.450
<v Speaker 1>eyes and he can see like sorta like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>

2743
01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:28.920
<v Speaker 1>like nocturnal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2744
01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:30.630
<v Speaker 1>that's him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

2745
01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Making science more available to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>public have been testing of chemicals</v>

2746
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:37.850
<v Speaker 1>that allows humans to see in the dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it works.</v>

2747
01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:39.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a true bio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>

2748
01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:42.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a correct use of the term</v>
<v Speaker 1>biohacking.</v>

2749
01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:46.110
<v Speaker 1>It's got some other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can get like,</v>

2750
01:55:46.111 --> 01:55:47.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's this on?</v>

2751
01:55:47.011 --> 01:55:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Nerdist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2752
01:55:48.451 --> 01:55:51.330
<v Speaker 1>nerdist.com there it goes straight into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eye.</v>

2753
01:55:51.331 --> 01:55:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will stop at the stem cells into my</v>

2754
01:55:54.661 --> 01:55:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to know things.</v>

2755
01:55:56.370 --> 01:55:59.910
<v Speaker 1>The speculum holding my eyes open was by</v>
<v Speaker 1>far the worst part.</v>

2756
01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Even the effects themselves were very</v>
<v Speaker 1>subtle.</v>

2757
01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:04.050
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2758
01:56:04.051 --> 01:56:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I have Predator vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like that.</v>

2759
01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:07.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't get super powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a tweak,</v>

2760
01:56:07.861 --> 01:56:10.260
<v Speaker 1>not an overhaul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of disappointing that you go</v>

2761
01:56:10.261 --> 01:56:11.820
<v Speaker 1>through all that for just the tweak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2762
01:56:11.821 --> 01:56:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Well your whole fucking eyes into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2763
01:56:14.971 --> 01:56:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I want Predator vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the full meal deal.</v>

2764
01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to hunt animals in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>

2765
01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Works by binding to ops and proteins in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your retina where it's excited by light</v>

2766
01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:28.500
<v Speaker 1>transformational process to occur in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>protein segment.</v>

2767
01:56:28.890 --> 01:56:30.270
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go,</v>

2768
01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2769
01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:34.890
<v Speaker 1>So you could get the blue light blocking</v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses or you could just inject</v>

2770
01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:37.890
<v Speaker 1>everything into your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allowed him pick to pick up figures in</v>

2771
01:56:37.891 --> 01:56:40.770
<v Speaker 1>the dark with 100% accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're non treated test subjects.</v>

2772
01:56:40.771 --> 01:56:43.560
<v Speaker 1>You'd only make out to about 30% pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant.</v>

2773
01:56:43.590 --> 01:56:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I liked it.</v>

2774
01:56:45.110 --> 01:56:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I liked how the author doesn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>which percentage signed to use the</v>

2775
01:56:47.971 --> 01:56:50.040
<v Speaker 1>actual percentage sign or the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

2776
01:56:50.190 --> 01:56:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to work on their,</v>

2777
01:56:52.530 --> 01:56:54.090
<v Speaker 1>on their editing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2778
01:56:54.091 --> 01:56:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Your writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 meters.</v>

2779
01:56:57.590 --> 01:57:01.350
<v Speaker 1>To go back to that Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking 50 meters over 160 feet</v>

2780
01:57:01.351 --> 01:57:02.250
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2781
01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:06.140
<v Speaker 1>That's actually really significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The following morning his eyes returned</v>

2782
01:57:06.141 --> 01:57:07.710
<v Speaker 1>to normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2783
01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just say that right there is returned to</v>

2784
01:57:11.221 --> 01:57:13.230
<v Speaker 1>normal and side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2785
01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:15.390
<v Speaker 1>So he's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not injecting.</v>

2786
01:57:15.391 --> 01:57:17.220
<v Speaker 1>They're dropping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They using drops.</v>

2787
01:57:17.610 --> 01:57:21.600
<v Speaker 1>So this would be like we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about bow hunting about elk hunting.</v>

2788
01:57:21.630 --> 01:57:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're in sort of low light,</v>

2789
01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:28.360
<v Speaker 1>that might be the mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could pack your speculum into your case,</v>

2790
01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:32.280
<v Speaker 1>drop them in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that you have a hunting buddy</v>

2791
01:57:32.281 --> 01:57:35.250
<v Speaker 1>who is well versed in the addition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chlorophyll,</v>

2792
01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.830
<v Speaker 1>rubber gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber gloves.</v>

2793
01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:41.070
<v Speaker 1>You've got all that stuff to feel dress</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways and just go to town on your</v>

2794
01:57:41.071 --> 01:57:42.810
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you get into bow hunting?</v>

2795
01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my buddy,</v>

2796
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:46.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>canton,</v>

2797
01:57:46.441 --> 01:57:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Claremont up in Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was running these trained to</v>

2798
01:57:50.250 --> 01:57:54.930
<v Speaker 1>competitions which are really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also of course racing with a weapon,</v>

2799
01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:56.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a ton of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could do it out here and like,</v>

2800
01:57:57.050 --> 01:57:59.040
<v Speaker 1>cause you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could carry sandbags,</v>

2801
01:57:59.041 --> 01:58:01.410
<v Speaker 1>do like cones and suicides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prints and all sorts of stuff with this</v>

2802
01:58:01.411 --> 01:58:05.550
<v Speaker 1>technical hunt set up that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that trying to hunt like uh,</v>

2803
01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:07.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first competition that I did you,</v>

2804
01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:10.740
<v Speaker 1>you show up and it starts off with like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a four or five hour traditional three d</v>

2805
01:58:10.741 --> 01:58:12.120
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for people who don't know what a</v>

2806
01:58:12.121 --> 01:58:13.620
<v Speaker 1>three d shoot is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bunch of targets,</v>

2807
01:58:13.621 --> 01:58:15.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Reinhardt targets or whatever that</v>

2808
01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:15.900
<v Speaker 1>are set up.</v>

2809
01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Well explain that they different</v>
<v Speaker 1>locations to a jetty.</v>

2810
01:58:18.330 --> 01:58:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Look Robert Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look like animals are going to be a</v>

2811
01:58:20.791 --> 01:58:24.090
<v Speaker 1>fox or an or an elk or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2812
01:58:24.091 --> 01:58:24.924
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2813
01:58:25.070 --> 01:58:28.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bedded animal or a standing animal and</v>

2814
01:58:28.050 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 1>they're spread throughout this course</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're walking.</v>

2815
01:58:31.471 --> 01:58:33.420
<v Speaker 1>You can think of it almost like golfing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2816
01:58:33.421 --> 01:58:36.420
<v Speaker 1>for people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't bow hunt and you'll,</v>

2817
01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:39.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one shot might just be like a simple 25</v>

2818
01:58:39.091 --> 01:58:41.800
<v Speaker 1>yard shot at a Fox where if you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitals,</v>

2819
01:58:41.801 --> 01:58:46.030
<v Speaker 1>you'll get the five points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you hit a body shot then it might</v>

2820
01:58:46.031 --> 01:58:50.200
<v Speaker 1>be three points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you miss it's zero.</v>

2821
01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:52.990
<v Speaker 1>And if you get like a wound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a negative score.</v>

2822
01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which it should be like,</v>

2823
01:58:54.161 --> 01:58:56.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like a night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you wound an animal that's,</v>

2824
01:58:56.531 --> 01:58:59.050
<v Speaker 1>that's really much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much worse than missing an animal.</v>

2825
01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of the shots are pretty complex.</v>

2826
01:59:02.201 --> 01:59:05.170
<v Speaker 1>It might be you got to get off two shots</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 10 seconds,</v>

2827
01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.670
<v Speaker 1>which is actually kind of hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2828
01:59:06.671 --> 01:59:09.610
<v Speaker 1>two shots in 10 seconds and one animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 20 and one animals at 40.</v>

2829
01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:11.950
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is why I use like a three pin side</v>

2830
01:59:11.951 --> 01:59:16.210
<v Speaker 1>on my ball because you don't even have</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to adjust the dial after you've</v>

2831
01:59:16.211 --> 01:59:18.610
<v Speaker 1>taken one shot to the yardage for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second shot.</v>

2832
01:59:19.090 --> 01:59:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have a shot that's like run up</v>

2833
01:59:21.911 --> 01:59:24.250
<v Speaker 1>this hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a target up there.</v>

2834
01:59:24.251 --> 01:59:29.020
<v Speaker 1>We won't tell you the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have 30 seconds to make it the</v>

2835
01:59:29.021 --> 01:59:31.840
<v Speaker 1>25 yards up that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goalie.</v>

2836
01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And then you're going to have a shot at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top and you got to run up the goal</v>

2837
01:59:35.341 --> 01:59:38.230
<v Speaker 1>he site and get your shot off in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 seconds.</v>

2838
01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2839
01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:40.810
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like a traditional three d</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>

2840
01:59:40.811 --> 01:59:42.250
<v Speaker 1>It's very active,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2841
01:59:42.251 --> 01:59:46.030
<v Speaker 1>and some shots are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you draw lunging and then you stand</v>

2842
01:59:46.031 --> 01:59:48.160
<v Speaker 1>and then you got to walk around the tree</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then take your shots.</v>

2843
01:59:48.161 --> 01:59:50.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way different than just like</v>

2844
01:59:50.711 --> 01:59:55.150
<v Speaker 1>standing out of the range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting a target and you get a certain</v>

2845
01:59:55.151 --> 01:59:57.160
<v Speaker 1>score coming out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2846
01:59:57.161 --> 02:00:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Like you might have a mass x number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>points or or lost x number of points and</v>

2847
02:00:01.271 --> 02:00:03.520
<v Speaker 1>then you go into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2848
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:04.650
<v Speaker 1>and they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2849
02:00:04.810 --> 02:00:07.510
<v Speaker 1>this year they've kind of like changed</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because a lot of people were like</v>

2850
02:00:07.570 --> 02:00:09.760
<v Speaker 1>getting hurt and blowing out their knees</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this next part.</v>

2851
02:00:09.761 --> 02:00:11.290
<v Speaker 1>But you do what's called like a meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack,</v>

2852
02:00:11.650 --> 02:00:15.370
<v Speaker 1>which is a hundred pounds in your pack</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's two to four mile course that</v>

2853
02:00:15.371 --> 02:00:17.410
<v Speaker 1>you got to boogie across as fast as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

2854
02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:20.650
<v Speaker 1>People were running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with it was people like</v>

2855
02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:23.560
<v Speaker 1>when you pack out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're taking it on time,</v>

2856
02:00:23.561 --> 02:00:26.290
<v Speaker 1>you're not running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not like racing your buddy but</v>

2857
02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was like the most painful thing</v>

2858
02:00:28.331 --> 02:00:32.050
<v Speaker 1>of really ever done in terms of like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>high my heart rate got and the amount of</v>

2859
02:00:32.051 --> 02:00:34.520
<v Speaker 1>lactic acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just try to go two miles fast.</v>

2860
02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:35.860
<v Speaker 1>You can with a hundred pounds in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>

2861
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Sounds very not only you've got to spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I would spend copious amounts of</v>

2862
02:00:39.251 --> 02:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>times like making sure the pack was</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjusted properly and I'll put like the</v>

2863
02:00:41.951 --> 02:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>bubble wrap in the bottom of the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it moves the weight that you're</v>

2864
02:00:44.621 --> 02:00:46.930
<v Speaker 1>using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are typically sandbags up to the</v>

2865
02:00:46.931 --> 02:00:50.200
<v Speaker 1>center of the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I worked with this company called</v>

2866
02:00:50.770 --> 02:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that makes like these facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah they make a jump back Aaron.</v>

2867
02:00:56.170 --> 02:00:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Um exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know he did some skype sessions</v>

2868
02:00:58.901 --> 02:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>with me where he taught me exactly cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't set it up the way that you</v>

2869
02:01:02.171 --> 02:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>would if you were just going to pack out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in animal,</v>

2870
02:01:03.850 --> 02:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you have to put it super duper tight up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the shoulder so it's not bouncing</v>

2871
02:01:06.701 --> 02:01:08.590
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you put the weight down in the</v>

2872
02:01:08.591 --> 02:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it works for running two miles really</v>

2873
02:01:11.501 --> 02:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's super uncomfortable and it's</v>

2874
02:01:13.751 --> 02:01:17.650
<v Speaker 1>not biomechanically favorable sucks but</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good to have it running.</v>

2875
02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they call that the meat pack right.</v>

2876
02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>And have to do it that way or is it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a matter of how much weight you have on</v>

2877
02:01:24.311 --> 02:01:26.620
<v Speaker 1>your back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could use one of those atlas</v>

2878
02:01:26.621 --> 02:01:28.750
<v Speaker 1>packs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you seen those atlas things from</v>

2879
02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>outdoors means it's essentially it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack frame with a traditional Olympic</v>

2880
02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>boats on the end of it where you put the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plates on it.</v>

2881
02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:39.890
<v Speaker 1>What are those things called and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of a weight bar or the white</v>

2882
02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>wait slide on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call that?</v>

2883
02:01:42.170 --> 02:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>The end of a weight borrower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weights.</v>

2884
02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Like a barbell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2885
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:48.410
<v Speaker 1>the end of the bar bar around the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bar.</v>

2886
02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Well they have one of those I post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you've got to post.</v>

2887
02:01:50.901 --> 02:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2888
02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>They have one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hanging out in the back.</v>

2889
02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the atlas trainer Jamie</v>

2890
02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>outdoorsman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] dot com um,</v>

2891
02:01:59.310 --> 02:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>as a PAC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's PAC frame with a,</v>

2892
02:02:02.151 --> 02:02:04.910
<v Speaker 1>I hiked with it on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a picture?</v>

2893
02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2894
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:07.833
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2895
02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:08.783
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2896
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could use whatever you want as long</v>

2897
02:02:13.821 --> 02:02:14.680
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you have waiting it.</v>

2898
02:02:14.681 --> 02:02:16.700
<v Speaker 1>You just have to figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause everybody has to use a standard</v>

2899
02:02:16.701 --> 02:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>weight so you have to use the sandbag</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they issue to you.</v>

2900
02:02:20.190 --> 02:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Your use the same object that so</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's using a sand bag just so you</v>

2901
02:02:24.531 --> 02:02:29.531
<v Speaker 1>don't come in with your own weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just saying if he did that that</v>

2902
02:02:29.610 --> 02:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>you like that you painted a 45 pound</v>
<v Speaker 1>logo on um,</v>

2903
02:02:33.590 --> 02:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>anyways though she didn't meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack in and he gives her amount of time</v>

2904
02:02:36.531 --> 02:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you do the obstacle course</v>

2905
02:02:38.091 --> 02:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>which is the real hoot and which they</v>
<v Speaker 1>still do,</v>

2906
02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:42.050
<v Speaker 1>which is cause I think got rid of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat pack.</v>

2907
02:02:42.051 --> 02:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>But the obstacle courses me pack it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not,</v>

2908
02:02:45.710 --> 02:02:46.820
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2909
02:02:46.821 --> 02:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Like they designed this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition to simulate hunting,</v>

2910
02:02:49.311 --> 02:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>to prepare a hunter to hunt and to train</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred a hundred properly and it just</v>

2911
02:02:53.931 --> 02:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>flew in the face of everything that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>

2912
02:02:55.941 --> 02:02:59.690
<v Speaker 1>which is jacked up nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2913
02:02:59.691 --> 02:03:02.510
<v Speaker 1>rushing through the woods with a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>package.</v>

2914
02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:05.480
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't pack out an animal like that.</v>

2915
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Then they'd have to figure out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put like a speed limiter on like,</v>

2916
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to run.</v>

2917
02:03:10.210 --> 02:03:13.050
<v Speaker 1>So you guys got there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes sense?</v>

2918
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:14.930
<v Speaker 1>But people were getting hurt and it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

2919
02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:17.270
<v Speaker 1>didn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be jacked up my back and like it,</v>

2920
02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:19.520
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I get it.</v>

2921
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I kind of wish they still had it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was good at that part.</v>

2922
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Cause like I'm going to doors halfway</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm kind of strong so for,</v>

2923
02:03:24.441 --> 02:03:26.640
<v Speaker 1>so for me it worked out pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2924
02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:30.470
<v Speaker 1>and then they have the obstacle course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like crawling under barb wire</v>

2925
02:03:30.530 --> 02:03:33.080
<v Speaker 1>stand shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're doing like,</v>

2926
02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:35.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like sand bag over the</v>

2927
02:03:35.181 --> 02:03:38.330
<v Speaker 1>shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 reps shoot 30 burpees and for the</v>

2928
02:03:38.331 --> 02:03:41.480
<v Speaker 1>obstacle course you have a 50 pound pack</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a 40 pound pack on your back.</v>

2929
02:03:41.690 --> 02:03:44.600
<v Speaker 1>They kind of adjust the pack weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>based off which division that you're in.</v>

2930
02:03:44.601 --> 02:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>But so you're using a smaller packs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I use the kefauver packet.</v>

2931
02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:48.920
<v Speaker 1>They again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just had like a smaller pack.</v>

2932
02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to sand bag.</v>

2933
02:03:50.371 --> 02:03:52.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a lighter sandbag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you carrying that through the whole</v>

2934
02:03:52.851 --> 02:03:54.680
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're stopping and shooting along</v>

2935
02:03:54.681 --> 02:03:55.850
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you're,</v>

2936
02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:59.600
<v Speaker 1>you're learning how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just imagine if you,</v>

2937
02:03:59.630 --> 02:04:02.900
<v Speaker 1>if you were like rushing up a hill and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to the top of the hill and he got</v>

2938
02:04:02.901 --> 02:04:05.420
<v Speaker 1>to calm your heart way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call him your nervous system very</v>

2939
02:04:05.421 --> 02:04:07.970
<v Speaker 1>quickly and get your shot off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And granted,</v>

2940
02:04:08.090 --> 02:04:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you're not necessarily going to be hall</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a sandbag up that hill and doing a</v>

2941
02:04:11.361 --> 02:04:14.660
<v Speaker 1>bunch of burpees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of simulating that of</v>

2942
02:04:14.661 --> 02:04:17.150
<v Speaker 1>shooting with your heart rate elevated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2943
02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:18.860
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard course.</v>

2944
02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean like there are like legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2945
02:04:21.981 --> 02:04:24.890
<v Speaker 1>hardcore crossfitters and athletes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this,</v>

2946
02:04:24.891 --> 02:04:28.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's a combination of being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot well and being able to,</v>

2947
02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:29.210
<v Speaker 1>to fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2948
02:04:29.211 --> 02:04:30.930
<v Speaker 1>that's the interesting thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting,</v>

2949
02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:33.080
<v Speaker 1>is it bow hunting really does require</v>
<v Speaker 1>fitness.</v>

2950
02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Well when I did that high country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2951
02:04:35.730 --> 02:04:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing this,</v>

2952
02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:41.640
<v Speaker 1>this ring we were talking about when did</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunt in Hawaii and I did it like 46</v>

2953
02:04:41.641 --> 02:04:46.170
<v Speaker 1>miles over the course of five days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like crawling and walking and</v>

2954
02:04:46.171 --> 02:04:48.120
<v Speaker 1>hiking and sprinting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

2955
02:04:48.121 --> 02:04:53.040
<v Speaker 1>that's why I like bow hunting is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenge and the uh,</v>

2956
02:04:53.041 --> 02:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>the train to hunt Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2957
02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Kenton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me about these competitions and</v>

2958
02:04:56.881 --> 02:04:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I was watching them and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really want to try this.</v>

2959
02:04:59.281 --> 02:05:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause at that point I'd firearms hunted</v>
<v Speaker 1>for two years.</v>

2960
02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't grow up hunting.</v>

2961
02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I grew up homeschooled playing chess and</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the violin,</v>

2962
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:10.110
<v Speaker 1>reading books and playing world of</v>
<v Speaker 1>warcraft.</v>

2963
02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:10.973
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2964
02:05:11.190 --> 02:05:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I was not like a hunter kid growing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and neither of my parents,</v>

2965
02:05:14.071 --> 02:05:15.750
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we'd occasionally go fishing for</v>

2966
02:05:15.751 --> 02:05:18.120
<v Speaker 1>trout and that was about it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the stock pond.</v>

2967
02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:22.020
<v Speaker 1>So hunting when it was new for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been hunting for two years.</v>

2968
02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Totally self taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel dressed my first animal with</v>

2969
02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:29.400
<v Speaker 1>the little youtube video on the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You following along?</v>

2970
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I've got my knife and I'm watching the</v>
<v Speaker 1>video because that's the way I was being</v>

2971
02:05:32.701 --> 02:05:33.360
<v Speaker 1>homeschooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2972
02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I like to teach myself things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just grew up as a very independent</v>

2973
02:05:36.571 --> 02:05:39.300
<v Speaker 1>learner so I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of my hunting was salt type benefit.</v>

2974
02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2975
02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:43.560
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are drawbacks to being very</v>

2976
02:05:43.561 --> 02:05:45.690
<v Speaker 1>resistant to learning from others or</v>
<v Speaker 1>having mentors.</v>

2977
02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I think that you also don't play well</v>
<v Speaker 1>with others.</v>

2978
02:05:48.631 --> 02:05:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I grew up as it,</v>

2979
02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:53.340
<v Speaker 1>when I got to college I was very poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the team activities you did weren't</v>

2980
02:05:53.341 --> 02:05:57.420
<v Speaker 1>socialized very good at creating at</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading edge,</v>

2981
02:05:57.421 --> 02:05:59.640
<v Speaker 1>thinking outside the box at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

2982
02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:00.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

2983
02:06:00.930 --> 02:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>kind of being a lot more independent</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>

2984
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:05.520
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating cause that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing.</v>

2985
02:06:05.770 --> 02:06:08.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what you did is what I wound up</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2986
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:13.140
<v Speaker 1>And also I read a copious amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a copious amount and that's</v>

2987
02:06:13.141 --> 02:06:16.410
<v Speaker 1>still what I do because that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I kind of grew up doing.</v>

2988
02:06:16.411 --> 02:06:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Homeschooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2989
02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:20.250
<v Speaker 1>and it was really tennis that got me</v>
<v Speaker 1>into fitness.</v>

2990
02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Like I played tennis in college and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got big into tennis in high school and</v>

2991
02:06:23.971 --> 02:06:25.980
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Idaho where I was at the time,</v>

2992
02:06:25.981 --> 02:06:29.220
<v Speaker 1>there is a rule that homeschooled kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>could play sports at the local public</v>

2993
02:06:29.221 --> 02:06:29.880
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

2994
02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:31.950
<v Speaker 1>So I played tennis and that really got</v>
<v Speaker 1>me into sports.</v>

2995
02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:35.300
<v Speaker 1>And then I studied exercise physiology</v>
<v Speaker 1>and biomechanics in college and,</v>

2996
02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:37.260
<v Speaker 1>and here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

2997
02:06:37.261 --> 02:06:41.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm like going from being homeschooled</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hanging out with public school kids.</v>

2998
02:06:43.110 --> 02:06:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Really Awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I because you're not,</v>

2999
02:06:46.650 --> 02:06:48.960
<v Speaker 1>you're not in class with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not at the prom,</v>

3000
02:06:48.961 --> 02:06:50.820
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing any of the social</v>

3001
02:06:50.821 --> 02:06:52.470
<v Speaker 1>things that they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you might show up at like,</v>

3002
02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:54.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tennis practice or whatever and same</v>

3003
02:06:54.241 --> 02:06:56.040
<v Speaker 1>thing we get to college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just not used to,</v>

3004
02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean like do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went off the deep end in college</v>

3005
02:06:58.411 --> 02:07:01.350
<v Speaker 1>because I graduated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 15 and I didn't do like a gap year</v>

3006
02:07:01.351 --> 02:07:01.981
<v Speaker 1>or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3007
02:07:01.981 --> 02:07:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I just started college when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 and I did not have good self control</v>

3008
02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:11.880
<v Speaker 1>around sex and alcohol and drugs and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things that all of a sudden I was</v>

3009
02:07:11.881 --> 02:07:13.410
<v Speaker 1>immersed in in college.</v>

3010
02:07:13.410 --> 02:07:15.210
<v Speaker 1>So no one was there to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3011
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way I raised my kids is they,</v>

3012
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:20.070
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

3013
02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:22.350
<v Speaker 1>there are really no rules in our house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3014
02:07:22.351 --> 02:07:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Like they can try Ramin Scotch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whiskey and they can take a hit off the</v>

3015
02:07:25.981 --> 02:07:27.900
<v Speaker 1>vape pen that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're nine.</v>

3016
02:07:28.290 --> 02:07:33.290
<v Speaker 1>But they also have been educated about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that might do to their liver or to</v>

3017
02:07:33.991 --> 02:07:36.820
<v Speaker 1>the gray matter in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we don't say no gluten.</v>

3018
02:07:36.821 --> 02:07:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I tell them you'll gluten is gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect your test stores.</v>

3019
02:07:38.831 --> 02:07:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Cores creates neural inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can create some gastric inflammation.</v>

3020
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:44.500
<v Speaker 1>You get to choose when you go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday party,</v>

3021
02:07:44.501 --> 02:07:46.870
<v Speaker 1>whether you're going to have the gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it comes back to bite me</v>

3022
02:07:46.871 --> 02:07:49.540
<v Speaker 1>because we'll go out to a restaurant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll bring the bread out to the</v>

3023
02:07:49.541 --> 02:07:50.620
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and they boys would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3024
02:07:50.621 --> 02:07:51.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want the,</v>

3025
02:07:51.490 --> 02:07:52.180
<v Speaker 1>we don't want the bread.</v>

3026
02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.940
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of wanted a little kind of</v>

3027
02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:59.740
<v Speaker 1>did on my little piece of bread here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that I think that's a better way to</v>

3028
02:07:59.741 --> 02:08:00.521
<v Speaker 1>raise a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3029
02:08:00.521 --> 02:08:04.540
<v Speaker 1>You educate them about the consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their decision and then you let them</v>

3030
02:08:04.541 --> 02:08:07.660
<v Speaker 1>make the decision themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You equip them rather than creating a</v>

3031
02:08:07.661 --> 02:08:09.820
<v Speaker 1>bunch of forbidden fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the way that I was kind of</v>

3032
02:08:09.821 --> 02:08:11.650
<v Speaker 1>raised Riley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3033
02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:13.360
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a little tricky,</v>

3034
02:08:13.361 --> 02:08:15.010
<v Speaker 1>the whole college thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3035
02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.740
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to back to bow hunting,</v>

3036
02:08:17.770 --> 02:08:21.250
<v Speaker 1>it was this train hunting and Kenton</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up to my house and I asked him</v>

3037
02:08:21.251 --> 02:08:22.510
<v Speaker 1>about like kind of like the spear</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing.</v>

3038
02:08:22.511 --> 02:08:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Like what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the ball?</v>

3039
02:08:24.010 --> 02:08:26.470
<v Speaker 1>What release do I get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What areas do I get?</v>

3040
02:08:26.471 --> 02:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>How would I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the,</v>

3041
02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.790
<v Speaker 1>my local boat shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took some lessons in shooting.</v>

3042
02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I,</v>

3043
02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:34.900
<v Speaker 1>my first hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3044
02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:38.710
<v Speaker 1>what was my first hunt side from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>

3045
02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:40.850
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm on 10 acres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe like a copious amount of white</v>

3046
02:08:40.851 --> 02:08:42.450
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I shot my first animal out there.</v>

3047
02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:44.800
<v Speaker 1>My first major hunt was high country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>

3048
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:46.930
<v Speaker 1>We did like a horseback hunt with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guide there,</v>

3049
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:49.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that got me hooked.</v>

3050
02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:54.060
<v Speaker 1>If this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was elk came back after seven days</v>

3051
02:08:54.131 --> 02:08:55.780
<v Speaker 1>with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my very first time.</v>

3052
02:08:56.230 --> 02:08:58.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then my first actual kill I hunted</v>

3053
02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.820
<v Speaker 1>access stare down in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

3054
02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas is crazy.</v>

3055
02:09:02.581 --> 02:09:04.270
<v Speaker 1>And it tests the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was telling you that have like fricken</v>

3056
02:09:04.271 --> 02:09:07.000

<v Speaker 1>I know they have everything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what their seasons</v>

3093
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:43.010
<v Speaker 1>stainable mineral rich source of</v>
<v Speaker 1>protein.</v>

3094
02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:43.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3095
02:10:43.821 --> 02:10:46.640
<v Speaker 1>And I don't see the thing about most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are like,</v>

3096
02:10:46.641 --> 02:10:50.210
<v Speaker 1>they don't want animals to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't usually give a shit about</v>

3097
02:10:50.211 --> 02:10:51.044
<v Speaker 1>bugs.</v>

3098
02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3099
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people find like a June bug.</v>

3100
02:10:53.931 --> 02:10:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Super Cute and cry when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it gets killed.</v>

3101
02:10:56.180 --> 02:10:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Miskino vegans just slap mosquitoes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their arms.</v>

3102
02:10:59.420 --> 02:11:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a study this morning of gene</v>

3103
02:11:01.191 --> 02:11:02.720
<v Speaker 1>editing mosquitoes now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3104
02:11:02.730 --> 02:11:05.690
<v Speaker 1>You're using crispr technologies to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mosquitoes less likely to bite you.</v>

3105
02:11:05.810 --> 02:11:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

3106
02:11:06.861 --> 02:11:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very bizarre.</v>

3107
02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

3108
02:11:09.021 --> 02:11:12.830
<v Speaker 1>there was a little cool little anecdote</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that study to where they found that</v>

3109
02:11:12.831 --> 02:11:16.340
<v Speaker 1>mosquito is actually have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they learn if you swat at the</v>

3110
02:11:16.341 --> 02:11:18.620
<v Speaker 1>mosquito,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually learns to avoid you.</v>

3111
02:11:19.190 --> 02:11:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

3112
02:11:20.901 --> 02:11:23.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally I just like put some on my skin</v>

3113
02:11:23.031 --> 02:11:25.970
<v Speaker 1>like cinnamon essential oil or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that drives a mosquito away.</v>

3114
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3115
02:11:26.961 --> 02:11:27.794
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

3116
02:11:27.810 --> 02:11:28.800
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>

3117
02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you want to dilute it because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very,</v>

3118
02:11:30.681 --> 02:11:34.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a burning oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cinnamon works amazingly if you ever</v>

3119
02:11:34.251 --> 02:11:34.580
<v Speaker 1>tried it.</v>

3120
02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And like Alaska where they have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really aggressive mosquitoes around.</v>

3121
02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why we're where there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of mosquitoes,</v>

3122
02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:43.520
<v Speaker 1>different animal and work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the Alaska,</v>

3123
02:11:43.610 --> 02:11:45.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's on my bucket.</v>

3124
02:11:45.211 --> 02:11:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Ours and they swarm you like a pack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zhan.</v>

3125
02:11:48.681 --> 02:11:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Laska doesn't seem like a place I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>envision having these like special snow.</v>

3126
02:11:52.610 --> 02:11:54.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live very long.</v>

3127
02:11:54.501 --> 02:11:56.470
<v Speaker 1>So they're incredibly aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3128
02:11:56.630 --> 02:11:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.</v>

3129
02:11:59.001 --> 02:12:02.180
<v Speaker 1>We went salmon fishing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and my friend Ari and we opened up</v>

3130
02:12:02.181 --> 02:12:05.390
<v Speaker 1>the car door to get out and the time it</v>
<v Speaker 1>take to open the car door,</v>

3131
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:08.120
<v Speaker 1>a swarm of mosquitoes was inside of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

3132
02:12:08.121 --> 02:12:11.210
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not exaggerating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Several hundred mosquitoes like goodness</v>

3133
02:12:11.211 --> 02:12:12.830
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like that video that you</v>

3134
02:12:12.831 --> 02:12:15.830
<v Speaker 1>pulled up once we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this with the clouds of mosquitoes in</v>

3135
02:12:15.831 --> 02:12:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Alaska.</v>

3136
02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like the graph.</v>

3137
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Like when I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Lewiston,</v>

3138
02:12:20.301 --> 02:12:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Idaho and we would get these grasshopper</v>
<v Speaker 1>infestations.</v>

3139
02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:24.860
<v Speaker 1>They like each year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3140
02:12:24.861 --> 02:12:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Locus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they apparently they plant their</v>

3141
02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:30.920
<v Speaker 1>eggs in the ground and then like in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spring or the summer they hatch.</v>

3142
02:12:31.470 --> 02:12:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's mosquitoes and Alaska.</v>

3143
02:12:33.370 --> 02:12:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's the cray.</v>

3145
02:12:35.901 --> 02:12:40.901

<v Speaker 1>It already getting jammed.</v>

3146
02:12:41.901 --> 02:12:44.810
<v Speaker 1>My goodness dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you I'd never seen anything</v>

3147
02:12:44.811 --> 02:12:48.110
<v Speaker 1>like it and we were covered with ddt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>

3148
02:12:48.111 --> 02:12:51.110
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible the deet.</v>

3149
02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about Therma sells their</v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks?</v>

3150
02:12:53.630 --> 02:12:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3151
02:12:54.651 --> 02:12:55.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3152
02:12:55.671 --> 02:12:57.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been using them cause my,</v>

3153
02:12:57.230 --> 02:12:59.180
<v Speaker 1>my kid's camp outside sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3154
02:12:59.181 --> 02:12:59.991
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the forest.</v>

3155
02:12:59.991 --> 02:13:02.750
<v Speaker 1>And I said to one of those little</v>
<v Speaker 1>thermacell things in front of their,</v>

3156
02:13:03.170 --> 02:13:04.003
<v Speaker 1>they're amazing.</v>

3157
02:13:05.950 --> 02:13:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3158
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Is that why you're the first like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea that Caribou uh,</v>

3159
02:13:11.271 --> 02:13:13.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grasshoppers at our house and loosed</v>

3160
02:13:13.311 --> 02:13:16.190
<v Speaker 1>and we would actually go sell them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pet stores.</v>

3161
02:13:16.191 --> 02:13:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how we make money in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>summers because it'd be so many of them.</v>

3162
02:13:18.831 --> 02:13:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Me and my brothers would walk around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with cages.</v>

3163
02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:22.850
<v Speaker 1>She's grasshoppers and bringing a pet</v>
<v Speaker 1>stores,</v>

3164
02:13:22.851 --> 02:13:24.830
<v Speaker 1>we'll use them for like tarantulas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

3165
02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:27.590
<v Speaker 1>And then this army guy who was in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>military came to her house and he showed</v>

3166
02:13:27.591 --> 02:13:30.440
<v Speaker 1>us how they eat grasshoppers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we started eating grass hoppers and</v>

3167
02:13:30.441 --> 02:13:31.850
<v Speaker 1>we like it everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3168
02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Like we'd microwave grasshopper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just figure out every way to kill a</v>

3169
02:13:35.371 --> 02:13:38.070
<v Speaker 1>grass hopper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that we got rid of him was</v>

3170
02:13:38.071 --> 02:13:42.320
<v Speaker 1>we introduced praying mantis and chicken</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our property and both of those mother</v>

3171
02:13:42.321 --> 02:13:44.520
<v Speaker 1>fuckers a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of chickens.</v>

3172
02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:47.150
<v Speaker 1>And then we have chickens at our</v>
<v Speaker 1>property up in spokane now too,</v>

3173
02:13:47.210 --> 02:13:48.620
<v Speaker 1>which I have a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eggs.</v>

3174
02:13:48.650 --> 02:13:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Icelandic chickens.</v>

3175
02:13:50.281 --> 02:13:51.480
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hardy.</v>

3176
02:13:51.530 --> 02:13:52.363
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the winter.</v>

3177
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:56.820
<v Speaker 1>And then the goats that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our Nigerian dwarf goats and Nigerian</v>

3178
02:13:56.821 --> 02:13:59.860
<v Speaker 1>dwarf goats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very small goat and they produce</v>

3179
02:13:59.861 --> 02:14:04.620
<v Speaker 1>a lot of milk for their actual size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're very hardy in the winter and</v>

3180
02:14:04.621 --> 02:14:08.430
<v Speaker 1>they're small and they're cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we haven't milked them yet because</v>

3181
02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:11.850
<v Speaker 1>they need to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have to be pregnant to produce</v>

3182
02:14:11.851 --> 02:14:14.910
<v Speaker 1>the milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've had some issues with like the</v>

3183
02:14:14.911 --> 02:14:16.530
<v Speaker 1>baby's dying and they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

3184
02:14:16.531 --> 02:14:18.300
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're learning our goat game.</v>

3185
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:21.180
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did have to tie rubber bands around a</v>

3186
02:14:21.181 --> 02:14:24.120
<v Speaker 1>bunch of their testicles recently to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to newt or some of the males.</v>

3187
02:14:24.121 --> 02:14:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Once you get them in front of that light</v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

3188
02:14:25.651 --> 02:14:27.390
<v Speaker 1>we're training the males to be pat</v>
<v Speaker 1>goats.</v>

3189
02:14:27.410 --> 02:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Him.</v>

3190
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:30.750
<v Speaker 1>So you're killing their balls with</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber bands.</v>

3191
02:14:30.751 --> 02:14:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3192
02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It's dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

3193
02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:36.500
<v Speaker 1>very you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh they're adorable.</v>

3194
02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:39.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a little Nigerian dwarf goats</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have like little tires,</v>

3195
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:43.340
<v Speaker 1>little tires that they play on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their seeds are kids.</v>

3196
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:45.030
<v Speaker 1>My kids love it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but over each other.</v>

3197
02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:49.410
<v Speaker 1>They named him after candy bars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mnm and caramel and Milky Way and</v>

3198
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:52.740
<v Speaker 1>toffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you buy them just for pets or did</v>

3199
02:14:52.741 --> 02:14:54.990
<v Speaker 1>you buy it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot them originally for milk</v>

3200
02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:55.980
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goat milk,</v>

3201
02:14:55.981 --> 02:14:57.020
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3202
02:14:57.060 --> 02:15:00.000
<v Speaker 1>the protein is smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very thermodynamically,</v>

3203
02:15:00.030 --> 02:15:02.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compatible with the hidden by apparently</v>

3204
02:15:02.311 --> 02:15:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the only one that's better as camel milk</v>
<v Speaker 1>really was a company out of California.</v>

3205
02:15:05.971 --> 02:15:08.370
<v Speaker 1>It was sending me camels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoked in my house for awhile and</v>

3206
02:15:08.371 --> 02:15:10.500
<v Speaker 1>apparently it's super duper healthy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3207
02:15:10.501 --> 02:15:12.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the protein is smaller,</v>

3208
02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:15.420
<v Speaker 1>more absorbable and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's less hypoallergenic.</v>

3209
02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:17.400
<v Speaker 1>And friendly to your immune system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3210
02:15:17.401 --> 02:15:22.170
<v Speaker 1>when my daughter was young she could not</v>
<v Speaker 1>digest actual cow milk.</v>

3211
02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:25.260
<v Speaker 1>It just really didn't agree with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But goat milk was fine.</v>

3212
02:15:25.810 --> 02:15:27.900
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those we found an I started</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking goat milk.</v>

3213
02:15:27.930 --> 02:15:29.880
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just tastes better.</v>

3214
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:32.940
<v Speaker 1>You know what I like is the colostrum</v>
<v Speaker 1>your reuse colostrum.</v>

3215
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jamie shows basically just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing,</v>

3216
02:15:35.230 --> 02:15:38.760
<v Speaker 1>what is this goat yoga?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do yoga with goats.</v>

3217
02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:43.820
<v Speaker 1>They apparently find it relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get so big you can do a down dog</v>

3218
02:15:44.491 --> 02:15:47.380
<v Speaker 1>and he got like a cloven hooves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're under cervical.</v>

3219
02:15:48.330 --> 02:15:50.130
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really popular.</v>

3220
02:15:50.131 --> 02:15:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I would get a kick out of that.</v>

3221
02:15:53.150 --> 02:15:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Distract you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the,</v>

3222
02:15:56.220 --> 02:15:58.130
<v Speaker 1>let's let people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3223
02:15:58.170 --> 02:16:00.720
<v Speaker 1>this looks like something people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have never been on a farm would do.</v>

3224
02:16:00.721 --> 02:16:03.650
<v Speaker 1>They're like goats yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3225
02:16:03.810 --> 02:16:04.890
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3226
02:16:04.891 --> 02:16:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Like you walk out of starbucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frappuccino and they go sit with the</v>

3227
02:16:08.791 --> 02:16:09.480
<v Speaker 1>goats.</v>

3228
02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great system out there though.</v>

3229
02:16:12.721 --> 02:16:16.230
<v Speaker 1>It sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild animals out there.</v>

3230
02:16:16.690 --> 02:16:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Good set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I have an obstacle.</v>

3231
02:16:18.301 --> 02:16:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I built an obstacle course cause I do</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this obstacle course race and you</v>

3232
02:16:21.301 --> 02:16:24.120
<v Speaker 1>know what's cool is you can take all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these little little bow targets and you</v>

3233
02:16:24.121 --> 02:16:26.630
<v Speaker 1>set them up around the obstacle course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll like climbing the rope and</v>

3234
02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:30.970
<v Speaker 1>come down and then you shoot your bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then even do practice like standing</v>

3235
02:16:30.971 --> 02:16:34.450
<v Speaker 1>still though and working on your form</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing that as well.</v>

3236
02:16:34.451 --> 02:16:35.950
<v Speaker 1>We got tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3237
02:16:36.010 --> 02:16:37.090
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3238
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:39.310
<v Speaker 1>it's meditative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to have John's very</v>

3239
02:16:39.311 --> 02:16:42.550
<v Speaker 1>relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly sit down with you and go over this</v>

3240
02:16:42.551 --> 02:16:45.040
<v Speaker 1>idea cause you also trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot,</v>

3241
02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not using a surprise release.</v>

3242
02:16:48.850 --> 02:16:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took one class at my boat shop on</v>

3243
02:16:52.421 --> 02:16:55.480
<v Speaker 1>surprise release and I like it and I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3244
02:16:55.510 --> 02:16:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And frankly I feel like there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>less strain in the shoulder when you</v>

3245
02:16:59.231 --> 02:17:01.560
<v Speaker 1>pull back because for a while I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting like some of the show,</v>

3246
02:17:01.561 --> 02:17:04.300
<v Speaker 1>like some of the brachialis issues from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from pulling back.</v>

3247
02:17:04.301 --> 02:17:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how when you do a lat pull down</v>

3248
02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:10.570
<v Speaker 1>and if you grip thumbs off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used more of the latter.</v>

3249
02:17:10.690 --> 02:17:13.450
<v Speaker 1>If you grip thumbs on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use more the more the biceps and the</v>

3250
02:17:13.451 --> 02:17:14.410
<v Speaker 1>forearm muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3251
02:17:14.470 --> 02:17:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it was similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like with the,</v>

3252
02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:20.650
<v Speaker 1>with the surprise release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was using more of my back and less</v>

3253
02:17:20.651 --> 02:17:22.750
<v Speaker 1>than my forearm and biceps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's something to</v>

3254
02:17:22.751 --> 02:17:24.490
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't make any sense because</v>

3255
02:17:24.491 --> 02:17:27.370
<v Speaker 1>the draw is exactly the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only difference is to release.</v>

3256
02:17:27.710 --> 02:17:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3257
02:17:28.510 --> 02:17:31.450
<v Speaker 1>It felt a lot different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about archery is it's like</v>

3258
02:17:31.451 --> 02:17:34.360
<v Speaker 1>martial arts in that if you learn the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong way,</v>

3259
02:17:34.361 --> 02:17:36.010
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to unlearn.</v>

3260
02:17:36.550 --> 02:17:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was teaching martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was way better to get someone who is</v>

3261
02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:43.030
<v Speaker 1>open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had never had any martial arts</v>

3262
02:17:43.031 --> 02:17:47.530
<v Speaker 1>experience versus someone who had many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years in a shitty martial art</v>

3263
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:51.550
<v Speaker 1>because those people had these deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingrained pathways that were,</v>

3264
02:17:51.551 --> 02:17:55.120
<v Speaker 1>whenever the shit we get weird or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would get uncomfortable or that it gets</v>

3265
02:17:55.450 --> 02:17:57.040
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would go back to their old</v>

3266
02:17:57.041 --> 02:17:57.874
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3267
02:17:58.110 --> 02:17:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

3268
02:17:59.350 --> 02:18:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Treats.</v>

3269
02:18:01.810 --> 02:18:02.980
<v Speaker 1>It's very dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3270
02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:07.690
<v Speaker 1>there's also a series of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>instructionals that can show you,</v>

3271
02:18:07.691 --> 02:18:10.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a surprise at least is that John</v>

3272
02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Dudley's done put online and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy named Joel Turner that has this</v>

3273
02:18:14.021 --> 02:18:19.021
<v Speaker 1>whole dedicated thing to avoiding target</v>
<v Speaker 1>panic and a high pressure situations is</v>

3274
02:18:20.170 --> 02:18:22.540
<v Speaker 1>he's got a website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be called iron mind hunting,</v>

3275
02:18:22.541 --> 02:18:26.010
<v Speaker 1>but now he calls it shot Iq I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an iron mind.</v>

3276
02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:29.590
<v Speaker 1>The people to sell the captains of crush</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand grip strengtheners I think that's</v>

3277
02:18:29.591 --> 02:18:31.630
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another company.</v>

3278
02:18:31.631 --> 02:18:33.160
<v Speaker 1>But I love those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

3279
02:18:33.161 --> 02:18:36.250
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of travel with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those up 197 pounds,</v>

3280
02:18:36.490 --> 02:18:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>

3281
02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:39.400
<v Speaker 1>I think mine might be like 150 years by</v>
<v Speaker 1>about two things.</v>

3282
02:18:39.401 --> 02:18:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I travel with one of the areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3283
02:18:40.940 --> 02:18:42.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like those power lungs and then</v>

3284
02:18:42.731 --> 02:18:44.410
<v Speaker 1>you breathe in and out of to strengthen</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3285
02:18:44.411 --> 02:18:47.590
<v Speaker 1>the experts in inspiratory muscles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diaphragm and then a captains of</v>

3286
02:18:47.591 --> 02:18:48.850
<v Speaker 1>crush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if I'm on long,</v>

3287
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:51.160
<v Speaker 1>like a long road trip and I got to drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time,</v>

3288
02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I go back and forth between the hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>grip strengthener and then the lung</v>

3289
02:18:54.791 --> 02:18:56.710
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just like work out for like two</v>

3290
02:18:56.711 --> 02:18:58.820
<v Speaker 1>hours while you're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3291
02:18:58.821 --> 02:19:01.180
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing you put put on a good book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the work,</v>

3292
02:19:01.181 --> 02:19:02.230
<v Speaker 1>the grip and work the lungs.</v>

3293
02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in those grip things.</v>

3294
02:19:04.271 --> 02:19:06.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just makes your hands so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>

3295
02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And the captains of crush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they don't fuck around.</v>

3296
02:19:08.741 --> 02:19:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Those are really hard and you combine</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with the apnea so you pass out a</v>

3297
02:19:11.951 --> 02:19:15.550
<v Speaker 1>few times and a super safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe way to drive.</v>

3298
02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Just like you got to sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're blue in the face.</v>

3299
02:19:19.301 --> 02:19:21.670
<v Speaker 1>You can't even grip the steering wheel</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause your grips gun.</v>

3300
02:19:21.770 --> 02:19:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3301
02:19:23.981 --> 02:19:26.740
<v Speaker 1>but I would feel like we could probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk for about six days and you would</v>

3302
02:19:26.741 --> 02:19:28.700
<v Speaker 1>never run out of things to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fun.</v>

3334
02:20:47.571 --> 02:20:51.230
<v Speaker 1>or as much because like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movement on your head is distracting</v>

3335

<v Speaker 1>devices.</v>

3377
02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:34.070
<v Speaker 1>glass rods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3378
02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:35.240
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

3379
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human guards,</v>

3380
02:22:35.911 --> 02:22:38.130
<v Speaker 1>they went in through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through my mouth to work on my back,</v>

3381
02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:39.930
<v Speaker 1>like back through your mind going</v>
<v Speaker 1>through your mouth,</v>

3382
02:22:39.931 --> 02:22:42.600
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible] old rubber glove and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like working on the different</v>

3383
02:22:42.601 --> 02:22:44.730
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how to like if you work on like</v>

3384
02:22:44.731 --> 02:22:47.340
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your infraspinatus or your Terry's minor</v>

3385
02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:49.980
<v Speaker 1>in your shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can actually get rid of pain on the</v>

3386
02:22:49.981 --> 02:22:50.820
<v Speaker 1>front of your shoulder.</v>

3387
02:22:50.850 --> 02:22:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Like there are certain trigger points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3388
02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:54.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there are certain trigger points on</v>

3389
02:22:54.811 --> 02:22:58.890
<v Speaker 1>the head that refer to like the back or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so ass.</v>

3390
02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:01.840
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this whole idea behind Stasha</v>

3391
02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:05.250
<v Speaker 1>and trigger points and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what when you're working on one area,</v>

3392
02:23:05.251 --> 02:23:06.780
<v Speaker 1>it actually affects another area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3393
02:23:06.781 --> 02:23:11.781
<v Speaker 1>I got rolfing done a few times when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had some pretty bad back injuries and a,</v>

3394
02:23:11.941 --> 02:23:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I found that to be pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3395
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:15.510
<v Speaker 1>very painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3396
02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had any rolfing done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had it from a giant dude too.</v>

3397
02:23:20.670 --> 02:23:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever had rolfing.</v>

3398
02:23:22.411 --> 02:23:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I use a lot of those vibrating foam</v>
<v Speaker 1>rollers and vibrating deep tissue</v>

3399
02:23:25.651 --> 02:23:28.240
<v Speaker 1>devices though I'm a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big fan.</v>

3400
02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you're not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere to get deep tissue.</v>

3401
02:23:30.750 --> 02:23:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>started to begin to have a massage</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapists come to my house once a week</v>

3403
02:23:39.870 --> 02:23:42.990
<v Speaker 1>cause I think like there there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of relaxation that you</v>

3404
02:23:42.991 --> 02:23:47.010
<v Speaker 1>get when somebody else is working on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're laying down on a table and I</v>

3405
02:23:47.011 --> 02:23:51.060
<v Speaker 1>have like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this used to like a bio mat bio mat,</v>

3406
02:23:51.061 --> 02:23:52.260
<v Speaker 1>like purchase a bunch of heat.</v>

<v Speaker 1>work on me for a couple of hours.</v>

<v Speaker 1>dinner,</v>
