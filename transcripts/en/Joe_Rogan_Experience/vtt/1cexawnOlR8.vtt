35
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>not virtually actually when I say virtually because I was trying to sound smart.</v>

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>much like Squarespace,</v>

98
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of our friends have used legal zoom.</v>

99
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.270
<v Speaker 1>It's been used by a lot of our friends on it was formed through legal zoom.</v>

100
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Brian formed his death squad company through legal zoom.</v>

101
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't get a better,</v>

102
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>simpler,</v>

103
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.100
<v Speaker 1>easier way to to do law type shit that you would ordinarily have to go to a</v>

104
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>lawyers office for.</v>

105
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>You would not ordinarily,</v>

106
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to make an appointment,</v>

107
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>he'd have to go there.</v>

108
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to wait in line.</v>

109
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to,</v>

110
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you wait in line,</v>

111
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to wait to wait.</v>

112
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a line.</v>

113
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.513
<v Speaker 1>I'm exaggerating.</v>

114
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>The point is it costs a lot of fucking money to go to the lawyer,</v>

115
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but you can start a business incorporate or start an lll LLC.</v>

116
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what an ELA is,</v>

118
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>but you can start an LLC,</v>

119
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>which is like limited legal something or another.</v>

120
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>What does that stand for?</v>

121
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Limited liability company.</v>

122
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

123
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 1>and you could do that for just 99 bucks.</v>

124

131
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:20.740

210
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.623
<v Speaker 1>It's a trap,</v>

211

221
00:06:47.621 --> 00:06:52.621
<v Speaker 1>wheels or anything that we find that is that can aid human performance,</v>

222
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:56.170
<v Speaker 1>whether it's human physical performance,</v>

223
00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:57.880
<v Speaker 1>whether it's cognitive performance,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whether it aids and enhancing your mood.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So much so that there's people that are on antidepressants or their doctors tell</v>

229
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 1>them to not take five HTP cause you don't want to get too much of that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Ecstasy like?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

235
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you want to go to,</v>

236
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I guess serotonin</v>

237
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.070
<v Speaker 1>overload or something like that?</v>

238
00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:26.440
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

239
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.420

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like too much of a bat,</v>

243
00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:30.631
<v Speaker 1>a good thing.</v>

244
00:07:30.631 --> 00:07:31.464
<v Speaker 1>It's still bad.</v>

245
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.490
<v Speaker 1>That's why if guys do steroids and they get to be 350 pounds there,</v>

246
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Dick just shuts down your Dick's done too much of a good thing.</v>

247
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

248

<v Speaker 1>your liver is freaking out.</v>

249
00:07:40.801 --> 00:07:43.110
<v Speaker 1>It's got to process all the shit that you're pumping into it.</v>

250
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It's all about balance,</v>

251
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.830
<v Speaker 1>balance and uh,</v>

252
00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:50.790
<v Speaker 1>all the things that on it.</v>

253
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

254
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.441
<v Speaker 1>whether it's uh,</v>

255
00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:55.140
<v Speaker 1>the strength and conditioning equipment or the supplements I'll share that I</v>

256
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:55.501
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

257
00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:56.820
<v Speaker 1>And if we find something out there,</v>

258
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.810
<v Speaker 1>we tried to sell it.</v>

259
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.880
<v Speaker 1>We tried to sell you the best coconut oil.</v>

260
00:07:59.881 --> 00:08:01.890
<v Speaker 1>We tried to sell you the best buffalo bars,</v>

261
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.390
<v Speaker 1>best hemp seed oil from the finest hemp seed with the highest levels of protein</v>

262
00:08:06.391 --> 00:08:06.900
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

263
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.440
<v Speaker 1>We just tried to sell you the very best shit available and we sell some</v>

264
00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:11.460
<v Speaker 1>controversial things,</v>

265
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

266
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.380
<v Speaker 1>things like nootropics.</v>

267
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.041
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

268
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:14.221
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

269
00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:17.520
<v Speaker 1>we funded a double blind placebo study that we'll be able to talk more about in</v>

270
00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:18.354
<v Speaker 1>February,</v>

271
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.440
<v Speaker 1>but we were spending a lot of money to back up the existing science on</v>

272
00:08:22.441 --> 00:08:26.880
<v Speaker 1>nootropics because I know a lot of people fear that things are snake oil.</v>

273
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:27.131
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

274
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:27.281
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

275
00:08:27.281 --> 00:08:28.320
<v Speaker 1>that's a good fear.</v>

276
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.183
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

277
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's good because it forces companies who sell legitimate things to do the</v>

278
00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:36.270
<v Speaker 1>proper testing and just show you,</v>

279
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.570
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of examples of things on late night TV.</v>

280
00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>They're telling you that your Dick's going to grow or you know this.</v>

281
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just one example of things that you know are dubious and you know</v>

282
00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:48.450
<v Speaker 1>they're making money because if they weren't making money they wouldn't be</v>

283
00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:49.410
<v Speaker 1>having these commercials.</v>

284
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing that makes your Dick Rowe.</v>

285
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:53.820
<v Speaker 1>If they did on it would have it on the God damn front page.</v>

286
00:08:53.821 --> 00:08:54.990
<v Speaker 1>We'd have Dick Rowe pills,</v>

287
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.411
<v Speaker 1>weed,</v>

288

<v Speaker 1>we'll have it,</v>

302
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 1>but until now we're just trying to sell you this stuff that does work.</v>

303
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Because of the controversy.</v>

304

306
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 1>on things like new mood or Alpha brain.</v>

307
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 1>There is a 90 pill,</v>

308
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:20.761
<v Speaker 1>30 day,</v>

<v Speaker 1>coffin here,</v>

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a 30 pill,</v>

315
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:29.754
<v Speaker 1>90 day.</v>

316
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>So the first 30 pills,</v>

317
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>you have a 90 day 100% money back guarantee and you don't even have to return</v>

318
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:37.884
<v Speaker 1>the product.</v>

319
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to send it back in.</v>

320
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

321
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>you use what you just said.</v>

322
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:41.814
<v Speaker 1>This stuff's socks.</v>

323
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.683
<v Speaker 1>You get your money back.</v>

324
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>The what we're trying to do is sell you something that is so good that you don't</v>

325
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>have that temptation.</v>

326
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Speaker 1>And if you honestly do try Alpha brain and you say it didn't do anything for</v>

327
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:53.034
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

328
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I want you to have your money back.</v>

329
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that's good.</v>

330
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.191
<v Speaker 1>Don't buy it.</v>

331
00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

332
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.121
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

333
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 1>don't buy it anymore.</v>

334
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.351
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

335
00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's just not for you,</v>

336
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.990
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

337
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

338
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody to feel ripped off.</v>

339
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 1>We're so confident that what we're selling is effective and works for us.</v>

340
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.420
<v Speaker 1>That we're willing to have such a,</v>

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

382
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.470
<v Speaker 1>A week later we're sitting in front of each other and want to talk about bitcoin</v>

383
00:11:15.471 --> 00:11:15.821
<v Speaker 1>in a million.</v>

384
00:11:15.821 --> 00:11:16.720
<v Speaker 1>People are going to hear about it.</v>

385
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

386
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.930
<v Speaker 1>does the Internet is fucking beautiful.</v>

387
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.130
<v Speaker 1>It's magic.</v>

388
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>

389
00:11:22.001 --> 00:11:23.530
<v Speaker 1>it is what it should have.</v>

390
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.490
<v Speaker 1>The would communication with human beings should have been a long time ago.</v>

391
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it would have all the things that took off and gained ground and gain</v>

392
00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:34.990
<v Speaker 1>momentum throughout human history,</v>

393
00:11:34.991 --> 00:11:38.560
<v Speaker 1>whether it's religion or whether it's colt rituals,</v>

394
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.420
<v Speaker 1>ritualistic behavior like the,</v>

395
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.840
<v Speaker 1>all that shit wouldn't have happened if the Internet was around.</v>

396
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.400
<v Speaker 1>The Internet would have went under Dah,</v>

397
00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:45.491
<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>

398
00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:45.641
<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>

399
00:11:45.641 --> 00:11:45.761
<v Speaker 1>Dah.</v>

400
00:11:45.761 --> 00:11:46.271
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>

401
00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:46.840
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

402
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.291
<v Speaker 1>why does it,</v>

403
00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:47.950
<v Speaker 1>does it stop?</v>

404
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:48.640
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying?</v>

405
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.473
<v Speaker 1>Look right here.</v>

406
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

407
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.683
<v Speaker 1>here's the studies.</v>

408
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.720
<v Speaker 1>There's so much misconception and so disinformation that human beings have been</v>

409
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>fed throughout history.</v>

410
00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I think we're just now starting to grasp how huge it is that this is the first</v>

411
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:06.091
<v Speaker 1>time in history where information just flows just back and forth and the most</v>

412
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 1>valuable stuff is free.</v>

413
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.070
<v Speaker 1>The most valuable information that you can get online,</v>

414
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>absolutely free,</v>

415
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.900
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

416
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.620
<v Speaker 2>you know what's the best thing about the internet is that it's a dumb network.</v>

417
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.360
<v Speaker 2>It transmits information from point a to point B and it doesn't care what that</v>

418
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:23.194
<v Speaker 2>information is.</v>

419
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 2>So if you come up with a new idea,</v>

420
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 2>a new application,</v>

421
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 2>and you stick it on the edge of the network,</v>

422
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 2>you can transmit that information to anybody else.</v>

423
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.640
<v Speaker 2>And there's a cellist principle behind it,</v>

424
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.700
<v Speaker 2>net neutrality that you don't prioritize your content instead of somebody</v>

425
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:37.534
<v Speaker 2>else's,</v>

426
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 2>you allow equal access to all for all contents.</v>

427
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 2>And the Internet doesn't care.</v>

428
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:42.761
<v Speaker 2>It's just Ip.</v>

429
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 2>All that seizes bites and it just moves them.</v>

430
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.500
<v Speaker 2>And then one day somebody invented a new application and stuck it on the edge,</v>

431
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 2>the Internet of money.</v>

432
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.400
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm here to talk about today because they didn't need to ask</v>

433
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 2>anybody permission.</v>

434
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.480
<v Speaker 2>And they launched bitcoin and it happened.</v>

435
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.340
<v Speaker 2>And now that it's here,</v>

436
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 2>it's enabling other people to launch money applications on the Internet and it's</v>

437
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:08.350
<v Speaker 2>going to fuel the Internet even faster than we've seen before.</v>

438
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:09.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

439
00:13:09.231 --> 00:13:10.850
<v Speaker 1>this is a very strange time,</v>

440
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

441
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:11.631
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

442
00:13:11.631 --> 00:13:15.830
<v Speaker 1>in that there's actually people that are just starting to accept bitcoin.</v>

443
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.560
<v Speaker 1>One of the first crypto currencies for,</v>

444
00:13:18.561 --> 00:13:23.270
<v Speaker 1>for solid objects like tiger direct is starting to accept bitcoin.</v>

445
00:13:23.271 --> 00:13:24.230
<v Speaker 1>For computers.</v>

446
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.830
<v Speaker 1>You can order a computer on tiger direct from fucking bitcoins.</v>

447
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.730
<v Speaker 1>And I'll send you a God damn actual computer that you can get online with that</v>

448
00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 1>starts becoming real</v>

449
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.230
<v Speaker 2>well tiger direct can very simply take that bit coin and immediately converted</v>

450
00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:42.231
<v Speaker 2>into dollars so they don't even have any exchange risk and other people are</v>

451
00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:45.060
<v Speaker 2>willing to give them dollars for it because they see it as valuable.</v>

452
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.830
<v Speaker 2>And that's all money is.</v>

453
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a shared understanding that this thing has value because it's scarce that</v>

454
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not around a lot.</v>

455
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.290
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to make.</v>

456
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.580
<v Speaker 2>You can't copy it,</v>

457
00:13:56.581 --> 00:13:57.540
<v Speaker 2>you can't fake it.</v>

458
00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.550
<v Speaker 2>And once you have those three things,</v>

459
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.533
<v Speaker 2>you have money.</v>

460
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

461
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.773
<v Speaker 2>then it has value.</v>

462
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Plain those.</v>

463
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.650
<v Speaker 1>How is it possible?</v>

464
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:04.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

465
00:14:04.891 --> 00:14:09.720
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is bitcoin for people that are completely on the outside on this</v>

466
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.520
<v Speaker 1>and they listen to this podcast and I'm like,</v>

467
00:14:11.521 --> 00:14:12.870
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is he talking about?</v>

468
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.681
<v Speaker 1>New Money,</v>

469
00:14:13.681 --> 00:14:14.310
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin.</v>

470
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.730
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

471
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.110
<v Speaker 1>what is a bitcoin?</v>

472
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.850
<v Speaker 2>So there's layers to this.</v>

473
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I'll start at the top layer at the top.</v>

474
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:21.281
<v Speaker 2>Player.</v>

475
00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:26.281
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin is cash on the intranet and I say cash because it's not just any kind of</v>

476
00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:27.431
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

477
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not like an account or credit card.</v>

478
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:30.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not like paypal.</v>

479
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.481
<v Speaker 2>This is cash,</v>

480
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:32.830
<v Speaker 2>which means that when you have it,</v>

481
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 2>you have it sitting on your computer as digital cash.</v>

482
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 2>And then when you send it,</v>

483
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.630
<v Speaker 2>it goes directly from your computer to the recipients wallet as digital cash.</v>

484
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Now that's the top layer underneath.</v>

485
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 2>This is basically a shared ledger.</v>

486
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 2>That means that everyone can see all of the transactions and the whole network</v>

487
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 2>agrees that Andrea sent Joe,</v>

488
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

489
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 2>a 10th of a bitcoin.</v>

490
00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

491
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Now the whole network knows it.</v>

492
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 2>So that means Joel has a 10th of a bitcoin and simply based on that,</v>

493
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 2>you can move money around.</v>

494
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

495
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.340
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of security in some complex math,</v>

496
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.130
<v Speaker 2>but basically bitcoin is a standard.</v>

497
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 2>It's an agreement on how to exchange money on the Internet,</v>

498
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:15.680
<v Speaker 2>just like the web is a standard on how to create pages and view them in a</v>

499
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:16.514
<v Speaker 2>browser.</v>

500
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.980
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of skepticism when it comes to bitcoin.</v>

501
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

502
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:21.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

503
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I've spoken to people that are financial wizards that are skeptical and I've</v>

504
00:15:27.401 --> 00:15:29.320
<v Speaker 1>spoken to people that are just,</v>

505
00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

506
00:15:30.311 --> 00:15:33.970
<v Speaker 1>the that have just looked into cryptocurrencies because of the rise of the</v>

507
00:15:33.971 --> 00:15:35.260
<v Speaker 1>popularity of bitcoin.</v>

508
00:15:35.261 --> 00:15:35.521
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

509
00:15:35.521 --> 00:15:36.460
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't make sense.</v>

510
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.620
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for inflation.</v>

511
00:15:38.621 --> 00:15:40.060
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough people,</v>

512
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 1>not enough bitcoins does it?</v>

513
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:43.234
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to work.</v>

514
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.500
<v Speaker 1>How are they going to create more?</v>

515
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.510
<v Speaker 1>There's all these different arguments about why do you think that what we're</v>

516
00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:54.511
<v Speaker 1>seeing with the rise of bitcoin is instead of just addressing all these</v>

517
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.500
<v Speaker 1>financial concerns and all these people that are used to the current market and</v>

518
00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:01.300
<v Speaker 1>the place that it's at right now,</v>

519
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.271
<v Speaker 1>the the the,</v>

520
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:06.250
<v Speaker 1>the standards that the way they run things instead of that bitcoin just creates</v>

521
00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:11.251
<v Speaker 1>a completely new network driven community driven money and says fuck all your</v>

522
00:16:12.851 --> 00:16:13.430
<v Speaker 1>old rule.</v>

523
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.840
<v Speaker 2>It's social network of funny.</v>

524
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>It's peer to peer money.</v>

525
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 2>It means to wrecked from one individual to another individual no matter where</v>

526
00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:24.461
<v Speaker 2>they are on the world in seconds for almost free and that has never happened</v>

527
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:24.960
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

528
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that part of the skepticism though is because of the fact this</v>

529
00:16:27.631 --> 00:16:28.950
<v Speaker 1>other system exists?</v>

530
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

531
00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And that this other system is our norm,</v>

532
00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:31.644
<v Speaker 1>our standard.</v>

533
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.580
<v Speaker 1>And we don't want to look at like something like bitcoin objectively just say,</v>

534
00:16:35.581 --> 00:16:35.881
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

535
00:16:35.881 --> 00:16:38.790
<v Speaker 1>let's pretend that our current system of stocks and bonds,</v>

536
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:39.843
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just,</v>

537
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.301
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

538
00:16:40.301 --> 00:16:41.560
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just the system.</v>

539
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.620
<v Speaker 2>It's so much part of our culture.</v>

540
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Money is one of the first technologies,</v>

541
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:47.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:49.420
<v Speaker 2>fire wheel money.</v>

543
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Money has existed for tens of thousands of years,</v>

544
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.520
<v Speaker 2>going back to shells and feathers and knots on string and giant rocks in the</v>

545
00:16:57.521 --> 00:17:02.521
<v Speaker 2>Polynesian islands and then through the Iron Age to minted coins stamped with</v>

546
00:17:02.891 --> 00:17:03.940
<v Speaker 2>emperors faces.</v>

547
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.450
<v Speaker 2>This stuff has been part of our culture for tens of thousands of years.</v>

548
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.561
<v Speaker 2>And as a result,</v>

549
00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:10.300
<v Speaker 2>it's no longer just technology.</v>

550
00:17:10.301 --> 00:17:14.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a cultural phenomenon and you are steeped in it from the moment you're</v>

551
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.943
<v Speaker 2>born.</v>

552
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.540
<v Speaker 2>And so you acquire certain notions of what money is and how it works.</v>

553
00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:23.620
<v Speaker 2>And you think that the current system by which money works is the only system</v>

554
00:17:23.621 --> 00:17:25.990
<v Speaker 2>because we've had it for thousands of years.</v>

555
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.120
<v Speaker 2>And even in computer science,</v>

556
00:17:28.121 --> 00:17:32.590
<v Speaker 2>the idea of getting distributed computers to agree on something without</v>

557
00:17:32.591 --> 00:17:33.370
<v Speaker 2>cheating,</v>

558
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:38.260
<v Speaker 2>we thought that problem couldn't be solved until 2008 when the invention behind</v>

559
00:17:38.261 --> 00:17:41.620
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin solve that problem and created a new way of doing money.</v>

560
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.990
<v Speaker 2>And it's going to take a lot of time to understand it.</v>

561
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Primarily because people don't really understand money as it is today.</v>

562
00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:48.850
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand how banks work.</v>

563
00:17:48.851 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 2>They understand how the Federal Reserve creates money.</v>

564
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand a debt based system for money.</v>

565
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.291
<v Speaker 2>I've read about it.</v>

566
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:56.124
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it.</v>

567
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

568
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.190
<v Speaker 2>I read,</v>

569
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I read many things.</v>

570
00:17:58.101 --> 00:17:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I've watched documentaries understand it.</v>

571
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Most of the people when they first face bitcoin,</v>

572
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.850
<v Speaker 2>they start asking questions about money and it quickly becomes apparent to all</v>

573
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 2>of us when we do this,</v>

574
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:08.390
<v Speaker 2>that we don't know much about money.</v>

575
00:18:08.391 --> 00:18:10.620
<v Speaker 2>So then we learned about money and we start reading about money.</v>

576
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.930
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

577
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

578
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:12.601
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

579
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:15.990
<v Speaker 2>it's very much part of the culture to the point where I'll talk to people about</v>

580
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:16.980
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin and they'll say,</v>

581
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:17.191
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

582
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:18.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not backed by gold.</v>

583
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 2>So how can it have value?</v>

584
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.400
<v Speaker 2>The dollar hasn't been backed by gold for like 60 years in,</v>

585
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.630
<v Speaker 2>and you talk to the average person in the streets and they still think there's</v>

586
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 2>some gold in a vault and that stuff does it.</v>

587
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.481
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exist.</v>

588
00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:32.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm happen to all the gold in the vault watches.</v>

589
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:33.301
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

590
00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other question.</v>

591
00:18:34.801 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

592
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 2>the real issue is this heath,</v>

593
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.600
<v Speaker 2>we haven't been on a gold standard for decades and all of the currencies in the</v>

594
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:45.870
<v Speaker 2>world are created based on the productive capacity of the country and the legal</v>

595
00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:46.231
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

596
00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:47.760
<v Speaker 2>and because they have value,</v>

597
00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:52.410
<v Speaker 2>because you pay your taxes with them and then they just float freely in exchange</v>

598
00:18:52.411 --> 00:18:52.681
<v Speaker 2>rates.</v>

599
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 2>So they very against each other in the,</v>

600
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.700
<v Speaker 2>because the dollar is used to buy oil,</v>

601
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:59.280
<v Speaker 2>it's the world reserve currency and all the other currencies are measured</v>

602
00:18:59.281 --> 00:18:59.731
<v Speaker 2>against that,</v>

603
00:18:59.731 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 2>but there is no gold and that's fine.</v>

604
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:03.930
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean it doesn't have value.</v>

605
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:04.764
<v Speaker 2>It absolutely has.</v>

606
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.040
<v Speaker 1>That fucks up a lot of old action movies,</v>

607
00:19:07.041 --> 00:19:07.730
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

608
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

609
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.110
<v Speaker 1>it really does.</v>

610
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Those movies where you would break into the vault.</v>

611
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

612
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.383
<v Speaker 1>Lone Ranger.</v>

613
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.930
<v Speaker 1>The bars of gold there would always be brick shaped.</v>

614
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Well the thing is gold isn't that efficient for building a currency on because</v>

615
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Speaker 2>the rates of which you can produce gold,</v>

616
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

617
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 2>is his face.</v>

618
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Then it's hoarded and you know,</v>

619
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:26.880
<v Speaker 2>you have certain problems.</v>

620
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Now the Nice thing about bitcoin is that it takes,</v>

621
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

622
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.040
<v Speaker 2>it takes the same concept of scarcity a,</v>

623
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.610
<v Speaker 2>of having something that is a limited resource,</v>

624
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.530
<v Speaker 2>but it does it by algorithm.</v>

625
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.210
<v Speaker 2>So you essentially have math that says that every 10 minutes,</v>

626
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:47.211
<v Speaker 2>25 new bitcoin is created by the network as a whole with all of the computing</v>

627
00:19:47.251 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 2>capacity of the network.</v>

628
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's fixed.</v>

629
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.360
<v Speaker 2>And every four years we create half as much every 10 minutes.</v>

630
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:57.360
<v Speaker 2>So in four years it goes down to 12 and a half bitcoin every 10 minutes.</v>

631
00:19:57.361 --> 00:20:00.300
<v Speaker 2>And then it goes down to six and a quarter and it keeps going down until you</v>

632
00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:01.480
<v Speaker 2>meant the last bit coin.</v>

633
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.080
<v Speaker 2>And then you're done 21 million coins.</v>

634
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>

635
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.830
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that you provide a sound basis for money.</v>

636
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Something that is rare,</v>

637
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.200
<v Speaker 2>cannot be forged,</v>

638
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.730
<v Speaker 2>is easily transportable.</v>

639
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.560
<v Speaker 2>And that is the form of currency.</v>

640
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.700
<v Speaker 1>So 21 million bitcoins and then it's over.</v>

641
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:17.390
<v Speaker 1>They will,</v>

642
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

643
00:20:17.631 --> 00:20:18.290
<v Speaker 1>there's our,</v>

644
00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.360
<v Speaker 2>you can divide a Bitcoin,</v>

645
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.660
<v Speaker 2>100 million pieces,</v>

646
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.120
<v Speaker 2>so it goes down to eight digits.</v>

647
00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:25.940
<v Speaker 2>And that means the lowest units is called a Satoshi.</v>

648
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.070
<v Speaker 2>And there's 100 million satoshis in a bitcoin.</v>

649
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.740
<v Speaker 2>So 21 million times 100 million,</v>

650
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.780
<v Speaker 2>21 quadrillion coins,</v>

651
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:33.703
<v Speaker 2>plenty coins.</v>

652
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.031
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

653
00:20:35.031 --> 00:20:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Why am,</v>

654
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.710
<v Speaker 1>why is that so complicated?</v>

655
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Why is it like 100 million?</v>

656
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

657
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.320
<v Speaker 2>well I think part of the reason is that it's easier to write a number without a</v>

658
00:20:45.781 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 2>decimal points and just to write a smaller units with lots of Zeros after it.</v>

659
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

660
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.970
<v Speaker 2>it's easier in computer terms,</v>

661
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:53.080
<v Speaker 2>the handle numbers that way,</v>

662
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:53.800
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

663
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.760
<v Speaker 2>but most importantly,</v>

664
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:57.980
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter because what you see on your screen at today might be a bit</v>

665
00:20:57.981 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 2>coin.</v>

666
00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:58.901
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

667
00:20:58.901 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 2>on my wallets,</v>

668
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.780
<v Speaker 2>I use Millie bet coins,</v>

669
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.260
<v Speaker 2>thousands of a bitcoin because of corresponds more to my daily purchases.</v>

670
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:05.921
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

671
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:09.220
<v Speaker 2>maybe a few years from now you're going to be using a millions of a bitcoin to</v>

672
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Speaker 2>look at your balance.</v>

673
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what you call a unit.</v>

674
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.001
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

675
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:16.780
<v Speaker 2>the point is what value does it have because someone else is willing to give you</v>

676
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.130
<v Speaker 2>that amount of money.</v>

677
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

678
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.150
<v Speaker 1>but we have like sort of this established ideal in our hand,</v>

679
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 1>what a dollar is worth.</v>

680
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.300
<v Speaker 1>This is a $100 that looks like a thousand dollar computer.</v>

681
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

682
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:25.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

683
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.440
<v Speaker 1>we have this idea in our head and that idea will be completely out the window.</v>

684
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 1>And you started talking about millions of bitcoins and trying to like figure out</v>

685
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:35.620
<v Speaker 1>like how much is a laptop from tiger dot.</v>

686
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 1>If I buy a laptop,</v>

687
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.460
<v Speaker 1>is that 200 millions of a bitcoin?</v>

688
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:39.731
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

689
00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:39.881
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

690
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:42.860
<v Speaker 2>we just talk in millibits and millibit is almost about a dollars.</v>

691
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.620
<v Speaker 2>It's about 800 something today.</v>

692
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

693
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

694
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.151
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

695
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:46.631
<v Speaker 2>middle of bed.</v>

696
00:21:46.631 --> 00:21:48.940
<v Speaker 2>So a computer with cost you about 1200 millivolts,</v>

697
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.970
<v Speaker 1>1200 megabits.</v>

698
00:21:49.971 --> 00:21:50.241
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

699
00:21:50.241 --> 00:21:55.241
<v Speaker 1>that seems normal as long as we can get it down to numbers that like correspond</v>

700
00:21:55.431 --> 00:21:56.270
<v Speaker 1>with dollars.</v>

701
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:57.223
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>

702
00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:57.920
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I mean?</v>

703
00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.650
<v Speaker 1>This is a global</v>

704
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.050
<v Speaker 2>bull phenomenon and there are so many countries out there whether currency,</v>

705
00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:06.040
<v Speaker 2>very 30% a year and some now for 30% a month.</v>

706
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:10.420
<v Speaker 2>And in those countries there is no stable anything and even the dollar,</v>

707
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.420
<v Speaker 2>we look at it today and we have this idea of what its value is,</v>

708
00:22:13.421 --> 00:22:17.980
<v Speaker 2>but if you look back historically it's value has been declining for almost a</v>

709
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.850
<v Speaker 2>century now and today's dollar is worth the same as you know,</v>

710
00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:24.700
<v Speaker 2>13 cents at the beginning of the previous century.</v>

711
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.050
<v Speaker 2>We don't see that on a day to day base because it's one of the most stable</v>

712
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:29.741
<v Speaker 2>currencies,</v>

713
00:22:29.741 --> 00:22:34.300
<v Speaker 2>but there's 193 currencies out there and 180 of them are far,</v>

714
00:22:34.301 --> 00:22:36.550
<v Speaker 2>far worse than the dollar in terms of management.</v>

715
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.430
<v Speaker 2>And a couple of handful of them absolutely horrible.</v>

716
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:43.000
<v Speaker 2>And the people trapped in these countries can now use bitcoin.</v>

717
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 2>So this is a lot broader than just the U s dollar.</v>

718
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a matter of is this going to be comfy for consumers?</v>

719
00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 2>This can bring people from countries that have extreme poverty,</v>

720
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:55.030
<v Speaker 2>extreme problems,</v>

721
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.270
<v Speaker 2>that are not necessarily based on a lack of technology,</v>

722
00:22:58.271 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 2>that have phones,</v>

723
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:01.270
<v Speaker 2>that can use bitcoin for example.</v>

724
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.030
<v Speaker 2>But because of politics that trapped in this situation recently,</v>

725
00:23:04.031 --> 00:23:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I was in Argentina in Buenos Iris and now they're having an even worst currency</v>

726
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:08.944
<v Speaker 2>crisis.</v>

727
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

728
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.650
<v Speaker 2>they devalued 18% last week,</v>

729
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.281
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

730
00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:13.540
<v Speaker 2>locked that lockdown.</v>

731
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.160
<v Speaker 2>They can't take money out of the country.</v>

732
00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:17.050
<v Speaker 2>They can't buy things online.</v>

733
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.400
<v Speaker 2>If they buy something online,</v>

734
00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:21.790
<v Speaker 2>they have to go pick it up from a customs office and pay 50% tax on it.</v>

735
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:22.451
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

736
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:24.430
<v Speaker 2>the countries trying to lock in the money,</v>

737
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:25.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

738
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.680
<v Speaker 2>And you have these extreme situations and then you have a choice suddenly.</v>

739
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.020
<v Speaker 2>So bitcoin is a lot bigger than just,</v>

740
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

741
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 2>a consumer thing for here in the u s</v>

742
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 1>how would someone get bitcoins from those environments?</v>

743
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

744
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.800
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you're in some poor third world country with a really incredibly</v>

745
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.620
<v Speaker 1>corrupt system and fucked up economy.</v>

746
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 1>How someone from</v>

747
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.820
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

748
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Speaker 4>that environment get a bitcoin?</v>

749
00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

750
00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.020
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

751
00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.853
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

752
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.660
<v Speaker 2>even in Argentina for example,</v>

753
00:23:52.661 --> 00:23:53.680
<v Speaker 2>which is not,</v>

754
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:54.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

755
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

756
00:23:54.581 --> 00:23:57.130
<v Speaker 2>this a second world country that was once the,</v>

757
00:23:57.131 --> 00:23:57.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

758
00:23:57.341 --> 00:24:00.190
<v Speaker 2>the Paris of Latin America and it's still a beautiful place.</v>

759
00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

760
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.190
<v Speaker 2>but it has these difficult political problems.</v>

761
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.510
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal to trade on the black market dollars for pesos,</v>

762
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:08.021
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

763
00:24:08.021 --> 00:24:10.150
<v Speaker 2>So you can't go in and if you're a tourist and say,</v>

764
00:24:10.151 --> 00:24:10.361
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

765
00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to give some dude on the street to hundred,</v>

766
00:24:12.281 --> 00:24:13.114
<v Speaker 2>that's illegal.</v>

767
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.890
<v Speaker 2>And yet on every street corner,</v>

768
00:24:14.891 --> 00:24:16.420
<v Speaker 2>the someone who will sell you pesos.</v>

769
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.550
<v Speaker 2>And last time I went to,</v>

770
00:24:17.551 --> 00:24:18.191
<v Speaker 2>I just asked them,</v>

771
00:24:18.191 --> 00:24:19.120
<v Speaker 2>will you take bitcoin?</v>

772
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.343
<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>

773
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Some of them said,</v>

774
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.271
<v Speaker 2>never heard of it.</v>

775
00:24:22.271 --> 00:24:23.170
<v Speaker 2>And some of them said,</v>

776
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:23.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

777
00:24:23.591 --> 00:24:24.610
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to do that now.</v>

778
00:24:24.611 --> 00:24:25.444
<v Speaker 2>Can you help us?</v>

779
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

780
00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:31.030
<v Speaker 2>So suddenly you have Jordi have this black market or gray market for currencies.</v>

781
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.580
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

782
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.400
<v Speaker 2>and in the u s you never see this,</v>

783
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:34.750
<v Speaker 2>but if you travel abroad,</v>

784
00:24:34.751 --> 00:24:35.950
<v Speaker 2>you see this all the time.</v>

785
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Most places in the world,</v>

786
00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.080
<v Speaker 2>the official currency rate versus the one you can get from a corner.</v>

787
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:41.621
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

788
00:24:41.621 --> 00:24:41.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

789
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:43.390
<v Speaker 2>a street sale seller who is,</v>

790
00:24:43.391 --> 00:24:43.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

791
00:24:43.601 --> 00:24:47.710
<v Speaker 2>selling vegetables and the local currency for dollars.</v>

792
00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:48.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

793
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.890
<v Speaker 2>you can do that to ever in so many countries in the world.</v>

794
00:24:50.891 --> 00:24:52.150
<v Speaker 2>And for them it's a normal thing.</v>

795
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.920
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

796
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.550
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

797
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.670
<v Speaker 4>this novel idea of this new currency,</v>

798
00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:00.720
<v Speaker 4>is this something that anyone right now is Lik living off of?</v>

799
00:25:00.721 --> 00:25:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Is anybody getting paid by bitcoin and paying their rent by bitcoin buying their</v>

800
00:25:05.191 --> 00:25:06.390
<v Speaker 4>food with bitcoin?</v>

801
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.701
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>

802
00:25:07.701 --> 00:25:08.660
<v Speaker 2>my income is entirely,</v>

803
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.700
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin has been for several months now.</v>

804
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.653
<v Speaker 2>How many months?</v>

805
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

806
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.210
<v Speaker 2>since October perhaps.</v>

807
00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 2>And before that I just didn't have as much income because I've been working on</v>

808
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin,</v>

809
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

810
00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:21.880
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

811
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.240
<v Speaker 2>to a level almost obsession because it's such a fascinating technology for me.</v>

812
00:25:26.241 --> 00:25:29.000
<v Speaker 2>And as someone who works in security and distributed systems,</v>

813
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:29.580
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

814
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

815
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:34.430
<v Speaker 2>a once in a lifetime opportunity to be involved in something monumental.</v>

816
00:25:34.431 --> 00:25:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Just like when I was involved in the early days of the Internet as,</v>

817
00:25:37.951 --> 00:25:38.151
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

818
00:25:38.151 --> 00:25:42.710
<v Speaker 2>as a young scientist and now I can do it again with bitcoin.</v>

819
00:25:42.711 --> 00:25:43.730
<v Speaker 2>So I've been obsessed,</v>

820
00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:48.350
<v Speaker 2>but since October I've also been making a living off bitcoin and I get paid in</v>

821
00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:48.910
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>

822
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:49.450
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

823
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:50.530
<v Speaker 4>And how do you pay your rent?</v>

824
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I convert some of it to dollars to pay my landlord until I can persuade them to</v>

825
00:25:54.061 --> 00:25:54.990
<v Speaker 2>take bitcoin directly.</v>

826
00:25:54.991 --> 00:25:58.620
<v Speaker 2>But it won't take that long because every time I pay in dollars I say,</v>

827
00:25:58.621 --> 00:25:59.880
<v Speaker 2>would you rather take bitcoin?</v>

828
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the easiest ways to get bitcoin by the ways.</v>

829
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.250
<v Speaker 2>So find someone who wants to pay for something with bitcoin.</v>

830
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.100
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

831
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.470
<v Speaker 4>And so they're not ready to yet,</v>

832
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.020
<v Speaker 4>but you think that perhaps they're thinking about it.</v>

833
00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:13.060
<v Speaker 4>I might be able to pay your rent in bitcoin.</v>

834
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:13.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>

835
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.970
<v Speaker 2>always surprised by WHO's going to take my bitcoin.</v>

836
00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's a taxi driver in Germany.</v>

837
00:26:19.241 --> 00:26:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you know it's a,</v>

838
00:26:21.731 --> 00:26:24.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a give it to them that they install an app on their phone.</v>

839
00:26:24.851 --> 00:26:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you some before the end of the show for sure.</v>

840
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.710
<v Speaker 2>They installed an APP on their phone and I just zap it across just like I could</v>

841
00:26:29.711 --> 00:26:32.050
<v Speaker 2>zap it from hair to Kuala Lumpur in two seconds.</v>

842
00:26:32.051 --> 00:26:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I can stop it across the table.</v>

843
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

844
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.500
<v Speaker 2>It's just like sending an email and,</v>

845
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:37.363
<v Speaker 2>and in fact it's,</v>

846
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.530
<v Speaker 2>it's remarkably similar.</v>

847
00:26:38.531 --> 00:26:39.011
<v Speaker 2>I just get,</v>

848
00:26:39.011 --> 00:26:42.220
<v Speaker 2>you'll install an app and then you'll give me your bitcoin address,</v>

849
00:26:42.221 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>which is like your email kinda.</v>

850
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll zap some bitcoin across the u and few seconds later you'll see it</v>

851
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:49.110
<v Speaker 2>pop up on your phone.</v>

852
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 2>And that is real bitcoin.</v>

853
00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.090
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

854
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.110
<v Speaker 2>and it's on your phone.</v>

855
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not sitting in a bank somewhere.</v>

856
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.210
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the promise that maybe when you try to withdraw it,</v>

857
00:26:56.211 --> 00:26:57.044
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have it.</v>

858
00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.133
<v Speaker 2>This isn't,</v>

859
00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:58.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

860
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:00.180
<v Speaker 2>a credit or something like that.</v>

861
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:05.420
<v Speaker 2>This is the actual digital amount is locked by a key that's on your phone and is</v>

862
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:08.580
<v Speaker 2>recognized by the entire network is a valid transaction.</v>

863
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.920
<v Speaker 2>If you left your phone behind in a drunken stupor,</v>

864
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 2>someone got ahold of your phone,</v>

865
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:13.800
<v Speaker 2>could they wreck you financially?</v>

866
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

867
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:15.463
<v Speaker 2>Dammit.</v>

868
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Say No.</v>

869
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.160
<v Speaker 2>So No,</v>

870
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.993
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be,</v>

871
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be 100% honest.</v>

872
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

873
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to protect yourself.</v>

874
00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:22.561
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

875
00:27:22.561 --> 00:27:23.161
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

876
00:27:23.161 --> 00:27:23.641
<v Speaker 2>on mine,</v>

877
00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 2>phone wallet,</v>

878
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.030
<v Speaker 2>first of all it has my phone has a pin.</v>

879
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Then my wallet has a pin of its own.</v>

880
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.250
<v Speaker 2>And then there's one thing that I can't do with a wallet right away,</v>

881
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:33.630
<v Speaker 2>which is I can't send money.</v>

882
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.680
<v Speaker 2>I can look at my balance,</v>

883
00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:35.341
<v Speaker 2>I can receive money,</v>

884
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 2>all of that just with a pin.</v>

885
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.960
<v Speaker 2>But if I want to send money and have to enter another password or pin personal</v>

886
00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 2>identification numbers.</v>

887
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

888
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Speaker 2>So I've got a couple of different passwords so that my wallet isn't just sitting</v>

889
00:27:44.731 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

890
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

891
00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:46.801
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

892
00:27:46.801 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 2>this is digital cash.</v>

893
00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:51.390
<v Speaker 2>So if you had a wallet stuffed with cash and you left isn't a cafe,</v>

894
00:27:51.391 --> 00:27:52.350
<v Speaker 2>what happens to it?</v>

895
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Somebody steals it or you get really lucky.</v>

896
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 2>And so when he gives it back to you.</v>

897
00:27:55.711 --> 00:27:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

898
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:56.541
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

899
00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:57.374
<v Speaker 2>I'm some of that money.</v>

900
00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

901
00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:58.913
<v Speaker 2>But most likely,</v>

902
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

903
00:27:59.341 --> 00:28:01.140
<v Speaker 2>you don't have someone to call and say,</v>

904
00:28:01.141 --> 00:28:01.974
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

905
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.150
<v Speaker 2>get that cash back for me.</v>

906
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:04.680
<v Speaker 2>It was stolen from so-and-so location.</v>

907
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:05.760
<v Speaker 2>It's gone back up.</v>

908
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:06.271
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

909
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:07.200
<v Speaker 2>you lose your phone.</v>

910
00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Can you back up from,</v>

911
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.293
<v Speaker 2>from a cloud.</v>

912
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:09.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

913
00:28:09.511 --> 00:28:12.930
<v Speaker 2>that's the nice thing about it because unlike physical money,</v>

914
00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:13.800
<v Speaker 2>this is digital money.</v>

915
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:14.760
<v Speaker 2>You can make copies of it.</v>

916
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.050
<v Speaker 2>You can't spend both copies,</v>

917
00:28:16.051 --> 00:28:17.010
<v Speaker 2>you can only spend one,</v>

918
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.290
<v Speaker 2>but you can make copies so you can make backups.</v>

919
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:21.840
<v Speaker 2>You can even back up right onto a piece of paper,</v>

920
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.150
<v Speaker 2>which is what I do in this called a paper wallet.</v>

921
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.400
<v Speaker 2>So I have printed pieces of paper with Bitcoin keys on them and I make two</v>

922
00:28:29.401 --> 00:28:34.320
<v Speaker 2>copies and I put one in a safe and I put the other in a safety deposit box and I</v>

923
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:36.060
<v Speaker 2>send bitcoin to those wallets.</v>

924
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.840
<v Speaker 2>And then I basically have my bitcoin sitting on paper in a bank.</v>

925
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:42.930
<v Speaker 2>What kind of like a bearer bond?</v>

926
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like a bearer bonds,</v>

927
00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:44.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

928
00:28:44.611 --> 00:28:46.020
<v Speaker 2>or like a stock certificate.</v>

929
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.610
<v Speaker 2>But the only differences that that magic number that's on there allows me to</v>

930
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:52.530
<v Speaker 2>redeem that bitcoin anywhere in the world.</v>

931
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.630
<v Speaker 2>This is way more sophisticated than I thought it was.</v>

932
00:28:54.631 --> 00:28:56.220
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a bunch of dorks running round,</v>

933
00:28:56.221 --> 00:28:58.650
<v Speaker 2>fake fucking duns and dragons money.</v>

934
00:28:59.280 --> 00:28:59.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

935
00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:00.210
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

936
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.480
<v Speaker 2>this is way more sophisticated.</v>

937
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 2>We'll get to talking about how you can use this to do stocks,</v>

938
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:04.921
<v Speaker 2>bonds,</v>

939
00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:06.120
<v Speaker 2>distributed companies,</v>

940
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:07.350
<v Speaker 2>autonomous companies.</v>

941
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Now when you pay your kinds of things,</v>

942
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.890
<v Speaker 2>when you pay your rent and you take your bitcoin,</v>

943
00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:11.850
<v Speaker 2>you convert it to money,</v>

944
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.620
<v Speaker 2>who's giving you money for Bitcoin?</v>

945
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.940
<v Speaker 2>People want to buy bitcoin.</v>

946
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.890
<v Speaker 2>So how do you find these people on craigslist?</v>

947
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 2>So there's a number of ways.</v>

948
00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:18.800
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

949
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.051
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

950
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:19.740
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

951
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.940
<v Speaker 2>the straightforward one,</v>

952
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:26.180
<v Speaker 2>if you come from the old banking style world is you open a brokerage account on</v>

953
00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:29.010
<v Speaker 2>a virtual currency exchange that will exchange dollars,</v>

954
00:29:29.011 --> 00:29:29.371
<v Speaker 2>yen,</v>

955
00:29:29.371 --> 00:29:30.120
<v Speaker 2>euros,</v>

956
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:34.890
<v Speaker 2>whatever to bitcoin or even some other cryptocurrencies.</v>

957
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.340
<v Speaker 2>And then you can go there and you can wire transfer,</v>

958
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

959
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:39.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

960
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.710
<v Speaker 2>using your bank account,</v>

961
00:29:40.711 --> 00:29:44.110
<v Speaker 2>you can wire transfer money into the brokerage account as you would to buy IBM</v>

962
00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 2>stock.</v>

963
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.220
<v Speaker 2>You wire him some money to your brokerage and then you buy some IBM stock.</v>

964
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Well here you are some money there and you buy some bitcoin with it.</v>

965
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

966
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 1>So traditional brokerages deal in Bitcoin as well.</v>

967
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:56.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

968
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.690
<v Speaker 2>this is a specialized exchange that deals in Bitcoin,</v>

969
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 2>but it works just like a brokerage account.</v>

970
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:04.570
<v Speaker 2>So you have a number of different currencies in it and you can buy one and sell</v>

971
00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:05.100
<v Speaker 2>the other.</v>

972
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Are there any brokers who deal in bitcoins,</v>

973
00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:08.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

974
00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.620
<v Speaker 2>of like traditional,</v>

975
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.120
<v Speaker 2>large scale?</v>

976
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:12.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

977
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.343
<v Speaker 2>not yet.</v>

978
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.273
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>

979
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:15.480
<v Speaker 2>But you think that's coming?</v>

980
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:15.901
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

981
00:30:15.901 --> 00:30:16.734
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

982
00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

983
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:18.630
<v Speaker 2>Because the thing is,</v>

984
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.051
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

985
00:30:19.051 --> 00:30:19.884
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

986
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.270
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the skills they have,</v>

987
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

988
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.790
<v Speaker 2>They also have the physical locations and branches to sell bed coin and before</v>

989
00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:27.241
<v Speaker 2>long board,</v>

990
00:30:27.241 --> 00:30:29.670
<v Speaker 2>we're going to see as the same thing that happened in the entertainment</v>

991
00:30:29.671 --> 00:30:30.061
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

992
00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:31.440
<v Speaker 2>When MP3 hit the scene.</v>

993
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Like at first everyone was like,</v>

994
00:30:33.361 --> 00:30:33.751
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

995
00:30:33.751 --> 00:30:35.100
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to even touch this.</v>

996
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.780
<v Speaker 2>And then somebody started thinking,</v>

997
00:30:36.781 --> 00:30:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

998
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.960
<v Speaker 2>if I start playing with this before everybody else,</v>

999
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.400
<v Speaker 2>it's going to hurt all of us,</v>

1000
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to hurt me less than I can start taking advantage.</v>

1001
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.980
<v Speaker 2>And they peel off the herd and boom,</v>

1002
00:30:46.981 --> 00:30:47.791
<v Speaker 2>you have adoption.</v>

1003
00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:50.280
<v Speaker 2>And I think the same thing is going to start happening with banking.</v>

1004
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1005
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Some of the banks,</v>

1006
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.660
<v Speaker 2>perhaps not the big six US banks,</v>

1007
00:30:54.661 --> 00:30:55.441
<v Speaker 2>they've got a nice,</v>

1008
00:30:55.441 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1009
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1010
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:56.761
<v Speaker 2>comfortable,</v>

1011
00:30:56.761 --> 00:30:59.910
<v Speaker 2>$70 billion a month from the Fed right now.</v>

1012
00:30:59.911 --> 00:31:01.020
<v Speaker 2>Why would they do innovation?</v>

1013
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.660
<v Speaker 2>But maybe one of the more nimble banks may be,</v>

1014
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1015
00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:04.591
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1016
00:31:04.591 --> 00:31:09.570
<v Speaker 2>in a country like Cyprus that's been hit hard by these bail ins and you have a</v>

1017
00:31:09.571 --> 00:31:11.310
<v Speaker 2>very open banking environment.</v>

1018
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Singapore is going to decide this is a good strategic move.</v>

1019
00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:15.780
<v Speaker 2>May Been Mccall who knows.</v>

1020
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.570
<v Speaker 2>The point is in an international financial environment,</v>

1021
00:31:18.571 --> 00:31:19.500
<v Speaker 2>all it takes is one.</v>

1022
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.050
<v Speaker 1>One ball gets rolling and then creates the avalanche and then,</v>

1024
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.960
<v Speaker 1>and then the stem piece and then the standard changes.</v>

1025
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:28.853
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1026
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1027
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:31.110
<v Speaker 1>This is very exciting.</v>

1028
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.820
<v Speaker 1>It's very complex though.</v>

1029
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.010
<v Speaker 1>And this is what I'm trying to wrap my head around.</v>

1030
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.090
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1031
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:41.090
<v Speaker 1>the amount of this bitcoin that's created every year is limited in fixed.</v>

1032
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Who determined all of this?</v>

1033
00:31:43.021 --> 00:31:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Who Do,</v>

1034
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.670
<v Speaker 1>who created bitcoin?</v>

1035
00:31:44.671 --> 00:31:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Who invented the concept?</v>

1036
00:31:45.991 --> 00:31:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Was there several people or,</v>

1037
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.571
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1038
00:31:47.571 --> 00:31:48.890
<v Speaker 2>you said when you exchanged money it's,</v>

1039
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.060
<v Speaker 2>it's almost free.</v>

1040
00:31:50.061 --> 00:31:50.481
<v Speaker 2>I heard.</v>

1041
00:31:50.481 --> 00:31:52.130
<v Speaker 2>So that money goes somewhere.</v>

1042
00:31:52.131 --> 00:31:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Who's getting this money?</v>

1043
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.820
<v Speaker 2>So this is where it gets a bit more complicated.</v>

1044
00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.690
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1045
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:57.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1046
00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.410
<v Speaker 2>but keep in mind the internet in 1992,</v>

1047
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.360
<v Speaker 2>you had to know unix command line skills to send an email and it took two days</v>

1048
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:05.300
<v Speaker 2>across the network.</v>

1049
00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.890
<v Speaker 2>We can get simpler and easier for most people over time,</v>

1050
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's still a bit geeky.</v>

1051
00:32:11.121 --> 00:32:11.451
<v Speaker 2>So I'll,</v>

1052
00:32:11.451 --> 00:32:11.661
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1053
00:32:11.661 --> 00:32:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I'll get into it.</v>

1054
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.490
<v Speaker 2>One question at a time though.</v>

1055
00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Who created this?</v>

1056
00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.230
<v Speaker 2>So this was created by Satoshi Nakamoto,</v>

1057
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.970
<v Speaker 2>a cryptographer who used an anonymous identity or pseudonymous identity.</v>

1058
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:23.241
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1059
00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:23.690
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1060
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:28.130
<v Speaker 2>he basically wrote a paper and the basic software,</v>

1061
00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.830
<v Speaker 2>a scientific paper that explains how it works.</v>

1062
00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.520
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the best way to understand bitcoin.</v>

1063
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.890
<v Speaker 2>If you have a bit of understanding of,</v>

1064
00:32:35.891 --> 00:32:36.890
<v Speaker 2>of basic science,</v>

1065
00:32:36.891 --> 00:32:37.400
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

1066
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.060
<v Speaker 2>you can read it.</v>

1067
00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.110
<v Speaker 2>It's very accessible.</v>

1068
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.670
<v Speaker 2>And if you look for those Satoshi Nakamoto bitcoin paper or the bitcoin paper,</v>

1069
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:44.690
<v Speaker 2>you'll find it online.</v>

1070
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.501
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1071
00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:50.390
<v Speaker 2>so he wrote a paper and at the same time he created the software that runs the</v>

1072
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:50.900
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1073
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1074
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.050
<v Speaker 2>And then gave it out to people and people started running it.</v>

1075
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Now keep in mind,</v>

1076
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin is an agreement.</v>

1077
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:58.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a standard.</v>

1078
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.960
<v Speaker 2>It's how you do certain things on the bitcoin network that's matters,</v>

1079
00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1080
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.930
<v Speaker 2>And then there's software that implements that agreement.</v>

1081
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:07.460
<v Speaker 2>The runs according to those rules,</v>

1082
00:33:07.461 --> 00:33:10.430
<v Speaker 2>just like the internet doesn't belong to anyone,</v>

1083
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.460
<v Speaker 2>is just an agreement of how you transmit things across the Internet.</v>

1084
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.820
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody can write software that can use that standard.</v>

1085
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:21.830
<v Speaker 2>So Satoshi Nakamoto created the standards in 2008,</v>

1086
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:22.790
<v Speaker 2>2008.</v>

1087
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:27.790
<v Speaker 2>The paper came out in 2008 and followed shortly thereafter by the code.</v>

1088
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:32.240
<v Speaker 2>The discussion actually lasted about a here as he was mulling this over and</v>

1089
00:33:32.241 --> 00:33:32.720
<v Speaker 2>discussing it.</v>

1090
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.351
<v Speaker 2>And keep in mind,</v>

1091
00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:34.700
<v Speaker 2>digital money is not new.</v>

1092
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:38.420
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing digital money since the probably the mid eighties.</v>

1093
00:33:38.421 --> 00:33:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I think the first,</v>

1094
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 2>a notable one was David showmes,</v>

1095
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:46.661
<v Speaker 2>Digi cash and he created a form of digital money using the new technology of</v>

1096
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:47.900
<v Speaker 2>cryptography at the time.</v>

1097
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1098
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.590
<v Speaker 2>he and cryptography is,</v>

1099
00:33:50.591 --> 00:33:54.530
<v Speaker 2>is a way of scrambling and unscrambling messages and doing digital signatures</v>

1100
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.640
<v Speaker 2>and using mathematics to,</v>

1101
00:33:56.641 --> 00:33:58.940
<v Speaker 2>to prove things basically on computers.</v>

1102
00:33:58.941 --> 00:34:02.180
<v Speaker 2>It's also what you use to protect your browsing session when you connect to your</v>

1103
00:34:02.181 --> 00:34:05.180
<v Speaker 2>bank and it puts that little lock that's using cryptography,</v>

1104
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:06.920
<v Speaker 2>you're doing an an an encrypted session.</v>

1105
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.290
<v Speaker 2>So at the time,</v>

1106
00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:09.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1107
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.980
<v Speaker 2>David Chaum basically created additional money.</v>

1108
00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 2>And what it is is you can have a number that has a signature on it,</v>

1109
00:34:16.611 --> 00:34:17.690
<v Speaker 2>the proof's who owns it.</v>

1110
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.100
<v Speaker 2>And then you can spend that.</v>

1111
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.260
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that you,</v>

1112
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 2>because it's digital,</v>

1113
00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:23.750
<v Speaker 2>you can copy it.</v>

1114
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.400
<v Speaker 2>So what happens if you spend it twice?</v>

1115
00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:26.234
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1116
00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:28.700
<v Speaker 2>you have to have some kind of central authority,</v>

1117
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:31.070
<v Speaker 2>the checks to see that you don't spend it twice.</v>

1118
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.580
<v Speaker 2>And so he put some servers together and they could handle all of the</v>

1119
00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:39.090
<v Speaker 2>transactions and make sure nobody spent the money twice and issue the money into</v>

1120
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:43.700
<v Speaker 2>all of the kind of Federal Reserve Central Bank functions and then ran it on the</v>

1121
00:34:43.701 --> 00:34:44.840
<v Speaker 2>network and it worked.</v>

1122
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 2>So unfortunately,</v>

1123
00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:50.480
<v Speaker 2>if you have a central server and you try to go against the banking system,</v>

1124
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.710
<v Speaker 2>they stomp on you.</v>

1125
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.360
<v Speaker 2>So they stomp on you.</v>

1126
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.460
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>

1127
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.293
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1128
00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:55.810
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1129
00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:59.270
<v Speaker 2>there was a series of legal battles and then eventually the service got down.</v>

1130
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.840
<v Speaker 2>And so we've seen this happen maybe four or five times with different attempts</v>

1131
00:35:05.181 --> 00:35:07.820
<v Speaker 2>to do digital cash with various levels of centralization.</v>

1132
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:09.950
<v Speaker 2>But the basic problem was this,</v>

1133
00:35:09.951 --> 00:35:14.030
<v Speaker 2>how do you ensure that the network remains trusted and honest</v>

1134
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.940
<v Speaker 2>without having someone in the middle who checks everything and authority?</v>

1135
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:21.680
<v Speaker 2>How do you put trust?</v>

1136
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Not In an institution or central authority as most hierarchal system work,</v>

1137
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.440
<v Speaker 2>but in a con,</v>

1138
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.480
<v Speaker 2>but spread that trust across the whole network.</v>

1139
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:30.620
<v Speaker 2>And in 2008,</v>

1140
00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Satoshi Nakamoto solve that problem and he solved it by putting together four or</v>

1141
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 2>five ideas that each of them had been done somewhat</v>

1142
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:38.790
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>

1143
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 5>but he put them together in an incredible combination that just worked and</v>

1144
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:44.040
<v Speaker 5>worked beautifully.</v>

1145
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:49.460
<v Speaker 5>So what the system does is it forces everyone who's participating on the network</v>

1146
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.680
<v Speaker 5>to do a bit of a computing,</v>

1147
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1148
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.601
<v Speaker 5>with our system,</v>

1149
00:35:54.601 --> 00:35:55.500
<v Speaker 5>which is called mining.</v>

1150
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.480
<v Speaker 5>And so if you,</v>

1151
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.560
<v Speaker 5>if you just have a wallet,</v>

1152
00:35:58.561 --> 00:35:59.161
<v Speaker 5>you don't do this,</v>

1153
00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:03.630
<v Speaker 5>but if you want to be part of the bitcoin network as a minor,</v>

1154
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:07.260
<v Speaker 5>what you do is you run on a specialized computer and it solves this very</v>

1155
00:36:07.261 --> 00:36:08.094
<v Speaker 5>difficult problem.</v>

1156
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.630
<v Speaker 5>And it's kind of like a competition.</v>

1157
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.470
<v Speaker 5>It's like looking for a magical number is that,</v>

1158
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.730
<v Speaker 5>that if you plug it into an equation,</v>

1159
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:15.600
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1160
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 5>it's the right number.</v>

1161
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:16.760
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1162
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.690
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like a global competition,</v>

1163
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.760
<v Speaker 5>like solving a giant Sudoku puzzle.</v>

1164
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.020
<v Speaker 5>So everyone's trying,</v>

1165
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 5>and then somebody,</v>

1166
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:27.210
<v Speaker 5>every 10 minutes on average finds a solution and that becomes a new block of</v>

1167
00:36:27.211 --> 00:36:28.044
<v Speaker 5>transactions.</v>

1168
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.940
<v Speaker 5>And when they find that solution,</v>

1169
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.710
<v Speaker 5>they get some bitcoin,</v>

1170
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.461
<v Speaker 5>which is new.</v>

1171
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:34.050
<v Speaker 5>Bitcoin is created for the first time.</v>

1172
00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:34.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm confused.</v>

1173
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1174
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:35.843
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1175
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 5>Find a solution for what?</v>

1176
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.653
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1177
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.880
<v Speaker 5>So basically the idea is everybody's trying to find a way to create a new block</v>

1178
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.490
<v Speaker 5>of transactions,</v>

1179
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.300
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1180
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.990
<v Speaker 5>And in this block they also get a reward for creating the block.</v>

1181
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.630
<v Speaker 5>What is a block of transactions?</v>

1182
00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.510
<v Speaker 5>It's basically,</v>

1183
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.673
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1184
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.240
<v Speaker 5>it's basically a,</v>

1185
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 5>an entry on the ledger.</v>

1186
00:36:58.921 --> 00:36:59.754
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1187
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.050
<v Speaker 5>as I mentioned before,</v>

1188
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.100
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1189
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:02.850
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1190
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.100
<v Speaker 5>there's a way to have,</v>

1191
00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:08.340
<v Speaker 5>there's a central transaction ledger where you can see everybody's transactions.</v>

1192
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 5>In order to write on that,</v>

1193
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 5>in order to create a new transaction to the entire network trusts,</v>

1194
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:15.720
<v Speaker 5>you have to solve a very difficult problem.</v>

1195
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.100
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1196
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.480
<v Speaker 5>But if you do solve the problem,</v>

1197
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 5>you get a reward in bitcoin.</v>

1198
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.360
<v Speaker 5>When you say you solved the problem,</v>

1199
00:37:21.361 --> 00:37:23.760
<v Speaker 5>is someone physically sitting in front of their computer trying to solve the</v>

1200
00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 5>problem of the computers?</v>

1201
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.130
<v Speaker 5>The shooter,</v>

1202
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.331
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1203
00:37:25.331 --> 00:37:25.510
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1204
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.460
<v Speaker 5>So their computer,</v>

1205
00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:28.020
<v Speaker 5>you're using their CPU power.</v>

1206
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:28.621
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1207
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:29.240
<v Speaker 5>But essentially,</v>

1208
00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:29.520
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1209
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.060
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1210
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.540
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1211
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.800
<v Speaker 5>So runs in the background,</v>

1212
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:33.270
<v Speaker 5>it's called commercial of work.</v>

1213
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.501
<v Speaker 5>You do a,</v>

1214
00:37:34.501 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 5>you're run a program that does proof of work,</v>

1215
00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:38.310
<v Speaker 5>which is basically solving this difficult problem.</v>

1216
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.450
<v Speaker 5>So is this in some way like sort of similar in fact to how Bitcoin,</v>

1217
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.160
<v Speaker 5>how bit torrent works,</v>

1218
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.020
<v Speaker 5>where bid corn bid torrent you,</v>

1219
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 5>you leave it on like if you're a sh a file share,</v>

1220
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.830
<v Speaker 5>like how bands can spread their music that way they put their files online,</v>

1221
00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:53.940
<v Speaker 5>let people know where there are,</v>

1222
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.900
<v Speaker 5>then people seed it and then they all just,</v>

1223
00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:56.610
<v Speaker 5>every,</v>

1224
00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 5>every bitcoin wallet works like that.</v>

1225
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:01.860
<v Speaker 5>It's like a little bit torrent clients and it talks to all the wallets and</v>

1226
00:38:01.861 --> 00:38:02.700
<v Speaker 5>confined on the,</v>

1227
00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:04.320
<v Speaker 5>on the network and communicates.</v>

1228
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:07.230
<v Speaker 5>But there are some specialized systems which,</v>

1229
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 5>which do this computation problem very,</v>

1230
00:38:09.691 --> 00:38:14.190
<v Speaker 5>very fast and they're big and noisy and have lots of fans because it's gotten</v>

1231
00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:14.971
<v Speaker 5>very competitive.</v>

1232
00:38:14.971 --> 00:38:17.850
<v Speaker 5>So people upgraded their stuff and then they upgraded it again and then they</v>

1233
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:18.690
<v Speaker 5>upgrade it again.</v>

1234
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:22.050
<v Speaker 5>And it's caused this kind of an arms race of computing power.</v>

1235
00:38:22.051 --> 00:38:24.530
<v Speaker 5>But the basic idea is that you,</v>

1236
00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.350
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1237
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.410
<v Speaker 5>you buy a box that has this ability to solve the problem.</v>

1238
00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:31.800
<v Speaker 5>You plug it into the network and it runs and it chews up electricity and it</v>

1239
00:38:31.801 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 5>glides bitcoin.</v>

1240
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 5>A dedicated box to try to help solve</v>

1241
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.281
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1242
00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 4>and in the meantime it makes money.</v>

1243
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1244
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.210
<v Speaker 4>and it makes a bit of money.</v>

1245
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:42.430
<v Speaker 4>And people join in groups that are called pools,</v>

1246
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.630
<v Speaker 4>just like playing a lottery.</v>

1247
00:38:43.631 --> 00:38:44.441
<v Speaker 4>Put this while I look.</v>

1248
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>

1249
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.761
<v Speaker 4>this guy is,</v>

1250
00:38:45.761 --> 00:38:46.960
<v Speaker 4>this is his servers.</v>

1251
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.550
<v Speaker 4>These are all the Bitcoin solvers,</v>

1252
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 4>if I'm not mistaken.</v>

1253
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:51.280
<v Speaker 4>This is a,</v>

1254
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:51.521
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1255
00:38:51.521 --> 00:38:53.110
<v Speaker 4>this is a liquid cool.</v>

1256
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 4>A rack system for folks who haven't seen this photo,</v>

1257
00:38:56.171 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 4>if you're listening to this,</v>

1258
00:38:57.041 --> 00:38:58.390
<v Speaker 4>which is the majority of our people,</v>

1259
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 4>what are they googling?</v>

1260
00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.161
<v Speaker 4>Brian?</v>

1261
00:39:00.161 --> 00:39:00.860
<v Speaker 4>What's the image?</v>

1262
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.080
<v Speaker 4>Coin Mining.</v>

1263
00:39:02.081 --> 00:39:02.914
<v Speaker 4>It's the first one.</v>

1264
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.671
<v Speaker 4>Coin Mining.</v>

1265
00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:04.900
<v Speaker 4>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1266
00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:06.100
<v Speaker 4>You have to see this picture folks,</v>

1267
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:06.791
<v Speaker 4>when you get home.</v>

1268
00:39:06.791 --> 00:39:07.720
<v Speaker 4>Bitcoin mining,</v>

1269
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.580
<v Speaker 4>they have goddamn rooms filled with computers that they're making bitcoin when</v>

1270
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:13.840
<v Speaker 4>we're in the matrix.</v>

1271
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.400
<v Speaker 4>So we're here,</v>

1272
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.950
<v Speaker 4>let me just,</v>

1273
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:16.900
<v Speaker 4>Damn Matrix.</v>

1274
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.130
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1275
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.510
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>

1276
00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:20.410
<v Speaker 4>There's somebody's house.</v>

1277
00:39:20.411 --> 00:39:25.411
<v Speaker 4>So the bitcoin network today is bigger than the world's top several hundred</v>

1278
00:39:26.591 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 4>super computers combined.</v>

1279
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:34.090
<v Speaker 4>It's the largest single computing experiment on the Internet ever.</v>

1280
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.010
<v Speaker 4>What's using more internet juice,</v>

1281
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin or porn at the moment?</v>

1282
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Bitcoin.</v>

1283
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.030
<v Speaker 4>That's not possible,</v>

1284
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:40.810
<v Speaker 4>son.</v>

1285
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.250
<v Speaker 4>You're talking crazy,</v>

1286
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:43.460
<v Speaker 4>but it's also a,</v>

1287
00:39:43.461 --> 00:39:47.260
<v Speaker 4>it's also generating an entire new economy based on that.</v>

1288
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:49.280
<v Speaker 4>How much prostitution has been paid for in Bitcoin.</v>

1289
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.133
<v Speaker 4>Is that possible?</v>

1290
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.150
<v Speaker 4>I have no ideas.</v>

1291
00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.293
<v Speaker 4>Are you sure?</v>

1292
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.280
<v Speaker 4>100% sure that.</v>

1293
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.330
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1294
00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:55.601
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1295
00:39:55.601 --> 00:39:56.434
<v Speaker 4>you're just guessing.</v>

1296
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.430
<v Speaker 4>You're not 100% sure.</v>

1297
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 4>You're pretty sure you can't say out of all the people on the road that's sluts</v>

1298
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.830
<v Speaker 4>or one uses super peak sloughed.</v>

1299
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.670
<v Speaker 4>What if you find the first one today?</v>

1300
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.141
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1301
00:40:07.141 --> 00:40:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you an argument for why that might touch.</v>

1302
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:10.374
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

1303
00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.030
<v Speaker 2>If you're a sex worker,</v>

1304
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:17.120
<v Speaker 2>one of the problems better world have is you're going to get extorted and</v>

1305
00:40:18.121 --> 00:40:21.030
<v Speaker 2>exploited for that money and you're not going to keep any of it.</v>

1306
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:22.980
<v Speaker 2>With a bitcoin wallet,</v>

1307
00:40:22.981 --> 00:40:27.750
<v Speaker 2>you can basically hide that money and you can also take it in a way that cannot</v>

1308
00:40:27.751 --> 00:40:29.370
<v Speaker 2>be taken away from you,</v>

1309
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:30.323
<v Speaker 2>not easily.</v>

1310
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.520
<v Speaker 2>So you know there's just take your phone.</v>

1311
00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.133
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

1312
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:35.910
<v Speaker 2>not so easy.</v>

1313
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:36.151
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1314
00:40:36.151 --> 00:40:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Because it's backed up and,</v>

1315
00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:37.890
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1316
00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:38.723
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1317
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're not carrying physical cash.</v>

1319
00:40:41.281 --> 00:40:43.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a much safer exchange.</v>

1320
00:40:43.231 --> 00:40:48.231
<v Speaker 2>And so there are many reasons why in many different environments where money is</v>

1321
00:40:48.481 --> 00:40:49.314
<v Speaker 2>difficult,</v>

1322
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:49.681
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1323
00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:51.000
<v Speaker 2>that bitcoin is successful.</v>

1324
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.080
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing,</v>

1325
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.850
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin is very efficient money.</v>

1326
00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:55.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good system of money.</v>

1327
00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:59.220
<v Speaker 2>If you can send money like an email anywhere in the world will,</v>

1328
00:40:59.221 --> 00:40:59.581
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1329
00:40:59.581 --> 00:41:00.780
<v Speaker 2>it's tremendously useful.</v>

1330
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:02.280
<v Speaker 2>And so in places,</v>

1331
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:07.200
<v Speaker 2>and that includes criminal activities where it's difficult to move money.</v>

1332
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.090
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin is going to be good for that.</v>

1333
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Regulate the point because at the end of the day,</v>

1334
00:41:11.881 --> 00:41:14.520
<v Speaker 2>there's another 6 billion of us want to do good things with it.</v>

1335
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.810
<v Speaker 2>And just like on the Internet,</v>

1336
00:41:15.811 --> 00:41:17.310
<v Speaker 2>you can use it for crime,</v>

1337
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.680
<v Speaker 2>but it gives so much more to humanity.</v>

1338
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Of course you can use bitcoin for crime you can use,</v>

1339
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:24.810
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is US dollars are used for crime.</v>

1340
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:30.050
<v Speaker 4>The currency in the Washington prostitution is the most ridiculous crime ever.</v>

1341
00:41:30.051 --> 00:41:31.910
<v Speaker 4>It's so should be legal.</v>

1342
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>It's so that people can</v>

1343
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 1>have sex for free,</v>

1344
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.740
<v Speaker 1>but they can't have sex for money.</v>

1345
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:37.621
<v Speaker 1>How come you give him,</v>

1346
00:41:37.621 --> 00:41:39.830
<v Speaker 1>give massages for money and massages?</v>

1347
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 1>A prostitution.</v>

1348
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1349
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:42.170
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

1350
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 1>they might as well be prostitution.</v>

1351
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.480
<v Speaker 1>They're awesome.</v>

1352
00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:45.111
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

1353
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I love massages,</v>

1354
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking prostitution.</v>

1355
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.400
<v Speaker 1>The person doesn't want to rub you,</v>

1356
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:50.660
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a guy or a girl,</v>

1357
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:51.650
<v Speaker 1>you want them to rub you,</v>

1358
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:52.281
<v Speaker 1>you give them money,</v>

1359
00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:52.821
<v Speaker 1>they rub you.</v>

1360
00:41:52.821 --> 00:41:53.481
<v Speaker 1>They even pretend.</v>

1361
00:41:53.481 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 1>They like rubbing you.</v>

1362
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:55.610
<v Speaker 1>They bring you water,</v>

1363
00:41:55.611 --> 00:41:56.361
<v Speaker 1>they get you a towel.</v>

1364
00:41:56.361 --> 00:41:58.700
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a fuck about that towel.</v>

1365
00:41:58.701 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>

1366
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

1367
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

1368
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the Gig.</v>

1369
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:02.271
<v Speaker 1>Part of the,</v>

1370
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:03.830
<v Speaker 1>that's the part of the prostitution gig.</v>

1371
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:09.730
<v Speaker 1>The idea that in 2014 it's still illegal to pay someone for sex is so stupid.</v>

1372
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Not even handjobs nothing.</v>

1373
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:14.023
<v Speaker 1>No Penis.</v>

1374
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.073
<v Speaker 1>Can't touch it.</v>

1375
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad place.</v>

1376
00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:19.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad place and you can't have money involved in your bad place.</v>

1377
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like paying money for crime.</v>

1378
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.640
<v Speaker 1>You call it crime.</v>

1379
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.961
<v Speaker 1>I just found out.</v>

1380
00:42:23.961 --> 00:42:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1381
00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.960
<v Speaker 1>it's being used for prostitution.</v>

1382
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.321
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1383
00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:30.680
<v Speaker 1>the first one was September of this year or last year.</v>

1384
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:31.341
<v Speaker 1>Passion,</v>

1385
00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 1>VIP and escort agency in England.</v>

1386
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Since they had,</v>

1387
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.690
<v Speaker 1>now I've accepted bitcoins as payment,</v>

1388
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.430
<v Speaker 1>godspeed to you,</v>

1389
00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.740
<v Speaker 1>passionate Gip in England,</v>

1390
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Godspeed to you.</v>

1391
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:42.140
<v Speaker 1>So now we know that kind of crime,</v>

1392
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.860
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>

1393
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.180
<v Speaker 1>let's separate ourselves from such controversial talk because this could really</v>

1394
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:48.800
<v Speaker 1>screw people's up.</v>

1395
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Their idea of what bitcoin really is.</v>

1396
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.891
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1397
00:42:51.891 --> 00:42:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1398
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:53.280
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing.</v>

1399
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.320
<v Speaker 5>Bitcoin is not just money,</v>

1400
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:59.550
<v Speaker 5>but when is an invention and what that invention allows people to do is move</v>

1401
00:42:59.551 --> 00:43:00.900
<v Speaker 5>value across the Internet.</v>

1402
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.570
<v Speaker 5>And that invention means you can do bitcoin,</v>

1403
00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.970
<v Speaker 5>but it also means you can do a lot of other things.</v>

1404
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.600
<v Speaker 5>And bitcoin is an incredible invention because it,</v>

1405
00:43:09.601 --> 00:43:10.590
<v Speaker 5>for the first time,</v>

1406
00:43:10.591 --> 00:43:11.590
<v Speaker 5>it completely democratized,</v>

1407
00:43:11.591 --> 00:43:12.301
<v Speaker 5>democratizes money.</v>

1408
00:43:12.301 --> 00:43:17.301
<v Speaker 5>It's separates money from a function of power of the state to an individual</v>

1409
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:21.360
<v Speaker 5>exchange between people like it's used to be when it was shells and feathers,</v>

1410
00:43:21.361 --> 00:43:21.960
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1411
00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:22.880
<v Speaker 5>Or um,</v>

1412
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.281
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1413
00:43:23.281 --> 00:43:24.240
<v Speaker 5>barter exchange.</v>

1414
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.720
<v Speaker 5>But the beauty of it is that it can,</v>

1415
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.411
<v Speaker 5>at the moment,</v>

1416
00:43:28.411 --> 00:43:29.370
<v Speaker 5>if you think about it,</v>

1417
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:30.480
<v Speaker 5>there is,</v>

1418
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.960
<v Speaker 5>let's say a billion people in the western world who have not just banking</v>

1419
00:43:33.961 --> 00:43:34.621
<v Speaker 5>facilities,</v>

1420
00:43:34.621 --> 00:43:36.600
<v Speaker 5>but like turbocharged power banking.</v>

1421
00:43:36.601 --> 00:43:38.160
<v Speaker 5>They have international transactions.</v>

1422
00:43:38.161 --> 00:43:39.930
<v Speaker 5>They can buy stocks on any stock market.</v>

1423
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.640
<v Speaker 5>They can do wire transfers,</v>

1424
00:43:41.641 --> 00:43:43.440
<v Speaker 5>some of them are credited investors,</v>

1425
00:43:43.441 --> 00:43:44.250
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

1426
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.630
<v Speaker 5>The power user of banking,</v>

1427
00:43:45.631 --> 00:43:50.580
<v Speaker 5>there's another may be 2 billion people who have a basic bank account and then</v>

1428
00:43:50.581 --> 00:43:51.480
<v Speaker 5>there's the rest of them,</v>

1429
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:52.230
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1430
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.531
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1431
00:43:52.531 --> 00:43:57.531
<v Speaker 5>the giant majority of the population on this planet has very limited access to</v>

1432
00:43:58.981 --> 00:43:59.430
<v Speaker 5>banking,</v>

1433
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:03.030
<v Speaker 5>very limited access to international finance,</v>

1434
00:44:03.031 --> 00:44:03.990
<v Speaker 5>to lending,</v>

1435
00:44:03.991 --> 00:44:05.010
<v Speaker 5>to capitol,</v>

1436
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.070
<v Speaker 5>to uh,</v>

1437
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.240
<v Speaker 5>the ability to even change their money to another currency.</v>

1438
00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.880
<v Speaker 5>And so bitcoin is so much more important for them.</v>

1439
00:44:11.881 --> 00:44:15.480
<v Speaker 5>I call this the other 6 billion just keeps the focus on the other 6 billion</v>

1440
00:44:15.481 --> 00:44:18.150
<v Speaker 5>because for the billion it might be a fad,</v>

1441
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.710
<v Speaker 5>but for the other 6 billion,</v>

1442
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 5>this is an opportunity to change the way we deal with poverty and to change the</v>

1443
00:44:25.351 --> 00:44:27.810
<v Speaker 5>way we unite the economic system of the planet,</v>

1444
00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.970
<v Speaker 5>which is a whole other level of compensation.</v>

1445
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 5>It will look at bitcoin and we think of it as</v>

1446
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.933
<v Speaker 2>just money,</v>

1447
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just money for the Internet.</v>

1448
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Money for the Internet is what it does.</v>

1449
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 2>And it does it very well.</v>

1450
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 2>But it's the intranet of money and it allows people at the edge by downloading</v>

1451
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:49.100
<v Speaker 2>just a simple application to join an economy and then to hold their own money</v>

1452
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.350
<v Speaker 2>without any state or corporation.</v>

1453
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Being able to steal it from them or inflated how to value and destroy their</v>

1454
00:44:56.101 --> 00:44:57.120
<v Speaker 2>children's future.</v>

1455
00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.510
<v Speaker 2>It allows them to hold and control that money and send it to anyone in the</v>

1456
00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:00.781
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1457
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:04.140
<v Speaker 2>They want to instantly for very little money.</v>

1458
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:09.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's never happened before and the implications that has for poverty,</v>

1459
00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:15.240
<v Speaker 2>for did the developing world for the way non governmental organizations work is</v>

1460
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:16.074
<v Speaker 2>staggering.</v>

1461
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Just take one example.</v>

1462
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 2>International remittances at the moment,</v>

1463
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:25.890
<v Speaker 2>500 or so billion dollars cent every year from the first world,</v>

1464
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.750
<v Speaker 2>two countries in the developing world,</v>

1465
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:28.620
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1466
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.540
<v Speaker 2>And out of that money,</v>

1467
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:32.850
<v Speaker 2>74 billion gets spent in fees,</v>

1468
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.730
<v Speaker 2>fees as high as 30 or 40% in fact,</v>

1469
00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:36.720
<v Speaker 2>the poor of the country,</v>

1470
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:39.090
<v Speaker 2>the higher the percentage of fee you have to pay.</v>

1471
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.200
<v Speaker 2>So Somalia and my migrants in the u s who sending $100 home,</v>

1472
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.150
<v Speaker 2>only 70 gets to the,</v>

1473
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:46.350
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

1474
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:51.350
<v Speaker 2>to the wife or the brother back home or the husband back home and the rest gets</v>

1475
00:45:51.781 --> 00:45:53.730
<v Speaker 2>chewed out by the money transfer companies.</v>

1476
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Now we give the developed world 150 or so billion and then we to the richest and</v>

1477
00:46:00.481 --> 00:46:04.050
<v Speaker 2>hope it trickles down and then we take 74 billion from the poorest.</v>

1478
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.610
<v Speaker 2>What if we could change that?</v>

1479
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:10.560
<v Speaker 2>What if we could enable bitcoin remittances and international payments and</v>

1480
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:14.730
<v Speaker 2>redeliver that 74 billion of their money and allow them to send that money</v>

1481
00:46:14.731 --> 00:46:16.590
<v Speaker 2>directly home without paying that fee?</v>

1482
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 2>That changes the lives of a billion people.</v>

1483
00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1484
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:25.280
<v Speaker 1>So you envisioned bitcoin as being a universal currency.</v>

1485
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.971
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1486
00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:26.780
<v Speaker 1>It already is.</v>

1487
00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Will it absorb the dollar or the,</v>

1488
00:46:28.701 --> 00:46:32.370
<v Speaker 1>will the dollar go away with a doll coexist along with bitcoin?</v>

1489
00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Like what is your hope for this?</v>

1490
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:34.891
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1491
00:46:34.891 --> 00:46:38.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that like many disruptive technologies is going to change the</v>

1492
00:46:38.671 --> 00:46:39.421
<v Speaker 2>power balance.</v>

1493
00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:41.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not that the dollar goes away of the banking system,</v>

1494
00:46:41.671 --> 00:46:42.091
<v Speaker 2>goes away,</v>

1495
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:46.410
<v Speaker 2>it just has less power and less relevance in a new world where people control</v>

1496
00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:47.970
<v Speaker 2>their own money and can send it to each other.</v>

1497
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.580
<v Speaker 1>So ultimately the grand hope is that the money,</v>

1498
00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:54.340
<v Speaker 1>the dollar that we see today becomes in the future.</v>

1499
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Much like the written letter,</v>

1500
00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.210
<v Speaker 1>no fucking need it anymore.</v>

1501
00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.260
<v Speaker 1>You can send emails,</v>

1502
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.730
<v Speaker 1>you send someone a text message,</v>

1503
00:47:00.731 --> 00:47:04.360
<v Speaker 1>you have to get on a fucking pony and carry your mail over to another state.</v>

1504
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:05.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1505
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.101
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

1506
00:47:06.101 --> 00:47:08.290
<v Speaker 2>the dollar again is the world reserve currency.</v>

1507
00:47:08.291 --> 00:47:09.220
<v Speaker 2>And there's only one of it.</v>

1508
00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Now are there 193 other currencies that,</v>

1509
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:15.070
<v Speaker 2>that some of them may end up getting replaced?</v>

1510
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1511
00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.730
<v Speaker 2>some of them may end up even converting into cryptocurrencies.</v>

1512
00:47:18.731 --> 00:47:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Have a nation states,</v>

1513
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:19.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1514
00:47:19.931 --> 00:47:20.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1515
00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1516
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Thailand coin,</v>

1517
00:47:21.941 --> 00:47:22.774
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

1518
00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Or Fed coin if we're doing it here.</v>

1519
00:47:25.091 --> 00:47:30.091
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that we can't judge bitcoin on the standard of the most</v>

1520
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:32.530
<v Speaker 2>comfortable world reserve currency.</v>

1521
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:35.170
<v Speaker 2>That's the most stable currents we have to look at the rest of the world.</v>

1522
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:37.420
<v Speaker 2>And see what their currencies are like.</v>

1523
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:38.370
<v Speaker 2>And in many cars,</v>

1524
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:39.243
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

1525
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:43.240
<v Speaker 2>the currency is worth less than goat shit because you can burn goat shed longer</v>

1526
00:47:43.241 --> 00:47:46.540
<v Speaker 2>than you can burn these bundles of paper money that doesn't burn very well,</v>

1527
00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:47.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1528
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Speaker 2>and in in those countries,</v>

1529
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:50.050
<v Speaker 2>this is not a matter of shopping.</v>

1530
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.910
<v Speaker 2>This is a matter of of the future of their children and it's a matter of</v>

1531
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:55.744
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

1532
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:57.020
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

1533
00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:57.440
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1534
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.850
<v Speaker 4>that's really fascinating.</v>

1535
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.781
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1536
00:47:59.781 --> 00:48:03.290
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the concerns as far as security.</v>

1537
00:48:03.291 --> 00:48:07.600
<v Speaker 4>What are the concerns as far as if someone steals your bitcoins,</v>

1538
00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:11.210
<v Speaker 4>is there any sort of a regulatory body that can determine whether or not</v>

1539
00:48:11.211 --> 00:48:15.260
<v Speaker 4>someone's computer or phones been hacked into and their big bitcoin's had been</v>

1540
00:48:15.261 --> 00:48:16.080
<v Speaker 4>stolen?</v>

1541
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:16.913
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have,</v>

1542
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.910
<v Speaker 4>has that become an issue yet or is that a potential issue?</v>

1543
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.050
<v Speaker 2>It is a potential issue and it has become an issue and yeah,</v>

1544
00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:24.980
<v Speaker 2>people have had their bitcoin stolen.</v>

1545
00:48:24.981 --> 00:48:25.490
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1546
00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:26.450
<v Speaker 2>how has that happened?</v>

1547
00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:30.020
<v Speaker 2>What is their computer gets hacked and then they have a password on the account,</v>

1548
00:48:30.021 --> 00:48:31.370
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have like,</v>

1549
00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:31.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1550
00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:32.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1551
00:48:32.181 --> 00:48:35.150
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you can do very easily is set up what's called two factor</v>

1552
00:48:35.151 --> 00:48:35.811
<v Speaker 2>authentication.</v>

1553
00:48:35.811 --> 00:48:38.420
<v Speaker 2>So every time you tried to use your bitcoin wallet,</v>

1554
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:41.690
<v Speaker 2>it sends you a little text message and you have to enter the secret code like</v>

1555
00:48:41.691 --> 00:48:43.250
<v Speaker 2>you do with your bank height.</v>

1556
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Slightly higher on the socio computer's been hacked.</v>

1557
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:46.460
<v Speaker 2>They don't get the text messages,</v>

1558
00:48:46.461 --> 00:48:47.960
<v Speaker 2>they can't easily get into your account.</v>

1559
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:48.860
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>

1560
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:49.970
<v Speaker 2>that article you just brought up,</v>

1561
00:48:49.971 --> 00:48:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

1562
00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.040
<v Speaker 2>this is the latest hack.</v>

1563
00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:54.320
<v Speaker 2>I know that Bitcoin has been hacked a few times,</v>

1564
00:48:54.321 --> 00:48:56.540
<v Speaker 2>but this last one was one point $2 million.</v>

1565
00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And there's an article on wired called 1.2 million hacks shows why you should</v>

1566
00:49:00.201 --> 00:49:02.270
<v Speaker 2>never store bitcoins on the Internet.</v>

1567
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1568
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.480
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1569
00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:04.730
<v Speaker 2>what happens to something like that?</v>

1570
00:49:04.731 --> 00:49:05.810
<v Speaker 2>That they just lost this,</v>

1571
00:49:05.811 --> 00:49:06.021
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1572
00:49:06.021 --> 00:49:06.530
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1573
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:07.940
<v Speaker 2>there's no getting this back.</v>

1574
00:49:07.941 --> 00:49:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1575
00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:12.030
<v Speaker 2>and is there somebody that like a group of people that um,</v>

1576
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.390
<v Speaker 2>that you think is responsible for this or?</v>

1577
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1578
00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:15.651
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1579
00:49:15.651 --> 00:49:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's always been a,</v>

1580
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.460
<v Speaker 2>a thriving hacker underground that a,</v>

1581
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.470
<v Speaker 2>that he uses the most efficient way to steal money.</v>

1582
00:49:24.471 --> 00:49:28.880
<v Speaker 2>And so they stole money from targets by compromising all of those credit cards</v>

1583
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:29.810
<v Speaker 2>just a few weeks ago.</v>

1584
00:49:29.811 --> 00:49:32.810
<v Speaker 2>And that affected her a lot more people than any of these thefts.</v>

1585
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.440
<v Speaker 2>And you know that they're going to go after wherever the money is.</v>

1586
00:49:36.441 --> 00:49:38.360
<v Speaker 2>And if the efficient money is bitcoin,</v>

1587
00:49:38.361 --> 00:49:39.590
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go after bitcoin too.</v>

1588
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:40.880
<v Speaker 2>But here's the trick,</v>

1589
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:45.620
<v Speaker 2>because this money is controlled through mathematical security and because it's</v>

1590
00:49:45.621 --> 00:49:46.400
<v Speaker 2>programmable,</v>

1591
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.210
<v Speaker 2>we can actually create new ways of securing money so we can innovate,</v>

1592
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:52.670
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the paper wallet example I gave you,</v>

1593
00:49:52.671 --> 00:49:56.240
<v Speaker 2>where you can create a physical copy that you can secure old style in a safe</v>

1594
00:49:56.241 --> 00:49:57.080
<v Speaker 2>deposit box,</v>

1595
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:59.840
<v Speaker 2>whether it's using multisignature transactions,</v>

1596
00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.250
<v Speaker 2>where for example,</v>

1597
00:50:01.251 --> 00:50:02.840
<v Speaker 2>the money is locked and it takes,</v>

1598
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1599
00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:05.750
<v Speaker 2>two keys or three keys to unlock it.</v>

1600
00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:07.100
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1601
00:50:07.101 --> 00:50:09.800
<v Speaker 2>you can have a backup company that provides the second key.</v>

1602
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:12.170
<v Speaker 2>And so if you lose the primary key,</v>

1603
00:50:12.171 --> 00:50:13.490
<v Speaker 2>you could use the secondary key.</v>

1604
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:15.260
<v Speaker 2>You can do digital backups,</v>

1605
00:50:15.261 --> 00:50:16.040
<v Speaker 2>you can do,</v>

1606
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.270
<v Speaker 2>you can do time locks,</v>

1607
00:50:17.271 --> 00:50:21.230
<v Speaker 2>you can do all kinds of things now with money because it's programmable that</v>

1608
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:23.540
<v Speaker 2>allow you to create new ways of securing it.</v>

1609
00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's still very early,</v>

1610
00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.390
<v Speaker 2>early days.</v>

1611
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1612
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:27.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1613
00:50:27.321 --> 00:50:27.741
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1614
00:50:27.741 --> 00:50:32.300
<v Speaker 2>some people who don't take care put too much of their bitcoin in one place and</v>

1615
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:32.571
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1616
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:33.800
<v Speaker 2>that's not a very good idea.</v>

1617
00:50:33.801 --> 00:50:35.030
<v Speaker 2>They have weak passwords.</v>

1618
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:36.103
<v Speaker 2>So in this happened,</v>

1619
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.690
<v Speaker 1>when these people lost 1.2 million in Bitcoin,</v>

1620
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no bringing that back.</v>

1621
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:41.030
<v Speaker 1>There's no tracing it.</v>

1622
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.850
<v Speaker 1>There's no find out where it went or their social securities and these bitcoins</v>

1623
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.030
<v Speaker 1>or numbers rather than these bitcoins that nope,</v>

1624
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:48.081
<v Speaker 1>like dollar bills,</v>

1625
00:50:48.081 --> 00:50:48.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1626
00:50:48.261 --> 00:50:49.094
<v Speaker 1>they'd trace like back</v>

1627
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:50.083
<v Speaker 2>it's cash.</v>

1628
00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:50.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1629
00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.070
<v Speaker 2>it's because it's digital.</v>

1630
00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1631
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the key,</v>

1632
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:55.663
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1633
00:50:55.790 --> 00:51:00.790
<v Speaker 2>one of the key controls in the system is that it's like teleporting the digital</v>

1634
00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:01.880
<v Speaker 2>cash and you know,</v>

1635
00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:02.510
<v Speaker 2>once it,</v>

1636
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:06.080
<v Speaker 2>it's not on your Tele Porter pad and it's gone,</v>

1637
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:08.990
<v Speaker 2>you just hope the other teleporter we'll send it back to you.</v>

1638
00:51:08.991 --> 00:51:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Cause otherwise it's gone.</v>

1639
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's digital cash.</v>

1640
00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:15.560
<v Speaker 2>It can go very easily because it flows very easily.</v>

1641
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1642
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:21.080
<v Speaker 2>so what we're doing at the moment is developing new security techniques to make</v>

1643
00:51:21.081 --> 00:51:23.120
<v Speaker 2>it both harder to steal in the,</v>

1644
00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.840
<v Speaker 2>in the first place to have backups so that you can,</v>

1645
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1646
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:29.030
<v Speaker 2>so they couldn't get back if a,</v>

1647
00:51:29.031 --> 00:51:32.780
<v Speaker 2>if a key stolen before it's used and there's all kinds of things we can do to</v>

1648
00:51:32.781 --> 00:51:33.614
<v Speaker 2>make this better.</v>

1649
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:34.970
<v Speaker 2>It's still early days.</v>

1650
00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:39.070
<v Speaker 1>There was a story about that guy who left his bitcoin on his hard drive and</v>

1651
00:51:39.071 --> 00:51:42.340
<v Speaker 1>tossed it out accidentally and it's worth $9 million.</v>

1652
00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1653
00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're aware of that story.</v>

1654
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:44.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1655
00:51:44.781 --> 00:51:45.271
<v Speaker 2>This was in,</v>

1656
00:51:45.271 --> 00:51:45.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1657
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.161
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

1658
00:51:46.161 --> 00:51:46.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1659
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:49.490
<v Speaker 2>an England and throughout the,</v>

1660
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 2>actually all that happened is that a lot of people showed up at the local</v>

1661
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:54.090
<v Speaker 2>landfill with a,</v>

1662
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.130
<v Speaker 2>with metal detectors.</v>

1663
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.820
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people were looking for this treasure hunters.</v>

1664
00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1665
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.863
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to steal it.</v>

1666
00:51:59.000 --> 00:51:59.181
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1667
00:51:59.181 --> 00:52:01.280
<v Speaker 2>digital treasure hunting is going to be a thing,</v>

1668
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 2>a part of our future.</v>

1669
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1670
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.881
<v Speaker 1>So you've got,</v>

1671
00:52:02.881 --> 00:52:05.510
<v Speaker 1>people are going to like find old hard drives.</v>

1672
00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:08.340
<v Speaker 1>When my 2013 and I looked for bitcoins on them,</v>

1673
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.680
<v Speaker 2>well I love stories like this.</v>

1674
00:52:09.681 --> 00:52:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I was on Reddit the other day and I was reading this great story.</v>

1675
00:52:12.531 --> 00:52:13.730
<v Speaker 2>This student who said,</v>

1676
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:14.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1677
00:52:14.421 --> 00:52:19.330
<v Speaker 2>back in 2010 I did some bitcoin mining on my laptop and I just found that wallet</v>

1678
00:52:19.331 --> 00:52:19.791
<v Speaker 2>and it says,</v>

1679
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:21.890
<v Speaker 2>I have 917 bitcoin.</v>

1680
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Am I rich or am I missing something because this would really change my life.</v>

1681
00:52:25.971 --> 00:52:28.190
<v Speaker 2>I've got student loans and the guy had,</v>

1682
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:28.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1683
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:33.521
<v Speaker 2>at the time it was a $900,000 worth of bitcoin that he had found from a laptop.</v>

1684
00:52:34.391 --> 00:52:36.860
<v Speaker 2>He left laying around in 2010 and did some mining,</v>

1685
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:39.560
<v Speaker 2>and that story is great and it's happened many,</v>

1686
00:52:39.561 --> 00:52:40.341
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>

1687
00:52:40.341 --> 00:52:40.941
<v Speaker 2>So did it,</v>

1688
00:52:40.941 --> 00:52:43.970
<v Speaker 2>that guy sell that and become like almost a millionaire.</v>

1689
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1690
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:45.343
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1691
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.790
<v Speaker 2>And this was a student who was like,</v>

1692
00:52:46.791 --> 00:52:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm having trouble with my student loans.</v>

1693
00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:48.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1694
00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.180
<v Speaker 2>this could really help me.</v>

1695
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Am I too am I?</v>

1696
00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:52.670
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't believe it.</v>

1697
00:52:52.671 --> 00:52:52.971
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1698
00:52:52.971 --> 00:52:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I might see this wrong.</v>

1699
00:52:54.021 --> 00:52:55.100
<v Speaker 2>That's from mining.</v>

1700
00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:55.731
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1701
00:52:55.731 --> 00:52:56.001
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1702
00:52:56.001 --> 00:52:56.271
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1703
00:52:56.271 --> 00:52:56.460
<v Speaker 2>let's</v>

1704
00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.440
<v Speaker 1>good crazy talking monkey studios here.</v>

1705
00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.340
<v Speaker 1>We decided to start a mining up.</v>

1706
00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

1707
00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:01.810
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1708
00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:02.560
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

1709
00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the high trying to win $1 million.</v>

1710
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:05.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1711
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

1712
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.270
<v Speaker 2>which tells me we don't know so well,</v>

1713
00:53:07.271 --> 00:53:07.691
<v Speaker 2>I'll sign.</v>

1714
00:53:07.691 --> 00:53:08.524
<v Speaker 2>I had it figured out.</v>

1715
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.940
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1716
00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:10.211
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1717
00:53:10.211 --> 00:53:13.510
<v Speaker 2>the reason people have been successful with bitcoin is because they got</v>

1718
00:53:13.511 --> 00:53:17.500
<v Speaker 2>interested in the technology went only a few thousand people knew about it and</v>

1719
00:53:17.501 --> 00:53:18.430
<v Speaker 2>when they got involved,</v>

1720
00:53:18.431 --> 00:53:19.100
<v Speaker 2>at that point,</v>

1721
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:23.980
<v Speaker 2>bitcoins were worth like a hundredth of a penny or a thousandth of a penny and</v>

1722
00:53:23.981 --> 00:53:25.530
<v Speaker 2>now they're worth a $2.</v>

1723
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:27.630
<v Speaker 2>So if you ended up mining some,</v>

1724
00:53:27.631 --> 00:53:29.670
<v Speaker 2>then even if you only mind a few,</v>

1725
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:30.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1726
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.410
<v Speaker 2>plus it was a lot easier to mind then because over time the network adjust the</v>

1727
00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:34.981
<v Speaker 2>difficulty.</v>

1728
00:53:34.981 --> 00:53:36.180
<v Speaker 2>So the more people trying,</v>

1729
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:37.230
<v Speaker 2>the harder it gets.</v>

1730
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.750
<v Speaker 2>So the network is autonomous,</v>

1731
00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:41.200
<v Speaker 2>there's no centralized server,</v>

1732
00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.730
<v Speaker 2>there's no central anything.</v>

1733
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.990
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1734
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a series of rules that everybody follows and it's hard to grasp at first</v>

1735
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:50.010
<v Speaker 2>because we've never seen this type of distributed organization.</v>

1736
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:55.100
<v Speaker 2>And is there any organization whatsoever as far as like a CEO,</v>

1737
00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Doris,</v>

1738
00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 2>does that money go then every time the transaction goes?</v>

1739
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Is it good just Atashi Nakamoto?</v>

1740
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:02.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1741
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:02.331
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1742
00:54:02.331 --> 00:54:03.164
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1743
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.590
<v Speaker 2>If they even exist,</v>

1744
00:54:04.591 --> 00:54:06.840
<v Speaker 2>there's not even a real picture of him anywhere on the Internet and no one's</v>

1745
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:08.400
<v Speaker 2>actually ever confirmed his identity.</v>

1746
00:54:08.401 --> 00:54:09.450
<v Speaker 2>So it could be just the government</v>

1747
00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.020
<v Speaker 2>or anonymous.</v>

1748
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.120
<v Speaker 2>It's an invisible hacker visit,</v>

1749
00:54:15.121 --> 00:54:16.020
<v Speaker 2>physically invisible.</v>

1750
00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:19.900
<v Speaker 2>So all of the people who are doing the mining who have the,</v>

1751
00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:20.201
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1752
00:54:20.201 --> 00:54:21.031
<v Speaker 2>the hardware in a,</v>

1753
00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:22.860
<v Speaker 2>using it to mine for Bitcoin,</v>

1754
00:54:22.861 --> 00:54:27.690
<v Speaker 2>what they do is they secure the network by running this very hard problem.</v>

1755
00:54:27.691 --> 00:54:30.750
<v Speaker 2>They prevent anyone else from cheating because in order to essentially they end</v>

1756
00:54:30.751 --> 00:54:35.670
<v Speaker 2>up voting on every block together with this enormous computing power and that</v>

1757
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:39.480
<v Speaker 2>enormous computing power means no one can falsify the block because they would</v>

1758
00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:43.650
<v Speaker 2>have to do that much computing power to falsify the the ledger,</v>

1759
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:44.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1760
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:47.850
<v Speaker 2>So if you can't falsify it without doing enormous amounts of computing power,</v>

1761
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:51.420
<v Speaker 2>but if you do enormous amounts of computing power that you get a reward and</v>

1762
00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:56.421
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin while you're going to try and win the game rather than cheat cheating is</v>

1763
00:54:57.091 --> 00:54:58.890
<v Speaker 2>extremely difficult and not rewarding.</v>

1764
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Whereas participating is rewarding.</v>

1765
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1766
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1767
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:08.160
<v Speaker 2>So all of these miners are working and what they do is they verify the</v>

1768
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:10.890
<v Speaker 2>transactions and they secure the entire network,</v>

1769
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:13.590
<v Speaker 2>which actually if you look at it on the grand scheme of things,</v>

1770
00:55:13.591 --> 00:55:18.591
<v Speaker 2>is a lot cheaper than guards and armored trucks and alarm companies and faults</v>

1771
00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:22.350
<v Speaker 2>and data centers and fraud prevention center is,</v>

1772
00:55:22.351 --> 00:55:25.290
<v Speaker 2>and all of those things that we have in our traditional payment system,</v>

1773
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:28.920
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a lot cheaper to do it by proving you're doing all of this</v>

1774
00:55:28.921 --> 00:55:30.960
<v Speaker 2>computation for the network security.</v>

1775
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Now they collect fees.</v>

1776
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 2>So when they verify a block,</v>

1777
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:38.970
<v Speaker 2>the person who manages the verify at first by finding this little magic number,</v>

1778
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 2>the solution to the problem,</v>

1779
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:41.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll explain that in a second,</v>

1780
00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.500
<v Speaker 2>collects the fees that are in the block.</v>

1781
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:45.280
<v Speaker 2>So all of the transactions that get verified.</v>

1782
00:55:45.281 --> 00:55:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Then the next 10 minutes,</v>

1783
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:49.260
<v Speaker 2>the miner who finds that block will collect all of the little fees.</v>

1784
00:55:49.261 --> 00:55:50.011
<v Speaker 2>40 cents here,</v>

1785
00:55:50.011 --> 00:55:51.630
<v Speaker 2>40 cents they are 40 cents there.</v>

1786
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:55.740
<v Speaker 2>It's about 40 40 cents to send a simple transaction right now and they'll also</v>

1787
00:55:55.741 --> 00:55:59.670
<v Speaker 2>get a reward of 25 bitcoin and then everyone will start the race again to,</v>

1788
00:55:59.671 --> 00:56:03.030
<v Speaker 2>to verify the next block of transactions for the next 10 minutes of spending.</v>

1789
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:07.530
<v Speaker 2>And the first one to find the solution wins gets the reward,</v>

1790
00:56:07.531 --> 00:56:09.750
<v Speaker 2>gets the fees and they all start competing again.</v>

1791
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.340
<v Speaker 2>But you don't know who's going to win it.</v>

1792
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:15.300
<v Speaker 2>And the enormous amount of computation that goes into its ensures that no one</v>

1793
00:56:15.301 --> 00:56:16.134
<v Speaker 2>can cheat.</v>

1794
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Even if you put together the 600 most powerful supercomputers in the world,</v>

1795
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.890
<v Speaker 2>you would not be able to get to to beat the system right now.</v>

1796
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 4>What a fascinating element to be added to the idea of the economy.</v>

1797
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.901
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1798
00:56:28.901 --> 00:56:33.901
<v Speaker 4>this idea of the unified group of computers working on ever increasingly complex</v>

1799
00:56:35.021 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 4>computations.</v>

1800
00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.890
<v Speaker 2>So the scientific term for it is a consensus assets ledger,</v>

1801
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:43.130
<v Speaker 2>which means it's a lighter or list of transactions about assets.</v>

1802
00:56:43.131 --> 00:56:43.611
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>

1803
00:56:43.611 --> 00:56:48.290
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin that's based on consensus on agreement and the agreement is reached by</v>

1804
00:56:48.291 --> 00:56:50.420
<v Speaker 2>everyone voting with their computing power.</v>

1805
00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:52.580
<v Speaker 2>And because there's so much of it,</v>

1806
00:56:52.581 --> 00:56:53.720
<v Speaker 2>you can't cheat the election.</v>

1807
00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:54.631
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1808
00:56:54.631 --> 00:56:58.950
<v Speaker 4>when you said that there have been other attempts at a new type of currency that</v>

1809
00:56:58.951 --> 00:57:02.040
<v Speaker 4>had been shut down by the current banking system,</v>

1810
00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:07.560
<v Speaker 4>that was because they had a place where they had centralized servers exactly</v>

1811
00:57:07.561 --> 00:57:08.780
<v Speaker 4>operated or the centralized service</v>

1812
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 2>or a centralized organization or a centralized something.</v>

1813
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:12.820
<v Speaker 2>What did they do to stop it?</v>

1814
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:13.271
<v Speaker 4>That movie?</v>

1815
00:57:13.271 --> 00:57:17.130
<v Speaker 4>Is there any legality issues when it comes to doing something like this or</v>

1816
00:57:17.131 --> 00:57:19.470
<v Speaker 4>creating a new type of currency?</v>

1817
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.601
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

1818
00:57:20.601 --> 00:57:20.691
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1819
00:57:20.691 --> 00:57:21.340
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

1820
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.480
<v Speaker 2>there's an enormous legality issues.</v>

1821
00:57:23.481 --> 00:57:28.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean the banking system has this fortress wall of regulations around it that</v>

1822
00:57:29.031 --> 00:57:34.031
<v Speaker 2>acts partly supposedly to protect consumers from misbehaving banks but also</v>

1823
00:57:34.701 --> 00:57:37.850
<v Speaker 2>serves very well to prevent competition from small banks because it's very</v>

1824
00:57:37.851 --> 00:57:38.960
<v Speaker 2>expensive to do to,</v>

1825
00:57:38.961 --> 00:57:39.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1826
00:57:39.201 --> 00:57:40.340
<v Speaker 2>pass all the tests.</v>

1827
00:57:40.341 --> 00:57:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1828
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.060
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1829
00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Say keeps the RAF the rabble out,</v>

1830
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.761
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1831
00:57:43.761 --> 00:57:44.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1832
00:57:44.211 --> 00:57:48.070
<v Speaker 2>then a lot of the criminals end up being inside this whole system here.</v>

1833
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing that,</v>

1834
00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:53.330
<v Speaker 2>that whole regulatory system comes down hard on people who had decided to want</v>

1835
00:57:53.331 --> 00:57:54.530
<v Speaker 2>to create their own currency.</v>

1836
00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.280
<v Speaker 2>And the Nice thing about bitcoin is that there is no one there.</v>

1837
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:01.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1838
00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.280
<v Speaker 2>basically in agreement when you say comes down hard,</v>

1839
00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:05.630
<v Speaker 2>like in what manner?</v>

1840
00:58:05.631 --> 00:58:06.111
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>

1841
00:58:06.111 --> 00:58:07.040
<v Speaker 2>how would they come down hard?</v>

1842
00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:09.230
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say you just asset forfeiture,</v>

1843
00:58:09.231 --> 00:58:09.741
<v Speaker 2>seizures,</v>

1844
00:58:09.741 --> 00:58:10.491
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits,</v>

1845
00:58:10.491 --> 00:58:12.110
<v Speaker 2>a money laundering charges,</v>

1846
00:58:12.111 --> 00:58:13.160
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of things like that.</v>

1847
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:17.060
<v Speaker 2>And this is because you're not doing things by regulation,</v>

1848
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:18.020
<v Speaker 2>is that what you're saying?</v>

1849
00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:18.201
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1850
00:58:18.201 --> 00:58:20.030
<v Speaker 2>it has happened that way in the past.</v>

1851
00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:21.200
<v Speaker 2>So you no matter what,</v>

1852
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:24.470
<v Speaker 4>what if you decide to create your own currency and you have an actual business</v>

1853
00:58:24.471 --> 00:58:27.500
<v Speaker 4>and you were a centralized business that essentially be centralized.</v>

1854
00:58:27.501 --> 00:58:31.850
<v Speaker 4>Business is responsible for following all of the government standards on banking</v>

1855
00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.470
<v Speaker 4>100% across the board.</v>

1856
00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:34.400
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't,</v>

1857
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.080
<v Speaker 4>that's where money laundering charges,</v>

1858
00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.840
<v Speaker 4>larceny and a lot of different</v>

1859
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:41.070
<v Speaker 2>charges get brought up is that,</v>

1860
00:58:41.071 --> 00:58:44.040
<v Speaker 2>that's what goes on now that's avoided somehow or another through bitcoin</v>

1861
00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.230
<v Speaker 2>because of the voided.</v>

1862
00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.210
<v Speaker 2>It's simply the bitcoin is a completely decentralized system.</v>

1863
00:58:48.211 --> 00:58:49.530
<v Speaker 2>It works based on math.</v>

1864
00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:50.640
<v Speaker 2>So there is no,</v>

1865
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.110
<v Speaker 2>there's no one running bitcoin.</v>

1866
00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:55.800
<v Speaker 2>It was an invention just like someone invented electricity than we all learned</v>

1867
00:58:55.801 --> 00:58:58.140
<v Speaker 2>how it worked and we all ended up using it.</v>

1868
00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:00.420
<v Speaker 2>But does it matter who you know,</v>

1869
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.580
<v Speaker 2>invented the electricity that makes us light work?</v>

1870
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:03.463
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1871
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin is like that.</v>

1872
00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:05.491
<v Speaker 2>It's a standard.</v>

1873
00:59:05.491 --> 00:59:10.020
<v Speaker 2>It's an idea and it runs by people participating in the network.</v>

1874
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.720
<v Speaker 2>So there's nothing,</v>

1875
00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:13.140
<v Speaker 2>there is no central location,</v>

1876
00:59:13.141 --> 00:59:14.520
<v Speaker 2>there's no company behind it,</v>

1877
00:59:14.521 --> 00:59:15.331
<v Speaker 2>there's no leader,</v>

1878
00:59:15.331 --> 00:59:16.170
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>

1879
00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:17.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a decentralized,</v>

1880
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:18.990
<v Speaker 2>it's just like no one runs the Internet.</v>

1881
00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:19.951
<v Speaker 2>So if you say,</v>

1882
00:59:19.951 --> 00:59:21.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the Internet to do this,</v>

1883
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>who are</v>

1884
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.813
<v Speaker 5>you gonna sue?</v>

1885
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.880
<v Speaker 5>It's a global network.</v>

1886
00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:25.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1887
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:30.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean what Al Gore Al Gore for inventing it.</v>

1888
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:30.531
<v Speaker 5>Why it's,</v>

1889
00:59:30.531 --> 00:59:33.560
<v Speaker 5>well that's one of the reasons to Toshi Nakamoto disappeared because he was</v>

1890
00:59:33.561 --> 00:59:34.970
<v Speaker 5>smart enough to know that uh,</v>

1891
00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:35.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1892
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:39.050
<v Speaker 5>smearing him would affect bitcoin but couldn't he could since he programmed</v>

1893
00:59:39.051 --> 00:59:39.860
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>

1894
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:42.590
<v Speaker 5>have access to everybody's money if he wanted to know.</v>

1895
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:43.700
<v Speaker 5>So let me explain that.</v>

1896
00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:48.710
<v Speaker 5>The software itself is so called open source software.</v>

1897
00:59:48.711 --> 00:59:53.240
<v Speaker 5>That means that it's a recipe of code that implements the,</v>

1898
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:55.970
<v Speaker 5>the big coin agreement according to the network standards.</v>

1899
00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:58.490
<v Speaker 5>And you can write your own,</v>

1900
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you don't want to run that software you can write a version of it.</v>

1901
01:00:01.311 --> 01:00:01.731
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

1902
01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:03.830
<v Speaker 5>there are five or six different,</v>

1903
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:04.610
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1904
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:04.881
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1905
01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:07.670
<v Speaker 5>fully compliant versions that can participate in the network.</v>

1906
01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:11.900
<v Speaker 5>And even if you take the basic one that started with him writing it,</v>

1907
01:00:11.901 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 5>but since has involved in a community project with lots of people writing code,</v>

1908
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:16.641
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1909
01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:17.780
<v Speaker 5>just like the intranet,</v>

1910
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.201
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1911
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:20.030
<v Speaker 5>you just agree to play by the rules.</v>

1912
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.670
<v Speaker 5>And then you can read the code and you can see exactly what happens.</v>

1913
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:24.020
<v Speaker 5>There is no controls in there.</v>

1914
01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:26.240
<v Speaker 5>There's no magic secret keys.</v>

1915
01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:27.500
<v Speaker 5>You can see how it works.</v>

1916
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:27.921
<v Speaker 5>What do you,</v>

1917
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:28.521
<v Speaker 5>what are you saying?</v>

1918
01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:29.354
<v Speaker 5>Hold on a second.</v>

1919
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:33.050
<v Speaker 5>There's five or six different types of bitcoin.</v>

1920
01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:33.800
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1921
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.700
<v Speaker 5>there's five or six different programs that can,</v>

1922
01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.660
<v Speaker 5>that can do the full bitcoin,</v>

1923
01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1924
01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:39.800
<v Speaker 5>language on the bitcoin network.</v>

1925
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:41.060
<v Speaker 5>Five or six different versions,</v>

1926
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:43.010
<v Speaker 5>but they all speak bitcoin so it doesn't matter.</v>

1927
01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.830
<v Speaker 5>But what are they doing differently than the other ones?</v>

1928
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:47.600
<v Speaker 5>Just um,</v>

1929
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:48.180
<v Speaker 5>different ways,</v>

1930
01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.970
<v Speaker 5>different programming languages,</v>

1931
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.380
<v Speaker 5>different ways of implementing them.</v>

1932
01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.720
<v Speaker 5>Some are more efficient in some ways.</v>

1933
01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:53.930
<v Speaker 5>Some are more efficient than the others,</v>

1934
01:00:53.931 --> 01:00:55.760
<v Speaker 5>but they don't do anything different in terms of bitcoin.</v>

1935
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.590
<v Speaker 5>So there's just like,</v>

1936
01:00:57.591 --> 01:01:01.880
<v Speaker 5>there are lots of different internet routers and they all speak TCP Ip on the</v>

1937
01:01:01.881 --> 01:01:02.691
<v Speaker 5>internets and you know,</v>

1938
01:01:02.691 --> 01:01:06.440
<v Speaker 5>Cisco makes some [inaudible] juniper networks make some others in HP makes them</v>

1939
01:01:06.441 --> 01:01:06.711
<v Speaker 5>others,</v>

1940
01:01:06.711 --> 01:01:07.820
<v Speaker 5>but they all speak the same.</v>

1941
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.780
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

1942
01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:10.580
<v Speaker 5>So there's no concern whatsoever.</v>

1943
01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:15.590
<v Speaker 5>There's any security openings because of the fact that these guys are producing</v>

1944
01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:16.911
<v Speaker 5>their own software.</v>

1945
01:01:16.911 --> 01:01:17.830
<v Speaker 5>That communicates in big,</v>

1946
01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:18.530
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1947
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:21.860
<v Speaker 5>Because the trust is based on computation,</v>

1948
01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:22.694
<v Speaker 5>not taxes.</v>

1949
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.230
<v Speaker 5>So this is a key thing to realize all of our payment systems and banking systems</v>

1950
01:01:27.231 --> 01:01:31.520
<v Speaker 5>up to now keep trust in the system by keeping people out,</v>

1951
01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:34.070
<v Speaker 5>by controlling very carefully who connects to the network.</v>

1952
01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:35.750
<v Speaker 5>And that means the network is always very small.</v>

1953
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.920
<v Speaker 5>In bitcoin,</v>

1954
01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.190
<v Speaker 5>all of the trust is done by this joint computation,</v>

1955
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.090
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1956
01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:45.530
<v Speaker 5>And so who talks the network doesn't matter because the network is trusted and</v>

1957
01:01:45.531 --> 01:01:50.240
<v Speaker 5>safe regardless of what you try to send to it or receive from it or how you</v>

1958
01:01:50.241 --> 01:01:51.830
<v Speaker 5>interpret it because there's no center.</v>

1959
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:57.250
<v Speaker 5>So this has radical implications because that means you can let anyone talk to</v>

1960
01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:03.311
<v Speaker 5>the network or rather you can let everyone talk to the network and everyone can</v>

1961
01:02:03.411 --> 01:02:07.100
<v Speaker 5>be a bank on that network and everyone can send wires,</v>

1962
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:11.990
<v Speaker 5>transfers on that network power of a bank on your smartphone.</v>

1963
01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.590
<v Speaker 5>And as long as it speaks to the bitcoin language and understands it with the</v>

1964
01:02:15.591 --> 01:02:16.520
<v Speaker 5>rest of the network,</v>

1965
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:17.960
<v Speaker 5>you don't need to trust,</v>

1966
01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:19.650
<v Speaker 5>you know it,</v>

1967
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 5>that that</v>

1968
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.270
<v Speaker 2>application is running.</v>

1969
01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:23.940
<v Speaker 2>The trust happens in the transactions in the network,</v>

1970
01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:25.270
<v Speaker 2>you can't cheat no matter what you do.</v>

1971
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:25.980
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1972
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.200
<v Speaker 4>So what is the motivation to write a new software?</v>

1973
01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:29.034
<v Speaker 4>What does the mode</v>

1974
01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:29.400
<v Speaker 2>fish,</v>

1975
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like there are different pieces that all run windows.</v>

1976
01:02:31.631 --> 01:02:32.350
<v Speaker 2>There's you know,</v>

1977
01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:34.090
<v Speaker 2>different clients that all run picc line.</v>

1978
01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:35.350
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>

1979
01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:39.400
<v Speaker 4>So they just have to sit at decided to run their own program that that speaks</v>

1980
01:02:39.401 --> 01:02:42.130
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin but it participates in the exact same fashion.</v>

1981
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.411
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1982
01:02:42.411 --> 01:02:46.070
<v Speaker 2>You have a chrome browser or you have a Firefox browser or why there too,</v>

1983
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:47.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1984
01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>

1985
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1986
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.380
<v Speaker 2>In fact it's very similar or like a bit torrent client.</v>

1987
01:02:51.381 --> 01:02:52.490
<v Speaker 2>There are three different versions,</v>

1988
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.880
<v Speaker 2>but they all speak bitterns and your brows is all speak http,</v>

1989
01:02:55.881 --> 01:02:57.590
<v Speaker 2>the hypertext transfer protocol.</v>

1990
01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.500
<v Speaker 2>So no matter what website you go to,</v>

1991
01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.850
<v Speaker 2>and there are lots of websites,</v>

1992
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:06.590
<v Speaker 2>programs that made by different companies that speak the server side of the web.</v>

1993
01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:07.341
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1994
01:03:07.341 --> 01:03:08.570
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of different versions.</v>

1995
01:03:08.571 --> 01:03:11.480
<v Speaker 2>But what matters is the common language they speak.</v>

1996
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:12.530
<v Speaker 2>And bitcoin is like that.</v>

1997
01:03:12.531 --> 01:03:13.370
<v Speaker 2>It's a common language,</v>

1998
01:03:13.371 --> 01:03:14.930
<v Speaker 2>a protocol or standard.</v>

1999
01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:18.500
<v Speaker 2>And that means that no matter what you attached to the network,</v>

2000
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.580
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a a wallet that's written for Androids,</v>

2001
01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:27.410
<v Speaker 2>a wallet that's written for Iphone or a wallet that's fancier or a wallet</v>

2002
01:03:27.411 --> 01:03:27.830
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2003
01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:29.150
<v Speaker 2>that's more geeky.</v>

2004
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>All of these will speak Bitcoin to the network and we'll work with a system and</v>

2005
01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:34.940
<v Speaker 2>the trust is in the network.</v>

2006
01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:35.611
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2007
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:38.070
<v Speaker 4>when we were talking earlier about the,</v>

2008
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:40.110
<v Speaker 4>if you had a centralized location,</v>

2009
01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.140
<v Speaker 4>centralized server that can be shut down by the banks and they could charge you</v>

2010
01:03:43.141 --> 01:03:43.974
<v Speaker 4>with all these crimes,</v>

2011
01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:49.370
<v Speaker 4>is there any concern legally speaking that if you were a person who has all your</v>

2012
01:03:51.031 --> 01:03:55.560
<v Speaker 4>money in bitcoin that maybe one day the government could come along and say,</v>

2013
01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:58.470
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin is not a valid currency,</v>

2014
01:03:58.471 --> 01:04:02.790
<v Speaker 4>it's illegal to use using it as a crime and we find it on you,</v>

2015
01:04:02.791 --> 01:04:05.400
<v Speaker 4>we're going to take it from you and we're going to arrest you?</v>

2016
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:05.911
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2017
01:04:05.911 --> 01:04:06.171
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

2018
01:04:06.171 --> 01:04:06.290
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2019
01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Government has already said that bitcoin is legal and that users using bitcoin</v>

2020
01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:15.320
<v Speaker 2>are are doing perfectly legal business.</v>

2021
01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Can you pay taxes in Bitcoin?</v>

2022
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not directly,</v>

2023
01:04:18.261 --> 01:04:18.471
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2024
01:04:18.471 --> 01:04:19.730
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to convert it to dollars,</v>

2025
01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:22.400
<v Speaker 2>but as a company that will take your bitcoin and pay the taxes for you.</v>

2026
01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.353
<v Speaker 2>Bingo.</v>

2027
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:25.303
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2028
01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:26.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2029
01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:26.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2030
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:27.500
<v Speaker 2>back in April,</v>

2031
01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:28.580
<v Speaker 2>the fin cen,</v>

2032
01:04:28.581 --> 01:04:31.310
<v Speaker 2>which is the financial crimes enforcement network,</v>

2033
01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:32.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2034
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:35.800
<v Speaker 2>created a memorandum where it explains how we treat bitcoin.</v>

2035
01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:36.290
<v Speaker 2>And it said,</v>

2036
01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:37.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2037
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.430
<v Speaker 2>if you're just an individual using bitcoin to buy and sell things,</v>

2038
01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:41.623
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

2039
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:42.980
<v Speaker 2>It's just like anything else you,</v>

2040
01:04:42.981 --> 01:04:43.814
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pay,</v>

2041
01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:44.451
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2042
01:04:44.451 --> 01:04:46.790
<v Speaker 2>you know you're going to pay your transaction.</v>

2043
01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:47.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

2044
01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.390
<v Speaker 2>If you're someone who makes a living in Bitcoin,</v>

2045
01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:51.860
<v Speaker 2>you pay income tax.</v>

2046
01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.420
<v Speaker 2>And if you're someone who's mining on Bitcoin,</v>

2047
01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.090
<v Speaker 2>you pay income tax on those bitcoins.</v>

2048
01:04:56.091 --> 01:04:57.290
<v Speaker 2>So if you're an investor,</v>

2049
01:04:58.310 --> 01:04:59.570
<v Speaker 2>you pay capital gains.</v>

2050
01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.060
<v Speaker 2>It's treated just like any other currency.</v>

2051
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.320
<v Speaker 4>So if you make your living off Bitcoin,</v>

2052
01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:05.310
<v Speaker 4>that's how you get paid.</v>

2053
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:06.840
<v Speaker 4>You convert that to dollars,</v>

2054
01:05:06.841 --> 01:05:08.250
<v Speaker 4>then you pay a percentage in dollars.</v>

2055
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.001
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you should do?</v>

2056
01:05:09.001 --> 01:05:13.290
<v Speaker 4>You convert like how much you made in Bitcoin coin in the year and what that</v>

2057
01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:15.900
<v Speaker 4>would be in dollar bills and then pay the percentage on that.</v>

2058
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:16.681
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2059
01:05:16.681 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that's not different</v>

2060
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.880
<v Speaker 4>from what I did before.</v>

2061
01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:20.110
<v Speaker 4>When I got paid in euros.</v>

2062
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:22.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean occasionally I get a paycheck from a customer in Europe.</v>

2063
01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:23.680
<v Speaker 4>They're going to pay me in euro's,</v>

2064
01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:23.920
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2065
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.341
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>

2066
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:25.420
<v Speaker 4>You convert it to dollars.</v>

2067
01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.550
<v Speaker 4>You mark the rates at which they paid you,</v>

2068
01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:28.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2069
01:05:28.001 --> 01:05:28.930
<v Speaker 4>you invoiced them,</v>

2070
01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.520
<v Speaker 4>they paid you in euros,</v>

2071
01:05:30.521 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 4>you mark what rate it was,</v>

2072
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.270
<v Speaker 4>and then you put it on the tax return as income.</v>

2073
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:38.090
<v Speaker 4>People are notoriously bad about reporting income when you know,</v>

2074
01:05:38.091 --> 01:05:39.080
<v Speaker 4>when it's independent,</v>

2075
01:05:39.081 --> 01:05:41.480
<v Speaker 4>when they're not being taxed by their employer,</v>

2076
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:43.340
<v Speaker 4>when it's not coming directly out of their paycheck.</v>

2077
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:46.580
<v Speaker 4>Comedians are terrible about that.</v>

2078
01:05:46.581 --> 01:05:49.940
<v Speaker 4>I know so many comedians that have had like serious IRS problems because of</v>

2079
01:05:49.941 --> 01:05:50.630
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2080
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:55.280
<v Speaker 4>I would think that that sort of issue would arise with bitcoin where people are</v>

2081
01:05:55.281 --> 01:05:58.310
<v Speaker 4>responsible for paying taxes on these and they don't.</v>

2082
01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.031
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2083
01:05:59.031 --> 01:05:59.360
<v Speaker 4>how much,</v>

2084
01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.660
<v Speaker 4>how much of an issue is that and how much of a criminality issue could that</v>

2085
01:06:02.661 --> 01:06:03.494
<v Speaker 4>become?</v>

2086
01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:04.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2087
01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I I think has al Capone found out there was one thing you can too in the u s and</v>

2088
01:06:08.401 --> 01:06:09.660
<v Speaker 2>that's not pay your taxes.</v>

2089
01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:10.501
<v Speaker 2>They might get,</v>

2090
01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:11.730
<v Speaker 2>they might not get you for anything else.</v>

2091
01:06:11.731 --> 01:06:12.231
<v Speaker 2>You pull it up,</v>

2092
01:06:12.231 --> 01:06:12.400
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2093
01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I keep pulling up these orders,</v>

2094
01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I pay my taxes and uh,</v>

2095
01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.230
<v Speaker 2>and if you earn money in Bitcoin,</v>

2096
01:06:19.231 --> 01:06:21.120
<v Speaker 2>you pay your taxes on Bitcoin is simple as death.</v>

2097
01:06:21.121 --> 01:06:23.550
<v Speaker 2>And if you think you can get away with not doing that,</v>

2098
01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:27.660
<v Speaker 2>then you'll find out like many people before you that the IRS will come,</v>

2099
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.470
<v Speaker 2>will audit you and you will end up paying a lot more.</v>

2100
01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:31.801
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2101
01:06:31.801 --> 01:06:35.940
<v Speaker 4>Even if you want to pay them back and agree to pay them back,</v>

2102
01:06:35.941 --> 01:06:37.020
<v Speaker 4>they still put you in jail.</v>

2103
01:06:37.290 --> 01:06:38.100
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2104
01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you need to sit in a cage for a little while and think about what</v>

2105
01:06:40.771 --> 01:06:41.510
<v Speaker 4>you did.</v>

2106
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.751
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2107
01:06:41.751 --> 01:06:41.841
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2108
01:06:41.841 --> 01:06:42.050
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2109
01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:44.600
<v Speaker 2>that would simply be a monumentally stupid sink to do,</v>

2110
01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:45.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2111
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:47.090
<v Speaker 2>to think that somehow that would protect.</v>

2112
01:06:47.091 --> 01:06:47.391
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2113
01:06:47.391 --> 01:06:50.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're going to track down your accounts just as effectively with</v>

2114
01:06:50.331 --> 01:06:51.830
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin as they deal with other things.</v>

2115
01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:52.790
<v Speaker 2>They're not stupid.</v>

2116
01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:53.960
<v Speaker 2>What are these articles you keep pulling up?</v>

2117
01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

2118
01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:58.580
<v Speaker 2>just keep on finding new things about different news reports.</v>

2119
01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Like this was a four hours ago where two guys have been arrested a major,</v>

2120
01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.030
<v Speaker 2>a prominent players in the bitcoin universe.</v>

2121
01:07:05.031 --> 01:07:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Charles Sherman was arrested by federal prosecutors on Sunday and accused of</v>

2122
01:07:08.931 --> 01:07:11.150
<v Speaker 2>helping grease the wheels for drug transactions,</v>

2123
01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:11.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2124
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:12.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2125
01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:14.630
<v Speaker 2>using bitcoins and uh,</v>

2126
01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Mr Shrem was also the founder and chief executive of popular website called bit</v>

2127
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:20.720
<v Speaker 2>instant.</v>

2128
01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.300
<v Speaker 2>We're bitcoins could be bought using dollars.</v>

2129
01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.550
<v Speaker 2>And so what it seems like there's a lot of people getting arrested though.</v>

2130
01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:30.800
<v Speaker 2>There was another guy that I flashed up earlier that was arrested.</v>

2131
01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's a lot of shady stuff going on in this universe right now.</v>

2132
01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.131
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

2133
01:07:37.131 --> 01:07:39.510
<v Speaker 2>that's the only reason I never went and got into bitcoins.</v>

2134
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:44.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel nervous about all these like recent news things at all or cause</v>

2135
01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.080
<v Speaker 2>you seem very pro like I,</v>

2136
01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about it at all.</v>

2137
01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Stated playstation that people are not going to stop going online and shopping</v>

2138
01:07:53.921 --> 01:07:55.930
<v Speaker 4>on amazon.com of Amazon gets hacked.</v>

2139
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:59.320
<v Speaker 4>What you're dealing with is a few people that are scumbags,</v>

2140
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:04.500
<v Speaker 4>that are operating in this a truly revolutionary system that is very beneficial.</v>

2141
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2142
01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:06.390
<v Speaker 2>But this is like hitting send counselors.</v>

2143
01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:07.060
<v Speaker 2>There's bank,</v>

2144
01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.350
<v Speaker 2>this is like robbing a bank,</v>

2145
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:08.950
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2146
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:09.161
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2147
01:08:09.161 --> 01:08:09.311
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2148
01:08:09.311 --> 01:08:10.144
<v Speaker 2>in this whole,</v>

2149
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.560
<v Speaker 2>so here's my perspective.</v>

2150
01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:12.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2151
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.840
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin is a,</v>

2152
01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 2>technology is</v>

2153
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:21.310
<v Speaker 5>powerful and is being used by school teachers to manage a PTA groups.</v>

2154
01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:28.060
<v Speaker 5>It's been used by churches to manage tithing and their collection plates.</v>

2155
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:33.080
<v Speaker 5>And there are clubs and it's also being used by criminals occasionally to do</v>

2156
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:35.450
<v Speaker 5>crimes just like any other currency.</v>

2157
01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

2158
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.120
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2159
01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:37.590
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2160
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:41.360
<v Speaker 5>the point is that compared to another currency like the dollar,</v>

2161
01:08:41.710 --> 01:08:41.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2162
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:42.321
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2163
01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:42.650
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2164
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:44.960
<v Speaker 5>the money laundering that happens with a dollar,</v>

2165
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.231
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2166
01:08:45.231 --> 01:08:49.730
<v Speaker 5>HSBC was found and convicted under consent agreements,</v>

2167
01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:54.731
<v Speaker 5>I think for $17 billion of money laundering with the worst Mexican cartels.</v>

2168
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:59.570
<v Speaker 5>And they got a minor fine and no one went to jail.</v>

2169
01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:03.050
<v Speaker 5>And what Cocoavia was money laundering,</v>

2170
01:09:03.051 --> 01:09:05.270
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of billions of dollars with,</v>

2171
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:05.541
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2172
01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:05.961
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

2173
01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:06.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2174
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.390
<v Speaker 5>various drug cartels in Asia.</v>

2175
01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.160
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

2176
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:11.760
<v Speaker 5>nothing happened.</v>

2177
01:09:11.761 --> 01:09:16.430
<v Speaker 5>So let's not pretend that suddenly bitcoin is like this criminal,</v>

2178
01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:17.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2179
01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:18.021
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

2180
01:09:18.021 --> 01:09:18.450
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

2181
01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:21.830
<v Speaker 5>it just represents just like the Internet represents society and you get the</v>

2182
01:09:21.831 --> 01:09:22.790
<v Speaker 5>whole spectrum.</v>

2183
01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.860
<v Speaker 5>Bitcoin as a currency can be used for economic activity and that means the whole</v>

2184
01:09:27.861 --> 01:09:28.694
<v Speaker 5>spectrum.</v>

2185
01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:32.660
<v Speaker 5>And you'll have a small subset who are people who take advantage and then you</v>

2186
01:09:32.661 --> 01:09:34.070
<v Speaker 5>have the vast majority.</v>

2187
01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:36.200
<v Speaker 5>Increasingly now it's getting more mainstream.</v>

2188
01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:41.970
<v Speaker 5>I see the possibility of being able to do exciting new things with money that</v>

2189
01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:44.930
<v Speaker 5>weren't possible before and,</v>

2190
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.910
<v Speaker 5>and to enable new forms of commerce.</v>

2191
01:09:46.911 --> 01:09:47.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2192
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:51.140
<v Speaker 5>there are hundreds of startups that are innovating with new forms of,</v>

2193
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:52.431
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2194
01:09:52.431 --> 01:09:57.431
<v Speaker 5>how to do settlement and escrow on a real estate transaction and not spend 2% on</v>

2195
01:09:58.191 --> 01:10:01.160
<v Speaker 5>that but do it with bitcoin much more safely,</v>

2196
01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:02.330
<v Speaker 5>much more effectively.</v>

2197
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:06.730
<v Speaker 5>Companies that are working on doing charitable foundations based on Bitcoin</v>

2198
01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:07.573
<v Speaker 5>endowments,</v>

2199
01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.060
<v Speaker 5>charities that are working to do remittances to foreign countries to help the</v>

2200
01:10:11.061 --> 01:10:11.894
<v Speaker 5>poor people.</v>

2201
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.411
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2202
01:10:12.411 --> 01:10:14.270
<v Speaker 5>all kinds of activities are happening.</v>

2203
01:10:14.271 --> 01:10:17.570
<v Speaker 5>But what is the primary focus of the media?</v>

2204
01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.750
<v Speaker 5>It is to generate page views and you know,</v>

2205
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 5>portraying the sensationalist stuff always wins out.</v>

2206
01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.480
<v Speaker 5>So there's a lot more to bitcoin.</v>

2207
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:28.940
<v Speaker 5>Don't get fooled by the fact that,</v>

2208
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:29.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2209
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.530
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>

2210
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:33.380
<v Speaker 5>some things are emphasized as if that's the be all.</v>

2211
01:10:33.381 --> 01:10:36.260
<v Speaker 5>And Adult Ed Coyle was certainly some things are emphasized,</v>

2212
01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:37.520
<v Speaker 5>but those are legitimate stories.</v>

2213
01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:37.671
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2214
01:10:37.671 --> 01:10:40.460
<v Speaker 5>that was a legitimate story that the stores are arrested for.</v>

2215
01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:45.440
<v Speaker 5>You can't judge the media on reporting legitimate crimes.</v>

2216
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.681
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2217
01:10:45.681 --> 01:10:46.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's the,</v>

2218
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:47.534
<v Speaker 5>that's the issue.</v>

2219
01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:48.470
<v Speaker 5>The problem is,</v>

2220
01:10:48.471 --> 01:10:48.711
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2221
01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:50.870
<v Speaker 5>you get a lot more of that than,</v>

2222
01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:53.600
<v Speaker 5>than is actually occurring and you get a lot less of the stuff.</v>

2223
01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:55.820
<v Speaker 5>That's really interesting and important in my view.</v>

2224
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:56.683
<v Speaker 5>The positive stories.</v>

2225
01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.741
<v Speaker 5>Positive stories.</v>

2226
01:10:57.741 --> 01:10:58.281
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2227
01:10:58.281 --> 01:10:58.850
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2228
01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:00.020
<v Speaker 5>the way I look at Bitcoin,</v>

2229
01:11:00.021 --> 01:11:02.510
<v Speaker 5>I think about the possibility you can create jobs.</v>

2230
01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.940
<v Speaker 5>I look at it as a technological innovation.</v>

2231
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.820
<v Speaker 5>I look at it as an engine for growth in a stagnant economy,</v>

2232
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2233
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:09.231
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2234
01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.850
<v Speaker 5>so those are the things that stick in my mind.</v>

2235
01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:11.271
<v Speaker 5>Jobs,</v>

2236
01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:12.380
<v Speaker 5>innovation and growth.</v>

2237
01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:13.290
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

2238
01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:13.951
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2239
01:11:13.951 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 5>the</v>

2240
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.641
<v Speaker 2>fact that,</v>

2241
01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:14.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2242
01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:18.180
<v Speaker 2>some bad dude used bitcoin to do bad things.</v>

2243
01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:18.651
<v Speaker 4>Your,</v>

2244
01:11:18.651 --> 01:11:22.220
<v Speaker 4>your example of the bank that was laundering money with the drug cartels is</v>

2245
01:11:22.221 --> 01:11:25.520
<v Speaker 4>absolutely perfect because that barely got a peep out of people.</v>

2246
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:27.350
<v Speaker 4>And that was a very recent decision.</v>

2247
01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.280
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2248
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:28.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2249
01:11:28.671 --> 01:11:31.280
<v Speaker 4>I saw some outrage from a few Twitter users.</v>

2250
01:11:31.281 --> 01:11:32.120
<v Speaker 4>I literally,</v>

2251
01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:34.670
<v Speaker 4>I've read the story and my mouth was hanging open.</v>

2252
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:35.361
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2253
01:11:35.361 --> 01:11:38.510
<v Speaker 4>how could they get away with that and just get a fine,</v>

2254
01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:43.780
<v Speaker 4>like they dealt with murderers and they laundered their drug money and they did</v>

2255
01:11:44.241 --> 01:11:46.910
<v Speaker 4>it for a long time and they made a lot of money.</v>

2256
01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:47.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2257
01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:48.140
<v Speaker 4>And they just got a slap</v>

2258
01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:52.520
<v Speaker 2>wasn't even up to the par of the money they made.</v>

2259
01:11:52.521 --> 01:11:53.600
<v Speaker 2>That's the shocking thing.</v>

2260
01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:55.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not even covering the profits they lost,</v>

2261
01:11:55.461 --> 01:11:57.200
<v Speaker 2>which basically rewards and says,</v>

2262
01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:57.441
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2263
01:11:57.441 --> 01:11:57.861
<v Speaker 2>go ahead,</v>

2264
01:11:57.861 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 2>do it again.</v>

2265
01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.900
<v Speaker 2>You made a great return on that investment.</v>

2266
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:05.040
<v Speaker 4>There's a real issue with this whole Mexican drug war is that there's so much</v>

2267
01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:10.041
<v Speaker 4>money to be made and being a part of it and it leaves so many holes open for</v>

2268
01:12:10.921 --> 01:12:11.760
<v Speaker 4>corruption.</v>

2269
01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:14.160
<v Speaker 4>And even legal corruption,</v>

2270
01:12:14.161 --> 01:12:15.780
<v Speaker 4>like this type of stuff where it's,</v>

2271
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.520
<v Speaker 4>it's they do something,</v>

2272
01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:20.640
<v Speaker 4>they get fined by whatever regulatory body,</v>

2273
01:12:20.641 --> 01:12:21.690
<v Speaker 4>but yet they're still in business.</v>

2274
01:12:21.691 --> 01:12:22.260
<v Speaker 4>They're still,</v>

2275
01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:24.660
<v Speaker 4>they're enacting in the profit on that decision,</v>

2276
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:26.460
<v Speaker 4>encouraging,</v>

2277
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:31.470
<v Speaker 4>literally encouraging people to continue to do business with illegal groups like</v>

2278
01:12:31.471 --> 01:12:32.010
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2279
01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:33.720
<v Speaker 4>If you can make that kind of profit,</v>

2280
01:12:33.721 --> 01:12:34.830
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>

2281
01:12:34.831 --> 01:12:36.940
<v Speaker 4>there's a real issue in this country,</v>

2282
01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:41.400
<v Speaker 4>a massive amount of distrust of law enforcement and there's a big part of that</v>

2283
01:12:41.401 --> 01:12:42.234
<v Speaker 4>becomes,</v>

2284
01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:42.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2285
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:44.670
<v Speaker 4>it comes out of the war on drugs.</v>

2286
01:12:44.671 --> 01:12:48.660
<v Speaker 4>It comes out of the war on nicknamed the drug.</v>

2287
01:12:48.690 --> 01:12:48.811
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2288
01:12:48.811 --> 01:12:52.560
<v Speaker 4>whether it's cocaine or whether all these different people that are struggling</v>

2289
01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:57.060
<v Speaker 4>to keep things illegal are pumping up all these businesses that sell these</v>

2290
01:12:57.061 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 4>illegal drugs because there's this massive demand for it.</v>

2291
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.830
<v Speaker 4>So when you see a war on drugs,</v>

2292
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:03.900
<v Speaker 4>w w what's you're seeing is,</v>

2293
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.800
<v Speaker 4>is an engine to generate money for crime.</v>

2294
01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is.</v>

2295
01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:11.580
<v Speaker 4>People are not going to stop altering their consciousness,</v>

2296
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:15.780
<v Speaker 4>but you are ensuring that the people that are profiting off of that are going to</v>

2297
01:13:15.781 --> 01:13:16.614
<v Speaker 4>be criminals.</v>

2298
01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:19.110
<v Speaker 4>And then it leaves the door open for people who are in,</v>

2299
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.100
<v Speaker 4>in actual law enforcement to see these loopholes and see these these ways.</v>

2300
01:13:23.101 --> 01:13:25.680
<v Speaker 4>They could skim a little money to take a little bit home for themselves.</v>

2301
01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.701
<v Speaker 4>And next thing you know,</v>

2302
01:13:26.701 --> 01:13:28.570
<v Speaker 4>you got corruption and next thing you go,</v>

2303
01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:29.520
<v Speaker 4>you got bankers going,</v>

2304
01:13:29.521 --> 01:13:29.970
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2305
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:33.600
<v Speaker 4>I can guarantee you the worst going to happen is we're going to get a fine if I</v>

2306
01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.820
<v Speaker 4>was going to be little and we're going to make a fuck load of money.</v>

2307
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.910
<v Speaker 4>And these guys Pedro's coming over and he's got a donkey cart.</v>

2308
01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Well this,</v>

2309
01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.020
<v Speaker 2>this is the best part of the story in,</v>

2310
01:13:42.021 --> 01:13:43.370
<v Speaker 2>in one of these bank,</v>

2311
01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:43.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2312
01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:48.620
<v Speaker 2>situations where they had these branches and Mexico and they were putting</v>

2313
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:51.470
<v Speaker 2>literally millions of dollars in suitcases,</v>

2314
01:13:51.471 --> 01:13:53.000
<v Speaker 2>a stake in them through the teller window.</v>

2315
01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:58.180
<v Speaker 2>They actually ended up designing and mass manufacturing suitcases that fits</v>

2316
01:13:58.221 --> 01:14:02.240
<v Speaker 2>through the slot because they were doing it every single day.</v>

2317
01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:07.540
<v Speaker 2>So they had a teller window slot fitting briefcase so they could stuff that cash</v>

2318
01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:09.320
<v Speaker 2>through</v>

2319
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.820
<v Speaker 4>and no one went to jail.</v>

2320
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:12.460
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

2321
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.630
<v Speaker 5>that's amazing.</v>

2322
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:14.501
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2323
01:14:14.501 --> 01:14:14.801
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2324
01:14:14.801 --> 01:14:15.634
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2325
01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.790
<v Speaker 5>we can talk about money all day and some money.</v>

2326
01:14:18.791 --> 01:14:21.850
<v Speaker 5>We'll create situations for people to take advantage.</v>

2327
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:22.750
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2328
01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.250
<v Speaker 4>Well it does the way with guns,</v>

2329
01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.120
<v Speaker 4>it's good.</v>

2330
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.050
<v Speaker 4>Does that we were everything.</v>

2331
01:14:26.051 --> 01:14:26.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's that whole,</v>

2332
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:27.754
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2333
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.460
<v Speaker 4>that fast and furious investigation that you know about that there was a worthy</v>

2334
01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:37.540
<v Speaker 4>whatever government agency was selling arms to Mexican drug dealers so that they</v>

2335
01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:39.700
<v Speaker 4>can quote unquote track the guns.</v>

2336
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:40.511
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2337
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:44.260
<v Speaker 4>And it's ridiculous because those guns actually got used for killing American</v>

2338
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:46.000
<v Speaker 4>service members,</v>

2339
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:46.841
<v Speaker 4>American,</v>

2340
01:14:46.841 --> 01:14:49.690
<v Speaker 4>the people that were involved in border patrol,</v>

2341
01:14:49.691 --> 01:14:51.880
<v Speaker 4>people that were involved in law enforcement,</v>

2342
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.931
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these,</v>

2343
01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:53.231
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2344
01:14:53.231 --> 01:14:57.850
<v Speaker 4>these guns wound up being used to actually kill Americans more than one.</v>

2345
01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:58.953
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

2346
01:14:59.030 --> 01:15:01.520
<v Speaker 5>the idea behind it is so preposterous.</v>

2347
01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:06.410
<v Speaker 5>The idea that you're going to sell weapons to criminals so that you could track</v>

2348
01:15:06.411 --> 01:15:07.400
<v Speaker 5>where these weapons go.</v>

2349
01:15:07.401 --> 01:15:07.940
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2350
01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:08.870
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2351
01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.760
<v Speaker 5>that's a fucking terrible idea.</v>

2352
01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.000
<v Speaker 5>These are the people that are in charge of deciding,</v>

2353
01:15:14.001 --> 01:15:14.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2354
01:15:14.541 --> 01:15:18.530
<v Speaker 5>what kind of laws get enforced and what w what atmosphere of law enforcement</v>

2355
01:15:18.531 --> 01:15:18.741
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2356
01:15:18.741 --> 01:15:19.610
<v Speaker 5>this country has.</v>

2357
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:20.930
<v Speaker 5>And when you see things like that,</v>

2358
01:15:20.931 --> 01:15:25.450
<v Speaker 5>it's so frustrating and confusing because it seems almost like a Palladian</v>

2359
01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:26.240
<v Speaker 5>crime.</v>

2360
01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.800
<v Speaker 5>Like someone's solds sold some guns to these Mexican drug lords and they did it</v>

2361
01:15:30.801 --> 01:15:33.710
<v Speaker 5>under the guise of this crazy operation.</v>

2362
01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.680
<v Speaker 5>We're just going to sell them guns and keep an eye on them that way.</v>

2363
01:15:36.681 --> 01:15:38.630
<v Speaker 5>We'll track them and then we're going to get them that way.</v>

2364
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:41.750
<v Speaker 5>You're giving them guns like that's what they want.</v>

2365
01:15:41.751 --> 01:15:43.880
<v Speaker 5>That's what they need to perform crimes.</v>

2366
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:45.140
<v Speaker 5>You're giving them tools.</v>

2367
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:47.420
<v Speaker 5>It's like a guy who's a fucking carpenter.</v>

2368
01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.890
<v Speaker 5>You're giving them a saw and a hammer.</v>

2369
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:51.590
<v Speaker 5>You're giving it to him and you're literally telling them to go use them.</v>

2370
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.951
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2371
01:15:51.951 --> 01:15:54.050
<v Speaker 5>that's essentially what you're doing and you're profiting off that.</v>

2372
01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:54.531
<v Speaker 5>How was,</v>

2373
01:15:54.531 --> 01:15:56.330
<v Speaker 5>how were you not in jail for selling guns?</v>

2374
01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:56.900
<v Speaker 5>How do you,</v>

2375
01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:57.681
<v Speaker 5>how can you say that?</v>

2376
01:15:57.681 --> 01:15:58.514
<v Speaker 5>That was a,</v>

2377
01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:58.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2378
01:15:58.920 --> 01:15:59.691
<v Speaker 5>an idea,</v>

2379
01:15:59.691 --> 01:16:01.040
<v Speaker 5>a plan that you had?</v>

2380
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.701
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2381
01:16:01.701 --> 01:16:02.720
<v Speaker 5>it's unbelievable.</v>

2382
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:03.860
<v Speaker 5>It's unbelievable and it's in,</v>

2383
01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:06.050
<v Speaker 5>it's impossible to,</v>

2384
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:08.070
<v Speaker 5>to read those stories and,</v>

2385
01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:08.913
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2386
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:13.210
<v Speaker 5>and understand how we could ever trust the people that are in charge of,</v>

2387
01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:13.490
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2388
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:14.510
<v Speaker 5>of running this country.</v>

2389
01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.760
<v Speaker 5>If this is something you're capable of doing,</v>

2390
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:18.740
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck can anybody trust you?</v>

2391
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:22.940
<v Speaker 5>How could anybody ever take your leadership seriously if this is what you do?</v>

2392
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:24.830
<v Speaker 5>This is madness.</v>

2393
01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:25.760
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2394
01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's one of the reasons that I think a lot of people are also</v>

2395
01:16:29.661 --> 01:16:32.660
<v Speaker 5>passionate about Bitcoin is that they've realized,</v>

2396
01:16:32.661 --> 01:16:37.340
<v Speaker 5>especially since 2008 that these same people cannot be trusted to run the money</v>

2397
01:16:37.341 --> 01:16:38.090
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

2398
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:39.620
<v Speaker 5>And we've seen now for the last,</v>

2399
01:16:39.621 --> 01:16:40.191
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2400
01:16:40.191 --> 01:16:40.821
<v Speaker 5>five years,</v>

2401
01:16:40.821 --> 01:16:45.821
<v Speaker 5>the Fed has been printing between 85 now tapered down to about $70 billion a</v>

2402
01:16:46.821 --> 01:16:51.821
<v Speaker 5>month and giving it as corporate welfare and direct subsidies to the banks.</v>

2403
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:55.520
<v Speaker 5>So we didn't get a stimulus,</v>

2404
01:16:55.521 --> 01:17:00.521
<v Speaker 5>but they are continuing for five years now to remain solvent based on $70</v>

2405
01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:01.551
<v Speaker 5>billion a month.</v>

2406
01:17:01.551 --> 01:17:02.900
<v Speaker 5>That's $1 trillion a year,</v>

2407
01:17:02.901 --> 01:17:05.660
<v Speaker 5>almost in dollars generated by the Fed.</v>

2408
01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.460
<v Speaker 5>Most people don't even know this is happening.</v>

2409
01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:08.960
<v Speaker 5>These little people running our,</v>

2410
01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 5>and what it means is</v>

2411
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.120
<v Speaker 2>that you go out to use your dollars at the store and suddenly you can buy a lot</v>

2412
01:17:14.121 --> 01:17:17.780
<v Speaker 2>less bread and a lot less milk and a lot fewer eggs.</v>

2413
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:21.230
<v Speaker 2>But then the teak items out of the inflation index.</v>

2414
01:17:21.231 --> 01:17:22.700
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like there is no inflation.</v>

2415
01:17:22.701 --> 01:17:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Where's anybody who's trying to spend their dollars knows that things are</v>

2416
01:17:25.461 --> 01:17:27.290
<v Speaker 2>getting harder and harder and harder,</v>

2417
01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.153
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2418
01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:29.690
<v Speaker 2>These are the people running our money.</v>

2419
01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.410
<v Speaker 2>So bitcoin offers an alternative approach,</v>

2420
01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:35.420
<v Speaker 2>which says let's trust math.</v>

2421
01:17:36.230 --> 01:17:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Let's trust that the system runs based on a rule,</v>

2422
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 2>a simple mathematical role.</v>

2423
01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:45.680
<v Speaker 2>And everybody agrees that that is the rule by which money is created and no one</v>

2424
01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:46.520
<v Speaker 2>can monkey with it.</v>

2425
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.601
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2426
01:17:47.601 --> 01:17:50.540
<v Speaker 2>and that's the beauty of it because if you know the rules,</v>

2427
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:52.340
<v Speaker 2>it reduces the uncertainty,</v>

2428
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:53.780
<v Speaker 2>it reduces the risk.</v>

2429
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:58.010
<v Speaker 2>And when you have a simple system where people can interact with each other and</v>

2430
01:17:58.011 --> 01:18:00.740
<v Speaker 2>exchange money based on simple mathematic rules,</v>

2431
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:05.690
<v Speaker 2>that system's going to do quite well because people no longer trust their</v>

2432
01:18:05.691 --> 01:18:07.220
<v Speaker 2>governments even here.</v>

2433
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:09.650
<v Speaker 2>And it's much worse everywhere else.</v>

2434
01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.690
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that these issues that we have with the financial system and the</v>

2435
01:18:13.691 --> 01:18:18.550
<v Speaker 4>law enforcement system are sort of magnified by the solution of Bitcoin,</v>

2436
01:18:18.730 --> 01:18:22.780
<v Speaker 4>that this being the internet of money that really we need an internet of law</v>

2437
01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:23.440
<v Speaker 4>enforcement.</v>

2438
01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.750
<v Speaker 4>We need an internet of,</v>

2439
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.420
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2440
01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:26.260
<v Speaker 4>of uh,</v>

2441
01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.430
<v Speaker 4>regulations.</v>

2442
01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:29.470
<v Speaker 4>We need what we all agree on.</v>

2443
01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.660
<v Speaker 4>We don't need what's been stuffed down our throat.</v>

2444
01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:36.190
<v Speaker 4>We need what we agree on by consensus based on the information that's currently</v>

2445
01:18:36.191 --> 01:18:36.671
<v Speaker 4>available,</v>

2446
01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:40.060
<v Speaker 4>which is what we would get if we didn't have some sort of a centralized group</v>

2447
01:18:40.061 --> 01:18:43.480
<v Speaker 4>that's in charge of deciding what's legal and not legal,</v>

2448
01:18:43.481 --> 01:18:44.510
<v Speaker 4>how things are enforced,</v>

2449
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:45.490
<v Speaker 4>how things are done,</v>

2450
01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:45.970
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

2451
01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:46.361
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

2452
01:18:46.361 --> 01:18:47.670
<v Speaker 4>how laws are,</v>

2453
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.980
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

2454
01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:48.813
<v Speaker 2>are created.</v>

2455
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about smart law and smart contracts cause this is a perfect</v>

2456
01:18:52.271 --> 01:18:53.104
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>

2457
01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:54.573
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin,</v>

2458
01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:55.900
<v Speaker 2>the underlying invention,</v>

2459
01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.570
<v Speaker 2>the blockchain asset ledger as it's called,</v>

2460
01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:02.890
<v Speaker 2>basically allows people to agree on who owns Watson to resolve differences</v>

2461
01:19:02.891 --> 01:19:04.630
<v Speaker 2>through this computation.</v>

2462
01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:08.980
<v Speaker 2>But the basic thing that means is that you can start doing smart contracts.</v>

2463
01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:13.270
<v Speaker 2>That means that you can put contracts into the system and then they either get</v>

2464
01:19:13.271 --> 01:19:17.440
<v Speaker 2>executed because the conditions are met or they do not based on mathematics.</v>

2465
01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:18.521
<v Speaker 2>So you could say,</v>

2466
01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:19.420
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2467
01:19:19.690 --> 01:19:20.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have,</v>

2468
01:19:20.651 --> 01:19:23.170
<v Speaker 2>instead of having a deed to my car,</v>

2469
01:19:23.171 --> 01:19:24.670
<v Speaker 2>the trench does with the TM fee,</v>

2470
01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a digital deed that's on the bitcoin network and when someone</v>

2471
01:19:29.291 --> 01:19:31.390
<v Speaker 2>pays me the money to buy that car,</v>

2472
01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:35.590
<v Speaker 2>that transaction is married to the deed transferring to them.</v>

2473
01:19:35.890 --> 01:19:38.440
<v Speaker 2>And the verification happens by the bitcoin network,</v>

2474
01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:41.470
<v Speaker 2>which I trust based on distributed consensus.</v>

2475
01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:42.460
<v Speaker 2>No one at the center,</v>

2476
01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:43.660
<v Speaker 2>no one monkeying with the rules.</v>

2477
01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:48.930
<v Speaker 2>So now you can start doing contracts and using the same basic mathematics to</v>

2478
01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:51.940
<v Speaker 2>fully resolve contracts.</v>

2479
01:19:51.941 --> 01:19:52.361
<v Speaker 2>You could have,</v>

2480
01:19:52.361 --> 01:19:52.991
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2481
01:19:52.991 --> 01:19:56.890
<v Speaker 2>a parent setting up a number of transactions in the blockchain and the bitcoin</v>

2482
01:19:56.891 --> 01:20:01.891
<v Speaker 2>network is that send money to their kids in two decades when they're going to be</v>

2483
01:20:03.911 --> 01:20:06.280
<v Speaker 2>18 or 20 or 21 right?</v>

2484
01:20:06.810 --> 01:20:11.810
<v Speaker 2>So like a trust fund or a will and you could write that off as a contract and</v>

2485
01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:16.770
<v Speaker 2>then executed on the bitcoin network and the no one can stop it.</v>

2486
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 2>No one can reverse it.</v>

2487
01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.400
<v Speaker 2>No one can invalidate it.</v>

2488
01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:23.070
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty powerful stuff.</v>

2489
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:25.950
<v Speaker 2>It allows people to have contracts between them,</v>

2490
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.860
<v Speaker 2>between each other that are adjudicated,</v>

2491
01:20:28.861 --> 01:20:29.694
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>

2492
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.640
<v Speaker 2>by the bitcoin network based on the mathematical rules.</v>

2493
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 4>And how would these things be enforced if they had to be in a court of law,</v>

2494
01:20:37.741 --> 01:20:39.120
<v Speaker 4>would that ever be an option?</v>

2495
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:41.580
<v Speaker 4>Would they ever be considered legally binding?</v>

2496
01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Well simple.</v>

2497
01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:46.430
<v Speaker 2>The simple matter is that the transaction goes through or the transaction does</v>

2498
01:20:46.431 --> 01:20:50.150
<v Speaker 2>not go through the transaction as either valid because you presented the right</v>

2499
01:20:50.151 --> 01:20:51.770
<v Speaker 2>keys or it is not valid.</v>

2500
01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.870
<v Speaker 2>And once the transaction has gone through,</v>

2501
01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.033
<v Speaker 2>it's gone through.</v>

2502
01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the simple way the network works.</v>

2503
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:59.690
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2504
01:20:59.691 --> 01:21:03.470
<v Speaker 2>adjudication is something that you then have to deal with after the fact.</v>

2505
01:21:03.471 --> 01:21:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Like if a,</v>

2506
01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:04.933
<v Speaker 2>if a,</v>

2507
01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:08.450
<v Speaker 2>if a parent put a transaction in the bitcoin network that gave,</v>

2508
01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:08.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2509
01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:09.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2510
01:21:09.261 --> 01:21:13.490
<v Speaker 2>money to their kid as part of a will is that can't be contested.</v>

2511
01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.950
<v Speaker 2>When that kid presents the key,</v>

2512
01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:17.420
<v Speaker 2>that transaction goes through.</v>

2513
01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Don,</v>

2514
01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.720
<v Speaker 2>the network has agreed that that money has transferred,</v>

2515
01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.213
<v Speaker 2>it's transferred.</v>

2516
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:25.970
<v Speaker 4>So it doesn't need a judge's written consent or it doesn't need</v>

2517
01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:26.261
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2518
01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:28.780
<v Speaker 2>it's mathematical rules instead without,</v>

2519
01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:29.551
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

2520
01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:29.761
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2521
01:21:29.761 --> 01:21:30.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2522
01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:34.900
<v Speaker 2>the benefit of this is that instead of relying on the ambiguity of language,</v>

2523
01:21:34.901 --> 01:21:38.080
<v Speaker 2>which is the basis of most law for many things,</v>

2524
01:21:38.081 --> 01:21:38.914
<v Speaker 2>you will have to,</v>

2525
01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:44.050
<v Speaker 2>but for some simple things like doing an escrow for a house or you know,</v>

2526
01:21:44.051 --> 01:21:48.370
<v Speaker 2>buying a car or transferring property or doing a trust or a will,</v>

2527
01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:53.640
<v Speaker 2>you could simply a convert those legal contracts into bitcoin transactions that</v>

2528
01:21:55.570 --> 01:22:00.130
<v Speaker 2>then get executed under a certain set of rules and suddenly you've got a form of</v>

2529
01:22:00.131 --> 01:22:00.880
<v Speaker 2>smart law,</v>

2530
01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:05.350
<v Speaker 2>self executing law that happens based on the bitcoin network's ability to agree</v>

2531
01:22:05.351 --> 01:22:06.184
<v Speaker 2>on what's true.</v>

2532
01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:12.130
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating to think that this could be one step in an ultimate revamping</v>

2533
01:22:13.311 --> 01:22:18.020
<v Speaker 4>of our society and the revamping of our society based on the Internet and that</v>

2534
01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.720
<v Speaker 4>if bitcoin or and things like Bitcoin,</v>

2535
01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.420
<v Speaker 4>these peer used groups,</v>

2536
01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:24.560
<v Speaker 4>these groups of,</v>

2537
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:25.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2538
01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:29.270
<v Speaker 4>many people agreeing on a standard and a subscribing to a system,</v>

2539
01:22:29.690 --> 01:22:31.280
<v Speaker 4>if that can happen with this,</v>

2540
01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:34.100
<v Speaker 4>they can start happening with a lot of things could start happening with</v>

2541
01:22:34.101 --> 01:22:34.731
<v Speaker 4>education.</v>

2542
01:22:34.731 --> 01:22:36.080
<v Speaker 4>It can start happening with,</v>

2543
01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:36.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2544
01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:38.870
<v Speaker 4>w w with even with law enforcement,</v>

2545
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:39.531
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2546
01:22:39.531 --> 01:22:41.660
<v Speaker 4>the idea of community law enforcement or,</v>

2547
01:22:41.661 --> 01:22:46.661
<v Speaker 4>or figuring out some way to a fun private law enforcement or private contractors</v>

2548
01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.660
<v Speaker 4>based on a situation like this.</v>

2549
01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:51.963
<v Speaker 2>So for,</v>

2550
01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:55.000
<v Speaker 2>for the biggest part of human history,</v>

2551
01:22:55.001 --> 01:22:59.680
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the most difficult problems like communicating at distances or agreeing</v>

2552
01:22:59.681 --> 01:23:02.650
<v Speaker 2>with lots of different people simply didn't scale.</v>

2553
01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:04.840
<v Speaker 2>And because you couldn't scale solutions to those,</v>

2554
01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:07.810
<v Speaker 2>we built hierarchal institutions to solve them.</v>

2555
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Representative democracy,</v>

2556
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:12.880
<v Speaker 2>we built councils and committees to solve decision making.</v>

2557
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.010
<v Speaker 2>We built banks and central banks,</v>

2558
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:15.551
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2559
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:19.090
<v Speaker 2>in order to solve issuance of currency and other things like that.</v>

2560
01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:24.300
<v Speaker 2>And we built hierarchal media organizations because we needed a single voice to</v>

2561
01:23:24.401 --> 01:23:25.450
<v Speaker 2>tell us what to think.</v>

2562
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:30.750
<v Speaker 2>And then gradually we're seeing the solutions that are decentralized that solve</v>

2563
01:23:31.191 --> 01:23:35.200
<v Speaker 2>the problem without a hierarchal organization and that scale.</v>

2564
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:39.340
<v Speaker 2>So the Internet was the first decentralized communications that scales to the</v>

2565
01:23:39.341 --> 01:23:40.174
<v Speaker 2>whole planet.</v>

2566
01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:44.380
<v Speaker 2>And so suddenly all of the hierarchal solutions for communication are no longer</v>

2567
01:23:44.381 --> 01:23:45.040
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

2568
01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.020
<v Speaker 2>They solve a problem that doesn't exist.</v>

2569
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:51.850
<v Speaker 2>The problem of it being difficult to transmit information across a continent or</v>

2570
01:23:51.851 --> 01:23:52.684
<v Speaker 2>across the globe.</v>

2571
01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Once our problem goes away,</v>

2572
01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.590
<v Speaker 2>the institution's built to solve it.</v>

2573
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:58.180
<v Speaker 2>New Systems,</v>

2574
01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:01.540
<v Speaker 2>large entertainment and marketing organizations to,</v>

2575
01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:02.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2576
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:03.970
<v Speaker 2>create single output products.</v>

2577
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.680
<v Speaker 2>All of those are no longer necessary.</v>

2578
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:07.750
<v Speaker 2>And the choice blossoms.</v>

2579
01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin is simply the same concept of decentralization but applied to money.</v>

2580
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:18.030
<v Speaker 2>And one of the interesting things is the bitcoin at its core works on the fact</v>

2581
01:24:18.101 --> 01:24:21.190
<v Speaker 2>that you can decentralize voting and do voting at scale.</v>

2582
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:24.670
<v Speaker 2>And the voting that's happening right now is the voting to agree on who has the</v>

2583
01:24:24.671 --> 01:24:25.504
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>

2584
01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:27.430
<v Speaker 2>But you could do voting for other things like</v>

2585
01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:29.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2586
01:24:29.291 --> 01:24:29.741
<v Speaker 2>stocks,</v>

2587
01:24:29.741 --> 01:24:30.220
<v Speaker 2>bonds,</v>

2588
01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.210
<v Speaker 2>global lotteries,</v>

2589
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:33.670
<v Speaker 2>national elections and things like that.</v>

2590
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:34.220
<v Speaker 2>When you say</v>

2591
01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.650
<v Speaker 1>voting is to see who has the bitcoins.</v>

2592
01:24:37.770 --> 01:24:38.401
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>

2593
01:24:38.401 --> 01:24:40.770
<v Speaker 2>when essentially the,</v>

2594
01:24:40.771 --> 01:24:41.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2595
01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:42.300
<v Speaker 2>the mining process,</v>

2596
01:24:42.301 --> 01:24:47.301
<v Speaker 2>the verifies each block of transaction and secure set is like a giant votes in</v>

2597
01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:49.680
<v Speaker 2>election that happens every 10 minutes.</v>

2598
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:52.110
<v Speaker 2>And by looking at the transactions,</v>

2599
01:24:52.111 --> 01:24:53.380
<v Speaker 2>you can tell who has the bitcoin.</v>

2600
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:54.990
<v Speaker 2>If the entire network has said,</v>

2601
01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Andrea sent Joe a bitcoin and that's been verified by the network,</v>

2602
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:05.550
<v Speaker 2>then everyone trusts Joe has a bitcoin and will be willing to accept that</v>

2603
01:25:05.551 --> 01:25:06.960
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin and payment for something.</v>

2604
01:25:06.961 --> 01:25:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2605
01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:09.220
<v Speaker 2>So essentially the,</v>

2606
01:25:09.221 --> 01:25:13.980
<v Speaker 2>you have this every 10 minutes you have this consensus where the entire network</v>

2607
01:25:13.981 --> 01:25:16.710
<v Speaker 2>agrees on all of the transactions that have happened,</v>

2608
01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:17.580
<v Speaker 2>who has waltz,</v>

2609
01:25:17.610 --> 01:25:18.930
<v Speaker 2>what's going on on the system,</v>

2610
01:25:19.650 --> 01:25:21.350
<v Speaker 2>the ability to add,</v>

2611
01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:22.590
<v Speaker 2>have massive scale.</v>

2612
01:25:22.591 --> 01:25:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Have everyone agree on what the truth is?</v>

2613
01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:30.060
<v Speaker 2>That is the core invention behind bitcoin does that makes currency possible,</v>

2614
01:25:30.061 --> 01:25:32.220
<v Speaker 2>but it also makes other things possible,</v>

2615
01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.630
<v Speaker 2>including elections.</v>

2616
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.350
<v Speaker 2>So you can do some pretty incredible things because what you've done is you've</v>

2617
01:25:37.351 --> 01:25:39.030
<v Speaker 2>decentralized decision making,</v>

2618
01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.700
<v Speaker 2>the Internet decentralized communications.</v>

2619
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin is decentralizing money,</v>

2620
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:48.340
<v Speaker 2>but at its core is an invention that decentralizes decisionmaking yeah,</v>

2621
01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:48.891
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2622
01:25:48.891 --> 01:25:53.891
<v Speaker 1>What are the concerns as far as bitcoin getting shut down and what repercussions</v>

2623
01:25:54.501 --> 01:25:54.791
<v Speaker 1>or what,</v>

2624
01:25:54.791 --> 01:25:56.090
<v Speaker 1>what kind of blow back,</v>

2625
01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.313
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>

2626
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:59.490
<v Speaker 1>have you guys received the people that are,</v>

2627
01:25:59.491 --> 01:25:59.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2628
01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:01.310
<v Speaker 1>in charge of,</v>

2629
01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2630
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:04.490
<v Speaker 1>spreading of this bitcoin</v>

2631
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:05.780
<v Speaker 5>evangelists as it were?</v>

2632
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:06.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2633
01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:06.350
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2634
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:09.320
<v Speaker 5>is there any repercussions or any blow back or is there any,</v>

2635
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 5>nope,</v>

2636
01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:11.023
<v Speaker 5>nothing so far.</v>

2637
01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:11.361
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2638
01:26:11.361 --> 01:26:12.194
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2639
01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:12.591
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2640
01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:12.921
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

2641
01:26:12.921 --> 01:26:16.250
<v Speaker 5>there's a little misunderstanding that happen every now and then and,</v>

2642
01:26:16.251 --> 01:26:16.581
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2643
01:26:16.581 --> 01:26:17.414
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2644
01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:18.560
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2645
01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:22.550
<v Speaker 5>people at first who don't understand the technology sometimes,</v>

2646
01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:23.240
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2647
01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.120
<v Speaker 5>sit down and have conversations to understand it better.</v>

2648
01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:27.200
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2649
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:27.471
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2650
01:26:27.471 --> 01:26:27.631
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2651
01:26:27.631 --> 01:26:29.210
<v Speaker 5>the point is that at the moment,</v>

2652
01:26:29.211 --> 01:26:33.740
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin is legal to use and it's not just legal to use in the u s but it's legal</v>

2653
01:26:33.741 --> 01:26:35.690
<v Speaker 5>to use in pretty much every country,</v>

2654
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:36.560
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2655
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.430
<v Speaker 5>for individuals.</v>

2656
01:26:37.431 --> 01:26:38.001
<v Speaker 5>Certainly,</v>

2657
01:26:38.001 --> 01:26:38.660
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

2658
01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:41.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't think any country has bandit or has even attempted to ban it.</v>

2659
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:43.183
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2660
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:47.930
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin is money as a piece of content that you can send on the Internet.</v>

2661
01:26:47.931 --> 01:26:48.170
<v Speaker 5>So if you,</v>

2662
01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:49.310
<v Speaker 5>even if you wanted to ban it,</v>

2663
01:26:49.311 --> 01:26:52.790
<v Speaker 5>who would be relatively difficult to do that without shutting down the Internet?</v>

2664
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:55.610
<v Speaker 5>So that's one thing to put out there.</v>

2665
01:26:55.611 --> 01:26:57.030
<v Speaker 5>But the point is a,</v>

2666
01:26:57.031 --> 01:26:58.640
<v Speaker 5>nobody's trying to ban bitcoin.</v>

2667
01:26:58.670 --> 01:27:00.350
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's trying to shut us down.</v>

2668
01:27:00.710 --> 01:27:05.360
<v Speaker 5>I think especially in the u s and especially among senior lawmakers like the</v>

2669
01:27:05.361 --> 01:27:06.920
<v Speaker 5>Senate who had hearings,</v>

2670
01:27:07.190 --> 01:27:07.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2671
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.230
<v Speaker 5>recently about Bitcoin,</v>

2672
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:10.970
<v Speaker 5>the prevailing attitude is,</v>

2673
01:27:10.971 --> 01:27:11.271
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2674
01:27:11.271 --> 01:27:14.360
<v Speaker 5>this is generating growth is generating jobs.</v>

2675
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:15.920
<v Speaker 5>It's a huge innovation.</v>

2676
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:17.190
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2677
01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:17.540
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2678
01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:20.900
<v Speaker 5>we see that it's being used at a very broad manner can change a lot of things.</v>

2679
01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:21.201
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2680
01:27:21.201 --> 01:27:23.240
<v Speaker 5>maybe we should take a wait and see approach.</v>

2681
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.670
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2682
01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:26.840
<v Speaker 5>and the price went up quite dramatically after they said that.</v>

2683
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.570
<v Speaker 5>But the general attitude is most,</v>

2684
01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:33.680
<v Speaker 5>most politicians are far more interested in the possibility that this might</v>

2685
01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:37.310
<v Speaker 5>generate growth and also jobs and as a result,</v>

2686
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:41.270
<v Speaker 5>votes and campaign finance money than they are about,</v>

2687
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:42.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2688
01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:45.440
<v Speaker 5>beating this down because it's going to affect different interests.</v>

2689
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.880
<v Speaker 5>So there's still open to it.</v>

2690
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:50.930
<v Speaker 5>And I think we've got a tremendous opportunity to educate people about all of</v>

2691
01:27:50.931 --> 01:27:54.730
<v Speaker 5>the incredible things we can do and also highlight the fact that this bitcoin</v>

2692
01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:59.740
<v Speaker 5>economy just in the last year has generated thousands of jobs in an environment</v>

2693
01:28:01.251 --> 01:28:03.320
<v Speaker 5>where we have economic stagnation.</v>

2694
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.680
<v Speaker 5>We've got this bloom of innovation and technology,</v>

2695
01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:07.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2696
01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:11.540
<v Speaker 5>much like the first burst of the Internet and you know,</v>

2697
01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:12.620
<v Speaker 5>that's a tremendous thing.</v>

2698
01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:15.200
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to squash that just because of a misunderstanding.</v>

2699
01:28:15.230 --> 01:28:18.950
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that there's a lack of blow back because the people in the powers</v>

2700
01:28:18.951 --> 01:28:22.280
<v Speaker 5>of be just having considered bitcoin to be a threat yet because we'll be talking</v>

2701
01:28:22.281 --> 01:28:26.500
<v Speaker 5>about like politicians not acting to try to the sound set to service.</v>

2702
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:28.800
<v Speaker 5>They're the people that get him in the office a little.</v>

2703
01:28:28.801 --> 01:28:31.590
<v Speaker 5>The little the lobbyists or special interest groups that would have you like</v>

2704
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:34.640
<v Speaker 5>that's just because they haven't been contacted by those people to try to do</v>

2705
01:28:34.641 --> 01:28:35.660
<v Speaker 5>something about bitcoin.</v>

2706
01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:41.020
<v Speaker 5>I think even the banks are ambivalent on this because while it may be disruptive</v>

2707
01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.520
<v Speaker 5>to some of their banking practices,</v>

2708
01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:47.360
<v Speaker 5>it is also one of the most interesting and innovative things to happen in</v>

2709
01:28:47.361 --> 01:28:49.040
<v Speaker 5>finance in the last hundred years.</v>

2710
01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.890
<v Speaker 5>And so I think a lot of banks are smart enough to say,</v>

2711
01:28:51.891 --> 01:28:52.221
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2712
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:54.200
<v Speaker 5>we were good at technology.</v>

2713
01:28:54.450 --> 01:28:54.951
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2714
01:28:54.951 --> 01:28:55.790
<v Speaker 5>we know money,</v>

2715
01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:56.930
<v Speaker 5>we've got branches,</v>

2716
01:28:56.931 --> 01:28:57.860
<v Speaker 5>we've got customers,</v>

2717
01:28:57.861 --> 01:28:58.700
<v Speaker 5>we've got marketing,</v>

2718
01:28:58.701 --> 01:28:59.421
<v Speaker 5>we've got brands,</v>

2719
01:28:59.421 --> 01:29:00.620
<v Speaker 5>we know how to do security.</v>

2720
01:29:00.621 --> 01:29:05.160
<v Speaker 5>We could really make a good deal with this bit coin thing and use it and make</v>

2721
01:29:05.161 --> 01:29:07.020
<v Speaker 5>some really interesting financial things.</v>

2722
01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:09.570
<v Speaker 5>So there's this mixed bag,</v>

2723
01:29:09.571 --> 01:29:10.404
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>

2724
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:10.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2725
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.390
<v Speaker 5>and I'll bring the same example.</v>

2726
01:29:12.391 --> 01:29:16.790
<v Speaker 5>When entertainment companies were first face with the possibility of MP3,</v>

2727
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.371
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

2728
01:29:17.371 --> 01:29:18.240
<v Speaker 5>Some people were like,</v>

2729
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.871
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

2730
01:29:18.871 --> 01:29:20.100
<v Speaker 5>this is going to destroy everything.</v>

2731
01:29:20.101 --> 01:29:21.060
<v Speaker 5>Music will die.</v>

2732
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:21.810
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2733
01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:24.050
<v Speaker 5>Which is the same they've said with every previous technology,</v>

2734
01:29:24.051 --> 01:29:24.670
<v Speaker 5>you're were right though.</v>

2735
01:29:24.670 --> 01:29:25.140
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2736
01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:25.590
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2737
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.890
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2738
01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:26.281
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

2739
01:29:26.281 --> 01:29:27.510
<v Speaker 5>they weren't because,</v>

2740
01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:29.310
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2741
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:29.721
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

2742
01:29:29.721 --> 01:29:31.350
<v Speaker 5>the point is that since then,</v>

2743
01:29:31.351 --> 01:29:33.060
<v Speaker 5>the number of genres and number of artists,</v>

2744
01:29:33.061 --> 01:29:35.820
<v Speaker 5>the number of the amount of music has exploded.</v>

2745
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:36.690
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2746
01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:39.510
<v Speaker 5>people get a broader range of music than ever before.</v>

2747
01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:42.960
<v Speaker 5>And mp3s have created so much good in the entertainment industry,</v>

2748
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:44.370
<v Speaker 5>so much more than damage.</v>

2749
01:29:44.371 --> 01:29:45.180
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2750
01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:47.460
<v Speaker 5>And I think even in banking environments,</v>

2751
01:29:47.461 --> 01:29:50.490
<v Speaker 5>they recognize that with bitcoin there's this mixed bag,</v>

2752
01:29:50.491 --> 01:29:52.980
<v Speaker 5>which is that the good far outweighs the bad.</v>

2753
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:57.510
<v Speaker 5>And even in a business that's going to get disrupted as banking will be just</v>

2754
01:29:57.511 --> 01:30:00.420
<v Speaker 5>like entertainment and telephone companies were disrupted by the Internet.</v>

2755
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:01.823
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2756
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:05.760
<v Speaker 5>those that are smart can take advantage and they can build something good with</v>

2757
01:30:05.761 --> 01:30:08.070
<v Speaker 5>this and they're going to lose some power and leverage,</v>

2758
01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:09.900
<v Speaker 5>but they can make some good money out of this.</v>

2759
01:30:10.050 --> 01:30:13.320
<v Speaker 5>So I don't think any was out to get bitcoin right now.</v>

2760
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.620
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2761
01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:14.490
<v Speaker 5>I think people are,</v>

2762
01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:16.590
<v Speaker 5>are commonly evaluating it's,</v>

2763
01:30:16.591 --> 01:30:16.891
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2764
01:30:16.891 --> 01:30:17.221
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2765
01:30:17.221 --> 01:30:19.560
<v Speaker 5>and thinking about what opportunities it can bring.</v>

2766
01:30:19.561 --> 01:30:20.760
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's the best approach.</v>

2767
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:21.623
<v Speaker 5>Would you pull up,</v>

2768
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.400
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2769
01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:23.280
<v Speaker 5>about the taxes?</v>

2770
01:30:23.281 --> 01:30:26.880
<v Speaker 5>Because I guess there's this whole thing going on that people,</v>

2771
01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:27.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2772
01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.680
<v Speaker 5>need to claim the,</v>

2773
01:30:28.690 --> 01:30:28.881
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2774
01:30:28.881 --> 01:30:29.091
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2775
01:30:29.091 --> 01:30:29.520
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2776
01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.510
<v Speaker 5>the stuff that the purchases or the money that they get from bitcoin on your</v>

2777
01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:33.961
<v Speaker 5>taxes,</v>

2778
01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 5>but the IRS hasn't said how to do it yet.</v>

2779
01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:37.861
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2780
01:30:37.861 --> 01:30:37.961
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2781
01:30:37.961 --> 01:30:38.311
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2782
01:30:38.311 --> 01:30:40.560
<v Speaker 6>I've discussed this with my accountant and they gave me a pretty</v>

2783
01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.280
<v Speaker 6>straightforward,</v>

2784
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:42.061
<v Speaker 6>a formula.</v>

2785
01:30:42.061 --> 01:30:43.440
<v Speaker 6>If I earn income on Bitcoin,</v>

2786
01:30:43.441 --> 01:30:46.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm mark how many dollars it was at the time and I pay income taxes on that.</v>

2787
01:30:46.951 --> 01:30:47.850
<v Speaker 6>Just like anything else,</v>

2788
01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:49.650
<v Speaker 6>I've invested in some bitcoin.</v>

2789
01:30:49.651 --> 01:30:51.390
<v Speaker 6>If I hold it for less than six months,</v>

2790
01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:55.740
<v Speaker 6>I'll declare a short term capital gains more and more than a here I'll longterm</v>

2791
01:30:55.741 --> 01:30:58.230
<v Speaker 6>capital gains and pay the difference.</v>

2792
01:30:58.650 --> 01:30:58.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2793
01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.620
<v Speaker 6>that's basically how I would work with euros.</v>

2794
01:31:01.621 --> 01:31:03.810
<v Speaker 6>That's how I'm going to work with a bitcoin.</v>

2795
01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:06.450
<v Speaker 6>The key word you're saying how you're going to,</v>

2796
01:31:06.451 --> 01:31:09.060
<v Speaker 6>that's what's interesting about this is you actually haven't started doing that</v>

2797
01:31:09.061 --> 01:31:13.260
<v Speaker 6>yet because you've only been starting to get paid fully in bitcoin over the last</v>

2798
01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:13.320
<v Speaker 6>few months.</v>

2799
01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.180
<v Speaker 6>So this is fairly experimental even for you,</v>

2800
01:31:15.181 --> 01:31:17.010
<v Speaker 6>you're basically at the cutting edge of this,</v>

2801
01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:17.610
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2802
01:31:17.610 --> 01:31:19.760
<v Speaker 6>So I mean there are people who have already filed</v>

2803
01:31:19.810 --> 01:31:20.360
<v Speaker 5>Texas,</v>

2804
01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:20.581
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2805
01:31:20.581 --> 01:31:22.840
<v Speaker 5>a few times and they've used the same approach.</v>

2806
01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:23.620
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2807
01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:28.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be filing income taxes in Bitcoin for the first time for 2013 but I</v>

2808
01:31:28.451 --> 01:31:28.601
<v Speaker 5>mean,</v>

2809
01:31:28.601 --> 01:31:31.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm discussing it with accountants and they think it's pretty straight forward</v>

2810
01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:34.600
<v Speaker 5>when I think the IRS will give us guidance before April.</v>

2811
01:31:34.601 --> 01:31:38.890
<v Speaker 5>And the reason I think they will is because the IRS is interested in or in</v>

2812
01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:43.920
<v Speaker 5>making revenue and what better way to make revenue from bitcoin than to simply</v>

2813
01:31:43.991 --> 01:31:47.140
<v Speaker 5>explain exactly how people should pay their taxes on it so we can,</v>

2814
01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.870
<v Speaker 5>things are going to get really weird if it takes off.</v>

2815
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2816
01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:53.740
<v Speaker 5>They're already weird and had already took off you think.</v>

2817
01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:54.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2818
01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:54.581
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2819
01:31:54.581 --> 01:31:55.151
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

2820
01:31:55.151 --> 01:31:55.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2821
01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:55.730
<v Speaker 5>that's</v>

2822
01:31:55.730 --> 01:31:56.010
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

2823
01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:58.060
<v Speaker 6>but I don't know anybody who's using it all the time.</v>

2824
01:31:58.061 --> 01:31:58.800
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2825
01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 6>you might say if you're,</v>

2826
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:00.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2827
01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:02.260
<v Speaker 1>you're on involved in these online groups,</v>

2828
01:32:02.261 --> 01:32:06.040
<v Speaker 1>but the actual percentage of people that are using big coin and regular basis,</v>

2829
01:32:06.041 --> 01:32:06.760
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

2830
01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.670
<v Speaker 1>one half of one half of 1% I mean is maybe</v>

2831
01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:10.280
<v Speaker 5>there are,</v>

2832
01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.600
<v Speaker 5>there's probably,</v>

2833
01:32:11.630 --> 01:32:12.463
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2834
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.821
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2835
01:32:13.821 --> 01:32:14.690
<v Speaker 5>several million.</v>

2836
01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:18.290
<v Speaker 5>Is it over 10 cents less than 10 in this country?</v>

2837
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.561
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2838
01:32:18.561 --> 01:32:19.071
<v Speaker 5>worldwide.</v>

2839
01:32:19.071 --> 01:32:20.180
<v Speaker 5>But most of it's in this country.</v>

2840
01:32:20.181 --> 01:32:20.480
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

2841
01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:23.720
<v Speaker 5>there's a million people in this country that are using bitcoin on a regular</v>

2842
01:32:23.721 --> 01:32:24.554
<v Speaker 5>basis.</v>

2843
01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:25.011
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2844
01:32:25.011 --> 01:32:25.221
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2845
01:32:25.221 --> 01:32:25.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2846
01:32:25.850 --> 01:32:26.091
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2847
01:32:26.091 --> 01:32:26.511
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

2848
01:32:26.511 --> 01:32:28.310
<v Speaker 5>and it's not easy to find out,</v>

2849
01:32:28.370 --> 01:32:31.220
<v Speaker 5>but what I do know is for it to be taking off is what I'm saying.</v>

2850
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:33.340
<v Speaker 5>So what I'm thinking about is,</v>

2851
01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:34.400
<v Speaker 5>in terms of taking off,</v>

2852
01:32:34.401 --> 01:32:35.900
<v Speaker 5>this has been around for five years.</v>

2853
01:32:35.901 --> 01:32:40.901
<v Speaker 5>It's been a very stable and secure network that has preserved or increased in</v>

2854
01:32:40.971 --> 01:32:41.804
<v Speaker 5>value.</v>

2855
01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:42.800
<v Speaker 5>At the same time,</v>

2856
01:32:42.801 --> 01:32:45.200
<v Speaker 5>people have gradually improve the technology.</v>

2857
01:32:45.201 --> 01:32:48.080
<v Speaker 5>Now we've got this whole raft to startups that are doing innovation and</v>

2858
01:32:48.081 --> 01:32:49.970
<v Speaker 5>delivering better and better products around it.</v>

2859
01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:52.550
<v Speaker 5>More and more merchants are doing it and most importantly,</v>

2860
01:32:52.551 --> 01:32:53.450
<v Speaker 5>it's gone global.</v>

2861
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:57.650
<v Speaker 5>It's now being used in dozens of countries around the world and the network is</v>

2862
01:32:57.651 --> 01:32:59.600
<v Speaker 5>large and getting larger every day.</v>

2863
01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:04.810
<v Speaker 5>So all of those conditions reminds me exactly of what the Internet was in 1992.</v>

2864
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.990
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

2865
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:10.990
<v Speaker 5>most people didn't hear about it until 94 95 and at that point you had people go</v>

2866
01:33:12.081 --> 01:33:13.250
<v Speaker 5>on the morning show and say,</v>

2867
01:33:13.251 --> 01:33:13.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2868
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:16.430
<v Speaker 5>is internet the email or what's this at sign?</v>

2869
01:33:16.431 --> 01:33:17.630
<v Speaker 5>And then we're having that conversation.</v>

2870
01:33:17.631 --> 01:33:20.300
<v Speaker 5>But it had already been growing quite rapidly.</v>

2871
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:21.890
<v Speaker 5>I think that's where we are with bitcoin.</v>

2872
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:23.750
<v Speaker 5>My mom is not going to do,</v>

2873
01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:24.231
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2874
01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:25.370
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin on her own,</v>

2875
01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:25.941
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2876
01:33:25.941 --> 01:33:27.560
<v Speaker 5>for another six or seven years.</v>

2877
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:28.310
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2878
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:31.790
<v Speaker 5>most people won't hear much about it for the next two years are going to hear</v>

2879
01:33:31.791 --> 01:33:32.780
<v Speaker 5>about it occasionally.</v>

2880
01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:36.500
<v Speaker 5>But in the meantime it's been building momentum and getting better.</v>

2881
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:37.220
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2882
01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:37.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2883
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:39.230
<v Speaker 5>I think it's already arrived.</v>

2884
01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:42.110
<v Speaker 5>Certainly the invention behind it,</v>

2885
01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:44.420
<v Speaker 5>which has also spawned many other currencies.</v>

2886
01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.680
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2887
01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.540
<v Speaker 5>you can't uninvent invent that invention.</v>

2888
01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.160
<v Speaker 5>So in whatever form.</v>

2889
01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:51.080
<v Speaker 5>And if it's not this bit coin currency,</v>

2890
01:33:51.081 --> 01:33:53.420
<v Speaker 5>which I think is already pretty damn strong.</v>

2891
01:33:54.110 --> 01:33:54.830
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2892
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:55.101
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2893
01:33:55.101 --> 01:33:59.000
<v Speaker 5>that same invention can be repeated and improved.</v>

2894
01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.260
<v Speaker 5>Just like you know,</v>

2895
01:34:00.261 --> 01:34:03.290
<v Speaker 5>the Internet's the first early versions were really,</v>

2896
01:34:03.291 --> 01:34:08.291
<v Speaker 5>really clunky and gradually and improved and keep in mind currency is just the</v>

2897
01:34:08.361 --> 01:34:09.290
<v Speaker 5>first application.</v>

2898
01:34:09.650 --> 01:34:11.840
<v Speaker 5>So if you were on the internet and you only knew email,</v>

2899
01:34:11.841 --> 01:34:14.480
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't even imagine what the web would be like,</v>

2900
01:34:14.481 --> 01:34:17.960
<v Speaker 5>let alone social media or mp3s or digital music and video.</v>

2901
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:20.270
<v Speaker 5>Internet still is a,</v>

2902
01:34:20.271 --> 01:34:21.260
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin is still like that.</v>

2903
01:34:21.261 --> 01:34:22.490
<v Speaker 5>We've got the bitcoin currency,</v>

2904
01:34:22.491 --> 01:34:25.640
<v Speaker 5>which is just like email and it's the basic application.</v>

2905
01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:29.720
<v Speaker 5>Now companies are building the other applications and it's getting really</v>

2906
01:34:29.721 --> 01:34:30.171
<v Speaker 5>exciting.</v>

2907
01:34:30.171 --> 01:34:34.040
<v Speaker 5>So I think we've got a bit to go until we're mainstream,</v>

2908
01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:35.530
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's already</v>

2909
01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:37.990
<v Speaker 1>catching on now in other countries it's the,</v>

2910
01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:41.710
<v Speaker 1>the government has been not so sweet about the use of bitcoin.</v>

2911
01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:44.800
<v Speaker 1>And there's an article that came out just a few hours ago from Russia,</v>

2912
01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:46.310
<v Speaker 1>the Russian central bank.</v>

2913
01:34:46.311 --> 01:34:48.520
<v Speaker 1>So the bitcoin users could face jail time.</v>

2914
01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:49.600
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

2915
01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2916
01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:50.891
<v Speaker 1>it's up there.</v>

2917
01:34:50.891 --> 01:34:55.890
<v Speaker 1>It's actually was in Time magazine a this is off Lariya Novo Ski.</v>

2918
01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

2919
01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.453
<v Speaker 1>lovely.</v>

2920
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll just</v>

2921
01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.830
<v Speaker 2>as you know that other countries have done the same thing,</v>

2922
01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:02.150
<v Speaker 2>including China.</v>

2923
01:35:02.151 --> 01:35:03.380
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

2924
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.390
<v Speaker 2>what if you use bitcoin and then,</v>

2925
01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2926
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:07.520
<v Speaker 2>two years from now they say it's illegal.</v>

2927
01:35:07.521 --> 01:35:07.741
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2928
01:35:07.741 --> 01:35:08.130
<v Speaker 2>are these,</v>

2929
01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:09.290
<v Speaker 1>well this is crazy.</v>

2930
01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:12.000
<v Speaker 1>This was released right before we started the podcast.</v>

2931
01:35:12.001 --> 01:35:14.040
<v Speaker 1>A couple of hours before we started this podcast,</v>

2932
01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:15.060
<v Speaker 1>they released the story.</v>

2933
01:35:15.330 --> 01:35:17.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fairly breaking news.</v>

2934
01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.960
<v Speaker 6>So I haven't seen the story.</v>

2935
01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:20.153
<v Speaker 6>What I can say,</v>

2936
01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:20.731
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

2937
01:35:20.731 --> 01:35:22.350
<v Speaker 6>if it's saying that it's the same in China,</v>

2938
01:35:22.351 --> 01:35:22.861
<v Speaker 6>they're wrong.</v>

2939
01:35:22.861 --> 01:35:25.830
<v Speaker 6>So that makes me wonder what else they're wrong about.</v>

2940
01:35:25.831 --> 01:35:27.180
<v Speaker 6>But in China,</v>

2941
01:35:27.181 --> 01:35:31.800
<v Speaker 6>they banned central banks and other banking institutions from holding bitcoin on</v>

2942
01:35:31.801 --> 01:35:32.611
<v Speaker 6>their asset ledger.</v>

2943
01:35:32.611 --> 01:35:34.080
<v Speaker 6>They didn't ban people from trading.</v>

2944
01:35:34.081 --> 01:35:34.914
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

2945
01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:38.160
<v Speaker 6>bitcoin is like 60% or more of the trading happens in China.</v>

2946
01:35:38.161 --> 01:35:39.710
<v Speaker 6>They didn't ban people from using it.</v>

2947
01:35:39.711 --> 01:35:41.580
<v Speaker 6>It's perfectly legal to use it there as well.</v>

2948
01:35:42.150 --> 01:35:42.600
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2949
01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:43.830
<v Speaker 6>I think you might be,</v>

2950
01:35:43.890 --> 01:35:45.330
<v Speaker 6>it might be an exaggerated headlines,</v>

2951
01:35:45.331 --> 01:35:46.320
<v Speaker 6>but even if it isn't,</v>

2952
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:47.010
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2953
01:35:47.010 --> 01:35:47.460
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2954
01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:48.720
<v Speaker 6>if Russia bans bitcoin,</v>

2955
01:35:48.721 --> 01:35:51.810
<v Speaker 6>I think that probably ends up hurting Russia more than bitcoin.</v>

2956
01:35:52.530 --> 01:35:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2957
01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:56.070
<v Speaker 1>China's limited bitcoin use for fruit citizens.</v>

2958
01:35:56.071 --> 01:35:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's on a few different,</v>

2959
01:35:57.991 --> 01:35:58.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2960
01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:01.060
<v Speaker 2>China also limits a Internet to use for its citizens.</v>

2961
01:36:01.061 --> 01:36:02.920
<v Speaker 2>So that doesn't devalue the Internet.</v>

2962
01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:03.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2963
01:36:03.251 --> 01:36:03.701
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

2964
01:36:03.701 --> 01:36:04.960
<v Speaker 2>that's the point about this.</v>

2965
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:06.580
<v Speaker 2>And keep in mind,</v>

2966
01:36:06.610 --> 01:36:10.000
<v Speaker 2>there's also a matter of due process of law and there's also a matter of</v>

2967
01:36:10.001 --> 01:36:10.930
<v Speaker 2>different legal structures.</v>

2968
01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:11.531
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

2969
01:36:11.531 --> 01:36:11.951
<v Speaker 2>in India,</v>

2970
01:36:11.951 --> 01:36:14.680
<v Speaker 2>the first reaction of the of the regulator is,</v>

2971
01:36:14.681 --> 01:36:15.340
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

2972
01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:15.551
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2973
01:36:15.551 --> 01:36:18.160
<v Speaker 2>if it's not specifically licensed and permitted,</v>

2974
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:19.361
<v Speaker 2>it's not legal.</v>

2975
01:36:19.361 --> 01:36:19.831
<v Speaker 2>That's their,</v>

2976
01:36:19.831 --> 01:36:23.710
<v Speaker 2>their legal system is attitude is we say it's legal,</v>

2977
01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:24.131
<v Speaker 2>it's legal.</v>

2978
01:36:24.131 --> 01:36:25.630
<v Speaker 2>If we haven't said anything about it,</v>

2979
01:36:25.631 --> 01:36:26.470
<v Speaker 2>then it's legal for,</v>

2980
01:36:26.490 --> 01:36:26.741
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2981
01:36:26.741 --> 01:36:27.700
<v Speaker 2>You need the license.</v>

2982
01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:29.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's the inverse of US law.</v>

2983
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:31.243
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2984
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.840
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2985
01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:32.171
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2986
01:36:32.171 --> 01:36:32.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2987
01:36:32.441 --> 01:36:33.001
<v Speaker 2>certainly,</v>

2988
01:36:33.001 --> 01:36:33.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2989
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:34.480
<v Speaker 2>here in the U s I'm not,</v>

2990
01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:36.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not worried about it being pants,</v>

2991
01:36:36.341 --> 01:36:36.671
<v Speaker 2>hair,</v>

2992
01:36:36.671 --> 01:36:40.120
<v Speaker 2>because there is a lot of legal precedent for private currencies in this</v>

2993
01:36:40.121 --> 01:36:40.954
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

2994
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:44.140
<v Speaker 2>And there's constitutional protections and there's companies that can defend</v>

2995
01:36:44.141 --> 01:36:45.070
<v Speaker 2>themselves against that.</v>

2996
01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:45.340
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2997
01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:47.850
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of people that listen to this podcast from other countries.</v>

2998
01:36:47.851 --> 01:36:49.500
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I wanted to bring that up,</v>

2999
01:36:49.530 --> 01:36:50.880
<v Speaker 1>the Russia story,</v>

3000
01:36:50.881 --> 01:36:51.280
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3001
01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:51.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3002
01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:55.240
<v Speaker 1>to point out that this is not a universally accepted things as far as the</v>

3003
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:58.650
<v Speaker 1>governments and the ambivalence of American banks that they've shown an American</v>

3004
01:36:58.651 --> 01:36:59.484
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>

3005
01:36:59.580 --> 01:36:59.881
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

3006
01:36:59.881 --> 01:37:01.830
<v Speaker 1>it may not be the case in other countries.</v>

3007
01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Was this Bank of Russia issues warning on digital currencies?</v>

3008
01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:05.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3009
01:37:05.221 --> 01:37:05.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3010
01:37:05.491 --> 01:37:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Russia is incredibly suppressive place.</v>

3011
01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3012
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:08.490
<v Speaker 1>we know that,</v>

3013
01:37:08.810 --> 01:37:09.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3014
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3015
01:37:09.781 --> 01:37:11.550
<v Speaker 1>we know what's going on with them and gay people.</v>

3016
01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:12.413
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3017
01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:12.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3018
01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:13.381
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3019
01:37:13.381 --> 01:37:13.921
<v Speaker 1>a really,</v>

3020
01:37:13.921 --> 01:37:14.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3021
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.880
<v Speaker 1>it's appalling,</v>

3022
01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.110
<v Speaker 1>very strange,</v>

3023
01:37:16.170 --> 01:37:18.440
<v Speaker 1>backwards country in,</v>

3024
01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:21.570
<v Speaker 1>in terms of a lot of the things that they think in a lot of the ways that they</v>

3025
01:37:21.571 --> 01:37:22.800
<v Speaker 1>behave as a nation.</v>

3026
01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:23.221
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3027
01:37:23.221 --> 01:37:23.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3028
01:37:23.461 --> 01:37:25.560
<v Speaker 1>it's basically also run by one gangster.</v>

3029
01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:25.961
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

3030
01:37:25.961 --> 01:37:27.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not a country of laws,</v>

3031
01:37:27.301 --> 01:37:28.050
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

3032
01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3033
01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3034
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.851
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt,</v>

3035
01:37:29.851 --> 01:37:30.211
<v Speaker 1>Putin,</v>

3036
01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:32.150
<v Speaker 1>whether he's a great leader and not his,</v>

3037
01:37:32.151 --> 01:37:32.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3038
01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:33.653
<v Speaker 1>his gangster,</v>

3039
01:37:33.690 --> 01:37:33.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3040
01:37:33.931 --> 01:37:37.980
<v Speaker 1>he's just a super awesome when at it he's running the country.</v>

3041
01:37:37.981 --> 01:37:39.840
<v Speaker 1>You used to be the president stepped down,</v>

3042
01:37:39.841 --> 01:37:42.900
<v Speaker 1>put a puppet government and probably his and then became the president again.</v>

3043
01:37:42.901 --> 01:37:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole thing is magical</v>

3044
01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.350
<v Speaker 2>and then rode around on a horse bare chested splendour.</v>

3045
01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:49.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3046
01:37:49.621 --> 01:37:51.090
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty crazy and weird.</v>

3047
01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3048
01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:52.580
<v Speaker 1>he does a lot of weird things.</v>

3049
01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Him and Obama were,</v>

3050
01:37:54.051 --> 01:37:54.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3051
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.640
<v Speaker 1>they were both conflicted.</v>

3052
01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:59.640
<v Speaker 1>They were in some area and they were conflicted as far as like,</v>

3053
01:37:59.641 --> 01:38:01.470
<v Speaker 1>when they could use the gym,</v>

3054
01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:01.820
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>

3055
01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:04.350
<v Speaker 1>They weren't allowed to use the gym together for some fucking reason.</v>

3056
01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Like as if Putin and Obama can't work out in the gym together.</v>

3057
01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:08.161
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3058
01:38:08.161 --> 01:38:09.390
<v Speaker 1>do you know how fucking crazy that is?</v>

3059
01:38:09.391 --> 01:38:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3060
01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:10.141
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3061
01:38:10.141 --> 01:38:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll be on a stairmaster.</v>

3062
01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:12.413
<v Speaker 1>You hit the weights.</v>

3063
01:38:12.450 --> 01:38:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Is that cool?</v>

3064
01:38:13.230 --> 01:38:13.501
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3065
01:38:13.501 --> 01:38:14.520
<v Speaker 1>they can't be in the room together.</v>

3066
01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Like they're afraid that Putin might beat him over the head with a fucking club</v>

3067
01:38:18.031 --> 01:38:18.840
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

3068
01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:22.770
<v Speaker 1>But so while Obama was in the gym working out,</v>

3069
01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Putin jumped in the fucking lake outside the gym.</v>

3070
01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:26.321
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>

3071
01:38:26.321 --> 01:38:28.440
<v Speaker 1>in clear view of Obama and his,</v>

3072
01:38:28.441 --> 01:38:29.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3073
01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3074
01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:33.690
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking elastic bands and he's doing his little aerobics stretches with</v>

3075
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Putin swimming.</v>

3076
01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:35.460
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

3077
01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:36.390
<v Speaker 1>In a fucking lake.</v>

3078
01:38:36.391 --> 01:38:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Freezing,</v>

3079
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:38.280
<v Speaker 1>freezing cold lake,</v>

3080
01:38:38.610 --> 01:38:39.450
<v Speaker 1>like a man,</v>

3081
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.480
<v Speaker 1>like a bare chest at savage and an old spice commercial,</v>

3082
01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.940
<v Speaker 1>a Russian old spice master.</v>

3083
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:47.303
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

3084
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:49.170
<v Speaker 1>They're just pissed off about Alaska still.</v>

3085
01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever hear that old story that,</v>

3086
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:51.893
<v Speaker 1>about how the,</v>

3087
01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:53.790
<v Speaker 1>they sold Alaska to us for,</v>

3088
01:38:53.791 --> 01:38:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like $12 million and then we bought it from them like an or</v>

3089
01:38:57.930 --> 01:38:58.231
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3090
01:38:58.231 --> 01:39:02.690
<v Speaker 1>1,817 hundreds and then we found so much gold in Alaska that,</v>

3091
01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:03.750
<v Speaker 1>that they would have,</v>

3092
01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3093
01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.560
<v Speaker 1>tripled the amount that we paid for Alaska.</v>

3094
01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Even just on gold.</v>

3095
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Forget the oil and everything else will ask is amazing.</v>

3096
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:12.263
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up.</v>

3097
01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.340
<v Speaker 1>It's way better than Russia dummies.</v>

3098
01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:17.330
<v Speaker 1>They could have had a vacation spot and we'll,</v>

3099
01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:18.490
<v Speaker 1>anchorage is the shit man.</v>

3100
01:39:18.491 --> 01:39:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I was one of my favorite places I've ever visited.</v>

3101
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:21.121
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3102
01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:23.190
<v Speaker 1>And the view that when you drive into the mountains,</v>

3103
01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:24.300
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

3104
01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:25.980
<v Speaker 1>it's just magical up there.</v>

3105
01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:26.933
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

3106
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3107
01:39:28.410 --> 01:39:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

3108
01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Russia is a weird spot,</v>

3109
01:39:29.821 --> 01:39:30.330
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3110
01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:30.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3111
01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Russia has had a long,</v>

3112
01:39:32.281 --> 01:39:33.180
<v Speaker 1>hard history,</v>

3113
01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:36.540
<v Speaker 1>has been a lot of horrible things that have happened to the Russian people,</v>

3114
01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:36.870
<v Speaker 1>both,</v>

3115
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3116
01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:39.580
<v Speaker 1>World War Two and before that there were,</v>

3117
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.570
<v Speaker 1>they were occupied by the Mongols for 200 years.</v>

3118
01:39:42.990 --> 01:39:43.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3119
01:39:43.261 --> 01:39:47.100
<v Speaker 1>it's just a rough country and when it comes to their laws,</v>

3120
01:39:47.101 --> 01:39:47.330
<v Speaker 1>lemon,</v>

3121
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:51.780
<v Speaker 1>they've got some really fucking shady laws and real weird attitudes on things</v>

3122
01:39:51.781 --> 01:39:52.021
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

3123
01:39:52.021 --> 01:39:52.550
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3124
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3125
01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:56.100
<v Speaker 1>they have a habit of shipping people that don't agree with them off to Siberia</v>

3126
01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:56.881
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3127
01:39:56.881 --> 01:39:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3128
01:39:57.420 --> 01:40:00.480
<v Speaker 1>that one really wealthy oligarch fellow,</v>

3129
01:40:00.630 --> 01:40:03.240
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the most richest men in Russia,</v>

3130
01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:04.180
<v Speaker 1>but crosswords,</v>

3131
01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Putin,</v>

3132
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Putin just sent that motherfucker to jail,</v>

3133
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.870
<v Speaker 1>kept him in jail for 10 years and then finally released him,</v>

3134
01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:12.840
<v Speaker 1>have massive public outcry.</v>

3135
01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:13.710
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3136
01:40:13.710 --> 01:40:14.550
<v Speaker 1>this guy was,</v>

3137
01:40:14.610 --> 01:40:15.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3138
01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.770
<v Speaker 1>they trumped up charges against him.</v>

3139
01:40:16.771 --> 01:40:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Just locked them up in a cage for a decade.</v>

3140
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:19.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3141
01:40:19.121 --> 01:40:19.331
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3142
01:40:19.331 --> 01:40:20.164
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>

3143
01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:25.260
<v Speaker 2>here's the other perspective on this switches in places like the u s if the,</v>

3144
01:40:25.690 --> 01:40:27.100
<v Speaker 2>if the government banned some things,</v>

3145
01:40:27.101 --> 01:40:29.470
<v Speaker 2>they go through a very long arduous process.</v>

3146
01:40:29.471 --> 01:40:30.370
<v Speaker 2>They go through courts,</v>

3147
01:40:30.371 --> 01:40:31.570
<v Speaker 2>they have to prove their case.</v>

3148
01:40:31.571 --> 01:40:35.620
<v Speaker 2>They can just willingly do it and it takes a long process.</v>

3149
01:40:35.621 --> 01:40:38.980
<v Speaker 2>And generally the people kind of agree with it.</v>

3150
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Now in a lot of places in the world when something is banned by the government</v>

3151
01:40:42.851 --> 01:40:43.510
<v Speaker 2>that people go,</v>

3152
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:44.140
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

3153
01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:45.550
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should look into that.</v>

3154
01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.050
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

3155
01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:48.340
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it's banned in Russia,</v>

3156
01:40:48.341 --> 01:40:50.410
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't necessarily mean the bitcoin disappears.</v>

3157
01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 2>It simply means that bitcoin is more of an underground in that place.</v>

3158
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:58.240
<v Speaker 5>And people have a lot less respect for laws that are arbitrary and capricious.</v>

3159
01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:02.200
<v Speaker 5>So in countries where you have week rule of law and you have rule of people</v>

3160
01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.460
<v Speaker 5>correspondingly,</v>

3161
01:41:03.461 --> 01:41:05.500
<v Speaker 5>the people don't pay much attention to those.</v>

3162
01:41:05.710 --> 01:41:05.891
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3163
01:41:05.891 --> 01:41:06.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3164
01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:08.040
<v Speaker 5>a lot of things are illegal in Russia,</v>

3165
01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:09.550
<v Speaker 5>including s you know,</v>

3166
01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:11.560
<v Speaker 5>buying and selling dollars on the black market.</v>

3167
01:41:11.561 --> 01:41:13.480
<v Speaker 5>And you can do it on every corner in Moscow.</v>

3168
01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3169
01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Isn't essentially illegal to be gay.</v>

3170
01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3171
01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:16.721
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>

3172
01:41:16.721 --> 01:41:17.800
<v Speaker 1>what are the laws on gay people?</v>

3173
01:41:17.801 --> 01:41:18.850
<v Speaker 1>They're incredibly restrictive.</v>

3174
01:41:18.851 --> 01:41:19.684
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3175
01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3176
01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:21.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3177
01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:21.470
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>

3178
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:22.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the,</v>

3179
01:41:22.541 --> 01:41:22.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

3180
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:24.250
<v Speaker 5>it's not illegal to be gay,</v>

3181
01:41:24.251 --> 01:41:25.420
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's more,</v>

3182
01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.313
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3183
01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:27.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3184
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:30.280
<v Speaker 5>there are still sodomy laws and there are still,</v>

3185
01:41:30.281 --> 01:41:31.114
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3186
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.870
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3187
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:34.510
<v Speaker 5>bans on public displays and things like that.</v>

3188
01:41:34.570 --> 01:41:34.891
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3189
01:41:34.891 --> 01:41:35.770
<v Speaker 5>it's really,</v>

3190
01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:37.480
<v Speaker 5>or even symbols.</v>

3191
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:39.940
<v Speaker 5>They arrested someone on the Sochi parade route with,</v>

3192
01:41:39.941 --> 01:41:41.140
<v Speaker 5>for holding a rainbow flag.</v>

3193
01:41:41.141 --> 01:41:41.974
<v Speaker 5>It was disgusting.</v>

3194
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:42.480
<v Speaker 5>That's all</v>

3195
01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Marius the gays have taken over the rainbow.</v>

3196
01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:46.071
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

3197
01:41:46.071 --> 01:41:46.731
<v Speaker 1>We rainbows,</v>

3198
01:41:46.731 --> 01:41:47.271
<v Speaker 1>we were a kid.</v>

3199
01:41:47.271 --> 01:41:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like fucking leprechauns pot of gold,</v>

3200
01:41:50.150 --> 01:41:50.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3201
01:41:50.601 --> 01:41:54.110
<v Speaker 1>beautiful sunshine after the rain and now it's gay.</v>

3202
01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd the fuck did they do that?</v>

3203
01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:59.030
<v Speaker 1>You can get arrested for having a fucking rainbow shirt on.</v>

3204
01:41:59.150 --> 01:41:59.361
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

3205
01:41:59.361 --> 01:42:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a fan of rainbows.</v>

3206
01:42:00.890 --> 01:42:03.110
<v Speaker 1>What if this rainbow shirt and you got a Leprechaun at the end of it?</v>

3207
01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:04.410
<v Speaker 1>What did they say then?</v>

3208
01:42:05.650 --> 01:42:09.200
<v Speaker 1>If you have a rainbow shirt on the Leprechaun and a pot of gold,</v>

3209
01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you get that.</v>

3210
01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:13.340
<v Speaker 5>To argue that in court about three months after you were arrested after spending</v>

3211
01:42:13.341 --> 01:42:14.540
<v Speaker 5>three months in a dungeon.</v>

3212
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.950
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>

3213
01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:17.480
<v Speaker 6>Well you have butt sex while you were in there,</v>

3214
01:42:17.481 --> 01:42:18.314
<v Speaker 6>so it might be great.</v>

3215
01:42:18.570 --> 01:42:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the old Lenny Bruce joke.</v>

3216
01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:21.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3217
01:42:21.150 --> 01:42:23.460
<v Speaker 1>there was like one of the classic Lenny Bruce Jokes.</v>

3218
01:42:23.850 --> 01:42:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why they would make the laws against homosexuality dig.</v>

3219
01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:32.040
<v Speaker 1>They take a guy who's gay and they arrest him and they put him in jail with a</v>

3220
01:42:32.041 --> 01:42:33.390
<v Speaker 1>bunch of men and when I have sex with them.</v>

3221
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3222
01:42:35.150 --> 01:42:35.980
<v Speaker 1>It was Lenny Bruce,</v>

3223
01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Bruce.</v>

3224
01:42:36.490 --> 01:42:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

3225
01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:37.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3226
01:42:37.091 --> 01:42:37.960
<v Speaker 1>That was a classic.</v>

3227
01:42:38.110 --> 01:42:39.780
<v Speaker 1>That was one that people uh,</v>

3228
01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:40.451
<v Speaker 1>stolen.</v>

3229
01:42:40.451 --> 01:42:41.830
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even realize they stole it.</v>

3230
01:42:41.831 --> 01:42:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3231
01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of people sort of recognize that.</v>

3232
01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like when I was,</v>

3233
01:42:45.671 --> 01:42:46.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3234
01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.650
<v Speaker 1>an open mic night comedian,</v>

3235
01:42:47.651 --> 01:42:52.651
<v Speaker 1>I've lived in Boston and Boston is of course south of New Hampshire and New</v>

3236
01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Hampshire had a license plate that said live free or die.</v>

3237
01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:57.281
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

3238
01:42:57.281 --> 01:42:57.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3239
01:42:57.550 --> 01:43:02.290
<v Speaker 1>the old classic story about license plates is that they were made by prisoners.</v>

3240
01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:06.460
<v Speaker 1>So like 10 guys came up with that joke independently.</v>

3241
01:43:06.850 --> 01:43:07.900
<v Speaker 1>The live free or die.</v>

3242
01:43:07.901 --> 01:43:08.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3243
01:43:08.051 --> 01:43:08.830
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is,</v>

3244
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:09.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3245
01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.560
<v Speaker 1>they're made by prisoners.</v>

3246
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:12.930
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those things.</v>

3247
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:15.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3248
01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:16.673
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin,</v>

3249
01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:17.513
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3250
01:43:18.450 --> 01:43:18.961
<v Speaker 1>where did we go?</v>

3251
01:43:18.961 --> 01:43:20.160
<v Speaker 1>We went off track,</v>

3252
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:21.143
<v Speaker 1>went into the woods.</v>

3253
01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:26.080
<v Speaker 6>Is there any kind of insurance or it company that's going to back up Bitcoin,</v>

3254
01:43:26.081 --> 01:43:27.670
<v Speaker 6>like an insurance company kind of like,</v>

3255
01:43:27.671 --> 01:43:27.881
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3256
01:43:27.881 --> 01:43:29.560
<v Speaker 6>when a bank gets robbed,</v>

3257
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:30.550
<v Speaker 6>US protected,</v>

3258
01:43:30.930 --> 01:43:31.150
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3259
01:43:31.150 --> 01:43:31.721
<v Speaker 6>Ashley,</v>

3260
01:43:31.721 --> 01:43:32.530
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3261
01:43:32.530 --> 01:43:35.650
<v Speaker 6>as in many areas of kind of emerging markets.</v>

3262
01:43:35.651 --> 01:43:37.780
<v Speaker 6>One of the first to move in as Lloyd's of London,</v>

3263
01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:41.050
<v Speaker 6>which have historically been involved in,</v>

3264
01:43:41.051 --> 01:43:44.260
<v Speaker 6>in types of insurance that other companies won't necessarily offer first and</v>

3265
01:43:44.261 --> 01:43:45.550
<v Speaker 6>introduce the new market.</v>

3266
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:49.840
<v Speaker 6>So there was an organization in the UK that will take,</v>

3267
01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:51.020
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3268
01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:55.100
<v Speaker 6>where you can store bitcoin and then have it in short by Lloyd's of London for a</v>

3269
01:43:55.101 --> 01:43:57.110
<v Speaker 6>specific fee and they'll protect it from theft.</v>

3270
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:59.300
<v Speaker 6>But here's the interesting thing.</v>

3271
01:43:59.380 --> 01:43:59.690
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3272
01:43:59.690 --> 01:44:00.140
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

3273
01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:02.270
<v Speaker 6>that's a fairly limited approach to it.</v>

3274
01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:03.970
<v Speaker 6>But what you can do with,</v>

3275
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:08.660
<v Speaker 6>with Bitcoin is you can take insurance contracts and the guarantees of insurance</v>

3276
01:44:08.661 --> 01:44:11.060
<v Speaker 6>companies and embed them into the transaction system.</v>

3277
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:12.590
<v Speaker 6>So now you could have,</v>

3278
01:44:12.591 --> 01:44:13.430
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

3279
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:17.750
<v Speaker 6>let's say when you go and buy something on Ebay and you do a paypal transaction</v>

3280
01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.880
<v Speaker 6>and they give you the ability to do escrow.</v>

3281
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:22.340
<v Speaker 6>So if the product never arrives at your doorstep,</v>

3282
01:44:22.610 --> 01:44:23.810
<v Speaker 6>you can get your money back.</v>

3283
01:44:23.811 --> 01:44:25.610
<v Speaker 6>Right now when you do that,</v>

3284
01:44:25.611 --> 01:44:27.260
<v Speaker 6>you have to use paypal escrow.</v>

3285
01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 6>You don't really have a choice.</v>

3286
01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:30.200
<v Speaker 6>And when you do that with visa,</v>

3287
01:44:30.201 --> 01:44:31.370
<v Speaker 6>you have to use visa escrow.</v>

3288
01:44:31.610 --> 01:44:31.821
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3289
01:44:31.821 --> 01:44:36.340
<v Speaker 6>on Bitcoin you can pick an escrow provider and have them add their own key and</v>

3290
01:44:36.341 --> 01:44:40.550
<v Speaker 6>to the transaction and now they're going to be your escrow and you chose them.</v>

3291
01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:41.510
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3292
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:44.780
<v Speaker 6>so you can pick from a market of escrow companies and they can do it without</v>

3293
01:44:44.781 --> 01:44:49.250
<v Speaker 6>actually holding your money simply by putting an extra key in the transaction</v>

3294
01:44:49.251 --> 01:44:50.690
<v Speaker 6>and neither authorizing it or not.</v>

3295
01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:52.333
<v Speaker 6>I see.</v>

3296
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:56.990
<v Speaker 6>So it opens up all of these possibilities for new forms of insurance,</v>

3297
01:44:56.991 --> 01:44:58.140
<v Speaker 6>new forms of escrow,</v>

3298
01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:02.540
<v Speaker 6>new forms of financial protections that couldn't be done with traditional money.</v>

3299
01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:03.740
<v Speaker 6>The edge,</v>

3300
01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:06.590
<v Speaker 6>there was news just out that a Jamaican bobsled team,</v>

3301
01:45:06.591 --> 01:45:08.210
<v Speaker 6>this was from bitcoin was it,</v>

3302
01:45:08.211 --> 01:45:10.340
<v Speaker 6>but it was a dodge coin or whatever it's called,</v>

3303
01:45:10.341 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 6>raise $30,000 for this year's a Olympics.</v>

3304
01:45:13.041 --> 01:45:13.874
<v Speaker 6>Just the other day.</v>

3305
01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:14.631
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3306
01:45:14.631 --> 01:45:15.260
<v Speaker 6>and I mean,</v>

3307
01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:18.170
<v Speaker 6>here's the other is story that's not told very often,</v>

3308
01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:19.820
<v Speaker 6>which is the charity aspect.</v>

3309
01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:21.380
<v Speaker 6>In study after study,</v>

3310
01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:25.460
<v Speaker 6>after study looking both the charitable organizations and user profiles,</v>

3311
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:26.330
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3312
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:27.350
<v Speaker 6>and questionnaires,</v>

3313
01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.400
<v Speaker 6>bitcoin users have said repeatedly that the number one thing they do with their</v>

3314
01:45:31.401 --> 01:45:33.290
<v Speaker 6>bitcoin is donate or give them away.</v>

3315
01:45:33.650 --> 01:45:33.980
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3316
01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:38.980
<v Speaker 6>charity is very active on the bitcoin blocks blockchain on the bitcoin network.</v>

3317
01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.473
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3318
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:41.510
<v Speaker 6>just recently,</v>

3319
01:45:42.170 --> 01:45:46.760
<v Speaker 6>bitcoiners raised a ton of money for the hurricane and the Philippines.</v>

3320
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:47.630
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3321
01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:51.170
<v Speaker 6>there's a number of charts we'll organizations helping the homeless in Florida.</v>

3322
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:52.130
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3323
01:45:52.130 --> 01:45:55.310
<v Speaker 6>there's other organizations doing the same in San Francisco,</v>

3324
01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:56.990
<v Speaker 6>all based around bitcoin.</v>

3325
01:45:57.170 --> 01:46:00.800
<v Speaker 6>So there's this incredible charitable giving spirit and it's on,</v>

3326
01:46:00.801 --> 01:46:03.230
<v Speaker 6>we're seeing that replicates with other coins to,</v>

3327
01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:04.130
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3328
01:46:04.130 --> 01:46:09.130
<v Speaker 6>one of the other interesting ones is the wikileaks recently announced that the</v>

3329
01:46:09.561 --> 01:46:11.090
<v Speaker 6>vast majority of their,</v>

3330
01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:11.330
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3331
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:13.700
<v Speaker 6>donations now come in cryptocurrencies.</v>

3332
01:46:13.701 --> 01:46:14.091
<v Speaker 6>Bitcoin,</v>

3333
01:46:14.091 --> 01:46:14.924
<v Speaker 6>unlike coin,</v>

3334
01:46:15.110 --> 01:46:18.920
<v Speaker 6>this is fascinating because on certain payment networks,</v>

3335
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:20.630
<v Speaker 6>you can't donate to,</v>

3336
01:46:20.690 --> 01:46:21.351
<v Speaker 6>to Wiki leaks,</v>

3337
01:46:21.351 --> 01:46:21.561
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3338
01:46:21.561 --> 01:46:23.420
<v Speaker 6>You can't donate to wikileaks was pay pal.</v>

3339
01:46:23.421 --> 01:46:25.400
<v Speaker 6>You can't donate to wikileaks with visa.</v>

3340
01:46:25.730 --> 01:46:27.040
<v Speaker 6>They ban you from doing that.</v>

3341
01:46:27.041 --> 01:46:29.450
<v Speaker 6>And that's how they've cut off the funding of that organization.</v>

3342
01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:32.030
<v Speaker 6>Yet at the same time on some of those payment networks,</v>

3343
01:46:32.031 --> 01:46:33.860
<v Speaker 6>you could donate to the Ku Klux Klan.</v>

3344
01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:34.521
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

3345
01:46:34.521 --> 01:46:38.390
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't represent my principals and I have a big problem with that.</v>

3346
01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:39.230
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3347
01:46:39.230 --> 01:46:43.610
<v Speaker 6>with bitcoins you can because you simply can't donate to whoever you want.</v>

3348
01:46:43.611 --> 01:46:45.380
<v Speaker 6>You can just send Bitcoin to any address.</v>

3349
01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:46.760
<v Speaker 6>And as a result,</v>

3350
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:47.800
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3351
01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:48.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3352
01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:50.430
<v Speaker 6>wikileaks has seen rise in the donations</v>

3353
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:51.250
<v Speaker 5>they receive,</v>

3354
01:46:51.250 --> 01:46:51.480
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3355
01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.313
<v Speaker 5>through bitcoin.</v>

3356
01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:54.360
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of other organizations too,</v>

3357
01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:54.751
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3358
01:46:54.751 --> 01:46:55.081
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3359
01:46:55.081 --> 01:46:56.460
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of charitable giving.</v>

3360
01:46:56.461 --> 01:46:59.200
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of nonprofit organizations using bit coin.</v>

3361
01:46:59.810 --> 01:47:01.490
<v Speaker 4>This is a fascinating time.</v>

3362
01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:02.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3363
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:04.370
<v Speaker 4>how many other Bitcoin,</v>

3364
01:47:04.371 --> 01:47:06.260
<v Speaker 4>like alternatives are available.</v>

3365
01:47:06.261 --> 01:47:09.080
<v Speaker 4>And do you feel that those are competition for big,</v>

3366
01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:12.170
<v Speaker 4>for Bitcoin or they just as valid as bitcoin?</v>

3367
01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:14.930
<v Speaker 4>Is there room for a bunch of cryptocurrencies?</v>

3368
01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:15.651
<v Speaker 4>What's the,</v>

3369
01:47:15.651 --> 01:47:16.850
<v Speaker 4>what's the attitude about that?</v>

3370
01:47:17.250 --> 01:47:19.320
<v Speaker 5>That's a great question because we,</v>

3371
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.680
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3372
01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.401
<v Speaker 5>generally speaking,</v>

3373
01:47:20.401 --> 01:47:23.610
<v Speaker 5>the term for alternative currencies is altcoins.</v>

3374
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:24.091
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3375
01:47:24.091 --> 01:47:25.950
<v Speaker 5>some of them are alternative,</v>

3376
01:47:25.951 --> 01:47:27.120
<v Speaker 5>some of them are,</v>

3377
01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:27.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3378
01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:29.370
<v Speaker 5>more competitive with bitcoin.</v>

3379
01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:32.190
<v Speaker 5>All of them are based on the same invention.</v>

3380
01:47:32.370 --> 01:47:36.390
<v Speaker 5>So what this shows is that the underlying invention of how to do computational</v>

3381
01:47:36.391 --> 01:47:40.500
<v Speaker 5>agreement on the network that invention has spawned all of these other</v>

3382
01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:41.753
<v Speaker 5>currencies.</v>

3383
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:42.241
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3384
01:47:42.241 --> 01:47:43.680
<v Speaker 5>some of them are very innovative,</v>

3385
01:47:43.681 --> 01:47:48.681
<v Speaker 5>some of them are just fads and memes and some of them are pump and dump schemes.</v>

3386
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.250
<v Speaker 5>So there's a whole range.</v>

3387
01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:55.560
<v Speaker 5>One of the interesting things that this has created is that in the past money</v>

3388
01:47:55.561 --> 01:47:59.850
<v Speaker 5>was trusted and had value because not many people could create it.</v>

3389
01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:03.420
<v Speaker 5>And so we trust governments to create money.</v>

3390
01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:08.840
<v Speaker 5>And money has value because only governments can create money now because anyone</v>

3391
01:48:09.331 --> 01:48:10.350
<v Speaker 5>can create money.</v>

3392
01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:13.410
<v Speaker 5>How you give it value depends on other things,</v>

3393
01:48:13.650 --> 01:48:16.890
<v Speaker 5>which is actually a good lesson because government money doesn't really have</v>

3394
01:48:16.891 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 5>that much value in a lot of places either.</v>

3395
01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:22.050
<v Speaker 5>It's just an illusion that somehow that makes it valuable.</v>

3396
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:24.270
<v Speaker 5>In the case of Bitcoin,</v>

3397
01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:28.410
<v Speaker 5>what makes bitcoin valuable is the enormous amounts of investment.</v>

3398
01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:29.040
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3399
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:31.950
<v Speaker 5>both in terms of resources,</v>

3400
01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.090
<v Speaker 5>in terms of the computing equipment that people have bought in terms of the</v>

3401
01:48:36.091 --> 01:48:38.550
<v Speaker 5>invested companies that are in it and the people who work in it.</v>

3402
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:39.420
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3403
01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:43.020
<v Speaker 5>other coins have slightly different variations of the same theme.</v>

3404
01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:44.040
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3405
01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:46.170
<v Speaker 5>and some of them are based on memes,</v>

3406
01:48:46.171 --> 01:48:47.004
<v Speaker 5>Internet memes.</v>

3407
01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:48.000
<v Speaker 5>But here's,</v>

3408
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.000
<v Speaker 5>I see a future where a five year old at school could use a web browser to build</v>

3409
01:48:54.481 --> 01:48:58.230
<v Speaker 5>a coin in an afternoon and launch it among their friends.</v>

3410
01:48:58.440 --> 01:48:59.850
<v Speaker 5>So will there be more coins?</v>

3411
01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:00.210
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3412
01:49:00.210 --> 01:49:01.650
<v Speaker 5>tens of thousands of them.</v>

3413
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.641
<v Speaker 5>And we'll,</v>

3414
01:49:02.641 --> 01:49:03.660
<v Speaker 5>those coins have value.</v>

3415
01:49:03.661 --> 01:49:04.470
<v Speaker 5>Probably not,</v>

3416
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:08.280
<v Speaker 5>no more than baseball cards or Pokemon or a Tamagotchi.</v>

3417
01:49:08.281 --> 01:49:12.090
<v Speaker 5>But within an environment and with young people,</v>

3418
01:49:12.330 --> 01:49:13.650
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have,</v>

3419
01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:19.220
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have people who create them for trading purposes and as memes</v>

3420
01:49:19.221 --> 01:49:19.590
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3421
01:49:19.590 --> 01:49:20.423
<v Speaker 5>and fats.</v>

3422
01:49:20.730 --> 01:49:22.940
<v Speaker 5>And so they'll have a certain kind of value,</v>

3423
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:24.240
<v Speaker 5>just not monetary value.</v>

3424
01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:28.410
<v Speaker 5>So you have to evaluate which coins have monetary value based on what's running</v>

3425
01:49:28.411 --> 01:49:29.040
<v Speaker 5>behind them.</v>

3426
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:29.430
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3427
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:33.330
<v Speaker 5>the bitcoin economy has an actual economy behind it has merchants,</v>

3428
01:49:33.331 --> 01:49:34.650
<v Speaker 5>it has retail transactions,</v>

3429
01:49:34.651 --> 01:49:36.470
<v Speaker 5>it has a startup,</v>

3430
01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.580
<v Speaker 5>companies that are investing in developing things with it.</v>

3431
01:49:39.210 --> 01:49:41.490
<v Speaker 5>Some of these other coins have some of those things.</v>

3432
01:49:41.491 --> 01:49:42.900
<v Speaker 5>Some of them have none of those things.</v>

3433
01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:47.530
<v Speaker 4>But is there a risk of bitcoin being like the myspace of cryptocurrencies when</v>

3434
01:49:47.531 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 4>you get off to</v>

3435
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.900
<v Speaker 1>his big headstart and you're way ahead of the game,</v>

3436
01:49:49.901 --> 01:49:52.150
<v Speaker 1>but there's holes in your game and right?</v>

3437
01:49:52.210 --> 01:49:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Facebook comes in and steals all your people.</v>

3438
01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:59.780
<v Speaker 5>So one thing to realize is that money is a lot more sticky than a social site.</v>

3439
01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:00.560
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3440
01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:04.790
<v Speaker 5>and when people invest their skills and expertise and companies into a certain</v>

3441
01:50:04.791 --> 01:50:05.600
<v Speaker 5>cryptocurrency,</v>

3442
01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:06.800
<v Speaker 5>that carries a lot of weight.</v>

3443
01:50:06.801 --> 01:50:10.850
<v Speaker 5>So bitcoin has already achieved a very high level of network effect,</v>

3444
01:50:10.851 --> 01:50:12.410
<v Speaker 5>which means that the more people are on it,</v>

3445
01:50:12.411 --> 01:50:13.790
<v Speaker 5>the more people that attracts,</v>

3446
01:50:13.791 --> 01:50:14.630
<v Speaker 5>the more people that are on it,</v>

3447
01:50:14.631 --> 01:50:15.920
<v Speaker 5>the more people that attracts.</v>

3448
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:16.880
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time,</v>

3449
01:50:17.150 --> 01:50:19.730
<v Speaker 5>because it's building a capital base that makes it,</v>

3450
01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:22.250
<v Speaker 5>that makes it very difficult to unseat bitcoin.</v>

3451
01:50:22.730 --> 01:50:23.330
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3452
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:26.690
<v Speaker 5>I think what we'll end up seeing is,</v>

3453
01:50:27.170 --> 01:50:27.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3454
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:29.510
<v Speaker 5>one or two major currencies.</v>

3455
01:50:29.511 --> 01:50:31.310
<v Speaker 5>Bitcoin is probably going to be the biggest,</v>

3456
01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:32.720
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3457
01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:37.490
<v Speaker 5>and then two or three or four or five secondary currencies that do some kind of</v>

3458
01:50:37.491 --> 01:50:39.980
<v Speaker 5>niche thing that's useful for some group,</v>

3459
01:50:40.370 --> 01:50:41.000
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3460
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.480
<v Speaker 5>that bitcoin can't do a won't do because it sounds like for example,</v>

3461
01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:49.740
<v Speaker 5>a bitcoin has reverse inflation deflation because there's a fixed supply.</v>

3462
01:50:49.850 --> 01:50:52.580
<v Speaker 5>So over time the value is gradually going to increase,</v>

3463
01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:53.480
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3464
01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:53.960
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3465
01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:56.360
<v Speaker 5>other people have created coins where if you don't spend them,</v>

3466
01:50:56.361 --> 01:50:57.140
<v Speaker 5>you lose a bit,</v>

3467
01:50:57.140 --> 01:50:58.910
<v Speaker 5>which is like inflation.</v>

3468
01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:02.360
<v Speaker 5>So bitcoin is not going to be able to copy that and take,</v>

3469
01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:03.530
<v Speaker 5>take that feature and say,</v>

3470
01:51:03.531 --> 01:51:03.681
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

3471
01:51:03.681 --> 01:51:04.221
<v Speaker 5>that looks good,</v>

3472
01:51:04.221 --> 01:51:05.054
<v Speaker 5>let's do it too.</v>

3473
01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:07.190
<v Speaker 5>But for a lot of other things,</v>

3474
01:51:07.191 --> 01:51:07.520
<v Speaker 5>when an,</v>

3475
01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.560
<v Speaker 5>when an alternative coin invents something new,</v>

3476
01:51:09.561 --> 01:51:14.510
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin can simply pick it up and run with it to a big coin hasn't stopped</v>

3477
01:51:14.511 --> 01:51:15.344
<v Speaker 5>moving.</v>

3478
01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:19.490
<v Speaker 5>It was invented in 2008 and five years of innovation have gone into it and the</v>

3479
01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:21.110
<v Speaker 5>level of innovation is accelerating.</v>

3480
01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:25.910
<v Speaker 5>So I think there's a lot of room for a lot of coins in this space and not all of</v>

3481
01:51:25.911 --> 01:51:26.721
<v Speaker 5>them are going to have value,</v>

3482
01:51:26.721 --> 01:51:28.100
<v Speaker 5>but some of them will have value.</v>

3483
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:31.820
<v Speaker 1>So are there any that stand down?</v>

3484
01:51:31.821 --> 01:51:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I know Doge Coin Dog,</v>

3485
01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:35.890
<v Speaker 1>he coin is one that keeps getting brought up to me to,</v>

3486
01:51:35.891 --> 01:51:37.400
<v Speaker 1>to talk to you about on the Internet.</v>

3487
01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:39.680
<v Speaker 1>What about Kanye West's coin?</v>

3488
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:40.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3489
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Kanye West has a coin,</v>

3490
01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:46.640
<v Speaker 5>so I think there are a few coins that have interesting characteristics.</v>

3491
01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:47.653
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3492
01:51:48.130 --> 01:51:48.561
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3493
01:51:48.561 --> 01:51:49.730
<v Speaker 5>they implement new features,</v>

3494
01:51:49.731 --> 01:51:53.300
<v Speaker 5>they do things slightly better or slightly different in some ways than bitcoin.</v>

3495
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.870
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>

3496
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:54.290
<v Speaker 5>like what,</v>

3497
01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:55.123
<v Speaker 5>what do they do better?</v>

3498
01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:55.820
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3499
01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:57.050
<v Speaker 5>well for example,</v>

3500
01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:57.913
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3501
01:51:57.980 --> 01:52:00.170
<v Speaker 5>one example is a light coin.</v>

3502
01:52:00.230 --> 01:52:03.440
<v Speaker 5>And what light coin does is it has a different way of,</v>

3503
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:05.270
<v Speaker 5>of having the agreement on the network,</v>

3504
01:52:05.271 --> 01:52:06.020
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

3505
01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:08.870
<v Speaker 5>which requires more memory on your computer in less CPU.</v>

3506
01:52:08.871 --> 01:52:09.830
<v Speaker 5>So that makes it,</v>

3507
01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:10.580
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3508
01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:12.800
<v Speaker 5>more level at the same time.</v>

3509
01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:13.280
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3510
01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:15.920
<v Speaker 5>it does transactions that are on a different pace.</v>

3511
01:52:15.921 --> 01:52:17.360
<v Speaker 5>So instead of every 10 minutes,</v>

3512
01:52:17.361 --> 01:52:18.150
<v Speaker 5>it does,</v>

3513
01:52:18.150 --> 01:52:18.410
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3514
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.651
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3515
01:52:18.651 --> 01:52:19.940
<v Speaker 5>fewer minutes for per block.</v>

3516
01:52:19.941 --> 01:52:20.721
<v Speaker 5>I think it's two and a half,</v>

3517
01:52:20.721 --> 01:52:22.880
<v Speaker 5>and then you have a larger number of total coin.</v>

3518
01:52:22.881 --> 01:52:23.930
<v Speaker 5>So it's a few tweaks.</v>

3519
01:52:24.170 --> 01:52:25.910
<v Speaker 5>The idea is if bitcoin is gold,</v>

3520
01:52:25.911 --> 01:52:26.960
<v Speaker 5>light coin is silver.</v>

3521
01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:28.040
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3522
01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:30.530
<v Speaker 5>but that's the general competitive environments.</v>

3523
01:52:30.531 --> 01:52:30.741
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

3524
01:52:30.741 --> 01:52:35.420
<v Speaker 5>beyond that Doge coin is in fact or dog coin or Doggy Coin,</v>

3525
01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:35.840
<v Speaker 5>whenever,</v>

3526
01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:38.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm not quite sure how it's pronounced is,</v>

3527
01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:41.180
<v Speaker 5>is an enhancement on the original,</v>

3528
01:52:41.210 --> 01:52:42.043
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3529
01:52:42.170 --> 01:52:43.190
<v Speaker 5>idea of light coin.</v>

3530
01:52:43.191 --> 01:52:44.840
<v Speaker 5>So it took that and then twisted it a bit.</v>

3531
01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.950
<v Speaker 5>And then you've got this whole list of other coins that,</v>

3532
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:48.950
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3533
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:50.000
<v Speaker 5>some of them are interesting.</v>

3534
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:52.130
<v Speaker 5>One discovers prime numbers,</v>

3535
01:52:52.131 --> 01:52:56.060
<v Speaker 5>which are useful in mathematics and the other one uses a different peer to peer</v>

3536
01:52:56.061 --> 01:52:56.840
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

3537
01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:57.680
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3538
01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:59.330
<v Speaker 5>another one is more programmable.</v>

3539
01:52:59.331 --> 01:53:00.950
<v Speaker 5>One of the new coins that's come out now,</v>

3540
01:53:00.951 --> 01:53:05.951
<v Speaker 5>ethereum allows each transaction to be a full code for programming language.</v>

3541
01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:08.630
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3542
01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:08.901
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3543
01:53:08.901 --> 01:53:12.020
<v Speaker 5>all of these may have interesting characteristics and then,</v>

3544
01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:12.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3545
01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:13.700
<v Speaker 5>Kanye West coin,</v>

3546
01:53:13.730 --> 01:53:13.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3547
01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:14.490
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

3548
01:53:14.490 --> 01:53:15.440
<v Speaker 5>and hey man,</v>

3549
01:53:15.441 --> 01:53:15.671
<v Speaker 5>dumped,</v>

3550
01:53:15.671 --> 01:53:16.221
<v Speaker 5>dismiss it.</v>

3551
01:53:16.221 --> 01:53:16.401
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3552
01:53:16.401 --> 01:53:17.031
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's great.</v>

3553
01:53:17.031 --> 01:53:17.864
<v Speaker 5>It comes to goal first.</v>

3554
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.411
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

3555
01:53:18.411 --> 01:53:19.490
<v Speaker 5>they got sued I think,</v>

3556
01:53:19.491 --> 01:53:23.480
<v Speaker 5>or they got cease and desists because they had nothing to do with him.</v>

3557
01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:24.710
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3558
01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:28.940
<v Speaker 5>but one of the interesting things is that we don't know if one of these catches</v>

3559
01:53:28.941 --> 01:53:29.774
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

3560
01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:35.000
<v Speaker 5>who knows why not a lot of things in life started as a joke and then became huge</v>

3561
01:53:35.001 --> 01:53:37.100
<v Speaker 5>things that became embedded in the culture.</v>

3562
01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:38.563
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>

3563
01:53:38.710 --> 01:53:39.670
<v Speaker 4>let me ask you this.</v>

3564
01:53:39.730 --> 01:53:42.730
<v Speaker 4>What about these massive fluctuations in value,</v>

3565
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:44.200
<v Speaker 4>like day to day,</v>

3566
01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:44.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3567
01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:46.510
<v Speaker 4>In intense fluctuations?</v>

3568
01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:46.900
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3569
01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:49.570
<v Speaker 4>Very disconcerting to people that are looking for a stable investment.</v>

3570
01:53:49.571 --> 01:53:50.760
<v Speaker 4>When you see what are the,</v>

3571
01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:51.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3572
01:53:51.370 --> 01:53:52.390
<v Speaker 4>several hundred percent,</v>

3573
01:53:52.391 --> 01:53:52.571
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3574
01:53:52.571 --> 01:53:55.570
<v Speaker 4>What is the worst day or the best day as far as the variation?</v>

3575
01:53:56.130 --> 01:54:00.220
<v Speaker 5>So I think the best day was a was maybe two and a half years ago,</v>

3576
01:54:00.610 --> 01:54:05.020
<v Speaker 5>which was a minus minus 40 minus 50% in a day.</v>

3577
01:54:05.410 --> 01:54:10.410
<v Speaker 5>That was a really big crash and it took it to from above 32 below a dollar.</v>

3578
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.823
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3579
01:54:12.970 --> 01:54:16.990
<v Speaker 5>and then there was another crash around a hundred and then there was another one</v>

3580
01:54:16.991 --> 01:54:20.140
<v Speaker 5>around to 66 and then there was another one around the thousand.</v>

3581
01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:24.190
<v Speaker 5>And so we're now kind of in a relatively stable band,</v>

3582
01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:24.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3583
01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:27.130
<v Speaker 5>between 800 900,</v>

3584
01:54:27.131 --> 01:54:27.850
<v Speaker 5>somewhere there.</v>

3585
01:54:27.850 --> 01:54:28.101
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3586
01:54:28.101 --> 01:54:28.600
<v Speaker 5>Explain.</v>

3587
01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:33.600
<v Speaker 5>But here's the point over time is these little hiccups get narrower and</v>

3588
01:54:34.871 --> 01:54:35.320
<v Speaker 5>narrower.</v>

3589
01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:36.580
<v Speaker 5>And here's why they occur.</v>

3590
01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:37.940
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the bitcoin,</v>

3591
01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:39.760
<v Speaker 5>the total market capitalization,</v>

3592
01:54:39.761 --> 01:54:42.880
<v Speaker 5>if you take all of the bitcoins that exist times the value that they have on the</v>

3593
01:54:42.881 --> 01:54:43.714
<v Speaker 5>market today,</v>

3594
01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:45.490
<v Speaker 5>it's about a $10 billion market,</v>

3595
01:54:45.850 --> 01:54:46.480
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3596
01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:48.400
<v Speaker 5>$10 billion market might sound like a lot,</v>

3597
01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:49.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3598
01:54:49.211 --> 01:54:50.470
<v Speaker 5>certainly if it was a tech stock,</v>

3599
01:54:50.471 --> 01:54:52.180
<v Speaker 5>it would be a nice size tech stock.</v>

3600
01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.860
<v Speaker 5>But as a currency is puny,</v>

3601
01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.281
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3602
01:54:54.281 --> 01:54:58.240
<v Speaker 5>there are hundreds of countries that have bigger monetary base for that</v>

3603
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.550
<v Speaker 5>currency.</v>

3604
01:54:58.550 --> 01:55:00.100
<v Speaker 5>And this is an international currency.</v>

3605
01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:00.993
<v Speaker 5>It's small.</v>

3606
01:55:01.090 --> 01:55:04.890
<v Speaker 5>So what happens is this is a shallow pool of,</v>

3607
01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:05.890
<v Speaker 5>of uh,</v>

3608
01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:06.813
<v Speaker 5>liquidity.</v>

3609
01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:10.990
<v Speaker 5>And when you have a shallow pool of liquidity like this with a few markets that</v>

3610
01:55:10.991 --> 01:55:12.100
<v Speaker 5>are not very efficient,</v>

3611
01:55:12.130 --> 01:55:14.470
<v Speaker 5>the end result is that every time someone sneezes,</v>

3612
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:18.160
<v Speaker 5>all of the liquidity sloshes around and you get these fluctuations,</v>

3613
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:20.470
<v Speaker 5>but as it gets bigger in size,</v>

3614
01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:21.760
<v Speaker 5>the waves get smaller,</v>

3615
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:22.623
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3616
01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:25.330
<v Speaker 5>So it's not as volatile.</v>

3617
01:55:25.331 --> 01:55:26.320
<v Speaker 5>And if you look at it,</v>

3618
01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:26.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3619
01:55:26.710 --> 01:55:29.230
<v Speaker 5>if you plotted on a graph and you plot the volatility,</v>

3620
01:55:29.231 --> 01:55:32.620
<v Speaker 5>you'll see that every year it's getting less and less and less and less and less</v>

3621
01:55:32.621 --> 01:55:33.400
<v Speaker 5>volatile.</v>

3622
01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:33.790
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

3623
01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:35.980
<v Speaker 5>if at some point it became large,</v>

3624
01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:36.551
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3625
01:55:36.551 --> 01:55:40.660
<v Speaker 5>the reason currencies like the u s dollar on it are not very volatile,</v>

3626
01:55:40.930 --> 01:55:45.150
<v Speaker 5>is because if you think of a $14 trillion economy is like a titanic,</v>

3627
01:55:45.151 --> 01:55:45.984
<v Speaker 5>it takes,</v>

3628
01:55:46.050 --> 01:55:46.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3629
01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:49.050
<v Speaker 5>three miles to turn 10 degrees,</v>

3630
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:50.003
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3631
01:55:50.250 --> 01:55:54.900
<v Speaker 5>So they're much more stable because they have weight behind them and inertia.</v>

3632
01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:56.370
<v Speaker 5>And even if you want to change it,</v>

3633
01:55:56.371 --> 01:55:59.550
<v Speaker 5>you tweak something now and it changes in six months because it takes time to</v>

3634
01:55:59.551 --> 01:56:00.540
<v Speaker 5>filter through the economy.</v>

3635
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:02.003
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>

3636
01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:04.500
<v Speaker 5>think of Bitcoin is like a little Zodiac boat,</v>

3637
01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:07.500
<v Speaker 5>makes the titanic bouncing up and down the waves,</v>

3638
01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:08.633
<v Speaker 5>very nimble,</v>

3639
01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:13.970
<v Speaker 5>both volatile over time as it gets bigger than the waves get smaller by</v>

3640
01:56:14.251 --> 01:56:14.730
<v Speaker 5>comparison.</v>

3641
01:56:14.730 --> 01:56:15.030
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3642
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:20.030
<v Speaker 5>what is the cause of these fluctuations to a financial dunce like myself?</v>

3643
01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:20.770
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

3644
01:56:20.770 --> 01:56:21.511
<v Speaker 5>what causes?</v>

3645
01:56:21.511 --> 01:56:25.190
<v Speaker 5>Like how can it be worth x amount and then half that in the case.</v>

3646
01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:29.670
<v Speaker 5>So let me start by answering the implicit question of how does it get its value?</v>

3647
01:56:29.671 --> 01:56:30.600
<v Speaker 5>Who sets the price?</v>

3648
01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:30.960
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3649
01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:32.730
<v Speaker 5>so it's a free market.</v>

3650
01:56:33.050 --> 01:56:33.611
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3651
01:56:33.611 --> 01:56:38.611
<v Speaker 5>and so if you go and try to buy bitcoin online at the moment and you say,</v>

3652
01:56:39.090 --> 01:56:40.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to pay 800 for it,</v>

3653
01:56:40.831 --> 01:56:42.000
<v Speaker 5>and someone says yes,</v>

3654
01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:47.540
<v Speaker 5>and then during the day the vast volume of people are buying and selling for</v>

3655
01:56:47.791 --> 01:56:49.410
<v Speaker 5>around a hundred $800.</v>

3656
01:56:49.410 --> 01:56:49.711
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

3657
01:56:49.711 --> 01:56:50.880
<v Speaker 5>That's the price of bitcoin.</v>

3658
01:56:50.881 --> 01:56:53.910
<v Speaker 5>It's whatever people are paying to buy and sell bitcoin.</v>

3659
01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:56.310
<v Speaker 5>And so every time the order changes,</v>

3660
01:56:56.610 --> 01:56:57.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3661
01:56:57.210 --> 01:57:00.450
<v Speaker 5>if suddenly you can't find anyone to buy your bitcoin at 800,</v>

3662
01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.570
<v Speaker 5>you're going to discount it a bit and discount until you find someone who's</v>

3663
01:57:03.571 --> 01:57:04.320
<v Speaker 5>going to buy it.</v>

3664
01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.670
<v Speaker 5>And then that's the new price.</v>

3665
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:07.320
<v Speaker 5>So it will go down a bit.</v>

3666
01:57:07.410 --> 01:57:11.730
<v Speaker 5>But if you are finding people easily to buy your bitcoin,</v>

3667
01:57:11.731 --> 01:57:13.020
<v Speaker 5>then you increase the price of it.</v>

3668
01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:14.100
<v Speaker 5>So it goes up a bit.</v>

3669
01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:15.330
<v Speaker 5>Just like the stock market.</v>

3670
01:57:15.331 --> 01:57:16.590
<v Speaker 5>Who sets the price of IBM?</v>

3671
01:57:16.650 --> 01:57:17.483
<v Speaker 5>No one,</v>

3672
01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:21.390
<v Speaker 5>it's whatever the last deal was on IBM stock.</v>

3673
01:57:21.450 --> 01:57:21.991
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3674
01:57:21.991 --> 01:57:22.260
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3675
01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:26.580
<v Speaker 5>how's that not make it vulnerable for the same pump and dump issues that you're</v>

3676
01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:29.070
<v Speaker 5>experiencing with all these other cryptocurrencies?</v>

3677
01:57:29.730 --> 01:57:29.941
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3678
01:57:29.941 --> 01:57:30.181
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3679
01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:30.571
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3680
01:57:30.571 --> 01:57:31.860
<v Speaker 5>it does make it vulnerable,</v>

3681
01:57:31.861 --> 01:57:34.560
<v Speaker 5>but the point is there's still a fixed amount of bitcoin.</v>

3682
01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:38.340
<v Speaker 5>So right now that small fixed amount of bitcoin with,</v>

3683
01:57:38.370 --> 01:57:38.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3684
01:57:38.670 --> 01:57:43.670
<v Speaker 5>very big changes of media news piece comes out and it's like Chinese people are</v>

3685
01:57:44.341 --> 01:57:45.750
<v Speaker 5>buying bitcoin woo.</v>

3686
01:57:45.751 --> 01:57:46.351
<v Speaker 5>And it goes,</v>

3687
01:57:46.351 --> 01:57:46.651
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3688
01:57:46.651 --> 01:57:47.490
<v Speaker 5>really high.</v>

3689
01:57:47.491 --> 01:57:48.840
<v Speaker 5>Everybody gets really excited.</v>

3690
01:57:48.841 --> 01:57:49.171
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

3691
01:57:49.171 --> 01:57:50.280
<v Speaker 5>it is breaking through.</v>

3692
01:57:50.281 --> 01:57:51.061
<v Speaker 5>Then the next week,</v>

3693
01:57:51.061 --> 01:57:54.090
<v Speaker 5>Central Bank of China won't let banks hold bitcoin down.</v>

3694
01:57:54.091 --> 01:57:54.571
<v Speaker 5>We go,</v>

3695
01:57:54.571 --> 01:57:55.404
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3696
01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:58.680
<v Speaker 5>every piece of good news pushes the price up.</v>

3697
01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:02.310
<v Speaker 5>Suddenly every piece of bad news knocks it down suddenly,</v>

3698
01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:07.260
<v Speaker 5>but it seems like really manipulative financial experts would be able to move it</v>

3699
01:58:07.261 --> 01:58:10.560
<v Speaker 5>left and right to their whim in order to profit off of it.</v>

3700
01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:11.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3701
01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:12.840
<v Speaker 5>on this probably a bit of that going on,</v>

3702
01:58:14.250 --> 01:58:19.020
<v Speaker 5>but I can tell you that there is a lot more of that going on in every other</v>

3703
01:58:19.021 --> 01:58:19.381
<v Speaker 5>market.</v>

3704
01:58:19.381 --> 01:58:20.630
<v Speaker 5>So that's the interesting thing here.</v>

3705
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:22.390
<v Speaker 5>We now know that Libor,</v>

3706
01:58:22.410 --> 01:58:26.370
<v Speaker 5>the interest rates in the Lenten than bank system has been fixed for years and</v>

3707
01:58:26.371 --> 01:58:27.870
<v Speaker 5>that's the basis for most interest rates.</v>

3708
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:29.280
<v Speaker 5>We know that the gold markets fixed,</v>

3709
01:58:29.281 --> 01:58:30.450
<v Speaker 5>we know that the stock markets,</v>

3710
01:58:30.451 --> 01:58:33.390
<v Speaker 5>they're doing front running on high frequency transactions,</v>

3711
01:58:33.391 --> 01:58:34.224
<v Speaker 5>those are fixed.</v>

3712
01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:39.180
<v Speaker 5>Every single market out there is currently rigged and so the people who are</v>

3713
01:58:39.181 --> 01:58:43.510
<v Speaker 5>playing within these markets with like fiber optic connections to this main data</v>

3714
01:58:43.511 --> 01:58:44.290
<v Speaker 5>center,</v>

3715
01:58:44.290 --> 01:58:44.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3716
01:58:44.621 --> 01:58:49.150
<v Speaker 5>and they're three feet closer than the other server and can get that transaction</v>

3717
01:58:49.151 --> 01:58:50.770
<v Speaker 5>in four nanosecond sooner.</v>

3718
01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Our front running transactions are benefiting,</v>

3719
01:58:54.551 --> 01:58:57.640
<v Speaker 5>are profiting from that distance and these markets are rigged.</v>

3720
01:58:57.641 --> 01:58:57.791
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3721
01:58:57.791 --> 01:59:00.520
<v Speaker 5>you go in with you a little brokerage accounts and you trade some IBM and you</v>

3722
01:59:00.521 --> 01:59:01.600
<v Speaker 5>think you're playing the game,</v>

3723
01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:03.161
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3724
01:59:03.161 --> 01:59:05.920
<v Speaker 5>You're the dunce in the room cause you don't know who the dunce and the room is.</v>

3725
01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:08.920
<v Speaker 5>What you're talking about with automated transfers like that where you're</v>

3726
01:59:08.921 --> 01:59:09.920
<v Speaker 5>dealing with Nano sock,</v>

3727
01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:12.460
<v Speaker 5>high frequency trading as it's called their algorithmic trading.</v>

3728
01:59:12.490 --> 01:59:13.780
<v Speaker 5>Unbelievably fascinating stuff.</v>

3729
01:59:13.781 --> 01:59:14.200
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3730
01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:19.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean literally they have racks trying to get closer to the rack where the</v>

3731
01:59:19.241 --> 01:59:22.690
<v Speaker 5>transactions are happening until data centers had to say,</v>

3732
01:59:22.810 --> 01:59:24.070
<v Speaker 5>no matter where you are in the room,</v>

3733
01:59:24.071 --> 01:59:27.850
<v Speaker 5>you're getting 300 feet of fiber and if it's coiled at the bottom of your rack</v>

3734
01:59:27.851 --> 01:59:28.870
<v Speaker 5>or if it's stretched out,</v>

3735
01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:33.280
<v Speaker 5>since you're still going to have to go soon so that everybody gets the same</v>

3736
01:59:33.281 --> 01:59:33.521
<v Speaker 5>deal.</v>

3737
01:59:33.521 --> 01:59:34.241
<v Speaker 5>But right now,</v>

3738
01:59:34.241 --> 01:59:35.074
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

3739
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3740
01:59:35.790 --> 01:59:37.180
<v Speaker 5>all of the banks are playing this game.</v>

3741
01:59:37.181 --> 01:59:39.130
<v Speaker 5>How can fast can you do a transaction?</v>

3742
01:59:39.131 --> 01:59:40.900
<v Speaker 5>So what I'm saying is yes,</v>

3743
01:59:40.901 --> 01:59:43.330
<v Speaker 5>there is manipulation in the bitcoin market,</v>

3744
01:59:43.331 --> 01:59:46.510
<v Speaker 5>but the manipulation is on the stock,</v>

3745
01:59:46.511 --> 01:59:48.110
<v Speaker 5>on the exchange rates,</v>

3746
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:50.500
<v Speaker 5>is that that happens on a day to day basis,</v>

3747
01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:52.480
<v Speaker 5>but it's not on the supply of money.</v>

3748
01:59:52.570 --> 01:59:54.730
<v Speaker 5>Whereas in the real economy,</v>

3749
01:59:54.731 --> 01:59:55.720
<v Speaker 5>the stock market,</v>

3750
01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:57.220
<v Speaker 5>the New York stock has changed.</v>

3751
01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:58.690
<v Speaker 5>Not only is the market rigged,</v>

3752
01:59:58.930 --> 02:00:00.940
<v Speaker 5>and not only is the market been manipulated,</v>

3753
02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:03.580
<v Speaker 5>but the currency itself is rigged and being manipulated.</v>

3754
02:00:03.581 --> 02:00:06.280
<v Speaker 5>The Fed is printing money and handing it to the banks.</v>

3755
02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:08.290
<v Speaker 5>So the lesser of two evils,</v>

3756
02:00:08.530 --> 02:00:10.480
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely the lesser of the two evils.</v>

3757
02:00:10.481 --> 02:00:12.400
<v Speaker 5>And also the larger it gets,</v>

3758
02:00:12.401 --> 02:00:14.770
<v Speaker 5>the harder it is for outsiders to manipulated,</v>

3759
02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:16.173
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3760
02:00:16.210 --> 02:00:18.580
<v Speaker 5>Because they don't control the levers of power of the currency.</v>

3761
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.080
<v Speaker 5>There are no leavers,</v>

3762
02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:21.580
<v Speaker 5>and that's the beauty of it.</v>

3763
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.940
<v Speaker 5>So you create a system that doesn't have leavers to control the currency.</v>

3764
02:00:24.941 --> 02:00:27.520
<v Speaker 5>So all they can control is the price and manipulated.</v>

3765
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:31.660
<v Speaker 5>But that's a dangerous game to play long term because if the market turns</v>

3766
02:00:31.661 --> 02:00:32.041
<v Speaker 5>against you,</v>

3767
02:00:32.041 --> 02:00:33.130
<v Speaker 5>you lose a lot of money too.</v>

3768
02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:37.750
<v Speaker 5>So it's currently worth how much is a bitcoin worth in American dollars?</v>

3769
02:00:38.050 --> 02:00:38.291
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3770
02:00:38.291 --> 02:00:42.610
<v Speaker 5>so one place to look up is bitcoin average.com and that shows you the average</v>

3771
02:00:42.611 --> 02:00:45.460
<v Speaker 5>across dozens of exchanges all around the world.</v>

3772
02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:48.160
<v Speaker 5>At the moment it's a 700,</v>

3773
02:00:48.370 --> 02:00:53.370
<v Speaker 5>hang on one bitcoin is 784 US dollars on average at the moment.</v>

3774
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.360
<v Speaker 5>And that's fairly stable cause you were talking about it at 800 before.</v>

3775
02:00:58.361 --> 02:01:01.510
<v Speaker 5>So it's pretty close for the last month it's been in that band.</v>

3776
02:01:02.370 --> 02:01:02.860
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3777
02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:04.330
<v Speaker 5>we have seen some wild swings,</v>

3778
02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:07.000
<v Speaker 5>but it seems to be stabilized around that level now,</v>

3779
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:11.170
<v Speaker 5>which by the way is three times the level it had stabilized before the big</v>

3780
02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:16.330
<v Speaker 5>bounce and how much bitcoin is actually available out there in the world.</v>

3781
02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:18.820
<v Speaker 5>So I'd have to look that up.</v>

3782
02:01:18.821 --> 02:01:22.750
<v Speaker 5>I would say about 11 million or so have been created so far.</v>

3783
02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:25.780
<v Speaker 5>And there's a constant creation of these every 10 minutes,</v>

3784
02:01:25.781 --> 02:01:30.400
<v Speaker 5>25 and this constant creation will eventually not just level off,</v>

3785
02:01:30.401 --> 02:01:31.510
<v Speaker 5>but one day stop.</v>

3786
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:32.583
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3787
02:01:32.590 --> 02:01:33.970
<v Speaker 5>Now what happens then?</v>

3788
02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:35.800
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3789
02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:36.730
<v Speaker 5>the thing is it,</v>

3790
02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:37.240
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3791
02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:39.770
<v Speaker 5>it starts operating more like a precious metal,</v>

3792
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.240
<v Speaker 5>which is that,</v>

3793
02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:41.601
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3794
02:01:41.601 --> 02:01:44.480
<v Speaker 5>once supply of a precious metal gets restricted,</v>

3795
02:01:44.481 --> 02:01:45.740
<v Speaker 5>it increases in value.</v>

3796
02:01:46.190 --> 02:01:48.230
<v Speaker 5>But the one difference is that a precious metal,</v>

3797
02:01:48.231 --> 02:01:49.580
<v Speaker 5>you can only shave so thin,</v>

3798
02:01:49.581 --> 02:01:52.760
<v Speaker 5>you can't cut it into smaller units and it's difficult to transport and all of</v>

3799
02:01:52.761 --> 02:01:53.001
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3800
02:01:53.001 --> 02:01:53.600
<v Speaker 5>Where's Bitcoin?</v>

3801
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:56.300
<v Speaker 5>You can divide it into 100 million sub units.</v>

3802
02:01:56.870 --> 02:02:01.870
<v Speaker 5>So basically instead of the money in your pocket losing value over time because</v>

3803
02:02:02.691 --> 02:02:04.490
<v Speaker 5>the central government is diluting it,</v>

3804
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:08.510
<v Speaker 5>it's getting concentrated because more people want to use it,</v>

3805
02:02:08.511 --> 02:02:09.800
<v Speaker 5>then there's not enough around.</v>

3806
02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:13.820
<v Speaker 5>So it gains value in your pocket and that's a deflationary currency.</v>

3807
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:14.691
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3808
02:02:14.691 --> 02:02:16.940
<v Speaker 5>it creates some interesting savings opportunities.</v>

3809
02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:19.400
<v Speaker 5>Where do you see this going?</v>

3810
02:02:19.610 --> 02:02:19.960
<v Speaker 5>How,</v>

3811
02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:20.600
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>

3812
02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:21.171
<v Speaker 5>where do you,</v>

3813
02:02:21.171 --> 02:02:23.390
<v Speaker 5>what do you see like the future and a hundred years from now,</v>

3814
02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:23.840
<v Speaker 5>what do you,</v>

3815
02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:26.750
<v Speaker 5>what do you think bitcoin's place in the world is going to be?</v>

3816
02:02:27.710 --> 02:02:29.960
<v Speaker 5>I think I can make certain predictions for sure.</v>

3817
02:02:30.170 --> 02:02:34.730
<v Speaker 5>And I can make other predictions with absolute 90% margin,</v>

3818
02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:36.800
<v Speaker 5>which means I'm pulling it out of my ass.</v>

3819
02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:38.930
<v Speaker 5>So let me tell you one I can make for sure.</v>

3820
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:43.670
<v Speaker 5>Cryptocurrencies will be part of our financial future period.</v>

3821
02:02:43.970 --> 02:02:45.650
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't matter what form they take.</v>

3822
02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:47.720
<v Speaker 5>This invention has been invented.</v>

3823
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:49.190
<v Speaker 5>It will change finance,</v>

3824
02:02:49.250 --> 02:02:50.570
<v Speaker 5>it will change banking.</v>

3825
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:51.441
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3826
02:02:51.441 --> 02:02:52.880
<v Speaker 5>and it might not be bitcoin.</v>

3827
02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:53.690
<v Speaker 5>I think it will,</v>

3828
02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:55.160
<v Speaker 5>but it might not be bitcoin,</v>

3829
02:02:55.190 --> 02:02:57.010
<v Speaker 5>but it will still be a cryptocurrency.</v>

3830
02:02:57.070 --> 02:03:01.700
<v Speaker 5>The idea of having a mathematical currency based on a distributed peer to peer</v>

3831
02:03:01.701 --> 02:03:03.590
<v Speaker 5>network happened.</v>

3832
02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:05.270
<v Speaker 5>The invention happens.</v>

3833
02:03:05.271 --> 02:03:08.090
<v Speaker 5>You can't stop people from coming up with variations on it.</v>

3834
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:11.900
<v Speaker 5>You can't easily shut it down if you shot down 100,</v>

3835
02:03:11.901 --> 02:03:13.520
<v Speaker 5>others are going to pop up in its place.</v>

3836
02:03:13.970 --> 02:03:14.840
<v Speaker 5>Now at the same time,</v>

3837
02:03:14.841 --> 02:03:19.040
<v Speaker 5>I think bitcoin has a very good chance of being the one that was good enough.</v>

3838
02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:24.100
<v Speaker 5>The grew fast enough and gained enough traction that it will actually have,</v>

3839
02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:25.430
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3840
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:27.920
<v Speaker 5>as a store of value value for a very long time.</v>

3841
02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:28.551
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

3842
02:03:28.551 --> 02:03:31.760
<v Speaker 5>didn't someone sell a house and Canada through Bitcoin?</v>

3843
02:03:32.030 --> 02:03:35.810
<v Speaker 5>We've seen transactions as big as $150 million by the way.</v>

3844
02:03:35.811 --> 02:03:37.040
<v Speaker 5>Guess what the fee was?</v>

3845
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:37.880
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

3846
02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:39.380
<v Speaker 5>Zero whoa.</v>

3847
02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:44.360
<v Speaker 5>Hundred and 50 million transferred in seconds for zero fee.</v>

3848
02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:44.930
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

3849
02:03:44.930 --> 02:03:45.401
<v Speaker 5>Who?</v>

3850
02:03:45.401 --> 02:03:47.630
<v Speaker 5>Who got $150 million in Bitcoin?</v>

3851
02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:48.411
<v Speaker 5>Justin Bieber.</v>

3852
02:03:48.411 --> 02:03:48.921
<v Speaker 5>That crazy.</v>

3853
02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:51.440
<v Speaker 5>Fuck who's who did that?</v>

3854
02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:52.430
<v Speaker 5>Were they drunk?</v>

3855
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:53.263
<v Speaker 5>We have no idea.</v>

3856
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.661
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3857
02:03:53.661 --> 02:03:54.710
<v Speaker 5>they must have been drunk as well.</v>

3858
02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:54.991
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3859
02:03:54.991 --> 02:03:55.141
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

3860
02:03:55.141 --> 02:03:55.381
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3861
02:03:55.381 --> 02:03:56.214
<v Speaker 7>you see,</v>

3862
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:58.680
<v Speaker 7>look at the text messages.</v>

3863
02:03:58.681 --> 02:04:00.750
<v Speaker 7>You mean when you were drunk and then look at your bitcoin folder.</v>

3864
02:04:00.751 --> 02:04:04.830
<v Speaker 7>I did what you think you would know if somebody spent that much money using</v>

3865
02:04:04.831 --> 02:04:05.700
<v Speaker 7>bitcoin because they would,</v>

3866
02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:06.690
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3867
02:04:06.690 --> 02:04:08.400
<v Speaker 7>as a bitcoin user would probably scream,</v>

3868
02:04:08.401 --> 02:04:10.110
<v Speaker 7>I just spend on one point $5 million.</v>

3869
02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:14.370
<v Speaker 7>That's why it's so weird for me to think that like the the guy that created it,</v>

3870
02:04:14.430 --> 02:04:15.660
<v Speaker 7>no one knows is what he looks like.</v>

3871
02:04:15.690 --> 02:04:16.171
<v Speaker 7>Some guys,</v>

3872
02:04:16.171 --> 02:04:18.810
<v Speaker 7>he spent one point $5 million but no one knows who this guy.</v>

3873
02:04:18.811 --> 02:04:20.390
<v Speaker 7>It just seems so weirdly.</v>

3874
02:04:20.410 --> 02:04:20.941
<v Speaker 7>Here's the thing,</v>

3875
02:04:20.941 --> 02:04:23.340
<v Speaker 7>you don't know what's happening in the banking system today.</v>

3876
02:04:23.341 --> 02:04:25.590
<v Speaker 7>People are sending billions of dollars around,</v>

3877
02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:26.940
<v Speaker 7>but for bitcoin users,</v>

3878
02:04:26.970 --> 02:04:27.300
<v Speaker 7>they're all,</v>

3879
02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:29.460
<v Speaker 7>it's almost like buying a cell phone in your advertising.</v>

3880
02:04:29.461 --> 02:04:31.140
<v Speaker 7>Like this is the best cell phone ever.</v>

3881
02:04:31.150 --> 02:04:31.921
<v Speaker 7>I love it.</v>

3882
02:04:31.921 --> 02:04:35.310
<v Speaker 7>You know that your cell phone sucks cause they are almost the most vocal about</v>

3883
02:04:35.311 --> 02:04:38.560
<v Speaker 7>using bit coin that you would think somebody going to spend 1.5 would,</v>

3884
02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:40.830
<v Speaker 7>would immediately go to online.</v>

3885
02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.050
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>

3886
02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:42.430
<v Speaker 5>Hold on,</v>

3887
02:04:42.430 --> 02:04:44.920
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell the world I have all this money.</v>

3888
02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:47.470
<v Speaker 5>That's a dangerous thing to say.</v>

3889
02:04:47.530 --> 02:04:48.130
<v Speaker 5>Why would you,</v>

3890
02:04:48.130 --> 02:04:50.710
<v Speaker 5>why would you think that that's what they would do and if they didn't do that</v>

3891
02:04:50.711 --> 02:04:51.400
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't,</v>

3892
02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:52.233
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't be real.</v>

3893
02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:53.360
<v Speaker 7>No I didn't say it's not real.</v>

3894
02:04:53.361 --> 02:04:57.050
<v Speaker 7>It just says it seems so suspicious that you know that there's so many.</v>

3895
02:04:57.650 --> 02:04:59.300
<v Speaker 7>See that my biggest problem cause I've been,</v>

3896
02:04:59.330 --> 02:05:01.610
<v Speaker 7>people have been trying to get me to a bitcoin for the longest time is things</v>

3897
02:05:01.611 --> 02:05:02.630
<v Speaker 7>like this where it's,</v>

3898
02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:05.350
<v Speaker 7>it just seems there's so much mystery to it like that.</v>

3899
02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:07.640
<v Speaker 7>Especially if you follow the conspiracies of the,</v>

3900
02:05:07.641 --> 02:05:08.780
<v Speaker 7>the guy that created it.</v>

3901
02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:09.480
<v Speaker 7>And if,</v>

3902
02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:12.070
<v Speaker 7>and you know you hear reports like somebody just spent,</v>

3903
02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:15.010
<v Speaker 7>well you know all these millions of dollars using bit coin.</v>

3904
02:05:15.150 --> 02:05:15.421
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3905
02:05:15.421 --> 02:05:15.961
<v Speaker 5>I already said,</v>

3906
02:05:15.961 --> 02:05:18.220
<v Speaker 5>he said someone bought one point $5 million,</v>

3907
02:05:19.730 --> 02:05:23.070
<v Speaker 5>transferred to $5 million transaction.</v>

3908
02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:27.120
<v Speaker 5>There was a transaction from one address to another address,</v>

3909
02:05:27.121 --> 02:05:32.121
<v Speaker 5>$450 million in a single transaction who can keep in mind minute 150 million.</v>

3910
02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.113
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3911
02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:35.040
<v Speaker 5>And these happen every second.</v>

3912
02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:36.480
<v Speaker 5>Not Not that big,</v>

3913
02:05:36.481 --> 02:05:38.160
<v Speaker 5>but transactions happen all the time.</v>

3914
02:05:38.161 --> 02:05:38.881
<v Speaker 5>And so as you,</v>

3915
02:05:38.881 --> 02:05:40.680
<v Speaker 5>if you were watching the stream and transaction,</v>

3916
02:05:40.681 --> 02:05:40.981
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3917
02:05:40.981 --> 02:05:41.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3918
02:05:41.490 --> 02:05:45.930
<v Speaker 5>$10 a thousand dollars $500 $10,000 150 million.</v>

3919
02:05:46.610 --> 02:05:47.101
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

3920
02:05:47.101 --> 02:05:47.934
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3921
02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:48.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3922
02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:51.210
<v Speaker 5>and you can see that transaction because it's on the public ledger.</v>

3923
02:05:51.211 --> 02:05:54.600
<v Speaker 5>And it did happen and it has been firefight and the transaction went through and</v>

3924
02:05:54.601 --> 02:05:55.560
<v Speaker 5>they paid zero fee.</v>

3925
02:05:55.770 --> 02:05:59.580
<v Speaker 5>So this hundred and $50 million transaction was between two people.</v>

3926
02:05:59.850 --> 02:06:01.060
<v Speaker 5>It was between two addresses.</v>

3927
02:06:01.061 --> 02:06:04.050
<v Speaker 5>So it might've been person moving in from one of their own accounts to one of</v>

3928
02:06:04.051 --> 02:06:05.040
<v Speaker 5>their own accounts or,</v>

3929
02:06:05.070 --> 02:06:06.150
<v Speaker 5>or given it someone else.</v>

3930
02:06:06.210 --> 02:06:09.560
<v Speaker 5>But it's still 150 million American dollars worth of.</v>

3931
02:06:09.561 --> 02:06:14.561
<v Speaker 5>It was about (406) 140-5000 bitcoin and bitcoin is worth $800 each.</v>

3932
02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:16.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3933
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.210
<v Speaker 5>So at the time it was almost a thousand.</v>

3934
02:06:18.211 --> 02:06:19.044
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

3935
02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:20.400
<v Speaker 5>it's about 150 million.</v>

3936
02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:21.893
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3937
02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:24.360
<v Speaker 5>Which in the big scheme of things,</v>

3938
02:06:24.361 --> 02:06:24.811
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

3939
02:06:24.811 --> 02:06:26.970
<v Speaker 5>in the global monetary system is peanuts,</v>

3940
02:06:27.090 --> 02:06:29.490
<v Speaker 5>but it's not user though.</v>

3941
02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:31.620
<v Speaker 5>If it's either an individual you or if it's an a,</v>

3942
02:06:31.621 --> 02:06:33.000
<v Speaker 5>is it a corporation?</v>

3943
02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:35.070
<v Speaker 5>The corporation might be the government.</v>

3944
02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:35.280
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

3945
02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:36.930
<v Speaker 7>When we seize the Silk Road,</v>

3946
02:06:36.931 --> 02:06:37.450
<v Speaker 7>the government,</v>

3947
02:06:37.450 --> 02:06:38.230
<v Speaker 7>meaning we,</v>

3948
02:06:38.230 --> 02:06:38.561
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3949
02:06:38.561 --> 02:06:39.394
<v Speaker 7>Hu</v>

3950
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:40.243
<v Speaker 5>government,</v>

3951
02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:42.170
<v Speaker 5>the government keeps,</v>

3952
02:06:42.410 --> 02:06:44.310
<v Speaker 5>keep kept that right there.</v>

3953
02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.021
<v Speaker 5>They're actually,</v>

3954
02:06:45.021 --> 02:06:45.800
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3955
02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:48.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they want to keep it for too long and I'm not sure they,</v>

3956
02:06:48.951 --> 02:06:50.930
<v Speaker 5>they are allowed by law to keep it for too long.</v>

3957
02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:53.810
<v Speaker 5>So what they've announced they're going to do is they're going to sell it.</v>

3958
02:06:54.110 --> 02:06:55.400
<v Speaker 5>They're going to sell Silk Road.</v>

3959
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:56.040
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3960
02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:57.200
<v Speaker 5>they're going to sell the bitcoins.</v>

3961
02:06:57.201 --> 02:06:58.034
<v Speaker 5>They seized</v>

3962
02:06:59.810 --> 02:07:00.980
<v Speaker 5>and they're going to sell them on the,</v>

3963
02:07:00.981 --> 02:07:03.020
<v Speaker 5>on some kind of market or auction,</v>

3964
02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:03.471
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

3965
02:07:03.471 --> 02:07:07.210
<v Speaker 5>which is great because it's going to create some discount treating.</v>

3966
02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:11.990
<v Speaker 5>That's funny because bitcoin was a key player in that whole silk road scandal.</v>

3967
02:07:11.991 --> 02:07:13.850
<v Speaker 5>And for folks who don't know what Silk Road was,</v>

3968
02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:18.590
<v Speaker 5>it was a website that allowed you to buy a lot of illegal things online and some</v>

3969
02:07:18.591 --> 02:07:21.740
<v Speaker 5>of it was purchased through bitcoin and those things were,</v>

3970
02:07:21.741 --> 02:07:25.820
<v Speaker 5>is illegal as drugs or as guns or there was a lot of different things,</v>

3971
02:07:25.821 --> 02:07:26.550
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3972
02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:27.240
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3973
02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:28.640
<v Speaker 7>Well it's the,</v>

3974
02:07:28.650 --> 02:07:31.920
<v Speaker 7>it's was mostly drugs and the just today,</v>

3975
02:07:31.921 --> 02:07:34.170
<v Speaker 7>53 minutes ago or whatever,</v>

3976
02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 7>I don't know the guy</v>

3977
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:36.873
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3978
02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:39.030
<v Speaker 5>those two people got arrested for that from the,</v>

3979
02:07:39.031 --> 02:07:39.390
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3980
02:07:39.390 --> 02:07:40.920
<v Speaker 5>they had a company that was a,</v>

3981
02:07:40.930 --> 02:07:43.690
<v Speaker 5>a laundering money using bitcoins,</v>

3982
02:07:43.770 --> 02:07:44.351
<v Speaker 5>allegedly,</v>

3983
02:07:44.351 --> 02:07:45.184
<v Speaker 5>allegedly.</v>

3984
02:07:46.230 --> 02:07:50.410
<v Speaker 5>Definitely someone who sold bitcoin to users who bought drugs.</v>

3985
02:07:50.650 --> 02:07:51.483
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

3986
02:07:51.590 --> 02:07:52.031
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

3987
02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:53.080
<v Speaker 5>Money Laundering for drug.</v>

3988
02:07:53.081 --> 02:07:53.591
<v Speaker 5>Let's be clear,</v>

3989
02:07:53.591 --> 02:07:54.341
<v Speaker 5>the allocation,</v>

3990
02:07:54.341 --> 02:07:55.600
<v Speaker 5>I read the indictment and on the plane,</v>

3991
02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:56.291
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not a lawyer,</v>

3992
02:07:56.291 --> 02:07:56.770
<v Speaker 5>but what it,</v>

3993
02:07:56.770 --> 02:07:59.260
<v Speaker 5>what it said is that allegedly,</v>

3994
02:07:59.650 --> 02:08:00.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3995
02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:05.040
<v Speaker 5>these people sold bitcoin to someone who then resold it on the Silk Road to</v>

3996
02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:06.790
<v Speaker 5>other users,</v>

3997
02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:09.580
<v Speaker 5>some of whom he used it to buy drugs.</v>

3998
02:08:09.610 --> 02:08:11.320
<v Speaker 5>So how could somebody be responsible for,</v>

3999
02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:11.740
<v Speaker 5>that's up.</v>

4000
02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:12.550
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>

4001
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:14.680
<v Speaker 5>that's a three hop allegation.</v>

4002
02:08:14.681 --> 02:08:15.760
<v Speaker 5>And in my mind,</v>

4003
02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:17.530
<v Speaker 5>if that's the standard,</v>

4004
02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:20.440
<v Speaker 5>then at least half of Wall Street should be in cuffs.</v>

4005
02:08:20.650 --> 02:08:23.890
<v Speaker 5>Right now the thing it's allegedly,</v>

4006
02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:25.240
<v Speaker 5>so let's keep that in there.</v>

4007
02:08:25.241 --> 02:08:25.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4008
02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:26.051
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4009
02:08:26.051 --> 02:08:27.970
<v Speaker 5>many we've used many allegedly is,</v>

4010
02:08:27.971 --> 02:08:28.720
<v Speaker 5>it's very important.</v>

4011
02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:29.140
<v Speaker 5>Well this is a,</v>

4012
02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:30.810
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of exaggerated,</v>

4013
02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:35.470
<v Speaker 5>exaggerated claims and statements in prosecution indictments.</v>

4014
02:08:35.471 --> 02:08:39.010
<v Speaker 5>When you're a career prosecutor and you write up the indictments and decide to</v>

4015
02:08:39.011 --> 02:08:40.210
<v Speaker 5>take it to the grand jury,</v>

4016
02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:42.490
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to just write the littlest thing you do.</v>

4017
02:08:42.670 --> 02:08:44.290
<v Speaker 5>You're going to make it look like,</v>

4018
02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:44.621
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

4019
02:08:44.621 --> 02:08:44.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4020
02:08:44.981 --> 02:08:49.570
<v Speaker 5>every person who arrest is the worst person in the world and has massive crimes</v>

4021
02:08:49.571 --> 02:08:50.404
<v Speaker 5>going on,</v>

4022
02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:55.210
<v Speaker 5>which means that reading fats and seeing how much of a weak case it is,</v>

4023
02:08:55.211 --> 02:08:56.044
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4024
02:08:56.110 --> 02:09:00.940
<v Speaker 5>allegedly sold to someone who allegedly sold to users who allegedly both drugs.</v>

4025
02:09:01.630 --> 02:09:02.463
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4026
02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:03.130
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>

4027
02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:04.630
<v Speaker 5>it seems insane.</v>

4028
02:09:04.631 --> 02:09:06.190
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like your employee,</v>

4029
02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:07.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4030
02:09:07.090 --> 02:09:12.090
<v Speaker 5>buys drugs with money that you paid him so you are in trouble for him buying</v>

4031
02:09:12.281 --> 02:09:13.090
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>

4032
02:09:13.090 --> 02:09:13.781
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a lawyer.</v>

4033
02:09:13.781 --> 02:09:17.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to figure out what sort of connection,</v>

4034
02:09:17.321 --> 02:09:19.540
<v Speaker 5>the same direct sort of connection and let's see them try and prove it.</v>

4035
02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:20.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the best,</v>

4036
02:09:20.711 --> 02:09:21.580
<v Speaker 5>the justice system.</v>

4037
02:09:21.581 --> 02:09:22.181
<v Speaker 5>You have to,</v>

4038
02:09:22.181 --> 02:09:23.014
<v Speaker 5>you have to prove it.</v>

4039
02:09:23.110 --> 02:09:23.321
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4040
02:09:23.321 --> 02:09:26.230
<v Speaker 5>But it's so scary that someone's freedom is on the line for something as</v>

4041
02:09:26.231 --> 02:09:27.280
<v Speaker 5>ambiguous as that.</v>

4042
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:30.550
<v Speaker 5>Especially when you're dealing with someone's selling bitcoin to someone who</v>

4043
02:09:30.551 --> 02:09:34.600
<v Speaker 5>used then use that bitcoin to buy drugs once it's out of your hands.</v>

4044
02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:38.230
<v Speaker 5>Scary as he got a 24 year olds sitting in jail for this.</v>

4045
02:09:38.231 --> 02:09:43.210
<v Speaker 5>And you've got the 55 year old CEO of HSBC who didn't even resign after being</v>

4046
02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:47.320
<v Speaker 5>fined hundreds of millions of dollars for laundering billions.</v>

4047
02:09:47.650 --> 02:09:48.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4048
02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:49.210
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>

4049
02:09:49.450 --> 02:09:54.430
<v Speaker 5>Government don't make us use the internet to run everything that's gonna happen,</v>

4050
02:09:54.431 --> 02:09:55.264
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4051
02:09:56.410 --> 02:09:56.741
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4052
02:09:56.741 --> 02:09:59.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is actually probably owned by the government and there you're going</v>

4053
02:09:59.501 --> 02:10:01.780
<v Speaker 5>to use it and voting in the future and like you said,</v>

4054
02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:02.683
<v Speaker 5>it's probably going to be,</v>

4055
02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:05.020
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter if it's owned by the government.</v>

4056
02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:05.260
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

4057
02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:05.980
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

4058
02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:06.611
<v Speaker 5>the government,</v>

4059
02:10:06.611 --> 02:10:07.880
<v Speaker 5>the government invented the,</v>

4060
02:10:07.881 --> 02:10:11.710
<v Speaker 5>the basic protocols behind the internets and then engineers and geeks took it</v>

4061
02:10:11.711 --> 02:10:13.210
<v Speaker 5>and turned it into a global network.</v>

4062
02:10:13.630 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 5>And even if the governments had invented the math behind bitcoin,</v>

4063
02:10:16.690 --> 02:10:17.770
<v Speaker 5>we know how it works.</v>

4064
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:22.030
<v Speaker 5>It's math and we're using it to do things that the government doesn't</v>

4065
02:10:22.031 --> 02:10:23.140
<v Speaker 5>necessarily control that well.</v>

4066
02:10:23.141 --> 02:10:24.130
<v Speaker 5>So if they did invent it,</v>

4067
02:10:24.131 --> 02:10:25.270
<v Speaker 5>that was a bad idea.</v>

4068
02:10:25.740 --> 02:10:26.710
<v Speaker 5>Often some people,</v>

4069
02:10:26.711 --> 02:10:27.940
<v Speaker 5>someone says it was the internet,</v>

4070
02:10:29.290 --> 02:10:31.180
<v Speaker 5>the underlying technology,</v>

4071
02:10:31.420 --> 02:10:33.040
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing mysterious about it.</v>

4072
02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 5>Can read the source code.</v>

4073
02:10:34.101 --> 02:10:35.210
<v Speaker 5>You can see how it works,</v>

4074
02:10:35.211 --> 02:10:39.050
<v Speaker 5>you can understand how it works and you're not trusting anyone specific.</v>

4075
02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:42.830
<v Speaker 5>You're just trusting that you understand how it works and it's math.</v>

4076
02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:43.161
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4077
02:10:43.161 --> 02:10:47.120
<v Speaker 5>that's the beauty of it and that's why it people are adopting it so easily is</v>

4078
02:10:47.121 --> 02:10:49.010
<v Speaker 5>because there's no one behind the curtain.</v>

4079
02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4080
02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:50.570
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4081
02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:51.071
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

4082
02:10:51.071 --> 02:10:51.820
<v Speaker 1>it's sexy.</v>

4083
02:10:51.820 --> 02:10:52.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4084
02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:53.560
<v Speaker 1>it's the new kid on the block.</v>

4085
02:10:53.561 --> 02:10:54.850
<v Speaker 1>It's the new exciting thing.</v>

4086
02:10:54.851 --> 02:10:55.271
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

4087
02:10:55.271 --> 02:10:55.511
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4088
02:10:55.511 --> 02:10:55.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4089
02:10:55.930 --> 02:10:56.591
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

4090
02:10:56.591 --> 02:10:57.940
<v Speaker 1>the Internet of money.</v>

4091
02:10:57.970 --> 02:10:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4092
02:10:58.330 --> 02:11:00.520
<v Speaker 1>And people want to be the first adopters.</v>

4093
02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:01.600
<v Speaker 1>They want to get on it first.</v>

4094
02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4095
02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:04.180
<v Speaker 5>That flux happening in this economy.</v>

4096
02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:04.871
<v Speaker 5>I mean really,</v>

4097
02:11:04.871 --> 02:11:05.561
<v Speaker 5>let's think about it.</v>

4098
02:11:05.561 --> 02:11:09.190
<v Speaker 5>What else is happening in this economy now other than the military under,</v>

4099
02:11:09.310 --> 02:11:13.480
<v Speaker 5>other than I'm more derivatives piled on the Huppah more derivatives by the</v>

4100
02:11:13.481 --> 02:11:13.870
<v Speaker 5>banks.</v>

4101
02:11:13.870 --> 02:11:16.020
<v Speaker 5>Pretty much everything else is at a standstill.</v>

4102
02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:16.893
<v Speaker 5>Set Marijuana.</v>

4103
02:11:18.110 --> 02:11:19.110
<v Speaker 1>The money from marijuana.</v>

4104
02:11:19.290 --> 02:11:19.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4105
02:11:19.531 --> 02:11:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the one thing in this economy that's exploded in the places where</v>

4106
02:11:22.951 --> 02:11:24.200
<v Speaker 1>it's been introduced and allowed to,</v>

4107
02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:25.393
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>

4108
02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:26.610
<v Speaker 1>operate in the free market.</v>

4109
02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>And ironically,</v>

4110
02:11:28.291 --> 02:11:28.591
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

4111
02:11:28.591 --> 02:11:28.810
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4112
02:11:28.810 --> 02:11:28.991
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4113
02:11:28.991 --> 02:11:32.130
<v Speaker 1>the situation there was that they weren't letting those people who are selling</v>

4114
02:11:32.131 --> 02:11:33.960
<v Speaker 1>the marijuana put their money in banks.</v>

4115
02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:38.220
<v Speaker 1>The government has since amended that and said that they're going to now start</v>

4116
02:11:38.221 --> 02:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>allowing these people who run these medical marijuana stores to,</v>

4117
02:11:42.601 --> 02:11:42.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4118
02:11:42.810 --> 02:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>put their money in banks,</v>

4119
02:11:43.831 --> 02:11:45.060
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge victory.</v>

4120
02:11:45.390 --> 02:11:45.991
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

4121
02:11:45.991 --> 02:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4122
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:49.320
<v Speaker 1>ultimately it's unconscionable.</v>

4123
02:11:49.321 --> 02:11:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Do anything else because you're,</v>

4124
02:11:50.581 --> 02:11:51.780
<v Speaker 1>you're allowing a,</v>

4125
02:11:51.781 --> 02:11:53.730
<v Speaker 1>an environment where crime,</v>

4126
02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:57.900
<v Speaker 1>violent crime is most likely going to take place because you are making people</v>

4127
02:11:57.901 --> 02:11:58.441
<v Speaker 1>targets.</v>

4128
02:11:58.441 --> 02:11:59.940
<v Speaker 1>If you're not allowing them to bank,</v>

4129
02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:00.430
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4130
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:04.290
<v Speaker 1>you're making sure they have massive amounts of cash on them on a regular basis</v>

4131
02:12:04.291 --> 02:12:05.250
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to get targeted.</v>

4132
02:12:05.530 --> 02:12:06.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of time.</v>

4133
02:12:06.571 --> 02:12:06.751
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

4134
02:12:06.751 --> 02:12:07.620
<v Speaker 1>you're creating,</v>

4135
02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:10.320
<v Speaker 1>you're going to create victims of a violent crime.</v>

4136
02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:13.290
<v Speaker 1>So I'm glad they decided to not do that.</v>

4137
02:12:13.291 --> 02:12:16.470
<v Speaker 1>But that's a perfect example of the kind of fuckery that's involved in our</v>

4138
02:12:16.471 --> 02:12:21.471
<v Speaker 1>government that you could have these people that did pass a law allowing</v>

4139
02:12:21.631 --> 02:12:23.040
<v Speaker 1>something to be legal.</v>

4140
02:12:23.041 --> 02:12:28.041
<v Speaker 1>And yet still those people are kept from in prohibited from putting that money</v>

4141
02:12:28.501 --> 02:12:29.334
<v Speaker 1>in banks.</v>

4142
02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:30.871
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>

4143
02:12:30.871 --> 02:12:31.704
<v Speaker 1>It's madness.</v>

4144
02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:32.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4145
02:12:32.730 --> 02:12:37.140
<v Speaker 5>the broader scheme of this is understanding that there's ways to deal this</v>

4146
02:12:37.141 --> 02:12:37.950
<v Speaker 5>through law,</v>

4147
02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:41.070
<v Speaker 5>including the People's propositions in these states.</v>

4148
02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:43.800
<v Speaker 5>And then there's a lot of these extra legal,</v>

4149
02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:44.700
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4150
02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:45.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4151
02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:50.300
<v Speaker 5>shenanigans that happen where suddenly someone gets audited for a dozen years in</v>

4152
02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:51.570
<v Speaker 5>a row,</v>

4153
02:12:51.570 --> 02:12:51.811
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4154
02:12:51.811 --> 02:12:52.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4155
02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:52.840
<v Speaker 5>And Yeah,</v>

4156
02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:57.330
<v Speaker 5>J J Edgar Hoover had people audited every year of their life,</v>

4157
02:12:57.630 --> 02:12:58.050
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4158
02:12:58.050 --> 02:12:59.310
<v Speaker 5>because he didn't like them.</v>

4159
02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:00.990
<v Speaker 5>And some of those practices,</v>

4160
02:13:00.991 --> 02:13:02.580
<v Speaker 5>Keno continue to this day.</v>

4161
02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:06.740
<v Speaker 5>Now I prove least like to see the rules followed.</v>

4162
02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:08.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the whole point of this country is,</v>

4163
02:13:08.321 --> 02:13:10.800
<v Speaker 5>and it's a rule of law equally apply to all.</v>

4164
02:13:10.801 --> 02:13:12.540
<v Speaker 5>At least if we know what the rules are,</v>

4165
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:15.690
<v Speaker 5>you can follow them or choose not to and then face the consequences.</v>

4166
02:13:15.691 --> 02:13:18.330
<v Speaker 5>But if you don't even know what the rules are because people may come up as they</v>

4167
02:13:18.331 --> 02:13:18.810
<v Speaker 5>go along,</v>

4168
02:13:18.810 --> 02:13:19.980
<v Speaker 5>that's not a good place to live.</v>

4169
02:13:20.050 --> 02:13:20.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4170
02:13:20.471 --> 02:13:21.790
<v Speaker 1>If a a business,</v>

4171
02:13:21.791 --> 02:13:26.020
<v Speaker 1>a private business acted the way the IRS did as far as like handing out audits</v>

4172
02:13:26.021 --> 02:13:27.910
<v Speaker 1>to people that were political opponents,</v>

4173
02:13:28.090 --> 02:13:30.100
<v Speaker 1>handing out audits to people that were personal,</v>

4174
02:13:30.101 --> 02:13:31.680
<v Speaker 1>opponents of people that in power,</v>

4175
02:13:31.950 --> 02:13:34.230
<v Speaker 1>if a private company acted out that way,</v>

4176
02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:36.810
<v Speaker 1>they would be guilty of all sorts of fucking violations.</v>

4177
02:13:36.811 --> 02:13:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It probably be somebody in jail.</v>

4178
02:13:38.250 --> 02:13:40.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would be a really big issue if you found out,</v>

4179
02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:44.310
<v Speaker 1>but they've been auditing people just to fuck with him for the longest time.</v>

4180
02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:44.490
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4181
02:13:44.490 --> 02:13:46.350
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty gross and scary thing.</v>

4182
02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:46.671
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4183
02:13:46.671 --> 02:13:50.570
<v Speaker 5>the good news is there now to auditing bitcoiners and so far we have a nice</v>

4184
02:13:50.571 --> 02:13:51.404
<v Speaker 5>relationship,</v>

4185
02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:52.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4186
02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:55.460
<v Speaker 5>with the IRS and they're looking for ways to help us pay our taxes.</v>

4187
02:13:55.461 --> 02:13:56.630
<v Speaker 5>And I'm looking forward to that time.</v>

4188
02:13:56.660 --> 02:13:58.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking forward to filing my taxes,</v>

4189
02:13:58.890 --> 02:13:59.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4190
02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:00.260
<v Speaker 5>and paying them this year.</v>

4191
02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:01.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm fascinated.</v>

4192
02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:01.611
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4193
02:14:01.611 --> 02:14:03.980
<v Speaker 5>I pay them every year paying,</v>

4194
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:06.610
<v Speaker 5>paying Texas specifically for the bitcoin earnings I've had this year.</v>

4195
02:14:06.690 --> 02:14:07.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated,</v>

4196
02:14:07.591 --> 02:14:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated to see that this yuck Amo Nakamoto guys.</v>

4197
02:14:11.370 --> 02:14:12.031
<v Speaker 1>How do you say his name?</v>

4198
02:14:12.031 --> 02:14:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Satoshi Nakamoto.</v>

4199
02:14:13.471 --> 02:14:14.630
<v Speaker 1>So Toshi Yakamoto,</v>

4200
02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:15.660
<v Speaker 1>have you met this cat?</v>

4201
02:14:16.150 --> 02:14:18.720
<v Speaker 5>No one's been solution that Comodo I think got real.</v>

4202
02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:19.690
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4203
02:14:19.690 --> 02:14:19.931
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4204
02:14:19.931 --> 02:14:20.531
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

4205
02:14:20.531 --> 02:14:22.160
<v Speaker 5>there was a possibility no one's mad at him.</v>

4206
02:14:22.410 --> 02:14:24.460
<v Speaker 5>There was a possibility that,</v>

4207
02:14:24.490 --> 02:14:24.701
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4208
02:14:24.701 --> 02:14:25.510
<v Speaker 5>here's what we know.</v>

4209
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:28.480
<v Speaker 5>We know what he wrote and based on what he wrote,</v>

4210
02:14:28.510 --> 02:14:32.830
<v Speaker 5>we know his name by changing it to numbers and doing it backwards and googling</v>

4211
02:14:32.831 --> 02:14:33.191
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

4212
02:14:33.191 --> 02:14:33.840
<v Speaker 5>And it was Savannah.</v>

4213
02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:36.490
<v Speaker 5>If you type in his name backwards into Google,</v>

4214
02:14:36.670 --> 02:14:40.960
<v Speaker 5>it leads you to this whole real long a discussion on some board about bitcoins.</v>

4215
02:14:40.961 --> 02:14:42.580
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like stealing them.</v>

4216
02:14:42.581 --> 02:14:43.414
<v Speaker 5>And stuff like that.</v>

4217
02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:44.253
<v Speaker 5>It's a really weird,</v>

4218
02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:45.280
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4219
02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:45.701
<v Speaker 5>I stopped.</v>

4220
02:14:45.701 --> 02:14:46.300
<v Speaker 5>Just continue.</v>

4221
02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:47.133
<v Speaker 5>Sorry about him.</v>

4222
02:14:47.210 --> 02:14:47.391
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4223
02:14:47.391 --> 02:14:47.501
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4224
02:14:47.501 --> 02:14:47.930
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4225
02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:48.280
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

4226
02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:48.680
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4227
02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:48.960
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4228
02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:50.650
<v Speaker 5>the thing about Satoshi Nakamoto is we,</v>

4229
02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:52.090
<v Speaker 5>he's written a scientific paper,</v>

4230
02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:52.540
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4231
02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:53.740
<v Speaker 5>And before that paper,</v>

4232
02:14:53.741 --> 02:14:54.970
<v Speaker 5>and after that paper,</v>

4233
02:14:54.971 --> 02:14:58.600
<v Speaker 5>he participated in the community for two and a half years having conversations</v>

4234
02:14:58.601 --> 02:14:59.530
<v Speaker 5>about how to do this.</v>

4235
02:14:59.531 --> 02:15:01.240
<v Speaker 5>So what we know is he's a scientist.</v>

4236
02:15:01.570 --> 02:15:02.291
<v Speaker 5>He's a scientist,</v>

4237
02:15:02.291 --> 02:15:05.950
<v Speaker 5>heavily involved in cartography and economics and in digital currencies,</v>

4238
02:15:06.070 --> 02:15:08.620
<v Speaker 5>which is a space that's been thriving for 20 years now.</v>

4239
02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:09.820
<v Speaker 5>And he,</v>

4240
02:15:09.970 --> 02:15:10.750
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>

4241
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:13.810
<v Speaker 5>they found a way to solve a specific,</v>

4242
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:14.090
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

4243
02:15:14.090 --> 02:15:14.371
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

4244
02:15:14.371 --> 02:15:14.551
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4245
02:15:14.551 --> 02:15:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4246
02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:14.971
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4247
02:15:14.971 --> 02:15:15.181
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

4248
02:15:15.181 --> 02:15:15.361
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4249
02:15:15.361 --> 02:15:15.600
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

4250
02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:15.841
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

4251
02:15:15.841 --> 02:15:16.171
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

4252
02:15:16.171 --> 02:15:17.004
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4253
02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:19.940
<v Speaker 5>so does she Nakamoto might not be a person.</v>

4254
02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.710
<v Speaker 5>Satoshi Nakamoto might be a woman.</v>

4255
02:15:21.890 --> 02:15:25.580
<v Speaker 5>Satoshi Nakamoto might be a group of two or three people collaborating under a</v>

4256
02:15:25.581 --> 02:15:27.860
<v Speaker 5>pseudonym to create a scientific solution.</v>

4257
02:15:29.060 --> 02:15:29.893
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>

4258
02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:32.150
<v Speaker 5>They invented science.</v>

4259
02:15:32.210 --> 02:15:32.331
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4260
02:15:32.331 --> 02:15:32.721
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

4261
02:15:32.721 --> 02:15:33.441
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter,</v>

4262
02:15:33.441 --> 02:15:34.430
<v Speaker 5>but aren't you fascinating?</v>

4263
02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:34.581
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4264
02:15:34.581 --> 02:15:35.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally fascinated.</v>

4265
02:15:35.610 --> 02:15:38.030
<v Speaker 5>But here's the lesson we've learned.</v>

4266
02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:43.160
<v Speaker 5>Prometheus's stole fire from the Gods and gave it to the people and they tied</v>

4267
02:15:43.161 --> 02:15:46.160
<v Speaker 5>him to a fucking rock and had an eagle eat his liver every day.</v>

4268
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:50.570
<v Speaker 5>So Tosha Nakamoto gave money to the people and he disappeared because he's smart</v>

4269
02:15:50.571 --> 02:15:53.270
<v Speaker 5>enough or she's smart enough not to get tied to a rock.</v>

4270
02:15:53.930 --> 02:15:54.980
<v Speaker 5>That's the bottom line.</v>

4271
02:15:55.010 --> 02:15:59.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't look into it because I think only bad things can come out of,</v>

4272
02:16:00.050 --> 02:16:00.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4273
02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:01.880
<v Speaker 5>outing Nakamoto.</v>

4274
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.863
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're saying.</v>

4275
02:16:02.970 --> 02:16:04.460
<v Speaker 5>They get smeared immediately.</v>

4276
02:16:04.461 --> 02:16:04.821
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4277
02:16:04.821 --> 02:16:07.490
<v Speaker 5>And there's nothing good that will come out of it because at the end of the day,</v>

4278
02:16:07.820 --> 02:16:09.080
<v Speaker 5>since they control nothing,</v>

4279
02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:12.080
<v Speaker 5>and since what they invented is a mathematical solution,</v>

4280
02:16:12.290 --> 02:16:13.123
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter.</v>

4281
02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:15.720
<v Speaker 5>So you believe that potentially</v>

4282
02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:18.700
<v Speaker 1>this group of people or individual person,</v>

4283
02:16:18.730 --> 02:16:19.541
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

4284
02:16:19.541 --> 02:16:20.650
<v Speaker 1>whichever scenario,</v>

4285
02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:22.810
<v Speaker 1>whichever sacks that they,</v>

4286
02:16:22.811 --> 02:16:23.644
<v Speaker 1>they</v>

4287
02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:26.510
<v Speaker 5>thought about it in advance and Oh,</v>

4288
02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:28.400
<v Speaker 5>they said they spent several years working on the,</v>

4289
02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:30.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean there active and not just the,</v>

4290
02:16:30.471 --> 02:16:31.240
<v Speaker 5>the code.</v>

4291
02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:35.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about the repercussions of their actions and they decided to be</v>

4292
02:16:35.231 --> 02:16:37.390
<v Speaker 5>anonymous in their delivery of this.</v>

4293
02:16:37.450 --> 02:16:37.601
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4294
02:16:37.601 --> 02:16:40.810
<v Speaker 5>I think throughout the 90s a lot of the people involved in digital currency</v>

4295
02:16:40.811 --> 02:16:43.750
<v Speaker 5>environment because some of them were working in oppressive,</v>

4296
02:16:43.751 --> 02:16:44.890
<v Speaker 5>highly oppressive environments.</v>

4297
02:16:44.891 --> 02:16:45.724
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

4298
02:16:47.770 --> 02:16:51.850
<v Speaker 5>people may be working from Burma or from China or from who knows where.</v>

4299
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:55.240
<v Speaker 5>And so it's not a good thing to be doing these with your own name attached.</v>

4300
02:16:55.241 --> 02:16:59.980
<v Speaker 5>So they made a lot of people in this space where involved anonymously to protect</v>

4301
02:16:59.981 --> 02:17:00.581
<v Speaker 5>their own safety.</v>

4302
02:17:00.581 --> 02:17:02.170
<v Speaker 5>I was at working in digital currencies,</v>

4303
02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:04.720
<v Speaker 5>basically doing science work in cryptography ends,</v>

4304
02:17:04.721 --> 02:17:06.310
<v Speaker 5>mathematics and distributed systems.</v>

4305
02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:08.230
<v Speaker 5>That's a very sexy part of the story.</v>

4306
02:17:08.231 --> 02:17:10.840
<v Speaker 5>You can't leave that out anymore when you tell the story.</v>

4307
02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:14.380
<v Speaker 5>You got to tell people that nobody knows if Satoshi Nakamoto is even real.</v>

4308
02:17:14.530 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of cool.</v>

4309
02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:16.271
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4310
02:17:16.271 --> 02:17:17.230
<v Speaker 5>it is kind of cool.</v>

4311
02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:17.561
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

4312
02:17:17.561 --> 02:17:17.861
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4313
02:17:17.861 --> 02:17:18.131
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4314
02:17:18.131 --> 02:17:19.630
<v Speaker 5>we do know some things about Satoshi,</v>

4315
02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:20.493
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

4316
02:17:20.710 --> 02:17:22.690
<v Speaker 5>he puts two spaces after every period,</v>

4317
02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:25.630
<v Speaker 5>or she or she or they were,</v>

4318
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:26.500
<v Speaker 5>or is that guy?</v>

4319
02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:27.333
<v Speaker 5>That's the Toshi,</v>

4320
02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:29.673
<v Speaker 5>Toshi.</v>

4321
02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:32.760
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people have tried to gas and there's a lot of uh,</v>

4322
02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:34.660
<v Speaker 5>a lot of digital currency,</v>

4323
02:17:34.770 --> 02:17:35.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4324
02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:36.640
<v Speaker 5>scientists and cartographers,</v>

4325
02:17:36.641 --> 02:17:40.870
<v Speaker 5>well known cryptographers who participated in the creation of many of the</v>

4326
02:17:40.871 --> 02:17:44.020
<v Speaker 5>aspects of bitcoin and people are fingered them and said,</v>

4327
02:17:44.050 --> 02:17:44.291
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4328
02:17:44.291 --> 02:17:45.071
<v Speaker 5>maybe that's the toll.</v>

4329
02:17:45.071 --> 02:17:45.551
<v Speaker 5>She may be,</v>

4330
02:17:45.551 --> 02:17:46.384
<v Speaker 5>that's the Toshi,</v>

4331
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:48.040
<v Speaker 5>maybe they're also Toshi.</v>

4332
02:17:48.250 --> 02:17:51.640
<v Speaker 5>I am Sitoshi so this is sort of almost like a jack the ripper sort of</v>

4333
02:17:51.641 --> 02:17:53.050
<v Speaker 5>investigation only.</v>

4334
02:17:53.051 --> 02:17:54.070
<v Speaker 5>He didn't kill anyone.</v>

4335
02:17:54.071 --> 02:17:55.750
<v Speaker 5>He gave science to the people.</v>

4336
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.950
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4337
02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:57.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean in terms of,</v>

4338
02:17:57.131 --> 02:18:00.860
<v Speaker 5>there's so many different theories of who you ever watched a documentary on it</v>

4339
02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:02.640
<v Speaker 5>solve Jack The ripper is murder,</v>

4340
02:18:02.670 --> 02:18:03.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4341
02:18:03.130 --> 02:18:05.440
<v Speaker 5>they always find out that it's a totally different gods.</v>

4342
02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:06.880
<v Speaker 5>It's like a great story.</v>

4343
02:18:06.881 --> 02:18:07.421
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4344
02:18:07.421 --> 02:18:07.721
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4345
02:18:07.721 --> 02:18:12.721
<v Speaker 5>this person invented a completely new science people or people and,</v>

4346
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.820
<v Speaker 5>and then disappeared for their own safety and yeah,</v>

4347
02:18:15.821 --> 02:18:16.654
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty cool.</v>

4348
02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:17.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4349
02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:21.550
<v Speaker 5>it is fast and it's going to be ripe for conspiracy theories of all kinds to</v>

4350
02:18:21.551 --> 02:18:22.390
<v Speaker 5>jump out of that.</v>

4351
02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:23.530
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

4352
02:18:23.530 --> 02:18:26.080
<v Speaker 5>I tried to focus primarily on the technology because I,</v>

4353
02:18:26.081 --> 02:18:27.190
<v Speaker 5>it stands alone.</v>

4354
02:18:27.430 --> 02:18:28.263
<v Speaker 5>That's the key.</v>

4355
02:18:28.270 --> 02:18:30.010
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't need any of this.</v>

4356
02:18:30.250 --> 02:18:31.150
<v Speaker 5>There is a culture,</v>

4357
02:18:31.151 --> 02:18:31.931
<v Speaker 5>there's a history,</v>

4358
02:18:31.931 --> 02:18:32.621
<v Speaker 5>there's all of that.</v>

4359
02:18:32.621 --> 02:18:33.550
<v Speaker 5>Then it's fascinating,</v>

4360
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.690
<v Speaker 5>but the technology just works and it's simple math and people can read it,</v>

4361
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:39.100
<v Speaker 5>understand how it works,</v>

4362
02:18:39.310 --> 02:18:40.180
<v Speaker 5>and then use it.</v>

4363
02:18:40.330 --> 02:18:42.960
<v Speaker 5>And that's the beauty of it because it doesn't depend on anyone.</v>

4364
02:18:42.970 --> 02:18:44.380
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to trust the Toshi.</v>

4365
02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:47.950
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to trust the bank and you don't have to trust that someone's not</v>

4366
02:18:47.951 --> 02:18:50.770
<v Speaker 5>going to mess it up because you can see how it works.</v>

4367
02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:54.730
<v Speaker 5>That's such a subject as ripe for conspiracy theorists.</v>

4368
02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:55.061
<v Speaker 5>Boy,</v>

4369
02:18:55.061 --> 02:18:56.500
<v Speaker 5>they're going to jump all over that one.</v>

4370
02:18:56.501 --> 02:18:57.334
<v Speaker 5>Then you got a big foot.</v>

4371
02:18:57.370 --> 02:18:59.350
<v Speaker 5>They're going to chem trail the fuck out of that one.</v>

4372
02:18:59.390 --> 02:18:59.530
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

4373
02:18:59.530 --> 02:18:59.711
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4374
02:18:59.711 --> 02:18:59.921
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4375
02:18:59.921 --> 02:19:00.131
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4376
02:19:00.131 --> 02:19:00.611
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

4377
02:19:00.611 --> 02:19:01.600
<v Speaker 5>it's already happening.</v>

4378
02:19:01.770 --> 02:19:02.620
<v Speaker 5>The tower seven,</v>

4379
02:19:02.621 --> 02:19:03.430
<v Speaker 5>this shit out.</v>

4380
02:19:03.430 --> 02:19:05.500
<v Speaker 5>How can we make a connection with bitcoin entire seven?</v>

4381
02:19:05.501 --> 02:19:06.251
<v Speaker 5>There has to be something.</v>

4382
02:19:06.251 --> 02:19:07.084
<v Speaker 5>It's all fun.</v>

4383
02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:08.140
<v Speaker 8>Tower seven.</v>

4384
02:19:09.370 --> 02:19:09.741
<v Speaker 8>Hell,</v>

4385
02:19:09.741 --> 02:19:12.060
<v Speaker 8>the original computer that created Bitcoin,</v>

4386
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:15.700
<v Speaker 8>it wasn't done at 2008 it was done in 2001 the NSA,</v>

4387
02:19:15.701 --> 02:19:16.534
<v Speaker 8>the CIA,</v>

4388
02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:17.560
<v Speaker 8>and the DEA.</v>

4389
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:20.650
<v Speaker 5>I've met that guy,</v>

4390
02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:21.813
<v Speaker 5>Alex Jones.</v>

4391
02:19:21.940 --> 02:19:22.110
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4392
02:19:22.110 --> 02:19:22.990
<v Speaker 5>was that complex?</v>

4393
02:19:22.991 --> 02:19:23.351
<v Speaker 5>Jones?</v>

4394
02:19:23.351 --> 02:19:24.190
<v Speaker 5>I was just guessing.</v>

4395
02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:25.840
<v Speaker 5>I've met several guys like that.</v>

4396
02:19:25.841 --> 02:19:26.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4397
02:19:26.050 --> 02:19:27.010
<v Speaker 5>well there's a lot of those guys.</v>

4398
02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:27.621
<v Speaker 5>Boy,</v>

4399
02:19:27.621 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 5>there's some fucking</v>

4400
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:30.110
<v Speaker 4>ferocious conspiracy theorists out there.</v>

4401
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:31.370
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4402
02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:32.203
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

4403
02:19:32.770 --> 02:19:34.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated by these things.</v>

4404
02:19:34.401 --> 02:19:39.401
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinating by these new avenues that our culture starts going down and</v>

4405
02:19:40.250 --> 02:19:45.250
<v Speaker 4>these incredible avenues and branches of possibility off of these new new paths.</v>

4406
02:19:47.390 --> 02:19:49.130
<v Speaker 4>It's just a really amazing,</v>

4407
02:19:49.131 --> 02:19:51.350
<v Speaker 4>amazing time in so many ways.</v>

4408
02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:56.380
<v Speaker 4>And this highlights just this constant repeating subject that comes up with me</v>

4409
02:19:57.021 --> 02:19:58.940
<v Speaker 4>and my friends is that W it's,</v>

4410
02:19:58.941 --> 02:20:00.860
<v Speaker 4>the Internet has changed everything,</v>

4411
02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:01.280
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

4412
02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:03.740
<v Speaker 4>And we've pretended that it's only been a little bit,</v>

4413
02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:04.221
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4414
02:20:04.221 --> 02:20:05.270
<v Speaker 4>so you get email now.</v>

4415
02:20:05.271 --> 02:20:06.104
<v Speaker 4>What's the big deal?</v>

4416
02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:06.950
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4417
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:08.420
<v Speaker 4>it's monstrous.</v>

4418
02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:08.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4419
02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:09.473
<v Speaker 4>It's changed.</v>

4420
02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:10.670
<v Speaker 4>It's changed my life.</v>

4421
02:20:10.690 --> 02:20:15.690
<v Speaker 4>A 100% change the way I think 100% changed my connection with just random human</v>

4422
02:20:17.451 --> 02:20:17.931
<v Speaker 4>beings.</v>

4423
02:20:17.931 --> 02:20:18.500
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4424
02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:23.500
<v Speaker 4>I interact with thousands of random human beings online on a daily basis.</v>

4425
02:20:23.780 --> 02:20:28.780
<v Speaker 4>And 99.9999% of those interactions are positive.</v>

4426
02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:29.540
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4427
02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:30.230
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

4428
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:32.240
<v Speaker 4>That's the most beautiful aspect about it.</v>

4429
02:20:32.241 --> 02:20:33.074
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

4430
02:20:33.540 --> 02:20:35.350
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin is just an expression of that.</v>

4431
02:20:35.351 --> 02:20:36.610
<v Speaker 5>It's a child of the Internet.</v>

4432
02:20:36.611 --> 02:20:36.791
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4433
02:20:36.791 --> 02:20:37.720
<v Speaker 5>when people say,</v>

4434
02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:38.261
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4435
02:20:38.261 --> 02:20:42.460
<v Speaker 5>the intranet now is so cooperative and restrictive that you can't do anything.</v>

4436
02:20:42.461 --> 02:20:46.870
<v Speaker 5>Well I can tell you you can because bitcoin came right out of that and works on</v>

4437
02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:48.220
<v Speaker 5>that perfectly today.</v>

4438
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:49.383
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

4439
02:20:49.410 --> 02:20:54.040
<v Speaker 5>the bit bitcoin is one more thing that happens because of the Internet and now</v>

4440
02:20:54.041 --> 02:20:55.030
<v Speaker 5>it's turning around.</v>

4441
02:20:55.031 --> 02:20:56.080
<v Speaker 5>And here's the interesting thing.</v>

4442
02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:58.870
<v Speaker 5>It allows you to do very small transactions,</v>

4443
02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:00.790
<v Speaker 5>micro nano transactions.</v>

4444
02:21:00.970 --> 02:21:01.990
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

4445
02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:07.030
<v Speaker 5>if you want to monetize your podcast and you accepted bitcoin and people sent</v>

4446
02:21:07.031 --> 02:21:12.031
<v Speaker 5>you a 10th of a penny or a penny or a dollar and you added up over hundreds of</v>

4447
02:21:12.370 --> 02:21:15.580
<v Speaker 5>thousands of users because it doesn't cost much to send because it's an easy</v>

4448
02:21:15.581 --> 02:21:16.414
<v Speaker 5>transaction.</v>

4449
02:21:16.660 --> 02:21:19.690
<v Speaker 5>People will make transactions smaller and smaller and smaller.</v>

4450
02:21:19.691 --> 02:21:24.691
<v Speaker 5>So suddenly bitcoin can fund all of the independent content providers and all of</v>

4451
02:21:25.031 --> 02:21:28.840
<v Speaker 5>the independent infrastructure providers on the intranet and transformed the</v>

4452
02:21:28.841 --> 02:21:30.820
<v Speaker 5>Internet again from the inside out.</v>

4453
02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:32.613
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4454
02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:36.550
<v Speaker 5>Like imagine all of these media companies that have gotten so horribly disrupted</v>

4455
02:21:36.551 --> 02:21:38.310
<v Speaker 5>because there's basically two media models.</v>

4456
02:21:38.330 --> 02:21:40.000
<v Speaker 5>If you make content on the Internet,</v>

4457
02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:41.950
<v Speaker 5>you either sell advertising.</v>

4458
02:21:41.980 --> 02:21:46.150
<v Speaker 5>So you're stuffing junk into the eyeballs of your customers or your ears.</v>

4459
02:21:46.330 --> 02:21:47.410
<v Speaker 5>And the bigger the company,</v>

4460
02:21:47.411 --> 02:21:49.000
<v Speaker 5>the more junk that comes out of it,</v>

4461
02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:49.930
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4462
02:21:49.930 --> 02:21:53.860
<v Speaker 5>Or you're selling your customer if the product is free,</v>

4463
02:21:53.861 --> 02:21:54.820
<v Speaker 5>your the product,</v>

4464
02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:55.570
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4465
02:21:55.570 --> 02:21:55.870
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4466
02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:58.780
<v Speaker 5>Your personal information is what generates the value.</v>

4467
02:21:58.781 --> 02:22:00.580
<v Speaker 5>So if you're on a social media site that's free,</v>

4468
02:22:00.581 --> 02:22:01.570
<v Speaker 5>you're the product.</v>

4469
02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:04.630
<v Speaker 5>And so they're selling your information in order to make money.</v>

4470
02:22:04.631 --> 02:22:07.330
<v Speaker 5>So it's either advertising or selling your information.</v>

4471
02:22:07.331 --> 02:22:09.010
<v Speaker 5>Well now there's this third way,</v>

4472
02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:14.220
<v Speaker 5>which is you can do transactions small enough to have value when accumulated in</v>

4473
02:22:14.711 --> 02:22:15.670
<v Speaker 5>large numbers.</v>

4474
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:20.680
<v Speaker 5>The you could independently and directly funds content providers and</v>

4475
02:22:20.681 --> 02:22:24.220
<v Speaker 5>infrastructure on the Internet and break the hold of these,</v>

4476
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:25.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4477
02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:25.680
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4478
02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:30.150
<v Speaker 5>systems of concentration that advertising and social media have become privacy,</v>

4479
02:22:30.151 --> 02:22:31.670
<v Speaker 5>selling privacy and,</v>

4480
02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:32.850
<v Speaker 5>and selling advertising,</v>

4481
02:22:32.851 --> 02:22:34.440
<v Speaker 5>which require concentration.</v>

4482
02:22:34.470 --> 02:22:36.140
<v Speaker 5>They require enormous concentration.</v>

4483
02:22:36.450 --> 02:22:40.330
<v Speaker 1>What do you think if we set up a dedicated Joe Rogan experience?</v>

4484
02:22:40.331 --> 02:22:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin server right here where we do not server,</v>

4485
02:22:44.201 --> 02:22:49.060
<v Speaker 1>but computer could have advocated to just crunching just out of respect.</v>

4486
02:22:49.230 --> 02:22:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4487
02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:51.700
<v Speaker 1>I just have one running here in the background all the time.</v>

4488
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4489
02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:52.280
<v Speaker 1>we joke.</v>

4490
02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Can we go to jail for that?</v>

4491
02:22:53.201 --> 02:22:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

4492
02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:53.951
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4493
02:22:53.951 --> 02:22:54.520
<v Speaker 5>of course not.</v>

4494
02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:55.300
<v Speaker 5>In fact yet,</v>

4495
02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:55.601
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4496
02:22:55.601 --> 02:22:56.650
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the show,</v>

4497
02:22:56.651 --> 02:22:56.951
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4498
02:22:56.951 --> 02:22:59.200
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to help set you up with a wallet on your,</v>

4499
02:22:59.201 --> 02:23:01.130
<v Speaker 5>on your smart phone and I'll send you some bitcoin.</v>

4500
02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

4501
02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:02.893
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

4502
02:23:03.770 --> 02:23:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4503
02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:06.490
<v Speaker 1>the other question I wanted to ask you about,</v>

4504
02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:06.621
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

4505
02:23:06.621 --> 02:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>we spoke about earlier was net neutrality.</v>

4506
02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:09.311
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

4507
02:23:09.311 --> 02:23:09.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4508
02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:14.760
<v Speaker 1>that that's a huge issue for anyone who loves the way the Internet works and the</v>

4509
02:23:15.791 --> 02:23:20.350
<v Speaker 1>way the internet does not judge and the Internet is freely available to anyone</v>

4510
02:23:20.351 --> 02:23:23.500
<v Speaker 1>who poe ports into it at virtually whatever,</v>

4511
02:23:23.501 --> 02:23:23.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4512
02:23:23.981 --> 02:23:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you pay for your connection,</v>

4513
02:23:25.121 --> 02:23:25.291
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

4514
02:23:25.291 --> 02:23:25.651
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

4515
02:23:25.651 --> 02:23:26.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4516
02:23:26.110 --> 02:23:27.490
<v Speaker 1>whatever your download speed is.</v>

4517
02:23:27.491 --> 02:23:28.660
<v Speaker 1>But there's no,</v>

4518
02:23:28.690 --> 02:23:33.690
<v Speaker 1>there's no regulation as far as like it being easier for Walmart to get online</v>

4519
02:23:34.331 --> 02:23:39.331
<v Speaker 1>or they have more of a percentage of the pipe or what are we concerned about net</v>

4520
02:23:39.911 --> 02:23:44.911
<v Speaker 1>neutrality being somehow or another compromise by nefarious sources?</v>

4521
02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:45.701
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4522
02:23:45.701 --> 02:23:46.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's your travels.</v>

4523
02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:49.880
<v Speaker 5>He suffered a massive setback in the courts just a couple of weeks ago with a</v>

4524
02:23:49.881 --> 02:23:52.300
<v Speaker 5>decision that allowed to Verizon communications,</v>

4525
02:23:52.301 --> 02:23:54.340
<v Speaker 5>so not be subject to the FCC rule,</v>

4526
02:23:54.640 --> 02:23:56.170
<v Speaker 5>imposing net neutrality,</v>

4527
02:23:56.500 --> 02:24:01.190
<v Speaker 5>and that sent shockwaves through the industry because the average down what?</v>

4528
02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:02.033
<v Speaker 5>What was the,</v>

4529
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:03.450
<v Speaker 5>the Internet lost.</v>

4530
02:24:03.610 --> 02:24:03.801
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

4531
02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:04.590
<v Speaker 5>What was the case?</v>

4532
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:08.080
<v Speaker 5>The case was the FCC made a rule that said that carriers must support net</v>

4533
02:24:08.081 --> 02:24:11.980
<v Speaker 5>neutrality and for ice and suit and had it overturned as unconstitutional or</v>

4534
02:24:11.981 --> 02:24:14.170
<v Speaker 5>outside the mandate to the FCC to be more accurate.</v>

4535
02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:16.090
<v Speaker 5>What did Verizon specifically want?</v>

4536
02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:17.081
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4537
02:24:17.081 --> 02:24:19.420
<v Speaker 5>we don't know that they say they want to make the internet better,</v>

4538
02:24:19.421 --> 02:24:23.050
<v Speaker 5>but they just got the rule that says that they have to treat all traffic equally</v>

4539
02:24:23.051 --> 02:24:23.884
<v Speaker 5>taken out.</v>

4540
02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:28.030
<v Speaker 5>And most people don't realize that the reason the internet allows things like</v>

4541
02:24:28.031 --> 02:24:31.420
<v Speaker 5>Netflix to happen is because they didn't have to ask anyone's permission.</v>

4542
02:24:31.421 --> 02:24:36.421
<v Speaker 5>Now imagine if when Netflix started it had to ask Comcast to run as traffic and</v>

4543
02:24:36.761 --> 02:24:37.810
<v Speaker 5>pay for premium.</v>

4544
02:24:38.110 --> 02:24:38.281
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4545
02:24:38.281 --> 02:24:40.390
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't do that because it's a competitor.</v>

4546
02:24:40.391 --> 02:24:43.870
<v Speaker 5>So of course they'd crowd the out of the market with exorbitant fees.</v>

4547
02:24:44.260 --> 02:24:48.190
<v Speaker 5>Net neutrality means that everybody has a fair shake to be heard and it's up to</v>

4548
02:24:48.191 --> 02:24:50.920
<v Speaker 5>the end user to decide who they want to listen to.</v>

4549
02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:55.420
<v Speaker 5>All of the traffic will reach you if you wanted as the listener or as a viewer.</v>

4550
02:24:55.570 --> 02:24:55.871
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

4551
02:24:55.871 --> 02:24:56.171
<v Speaker 1>Ken,</v>

4552
02:24:56.171 --> 02:25:00.580
<v Speaker 1>they somehow or another limit where the traffic goes to like what we're seeing</v>

4553
02:25:00.581 --> 02:25:02.680
<v Speaker 1>in other countries where they have restrictive internet laws.</v>

4554
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Is that a potential,</v>

4555
02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:06.200
<v Speaker 5>I think for product to this case,</v>

4556
02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:10.280
<v Speaker 5>I think the biggest threat right now it comes to companies like Netflix or</v>

4557
02:25:10.281 --> 02:25:14.420
<v Speaker 5>things like I'm streaming radio and audio systems,</v>

4558
02:25:14.421 --> 02:25:15.650
<v Speaker 5>a Spotify,</v>

4559
02:25:15.651 --> 02:25:16.251
<v Speaker 5>Pandora,</v>

4560
02:25:16.251 --> 02:25:21.251
<v Speaker 5>etc. Whereby a service providers who have their own TV streams or their own</v>

4561
02:25:21.741 --> 02:25:25.900
<v Speaker 5>music streams that are competing are going to make their experience great.</v>

4562
02:25:26.170 --> 02:25:29.680
<v Speaker 5>And Netflix experience somewhat suckier,</v>

4563
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:33.670
<v Speaker 5>so they'll limit the bandwidth of Netflix applications.</v>

4564
02:25:33.970 --> 02:25:34.810
<v Speaker 5>They'll choke them.</v>

4565
02:25:35.290 --> 02:25:35.740
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4566
02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:36.341
<v Speaker 5>Right now.</v>

4567
02:25:36.341 --> 02:25:38.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean they already do in some cases,</v>

4568
02:25:38.141 --> 02:25:39.190
<v Speaker 5>but how they do that?</v>

4569
02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:40.301
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4570
02:25:40.301 --> 02:25:42.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean they all kinds of shenanigans,</v>

4571
02:25:42.431 --> 02:25:43.264
<v Speaker 5>but I mean the bay,</v>

4572
02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:47.800
<v Speaker 5>the basic deal is that this FCC rule was trying to establish a legal framework</v>

4573
02:25:47.801 --> 02:25:47.981
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>

4574
02:25:47.981 --> 02:25:51.790
<v Speaker 5>which they'd be obliged to give equal access to all contents as long as the</v>

4575
02:25:51.791 --> 02:25:52.571
<v Speaker 5>viewer chose,</v>

4576
02:25:52.571 --> 02:25:53.740
<v Speaker 5>that's what they want to see.</v>

4577
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:56.500
<v Speaker 5>Or they wanted to connect to all of the Internet.</v>

4578
02:25:56.770 --> 02:25:59.830
<v Speaker 5>They would connect to that with the same bandwidth that they've bought.</v>

4579
02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:00.581
<v Speaker 5>A,</v>

4580
02:26:00.581 --> 02:26:04.600
<v Speaker 5>you buy bandwidth and you use it for whatever you want and you don't get better</v>

4581
02:26:04.601 --> 02:26:06.130
<v Speaker 5>bandwidth if you use their shows.</v>

4582
02:26:06.131 --> 02:26:06.964
<v Speaker 5>The Netflix,</v>

4583
02:26:07.090 --> 02:26:07.450
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4584
02:26:07.450 --> 02:26:09.400
<v Speaker 5>once they tried to put that rule in place,</v>

4585
02:26:09.610 --> 02:26:10.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4586
02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:10.810
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4587
02:26:10.810 --> 02:26:14.890
<v Speaker 5>the lawsuit started and now we have a very bad decision that could really,</v>

4588
02:26:14.891 --> 02:26:16.510
<v Speaker 5>really hamper innovation.</v>

4589
02:26:16.511 --> 02:26:19.870
<v Speaker 5>A lot of the things that we see today on the Internet would not have happened if</v>

4590
02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:23.560
<v Speaker 5>net neutrality weren't observed and the Verizon,</v>

4591
02:26:23.561 --> 02:26:25.480
<v Speaker 5>for many people who don't realize this,</v>

4592
02:26:25.481 --> 02:26:30.481
<v Speaker 5>Verizon offers home Internet connection as well as four g and,</v>

4593
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:32.350
<v Speaker 5>and TV most importantly,</v>

4594
02:26:32.351 --> 02:26:32.621
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4595
02:26:32.621 --> 02:26:34.690
<v Speaker 5>And pay per view and video on demand,</v>

4596
02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:38.020
<v Speaker 5>which means that they're directly competing against other content providers.</v>

4597
02:26:38.290 --> 02:26:41.420
<v Speaker 5>Verizon now has a fiber optic system that's,</v>

4598
02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:42.573
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4599
02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:47.640
<v Speaker 5>incredibly fast and connects to you direct download movies and television shows.</v>

4600
02:26:50.050 --> 02:26:52.860
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot going on right now as far as um,</v>

4601
02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:53.800
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4602
02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:56.170
<v Speaker 5>as far as internet related content,</v>

4603
02:26:56.171 --> 02:26:58.630
<v Speaker 5>things like Netflix and things like,</v>

4604
02:26:58.631 --> 02:27:03.631
<v Speaker 5>I mean Hulu and Hulu plus and there's these places are now starting to create</v>

4605
02:27:03.731 --> 02:27:05.350
<v Speaker 5>their own programming as well.</v>

4606
02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:05.830
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4607
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:08.920
<v Speaker 5>Getting really fascinating cause they're not just competing with Verizon now.</v>

4608
02:27:08.921 --> 02:27:11.440
<v Speaker 5>They're competing with NBC and CBS and what have you.</v>

4609
02:27:11.860 --> 02:27:16.240
<v Speaker 5>And if you like that net neutrality is why it happens and therefore we should be</v>

4610
02:27:16.241 --> 02:27:17.330
<v Speaker 5>defending that you trial.</v>

4611
02:27:17.331 --> 02:27:22.150
<v Speaker 5>So what people should do is probably boycott companies that don't support net</v>

4612
02:27:22.151 --> 02:27:22.750
<v Speaker 5>neutrality.</v>

4613
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:22.961
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

4614
02:27:22.961 --> 02:27:26.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm a huge supporter of the eff electronic frontier foundation that's been</v>

4615
02:27:26.291 --> 02:27:28.450
<v Speaker 5>fighting for privacy and liberty.</v>

4616
02:27:28.451 --> 02:27:32.470
<v Speaker 5>And then you travel to on the Internet since the early nineties,</v>

4617
02:27:32.530 --> 02:27:35.920
<v Speaker 5>and they've won several substantial cases both against organizations like the</v>

4618
02:27:35.921 --> 02:27:36.610
<v Speaker 5>NSA,</v>

4619
02:27:36.610 --> 02:27:40.420
<v Speaker 5>but also against a service providers that tried to abuse their position to</v>

4620
02:27:40.421 --> 02:27:41.560
<v Speaker 5>prioritize traffic.</v>

4621
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:44.410
<v Speaker 5>And they've promoted the idea of an open,</v>

4622
02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:45.341
<v Speaker 5>independent,</v>

4623
02:27:45.341 --> 02:27:48.040
<v Speaker 5>transparent and fair Internet for all,</v>

4624
02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:48.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4625
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:49.840
<v Speaker 5>with equal access for everyone.</v>

4626
02:27:49.841 --> 02:27:50.111
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4627
02:27:50.111 --> 02:27:53.050
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing that's made the Internet magic and they've</v>

4628
02:27:53.051 --> 02:27:56.230
<v Speaker 5>been@theforefrontofdoingthattoeff.org I'm a huge supporter.</v>

4629
02:27:56.590 --> 02:27:57.490
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

4630
02:27:57.560 --> 02:27:57.951
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4631
02:27:57.951 --> 02:28:02.490
<v Speaker 5>we'll look into that and maybe we'll fucking put an eff sticker on our website</v>

4632
02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:03.250
<v Speaker 5>or something like that.</v>

4633
02:28:03.250 --> 02:28:04.680
<v Speaker 5>And you can put it on your webcam too.</v>

4634
02:28:04.690 --> 02:28:06.850
<v Speaker 5>They're the same ones who sell those little things.</v>

4635
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:07.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4636
02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:08.590
<v Speaker 5>well those guys are on the ball.</v>

4637
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:09.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4638
02:28:09.130 --> 02:28:09.521
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

4639
02:28:09.521 --> 02:28:11.050
<v Speaker 5>that's something to really be concerned with.</v>

4640
02:28:11.051 --> 02:28:14.560
<v Speaker 5>It really is the idea that they could limit your experience,</v>

4641
02:28:14.590 --> 02:28:16.060
<v Speaker 5>whether it's Netflix or whatever.</v>

4642
02:28:16.061 --> 02:28:18.280
<v Speaker 5>Downloadable charter does it to Jamie.</v>

4643
02:28:18.281 --> 02:28:18.401
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4644
02:28:18.401 --> 02:28:20.050
<v Speaker 5>they won't let them go to pirate bay anymore.</v>

4645
02:28:20.051 --> 02:28:21.190
<v Speaker 5>And I've heard that before.</v>

4646
02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 5>Allegedly,</v>

4647
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:22.700
<v Speaker 6>allegedly,</v>

4648
02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:23.533
<v Speaker 6>allegedly,</v>

4649
02:28:23.900 --> 02:28:25.500
<v Speaker 6>allegedly he doesn't go to pirate bay.</v>

4650
02:28:25.580 --> 02:28:25.901
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>

4651
02:28:25.901 --> 02:28:26.150
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4652
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:28.620
<v Speaker 6>I need to download a legal lego league,</v>

4653
02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:29.713
<v Speaker 6>legal music,</v>

4654
02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 6>legal like nine inch nails.</v>

4655
02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:36.470
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in an area where they have a lockdown on,</v>

4656
02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:38.300
<v Speaker 1>on Internet providers,</v>

4657
02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:38.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4658
02:28:38.901 --> 02:28:41.540
<v Speaker 1>where some people like can only get Verizon,</v>

4659
02:28:41.541 --> 02:28:45.050
<v Speaker 1>they're in an area that only gets rise and like 18 t doesn't reach their time</v>

4660
02:28:45.051 --> 02:28:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Warner's and reach there.</v>

4661
02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:49.440
<v Speaker 6>That sucks.</v>

4662
02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:50.150
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

4663
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:51.150
<v Speaker 6>that's so disturbing.</v>

4664
02:28:51.151 --> 02:28:53.110
<v Speaker 6>And it's so contrary to the,</v>

4665
02:28:53.111 --> 02:28:55.950
<v Speaker 6>the trends that we would like to see as far as,</v>

4666
02:28:56.010 --> 02:28:57.420
<v Speaker 6>here's one good idea.</v>

4667
02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:59.070
<v Speaker 6>One could thought that comes out of this.</v>

4668
02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:03.000
<v Speaker 6>A lot of the problem right now is that you pay for both of your infrastructure</v>

4669
02:29:03.001 --> 02:29:04.740
<v Speaker 6>and your content in a single payment.</v>

4670
02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:05.613
<v Speaker 6>Your Isp,</v>

4671
02:29:06.330 --> 02:29:09.930
<v Speaker 6>well with bitcoin you could pay the recipients of the content provider directly</v>

4672
02:29:09.931 --> 02:29:10.471
<v Speaker 6>in tiny,</v>

4673
02:29:10.471 --> 02:29:10.831
<v Speaker 6>tiny,</v>

4674
02:29:10.831 --> 02:29:11.664
<v Speaker 6>tiny payments.</v>

4675
02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:14.160
<v Speaker 6>So you really are the bitcoin genius,</v>

4676
02:29:15.090 --> 02:29:16.110
<v Speaker 6>your bitcoin Jesus.</v>

4677
02:29:16.111 --> 02:29:16.740
<v Speaker 6>Because you,</v>

4678
02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:17.520
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4679
02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:20.970
<v Speaker 6>he is because he's buying bitcoin as a solution for everything.</v>

4680
02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:21.810
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4681
02:29:21.810 --> 02:29:22.051
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4682
02:29:22.051 --> 02:29:25.260
<v Speaker 6>it's powerful stuff fixed that and bitcoin can fix the Internet.</v>

4683
02:29:25.290 --> 02:29:26.730
<v Speaker 6>Bitcoin can fix Verizon.</v>

4684
02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:28.290
<v Speaker 6>It's almost an I'm not,</v>

4685
02:29:28.410 --> 02:29:28.981
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

4686
02:29:28.981 --> 02:29:29.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4687
02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:32.880
<v Speaker 6>it's almost like evangelists stick like it almost like a,</v>

4688
02:29:32.900 --> 02:29:33.570
<v Speaker 6>like pyramids.</v>

4689
02:29:33.570 --> 02:29:36.150
<v Speaker 6>Like when you go to a pyramid type thing where they're sounding like,</v>

4690
02:29:36.151 --> 02:29:37.140
<v Speaker 6>no you're not you.</v>

4691
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:38.550
<v Speaker 6>Is there anything you don't like about it?</v>

4692
02:29:38.551 --> 02:29:40.080
<v Speaker 6>Like what's the number one thing that you're like,</v>

4693
02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:42.570
<v Speaker 6>I hope something changes with this.</v>

4694
02:29:42.571 --> 02:29:43.404
<v Speaker 6>Is there anything,</v>

4695
02:29:43.650 --> 02:29:43.921
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4696
02:29:43.921 --> 02:29:44.251
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

4697
02:29:44.251 --> 02:29:45.190
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's got a,</v>

4698
02:29:45.210 --> 02:29:47.910
<v Speaker 6>it's got some scalability issues that are being solved.</v>

4699
02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:48.700
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

4700
02:29:48.700 --> 02:29:52.200
<v Speaker 6>it's software so we have to be very careful with the upgrades.</v>

4701
02:29:52.470 --> 02:29:53.303
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4702
02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:54.031
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

4703
02:29:54.031 --> 02:29:56.670
<v Speaker 6>I mean compared to the existing form of money we have,</v>

4704
02:29:56.700 --> 02:29:58.530
<v Speaker 6>I honestly think it's better money and it's,</v>

4705
02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:00.180
<v Speaker 6>and it's a great technology.</v>

4706
02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:03.690
<v Speaker 6>I've spent 20 years doing security and distributed systems.</v>

4707
02:30:03.691 --> 02:30:05.910
<v Speaker 6>That's my area of expertise as a professional.</v>

4708
02:30:06.210 --> 02:30:10.680
<v Speaker 6>So what I love about this is that I can see the elegance of the technology and I</v>

4709
02:30:10.681 --> 02:30:12.120
<v Speaker 6>understand its implications.</v>

4710
02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:17.380
<v Speaker 6>The last time I felt like this was 1992 and it was because I saw the internet</v>

4711
02:30:17.431 --> 02:30:21.780
<v Speaker 6>and I saw the elegance of its and I was out telling as many people as I could,</v>

4712
02:30:22.020 --> 02:30:22.231
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4713
02:30:22.231 --> 02:30:25.050
<v Speaker 6>this is really going to change things in ways you don't even expect.</v>

4714
02:30:25.051 --> 02:30:28.560
<v Speaker 6>And I can't even explain to you yet because it's going to unfold in ways no one</v>

4715
02:30:28.561 --> 02:30:29.394
<v Speaker 6>anticipates.</v>

4716
02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:32.490
<v Speaker 6>Because what it does is it democratizes information.</v>

4717
02:30:32.820 --> 02:30:33.391
<v Speaker 6>So yes,</v>

4718
02:30:33.391 --> 02:30:35.910
<v Speaker 6>I'm excited about something that democratizes money,</v>

4719
02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:38.760
<v Speaker 6>but it's because I understand the underlying technology.</v>

4720
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.451
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4721
02:30:39.451 --> 02:30:39.751
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4722
02:30:39.751 --> 02:30:41.850
<v Speaker 6>I don't profit from talking about this.</v>

4723
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.983
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4724
02:30:42.990 --> 02:30:44.880
<v Speaker 6>I'm able to build a career on it.</v>

4725
02:30:44.881 --> 02:30:45.450
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

4726
02:30:45.450 --> 02:30:46.650
<v Speaker 6>And I love doing it,</v>

4727
02:30:46.651 --> 02:30:47.940
<v Speaker 6>but really at the,</v>

4728
02:30:48.090 --> 02:30:48.930
<v Speaker 6>at the heart of it,</v>

4729
02:30:49.290 --> 02:30:50.123
<v Speaker 6>I'm a geek.</v>

4730
02:30:50.190 --> 02:30:53.220
<v Speaker 6>I love the technology and that passion just comes through.</v>

4731
02:30:53.350 --> 02:30:54.131
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious.</v>

4732
02:30:54.131 --> 02:30:55.210
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious that you love it.</v>

4733
02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:56.610
<v Speaker 1>You light up and you,</v>

4734
02:30:56.611 --> 02:30:59.140
<v Speaker 1>you when the word bitcoin comes out of your mouth,</v>

4735
02:30:59.141 --> 02:31:01.120
<v Speaker 1>it comes out just covered in love juice.</v>

4736
02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:02.433
<v Speaker 1>You love it.</v>

4737
02:31:02.680 --> 02:31:04.930
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious and it's interesting and it's,</v>

4738
02:31:04.931 --> 02:31:05.231
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4739
02:31:05.231 --> 02:31:05.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4740
02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:09.820
<v Speaker 1>you're in a very unique position because you're really at the edge of it and</v>

4741
02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:10.170
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4742
02:31:10.170 --> 02:31:15.170
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of at the front of this ever increasing in mass ship and a,</v>

4743
02:31:15.230 --> 02:31:16.540
<v Speaker 1>you're watching a game momentum.</v>

4744
02:31:16.541 --> 02:31:17.530
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be pretty exciting.</v>

4745
02:31:17.920 --> 02:31:18.671
<v Speaker 6>It's exciting.</v>

4746
02:31:18.671 --> 02:31:19.350
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

4747
02:31:19.350 --> 02:31:20.430
<v Speaker 6>it was also terrifying</v>

4748
02:31:20.430 --> 02:31:21.121
<v Speaker 5>for quite a while.</v>

4749
02:31:21.121 --> 02:31:21.331
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4750
02:31:21.331 --> 02:31:24.270
<v Speaker 5>I've been in this full time for almost two years and I can tell you that that</v>

4751
02:31:24.271 --> 02:31:26.610
<v Speaker 5>was a not a very profitable,</v>

4752
02:31:26.660 --> 02:31:29.340
<v Speaker 5>a job for living before that.</v>

4753
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:30.301
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4754
02:31:30.301 --> 02:31:32.280
<v Speaker 5>I've been an independent freelancer.</v>

4755
02:31:32.281 --> 02:31:33.360
<v Speaker 5>I've been starting businesses.</v>

4756
02:31:33.361 --> 02:31:34.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm an entrepreneur,</v>

4757
02:31:34.610 --> 02:31:36.800
<v Speaker 5>so I was an independent freelancer and linking them.</v>

4758
02:31:36.810 --> 02:31:37.081
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

4759
02:31:37.081 --> 02:31:37.621
<v Speaker 5>what is your,</v>

4760
02:31:37.621 --> 02:31:37.890
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

4761
02:31:37.890 --> 02:31:38.431
<v Speaker 5>your background,</v>

4762
02:31:38.431 --> 02:31:39.450
<v Speaker 5>your education and background?</v>

4763
02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:42.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm a computer scientist with a specialization in distributed systems.</v>

4764
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.180
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4765
02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:47.880
<v Speaker 5>I've been working in security for just over 18 years in information security</v>

4766
02:31:47.881 --> 02:31:48.540
<v Speaker 5>systems.</v>

4767
02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:49.950
<v Speaker 5>So I worked as a consultant.</v>

4768
02:31:49.951 --> 02:31:51.120
<v Speaker 5>I worked as an advisor.</v>

4769
02:31:51.121 --> 02:31:53.910
<v Speaker 5>I worked as a chief information officer for companies.</v>

4770
02:31:54.330 --> 02:31:55.980
<v Speaker 5>I built research companies.</v>

4771
02:31:55.981 --> 02:31:56.620
<v Speaker 5>I built,</v>

4772
02:31:56.620 --> 02:31:56.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4773
02:31:56.910 --> 02:31:58.080
<v Speaker 5>companies that built,</v>

4774
02:31:58.200 --> 02:31:58.400
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4775
02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:00.900
<v Speaker 5>Internet systems and I followed the Internet.</v>

4776
02:32:00.930 --> 02:32:02.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm not one of the pioneers of the Internet.</v>

4777
02:32:02.850 --> 02:32:06.240
<v Speaker 5>I was the 16 year old kid looking over their shoulder as they were doing these</v>

4778
02:32:06.241 --> 02:32:06.550
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

4779
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4780
02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:10.770
<v Speaker 5>so I was buried in it when I was young and you know,</v>

4781
02:32:11.220 --> 02:32:12.210
<v Speaker 5>so I've,</v>

4782
02:32:12.330 --> 02:32:12.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4783
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:13.800
<v Speaker 5>I've worked as a,</v>

4784
02:32:13.801 --> 02:32:16.740
<v Speaker 5>as an independent professional in this space for many years.</v>

4785
02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:20.190
<v Speaker 5>And then two years ago I first discovered bitcoin.</v>

4786
02:32:20.610 --> 02:32:22.260
<v Speaker 5>Then it hit me again a second time.</v>

4787
02:32:22.261 --> 02:32:26.490
<v Speaker 5>I read this little sheet of paper and I decided this is the job I'm going to do</v>

4788
02:32:26.730 --> 02:32:28.320
<v Speaker 5>and right now if there is no job,</v>

4789
02:32:28.321 --> 02:32:29.850
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not gonna make any money at it,</v>

4790
02:32:29.851 --> 02:32:32.790
<v Speaker 5>but I'm going to do this job until it actually becomes a job.</v>

4791
02:32:32.791 --> 02:32:35.970
<v Speaker 5>And I did that for two years and I almost went bankrupt because there wasn't a</v>

4792
02:32:35.971 --> 02:32:37.140
<v Speaker 5>job there at the beginning.</v>

4793
02:32:37.770 --> 02:32:40.260
<v Speaker 5>And now it's a job and it's very exciting.</v>

4794
02:32:40.290 --> 02:32:42.140
<v Speaker 5>So this is a conscious decision on your,</v>

4795
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:44.940
<v Speaker 5>your part back when it wasn't even profitable?</v>

4796
02:32:45.210 --> 02:32:45.541
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

4797
02:32:45.541 --> 02:32:46.080
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

4798
02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:48.630
<v Speaker 5>Massive chance and stepped out on the edge of the dock.</v>

4799
02:32:48.750 --> 02:32:49.170
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4800
02:32:49.170 --> 02:32:50.910
<v Speaker 5>I invested in several companies.</v>

4801
02:32:50.911 --> 02:32:52.800
<v Speaker 5>I drained my retirement accounts,</v>

4802
02:32:53.130 --> 02:32:54.360
<v Speaker 5>I drained my savings,</v>

4803
02:32:54.361 --> 02:32:57.000
<v Speaker 5>paying my bills until I could generate income doing this.</v>

4804
02:32:57.540 --> 02:32:58.530
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4805
02:32:58.590 --> 02:32:59.270
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

4806
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.560
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

4807
02:32:59.560 --> 02:33:01.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is not prudent investment.</v>

4808
02:33:02.220 --> 02:33:04.620
<v Speaker 5>This is not prudent behavior financially.</v>

4809
02:33:04.621 --> 02:33:06.300
<v Speaker 5>But as a,</v>

4810
02:33:06.330 --> 02:33:07.620
<v Speaker 5>as a technologist,</v>

4811
02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:10.600
<v Speaker 5>as a person who's worked in distributed systems and,</v>

4812
02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:12.570
<v Speaker 5>and security and computer systems,</v>

4813
02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:16.560
<v Speaker 5>I could see that this was an exciting technology and I want to build a career in</v>

4814
02:33:16.561 --> 02:33:16.681
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

4815
02:33:16.681 --> 02:33:21.330
<v Speaker 5>So what I've been doing is swapping money for skills and experience and the</v>

4816
02:33:21.331 --> 02:33:23.310
<v Speaker 5>opportunity to be on the ground floor.</v>

4817
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:27.690
<v Speaker 5>I was too young when the Internet started to to be influential in that space and</v>

4818
02:33:27.691 --> 02:33:30.330
<v Speaker 5>I see this opportunity as a second opportunity to do that.</v>

4819
02:33:31.290 --> 02:33:31.770
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

4820
02:33:31.770 --> 02:33:34.500
<v Speaker 5>How did you know that Bitcoin was the solution?</v>

4821
02:33:34.530 --> 02:33:39.290
<v Speaker 5>What made you so confident that you invested as exorbitant amount of time in,</v>

4822
02:33:39.291 --> 02:33:39.720
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

4823
02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:44.720
<v Speaker 5>in bitcoin and you know back two years ago that the future could not have looked</v>

4824
02:33:45.421 --> 02:33:46.770
<v Speaker 5>nearly as bright as it looks now?</v>

4825
02:33:46.980 --> 02:33:47.970
<v Speaker 5>So the key,</v>

4826
02:33:47.971 --> 02:33:52.800
<v Speaker 5>the key here was that I was in distributed systems and security and then the</v>

4827
02:33:52.801 --> 02:33:54.900
<v Speaker 5>first time I thought I heard about it,</v>

4828
02:33:54.901 --> 02:33:58.950
<v Speaker 5>I thought nerd money and then the s like everybody does,</v>

4829
02:33:58.951 --> 02:33:59.251
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4830
02:33:59.251 --> 02:34:00.060
<v Speaker 5>That's where Brian is,</v>

4831
02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:01.770
<v Speaker 5>that possible can't possibly work.</v>

4832
02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:06.330
<v Speaker 5>Then I went back and I read this a Toshi paper and I grasped the science and it</v>

4833
02:34:06.331 --> 02:34:09.300
<v Speaker 5>was confusing that I read it again and I really grasped the science and then</v>

4834
02:34:09.301 --> 02:34:10.134
<v Speaker 5>suddenly it hit me.</v>

4835
02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:11.513
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

4836
02:34:11.730 --> 02:34:12.930
<v Speaker 5>this isn't a currency.</v>

4837
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:15.300
<v Speaker 5>It's a consensus network.</v>

4838
02:34:16.290 --> 02:34:18.670
<v Speaker 5>This is the grail of distributed systems.</v>

4839
02:34:18.671 --> 02:34:20.020
<v Speaker 5>Of the last 15 years,</v>

4840
02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:22.390
<v Speaker 5>you can do so much more than currency.</v>

4841
02:34:22.391 --> 02:34:24.340
<v Speaker 5>And once that light bulb went off,</v>

4842
02:34:24.610 --> 02:34:26.710
<v Speaker 5>all I could see was the possibilities.</v>

4843
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:29.860
<v Speaker 5>Oh well now that we have this technology,</v>

4844
02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:35.070
<v Speaker 5>we can do this and this and this and the currency will do these things for us.</v>

4845
02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:36.580
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

4846
02:34:36.581 --> 02:34:38.680
<v Speaker 5>all of these possibilities unfolded in my head.</v>

4847
02:34:38.681 --> 02:34:39.190
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>

4848
02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:41.800
<v Speaker 5>it was a really dizzy experience,</v>

4849
02:34:42.190 --> 02:34:47.190
<v Speaker 5>but I understood the fundamental building blocks looked so much like the early</v>

4850
02:34:47.351 --> 02:34:50.950
<v Speaker 5>Internet and I knew what structures like that do.</v>

4851
02:34:50.951 --> 02:34:52.630
<v Speaker 5>They create a network effect.</v>

4852
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:56.500
<v Speaker 5>They create this attractive force where it gets more useful the more people who</v>

4853
02:34:56.501 --> 02:34:57.334
<v Speaker 5>use it.</v>

4854
02:34:57.340 --> 02:34:57.491
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

4855
02:34:57.491 --> 02:35:01.360
<v Speaker 5>work effect was coined first by Bob mad calf in 1984 he said the value of the</v>

4856
02:35:01.361 --> 02:35:04.870
<v Speaker 5>network increases exponentially with the addition of each node.</v>

4857
02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:07.480
<v Speaker 5>Because when you join a network,</v>

4858
02:35:07.570 --> 02:35:09.730
<v Speaker 5>you don't just getting that value,</v>

4859
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:13.030
<v Speaker 5>but by increasing the size of the network to make it more valuable for everyone</v>

4860
02:35:13.031 --> 02:35:14.800
<v Speaker 5>else because they have one more person to connect to.</v>

4861
02:35:14.890 --> 02:35:15.490
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4862
02:35:15.490 --> 02:35:16.810
<v Speaker 5>And if you keep doing that,</v>

4863
02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:18.880
<v Speaker 5>it achieves a scale where it starts multiplying.</v>

4864
02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:24.180
<v Speaker 5>That's how the Internet grew and when you have this magic combination of money</v>

4865
02:35:25.061 --> 02:35:28.240
<v Speaker 5>for the people that can be sent directly between people,</v>

4866
02:35:28.390 --> 02:35:28.991
<v Speaker 5>the forms,</v>

4867
02:35:28.991 --> 02:35:29.860
<v Speaker 5>a network,</v>

4868
02:35:30.130 --> 02:35:31.540
<v Speaker 5>those three things came together.</v>

4869
02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:32.201
<v Speaker 5>In my head I'm like,</v>

4870
02:35:32.201 --> 02:35:32.621
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

4871
02:35:32.621 --> 02:35:35.290
<v Speaker 5>this is big and nobody knows it yet.</v>

4872
02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:38.050
<v Speaker 5>And when you see something that big and nobody knows it yet,</v>

4873
02:35:38.410 --> 02:35:42.520
<v Speaker 5>you want to tell everyone and you want to dedicate a large part of your time to</v>

4874
02:35:42.521 --> 02:35:44.920
<v Speaker 5>doing this because it's incredibly exciting.</v>

4875
02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:45.611
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

4876
02:35:45.611 --> 02:35:48.220
<v Speaker 5>how did you initially jump in?</v>

4877
02:35:48.221 --> 02:35:48.401
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4878
02:35:48.401 --> 02:35:50.890
<v Speaker 5>how do you jump in in the infant stages of,</v>

4879
02:35:50.891 --> 02:35:51.880
<v Speaker 5>of Bitcoin,</v>

4880
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:52.250
<v Speaker 5>what it,</v>

4881
02:35:52.250 --> 02:35:54.910
<v Speaker 5>what's the steps that you took to become a part of this?</v>

4882
02:35:55.660 --> 02:35:56.051
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4883
02:35:56.051 --> 02:35:59.590
<v Speaker 5>I spent months and months and months reading everything that I could,</v>

4884
02:35:59.630 --> 02:36:03.100
<v Speaker 5>the scientific papers and discussions that Satoshi Nakamoto had with the other</v>

4885
02:36:03.101 --> 02:36:04.390
<v Speaker 5>developers as he developed it.</v>

4886
02:36:04.391 --> 02:36:05.560
<v Speaker 5>I started reading the code,</v>

4887
02:36:05.561 --> 02:36:06.700
<v Speaker 5>I started writing code,</v>

4888
02:36:06.701 --> 02:36:08.410
<v Speaker 5>I started building businesses around it.</v>

4889
02:36:08.770 --> 02:36:10.060
<v Speaker 5>I started talking to people.</v>

4890
02:36:10.061 --> 02:36:13.750
<v Speaker 5>I started meeting up with other bitcoin enthusiasts and then as soon as I could,</v>

4891
02:36:13.751 --> 02:36:16.390
<v Speaker 5>I started buying bitcoin and you know,</v>

4892
02:36:16.570 --> 02:36:18.400
<v Speaker 5>and basically have been doing that since.</v>

4893
02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:23.140
<v Speaker 5>And what does your average day now consist of going on podcasts and telling</v>

4894
02:36:23.141 --> 02:36:24.460
<v Speaker 5>people how awesome bid coin is?</v>

4895
02:36:24.490 --> 02:36:25.630
<v Speaker 5>How often does that come up?</v>

4896
02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:30.220
<v Speaker 5>So I have a day job on the technical advisor and a number of bitcoin startups.</v>

4897
02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:33.110
<v Speaker 5>I am the chief security officer for blockchain Info,</v>

4898
02:36:33.130 --> 02:36:35.590
<v Speaker 5>which is the largest bitcoin web wallet,</v>

4899
02:36:35.730 --> 02:36:35.921
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4900
02:36:35.921 --> 02:36:36.754
<v Speaker 5>in the space.</v>

4901
02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:37.833
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4902
02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:40.660
<v Speaker 5>and I work everyday as a media,</v>

4903
02:36:40.730 --> 02:36:41.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4904
02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:41.771
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4905
02:36:41.771 --> 02:36:42.670
<v Speaker 5>as a media pundits,</v>

4906
02:36:42.671 --> 02:36:43.910
<v Speaker 5>a commentator on bitcoin.</v>

4907
02:36:43.930 --> 02:36:48.790
<v Speaker 5>I write code and then I comment about it and I do interviews all the time</v>

4908
02:36:49.270 --> 02:36:51.010
<v Speaker 5>because this is something I believe in strongly.</v>

4909
02:36:51.250 --> 02:36:52.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't get paid for my interviews.</v>

4910
02:36:52.781 --> 02:36:57.781
<v Speaker 5>I have other jobs that allow me to pay for international travel for a long time.</v>

4911
02:36:58.271 --> 02:37:00.520
<v Speaker 5>That was my savings account until,</v>

4912
02:37:00.570 --> 02:37:00.861
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4913
02:37:00.861 --> 02:37:02.470
<v Speaker 5>until I was able to get other beans.</v>

4914
02:37:03.130 --> 02:37:06.940
<v Speaker 5>Buble you certainly hope to eventually profit off of this.</v>

4915
02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:07.571
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4916
02:37:07.571 --> 02:37:09.400
<v Speaker 5>actually now I'm making income on Bitcoin,</v>

4917
02:37:09.401 --> 02:37:09.731
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

4918
02:37:09.731 --> 02:37:10.101
<v Speaker 5>so let's,</v>

4919
02:37:10.101 --> 02:37:11.410
<v Speaker 5>so things are stabilized.</v>

4920
02:37:11.530 --> 02:37:11.921
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4921
02:37:11.921 --> 02:37:12.281
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4922
02:37:12.281 --> 02:37:13.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a bitcoin millionaire.</v>

4923
02:37:13.490 --> 02:37:15.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm may never be a bitcoin millionaire,</v>

4924
02:37:15.710 --> 02:37:18.230
<v Speaker 5>but I know what career I want to do for the next 15 years.</v>

4925
02:37:18.470 --> 02:37:19.303
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4926
02:37:19.370 --> 02:37:22.790
<v Speaker 5>So how did you know that bitcoin was going to be worthwhile and that so many</v>

4927
02:37:22.791 --> 02:37:24.740
<v Speaker 5>people are going to jump on the board?</v>

4928
02:37:25.130 --> 02:37:27.050
<v Speaker 5>A jump of board two years ago,</v>

4929
02:37:27.051 --> 02:37:28.500
<v Speaker 5>it seems like two years ago it was like,</v>

4930
02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:29.271
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know.</v>

4931
02:37:29.271 --> 02:37:32.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean what I knew is this is a very elegant technology.</v>

4932
02:37:32.001 --> 02:37:34.280
<v Speaker 5>The had some implications,</v>

4933
02:37:34.310 --> 02:37:36.050
<v Speaker 5>some geopolitical implications,</v>

4934
02:37:36.051 --> 02:37:37.340
<v Speaker 5>some cultural implications,</v>

4935
02:37:37.341 --> 02:37:38.660
<v Speaker 5>some technology implications.</v>

4936
02:37:38.661 --> 02:37:41.180
<v Speaker 5>And I liked all of those and I was very interested in pursuing it.</v>

4937
02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:44.420
<v Speaker 5>And at the time I hoped it was going to get baked and I figured,</v>

4938
02:37:44.421 --> 02:37:44.601
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4939
02:37:44.601 --> 02:37:45.434
<v Speaker 5>if it didn't and uh,</v>

4940
02:37:45.450 --> 02:37:46.910
<v Speaker 5>and I didn't get anywhere with it,</v>

4941
02:37:46.911 --> 02:37:48.500
<v Speaker 5>I could do something else in a couple of years.</v>

4942
02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:50.510
<v Speaker 5>You've got to come on again in a year.</v>

4943
02:37:51.170 --> 02:37:51.740
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to,</v>

4944
02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:51.951
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4945
02:37:51.951 --> 02:37:52.280
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

4946
02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:52.611
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

4947
02:37:52.611 --> 02:37:54.530
<v Speaker 5>let's let this thing cook out there.</v>

4948
02:37:54.531 --> 02:37:55.281
<v Speaker 5>In the crazy world,</v>

4949
02:37:55.281 --> 02:37:56.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean what we say a year,</v>

4950
02:37:56.930 --> 02:37:58.280
<v Speaker 5>but the way things are moving,</v>

4951
02:37:58.281 --> 02:38:00.710
<v Speaker 5>three months you might be right.</v>

4952
02:38:00.970 --> 02:38:04.780
<v Speaker 5>It was getting crazy in terms of what happened in the last year alone.</v>

4953
02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:06.260
<v Speaker 5>It's been unbelievable.</v>

4954
02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:06.651
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4955
02:38:06.651 --> 02:38:09.860
<v Speaker 5>we had our first major bitcoin conference in April in San Jose,</v>

4956
02:38:10.370 --> 02:38:13.220
<v Speaker 5>and now there's like a hundred conferences going on this year.</v>

4957
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:14.270
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4958
02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:16.700
<v Speaker 5>And there's $150 million transaction.</v>

4959
02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:17.270
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4960
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:17.721
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

4961
02:38:17.721 --> 02:38:18.630
<v Speaker 5>And the price was that,</v>

4962
02:38:18.631 --> 02:38:18.951
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

4963
02:38:18.951 --> 02:38:19.910
<v Speaker 5>I was working on this,</v>

4964
02:38:19.911 --> 02:38:21.740
<v Speaker 5>the price was $15 I,</v>

4965
02:38:21.950 --> 02:38:22.221
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4966
02:38:22.221 --> 02:38:23.420
<v Speaker 5>if you asked me last year,</v>

4967
02:38:23.421 --> 02:38:23.661
<v Speaker 5>it did.</v>

4968
02:38:23.661 --> 02:38:25.280
<v Speaker 5>I think bitcoin would be at a thousand.</v>

4969
02:38:25.281 --> 02:38:25.820
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

4970
02:38:25.820 --> 02:38:26.270
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4971
02:38:26.270 --> 02:38:27.680
<v Speaker 5>y'all may be in a couple of years.</v>

4972
02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:29.060
<v Speaker 5>I was surprised too.</v>

4973
02:38:29.090 --> 02:38:29.990
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

4974
02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:31.700
<v Speaker 5>it has a way of growing on you.</v>

4975
02:38:32.030 --> 02:38:32.751
<v Speaker 5>And when it does,</v>

4976
02:38:32.751 --> 02:38:36.020
<v Speaker 5>it grows as a network and people find it useful and they try it.</v>

4977
02:38:36.410 --> 02:38:37.970
<v Speaker 5>They understand how it works,</v>

4978
02:38:37.971 --> 02:38:38.810
<v Speaker 5>it's practical.</v>

4979
02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:40.640
<v Speaker 5>They grasped the usefulness of it,</v>

4980
02:38:40.970 --> 02:38:41.930
<v Speaker 5>and they start using it.</v>

4981
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:44.600
<v Speaker 5>I wish I had you in here when Peter Schiff was in here.</v>

4982
02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:47.220
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like sick Andreas.</v>

4983
02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:49.003
<v Speaker 5>Tell him what's up.</v>

4984
02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:50.691
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he's right.</v>

4985
02:38:50.691 --> 02:38:51.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who's right or wrong.</v>

4986
02:38:51.690 --> 02:38:51.830
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4987
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:56.180
<v Speaker 5>I don't generally debates on this because the simple truth is that none of us</v>

4988
02:38:56.181 --> 02:38:57.014
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>

4989
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.320
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4990
02:38:57.320 --> 02:39:01.100
<v Speaker 5>And the reason we don't know is because the tools we have to analyze currencies</v>

4991
02:39:01.101 --> 02:39:03.590
<v Speaker 5>don't apply because this is a completely different type of currency.</v>

4992
02:39:03.591 --> 02:39:04.430
<v Speaker 5>It's not a stock,</v>

4993
02:39:04.431 --> 02:39:05.390
<v Speaker 5>it's not a currency.</v>

4994
02:39:05.391 --> 02:39:06.230
<v Speaker 5>It's not an asset.</v>

4995
02:39:06.231 --> 02:39:07.130
<v Speaker 5>It's not a commodity.</v>

4996
02:39:07.131 --> 02:39:07.970
<v Speaker 5>It's a bit of everything.</v>

4997
02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:09.170
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4998
02:39:09.170 --> 02:39:11.570
<v Speaker 5>so can I tell you what it's gonna do in two years?</v>

4999
02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:12.710
<v Speaker 5>Of course not.</v>

5000
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:13.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

5001
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:15.050
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows.</v>

5002
02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:18.920
<v Speaker 5>What I do know is I understand the technology and what I see as something</v>

5003
02:39:18.921 --> 02:39:20.120
<v Speaker 5>elegant and practical.</v>

5004
02:39:20.330 --> 02:39:22.880
<v Speaker 5>So I'm interested in seeing where this experiment will go.</v>

5005
02:39:22.881 --> 02:39:24.620
<v Speaker 5>Because here's the thing,</v>

5006
02:39:24.621 --> 02:39:25.580
<v Speaker 5>if it doesn't work,</v>

5007
02:39:25.581 --> 02:39:26.660
<v Speaker 5>some people lose money.</v>

5008
02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:28.130
<v Speaker 5>If it does work.</v>

5009
02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:30.200
<v Speaker 5>We changed the world of money forever.</v>

5010
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:32.720
<v Speaker 5>And that's a pretty big thing to say.</v>

5011
02:39:32.721 --> 02:39:35.030
<v Speaker 5>But cryptocurrencies I think are here to stay.</v>

5012
02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:37.910
<v Speaker 5>They offer an elegant solution to decentralized money.</v>

5013
02:39:38.180 --> 02:39:39.920
<v Speaker 5>And with a bit coin survives or not.</v>

5014
02:39:40.340 --> 02:39:43.970
<v Speaker 5>I want to see where this is going to go because it has the possibility of</v>

5015
02:39:43.971 --> 02:39:45.770
<v Speaker 5>changing a lot of people's lives.</v>

5016
02:39:46.170 --> 02:39:46.371
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5017
02:39:46.371 --> 02:39:47.151
<v Speaker 5>it certainly does.</v>

5018
02:39:47.151 --> 02:39:50.600
<v Speaker 5>And I want to see them find that Nakamoto thing.</v>

5019
02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:52.010
<v Speaker 5>I want to see who it is.</v>

5020
02:39:52.330 --> 02:39:52.631
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5021
02:39:52.631 --> 02:39:53.960
<v Speaker 5>I hope they never find him.</v>

5022
02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:54.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5023
02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:54.791
<v Speaker 5>cause you're,</v>

5024
02:39:54.791 --> 02:39:54.980
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

5025
02:39:54.980 --> 02:39:58.700
<v Speaker 5>it's like big foot for you searching for a searching for sugar,</v>

5026
02:39:58.701 --> 02:39:58.911
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

5027
02:39:58.911 --> 02:39:59.301
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>

5028
02:39:59.301 --> 02:40:00.134
<v Speaker 5>I want to find them.</v>

5029
02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:02.970
<v Speaker 5>It's probably gonna be something you already know to like the dude you got a</v>

5030
02:40:02.971 --> 02:40:04.100
<v Speaker 5>Dell guy or somebody.</v>

5031
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:08.300
<v Speaker 5>It's unbelievably fascinating.</v>

5032
02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:10.160
<v Speaker 5>It's just unbelievably fascinating.</v>

5033
02:40:10.161 --> 02:40:12.890
<v Speaker 5>Especially listening to you describe it.</v>

5034
02:40:13.230 --> 02:40:13.561
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5035
02:40:13.561 --> 02:40:13.831
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

5036
02:40:13.831 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 5>your</v>

5037
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:16.380
<v Speaker 1>passion for it makes it even more fascinating.</v>

5038
02:40:16.830 --> 02:40:17.371
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

5039
02:40:17.371 --> 02:40:20.370
<v Speaker 1>it's really something that I'm going to keep my eyes on and try to follow.</v>

5040
02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:20.941
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5041
02:40:20.941 --> 02:40:21.121
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5042
02:40:21.121 --> 02:40:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate you coming over here and I appreciate you,</v>

5043
02:40:23.191 --> 02:40:23.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5044
02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:26.670
<v Speaker 1>giving us your knowledge and spending your time and,</v>

5045
02:40:27.060 --> 02:40:27.870
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

5046
02:40:27.870 --> 02:40:28.451
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'll,</v>

5047
02:40:28.451 --> 02:40:29.011
<v Speaker 1>I'll set up,</v>

5048
02:40:29.011 --> 02:40:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch it on my phone now,</v>

5049
02:40:30.350 --> 02:40:30.930
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

5050
02:40:30.930 --> 02:40:31.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5051
02:40:31.410 --> 02:40:31.970
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

5052
02:40:31.970 --> 02:40:32.271
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

5053
02:40:32.271 --> 02:40:33.104
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

5054
02:40:33.130 --> 02:40:34.400
<v Speaker 2>And if we set up an android phone,</v>

5055
02:40:34.490 --> 02:40:35.110
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

5056
02:40:35.110 --> 02:40:35.471
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5057
02:40:35.471 --> 02:40:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5058
02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:36.460
<v Speaker 2>So you can,</v>

5059
02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:37.730
<v Speaker 2>you can download the blockchain.</v>

5060
02:40:37.731 --> 02:40:39.110
<v Speaker 2>And I said before I,</v>

5061
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:41.360
<v Speaker 2>I work for blockchain as the chief security officer.</v>

5062
02:40:41.361 --> 02:40:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I was a customer long before that,</v>

5063
02:40:42.741 --> 02:40:44.330
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's one of the better ones.</v>

5064
02:40:44.390 --> 02:40:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5065
02:40:44.810 --> 02:40:48.470
<v Speaker 2>So you download blockchain from your app store and a,</v>

5066
02:40:48.471 --> 02:40:49.460
<v Speaker 2>then you'll get an address.</v>

5067
02:40:49.461 --> 02:40:52.190
<v Speaker 2>And I can then send you some bitcoin and you'll have it in a few seconds</v>

5068
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:54.650
<v Speaker 1>to put up a computer here.</v>

5069
02:40:54.651 --> 02:40:56.780
<v Speaker 1>A dedicated computer that runs can help you do that.</v>

5070
02:40:56.781 --> 02:41:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Coin computations wouldn't fuck with us in any way,</v>

5071
02:41:00.321 --> 02:41:00.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5072
02:41:00.611 --> 02:41:00.740
<v Speaker 1>With,</v>

5073
02:41:00.740 --> 02:41:00.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5074
02:41:00.890 --> 02:41:01.310
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

5075
02:41:01.310 --> 02:41:02.143
<v Speaker 1>Mess with our band.</v>

5076
02:41:02.260 --> 02:41:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

5077
02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:03.350
<v Speaker 2>what's your electricity?</v>

5078
02:41:04.490 --> 02:41:05.111
<v Speaker 2>Electricity.</v>

5079
02:41:05.111 --> 02:41:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can get a little one that's even a USB sticks.</v>

5080
02:41:08.361 --> 02:41:11.930
<v Speaker 2>They call it like a Klondike insulate a little as stick USB stick.</v>

5081
02:41:11.931 --> 02:41:14.710

<v Speaker 1>It's what life is about to me.</v>

5107
02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:54.040
<v Speaker 1>It's about pursuing passions and I love the fact that you're really into it and</v>

5112
02:41:59.231 --> 02:42:00.031

5114
02:42:01.541 --> 02:42:03.490
<v Speaker 2>but some of the most interesting things in life,</v>

5115
02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:04.930
<v Speaker 2>once you find them,</v>

5116
02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:06.430
<v Speaker 2>you have no choice.</v>

5117
02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I had no choice.</v>

5118
02:42:07.721 --> 02:42:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't sleep at night if I wasn't doing this.</v>

5119
02:42:09.610 --> 02:42:10.431
<v Speaker 2>It's still a choice.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to sell anything.</v>

5126
02:42:16.260 --> 02:42:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I am genuinely passionate about this because I see an elegant solution.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the choices,</v>

5131
02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:25.870
<v Speaker 1>the choices and being that person who follows their passions,</v>

5132
02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:27.880
<v Speaker 1>that's inspirational to me.</v>

5134
02:42:31.421 --> 02:42:34.210
<v Speaker 1>real world is watching people who are passionate about what they do</v>
