22
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.213
<v Speaker 1>And they went to this whole thing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they dropped everybody with who would </v>

00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>pay for the followers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be in like 5,000.</v>

24
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.321

<v Speaker 1>I've got a wave of people that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>excited about it.</v>

34
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:16.110

<v Speaker 1>have a publicist champ.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

41
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunately,</v>

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>every championship has been ordered as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as Brian and the team.</v>

44
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>They've been delaying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if he's going to drop out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just give me the belt.</v>

46
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.493
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what's happening because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been waiting for them to pull the </v>

47
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said they were going to,</v>

48
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:40.914
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find,</v>

49
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>find the venue and everything is taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about Australia,</v>

50
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>they talked about China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the promoter?</v>

51
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.191
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

52
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

53
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his management team and his lawyer,</v>

54
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Leon Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lisa handling most of it.</v>

55
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.570
<v Speaker 1>But if they don't come with the deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion,</v>

56
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:54.404
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already feel like everybody's scared </v>

57
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:56.724
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't think he just gave me the </v>

58
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>belt because I just want to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>Klitschko to be honest with you,</v>

59
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>cause I want to prove to the world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he saw for the biscuit because he really</v>

<v Speaker 1>I took like unreal punches to the head.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I took unreal punches to the head.</v>

68
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:24.654
<v Speaker 1>They left me for dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't even get paid for the fight </v>

72
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.813
<v Speaker 1>Golden Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was basically backdoor to change to </v>

73
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>the empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fought.</v>

74
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>The company fell as though certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that were a lot of to me,</v>
