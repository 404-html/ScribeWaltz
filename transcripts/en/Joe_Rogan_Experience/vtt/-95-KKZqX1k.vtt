106
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>1973,</v>

107
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I was 10 years old.</v>

108
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I went to see the mets against the Cincinnati reds.</v>

109

<v Speaker 1>I was in my fucking haven.</v>

110
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>It was the fucking all star game.</v>

111
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>It was the National League,</v>

112
00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.560

<v Speaker 1>And he beat up but house and his second,</v>

115
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.563

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>look at us.</v>

117
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.981

119
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:08.230

120
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.360
<v Speaker 1>my stepdad.</v>

121
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.370
<v Speaker 1>We was sitting behind Tony Perez family and Pete rose is beaten up on bud house.</v>

122
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:16.980
<v Speaker 1>And I left that with my fucking Dick hard.</v>

123
00:03:16.981 --> 00:03:17.814
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>and I could chicken pox.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I had the chicken pox.</v>

126
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>I went to that game with the fucking chicken pox.</v>

127
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>So here's my question to you.</v>

128
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

130
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Because how come the guy can't run into the guy at home base today?</v>

131
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>That would be a much suspension,</v>

132
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.730
<v Speaker 1>three months suspension,</v>

133

<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

137
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of the greatest,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's one of the greatest.</v>

141
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>You'll never see anything like that.</v>

142
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.231

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>somebody would get hurt on Cincinnati.</v>

163
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:09.061
<v Speaker 1>Reds and bench would automatically go to first and plumber would play like a</v>

201
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.011
<v Speaker 1>He used to tell him,</v>

202
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:15.611
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

203
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:16.600

<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

205
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't think your rest of your life is telling people to go fuck themselves.</v>

206
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Who does that in 1973 in an all star game?</v>

207
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.510

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 1>So the players didn't like him like that.</v>

209
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.640
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Then he went and he became a player.</v>

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.061
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

213
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:35.260

227
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.980
