17
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were to ask,</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you could let you go,</v>

19
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>if you would've asked me two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've said,</v>

20
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy.</v>

21
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what I to say,</v>

23
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd asked me even five years ago,</v>

24
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

25
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>die doesn't really matter that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just training your ass off.</v>

26
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Because I had been an athlete is</v>
<v Speaker 1>training my whole life.</v>

27
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really until I got in my mid</v>

28
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>forties and then all of a sudden I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like crap,</v>

29
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>trading ain't working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just getting fat.</v>

30
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:04.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>high blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>probably pre diabetic and they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that I went down this,</v>

33
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's dietary journey where I went</v>

34
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:16.401
<v Speaker 1>from doing the low fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low calorie fish and vegetables,</v>

35
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>almost vegetarian training three day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times a day,</v>

36
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>just about trying to try and get lean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went down to,</v>

37
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I was like,</v>

38
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>man this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm miserable.</v>

39
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

40
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>can't maintain this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

41
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Then I went on the Paleo Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You started looking,</v>

42
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.601
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

43
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Bacon looks pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went and I started reading</v>

44
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>some more and then I went on to a low</v>
<v Speaker 1>carb,</v>

45
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>high fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I did ketogenic for about two,</v>

46
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think you do stuff like that</v>

47
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I just started reading about</v>

48
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>these people that do this cardboard dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I want to sort of reading,</v>

49
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>did you read about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a facebook group,</v>

51
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>it's called zeroing in on health is</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting Charles' Washington,</v>

52
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>he's been doing it about 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they've got about 10 thinks about</v>

53
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 1>13,000 peoples right people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's been exclusively on a</v>

54
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>carnivorous diet for 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years.</v>

55
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>So no vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no carbs,</v>

56
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

57
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean he basically eats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I think he ate steak and pork ribs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

59
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>And there's another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was more impressive.</v>

60
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named Joel Anderson and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife Shawn,</v>

61
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.370
<v Speaker 1>they'd been doing it for 20 years and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I could probably show you a picture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

63
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's 60 and he looks like he's 30</v>

64
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>his wife is in his mid forties and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like she's 25 I mean there,</v>

65
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean why all by looking at these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you're like,</v>

66
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>they're crazy healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 1>what happened was she had lyme disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>real bad and was kind of overweight and</v>

68
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>really sick and he started doing like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same stuff loud when he's reading</v>

69
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>about these olds cold bodybuilders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember,</v>

70
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we're ever going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>convince Kuranda.</v>

71
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>So he promoted the steak and eggs diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the 1950s sixties and he was</v>

72
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>just jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was,</v>

73
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

74
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1956 he was kind of before most of the</v>

75
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>steroid stuff was hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were still some steroids back in</v>

77
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>the 1940s you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're Nazis play with that with the</v>

78
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

79
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't really get into the</v>

80
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding culture till probably the</v>
<v Speaker 1>60s you know,</v>

81
00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>and in the 70s and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.570
<v Speaker 1>not to everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

83
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was doing this stuff when he,</v>

84
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>and if you look up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look up Vince Garon de and look</v>

85
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>at his physique from the 1940</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 1950 he's fricking pretty</v>

86
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just eating meat.</v>

87
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.800
<v Speaker 1>He was eating his diet was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was five days of just eating</v>

88
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>meat and eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was taking the eggs and then every,</v>

89
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>every one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every fifth or sixth day you could</v>

90
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what,</v>

92
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>that's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was his night.</v>

93
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:25.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's what he looked like back in 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the fifties you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

95
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty decent for back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>they jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I mean for,</v>

97
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>for our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for a nonsteroid guy,</v>

98
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is also taking into</v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration how little they really</v>

99
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>knew about training back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

100
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know.</v>

101
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go back into history and I'm</v>

102
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>moving to talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there was a guy named Larry</v>

103
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Scott who was like the first Mr Olympia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was another guy that was eating</v>

104
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>just tons of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>four or five pounds of meat a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wanted us to an Olympian again,</v>

106
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some of their drug use,</v>

107
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some of this stuff.</v>

108
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>But I was just reading about this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was just like,</v>

109
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

110
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an athlete.</v>

111
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I like trying new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

112
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to try it for a month.</v>

113
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>And so I did it for a month and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

114
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel pretty good,</v>

115
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.101
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

116
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:06.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>

117
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm size like I did a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

118
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go back and go back to my</v>

119
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Kenogenic Diet.</v>

120
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>And so I started wearing that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The day I did,</v>

121
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna eat some apples,</v>

122
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>a little almond butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>had some barriers and creamy and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be normally it is a treat and I</v>

124
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 1>just didn't feel as good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>like my back started hurting a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and I was like,</v>

126
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:23.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's where someone had,</v>

127
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>so then I went and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

128
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going back to eating meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

129
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>When your back started hurting from</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating apples.</v>

130
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.161
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

131
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.490
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

133
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.340
<v Speaker 1>and we can talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>in detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen a lot of people what</v>

135
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>they'll say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I saw when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>working as a surgeon,</v>

137
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 1>when I put people on a ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their joint pain was starting to go</v>

138
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:44.390
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

139
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is pretty common.</v>

140
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people believe that joint pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>is connected to the consumption of</v>

141
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.420
<v Speaker 1>simple carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

142
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.951
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

143
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I find carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is for sure,</v>

145
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's something we eat and most like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>a lot of cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not always,</v>

147
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's something out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're eating.</v>

148
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty convinced as not meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>that's what I can tell you for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what I know,</v>

150
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>

151
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:07.160
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>

153
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>process gluten or wheat or stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

155
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>whether it's vegetable oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

156
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

157
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even some vegetables potentially.</v>

158
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>And so this is what I'm seeing and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what I saw.</v>

159
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied these large facebook groups</v>

160
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>like an anthropologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>like they used to study these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:25.980
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years ago they'd go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.910
<v Speaker 1>western price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got and see all these people and</v>

164
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>study their teeth and stuff.</v>

165
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.750
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't speak their language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

167
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>he was pretty remote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

168
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you've got to translate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so some of those observations,</v>

169
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're valid,</v>

170
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>they're hard to do now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:41.640
<v Speaker 1>but so when you go on these groups and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just wa all even knew it,</v>

172
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>just like reading this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a scientist going,</v>

173
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy went on this diet and has joint</v>

174
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.441
<v Speaker 1>pulling away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy,</v>

175
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>one of those not in his thyroid disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>went away.</v>

176
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>This guy went on this diet and his skin</v>
<v Speaker 1>got psoriasis,</v>

177
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I kept seeing this over and over and</v>

178
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean thousands of them.</v>

179
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>But the big thing for most</v>

180
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 2>people is removing refined</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>

181
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 2>removing sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people</v>

182
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I would say that that's a good strategy</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people.</v>

184
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:08.324
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>

185
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what people or you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

186
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>whatever makes you healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

187
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had these national guidelines that</v>

188
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>tell people what to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there they don't work for most</v>

189
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:16.851
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

190
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:17.500
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

191
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at our country.</v>

192
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sad to see all these people that</v>

193
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really getting sick.</v>

195
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named Vinnie toward her</v>
<v Speaker 1>two has this no sugar,</v>

197
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 1>no grains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that will,</v>

198
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>that will successfully help a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of people,</v>

199
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think you have to be objective</v>

200
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:35.370
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do it long enough for town</v>

201
00:06:35.371 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>and effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

202
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

203
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

204
00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>be really cool.</v>

205
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>It'd be really clinical about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the big problems that I</v>

206
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 1>see as a physician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a big problem because people</v>

207
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>will go on a low carb diet or ketogenic</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet and they'll say,</v>

208
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I feel the best I've ever felt in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

209
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mood is better,</v>

210
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mental cognition is better,</v>

211
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 1>my joints feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my guts don't hurt,</v>

212
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>my skin is better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sex drive is better.</v>

213
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Everything you would say is that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting healthy and they'll go to</v>

214
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 1>their doctor and they'll get some blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn and their cholesterol be high and</v>

215
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 1>the doctor will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

216
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>you're going to kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have a heart attack.</v>

217
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people get scared away from that and</v>

218
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>then go back to eating their other stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get,</v>

219
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>then they feel crappy again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're like,</v>

220
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least my cholesterol is not bad.</v>

221
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 1>So one of the big problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to sort of basically</v>

222
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>preaching this stuff is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a problem with health care</v>

223
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:26.630
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we have so gotten away from just</v>

224
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:27.970
<v Speaker 1>defining what's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

225
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.270
<v Speaker 1>if somebody comes into your office and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say you meet,</v>

226
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.900
<v Speaker 1>you talk to him for two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three minutes because health healthcare</v>

227
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 1>is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got 10 minutes to see a patient make</v>

228
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 1>a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're gonna do is like,</v>

229
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.993
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you doing?</v>

230
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Order a bunch of labs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at the results of the labs and</v>

231
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

232
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Speaker 1>this lab's low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slab is high,</v>

233
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.180
<v Speaker 1>the slabs normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on this drug or you know,</v>

234
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:48.160
<v Speaker 1>do this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

235
00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the patient may be saying why,</v>

236
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:50.830
<v Speaker 1>but I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the,</v>

237
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.190
<v Speaker 1>or maybe converse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may say,</v>

238
00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I feel like crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

239
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>you look at your labs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look fine.</v>

240
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:55.890
<v Speaker 1>So go exercise a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me</v>

241
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 2>back to the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

242
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a physician,</v>

243
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you understand a lot about the human</v>

244
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>double you worried when decided to go on</v>

245
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 2>this carnivore only diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

246
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 2>you worried that you were going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>deficient in some sort of nutrients and</v>

247
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and fiber and all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

248
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Like where were you cautious?</v>

249
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

250
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very,</v>

251
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

252
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm still skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

253
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just the way he should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

254
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.104
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>we're aware of what's not in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

256
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the Rda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the already in it says</v>

257
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 1>meet as low in vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's low and manganese,</v>

258
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>it's low and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a potassium,</v>

259
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:34.940
<v Speaker 1>it's low and you don't vitamin a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean there's a whole bunch of</v>

260
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:36.050
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's low and you know,</v>

261
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 1>on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

262
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.480
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

263
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't rectify,</v>

264
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 1>why are these people are doing so well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

265
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:45.500
<v Speaker 1>just eating meat and we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>historically that tear their populations</v>

266
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:49.340
<v Speaker 1>out there in the inner what the Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sammy and all these people,</v>

267
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

268
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.260
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the best exam,</v>

269
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

270
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.850
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they had extremely low incidence</v>

271
00:08:53.851 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>of cancer and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing up</v>

272
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.740
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

274
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to,</v>

275
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to northern Alaska in the</v>

276
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.310
<v Speaker 1>winter time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck trying to find a fruit or</v>

277
00:09:03.311 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>vegetable or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

278
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>but what people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they would,</v>

279
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>they would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just fly.</v>

280
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had a lot of their organs and I</v>

281
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 1>guess the vitamin C from their liver and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:13.670
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the whale skin handsome.</v>

283
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>And so they would just try to justify</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and try and make,</v>

284
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.340
<v Speaker 1>this is how it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the same thing as messiah.</v>

285
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>And they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well sometimes they would eat some</v>

286
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>berries once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they would always try to justify it.</v>

287
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 1>those things aren't available year</v>
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

289
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get berries,</v>

290
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in Alaska or wherever the</v>

291
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 1>anyone are.</v>

292
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

293
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 1>you can't get that 12 months out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

294
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 1>That's not what's having a significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on their diet.</v>

295
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's coming from the meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

296
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:39.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>

297
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 1>this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I,</v>

298
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>after doing a lot of research on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

299
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:45.120
<v Speaker 1>So we've known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's interesting.</v>

300
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:47.720
<v Speaker 1>So when we look at the development of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rdh,</v>

301
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recommended daily allowance is those</v>

302
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 1>were divine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those were developed back in the 1940s</v>

303
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 1>and they were developed basically for</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers to figure out what the heck are</v>

304
00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you supposed to feed people so they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>

305
00:09:56.611 --> 00:10:00.240
<v Speaker 1>And so they did research on this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they did was they take populations</v>

306
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>of people that are consuming a normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

307
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the 1940s you know,</v>

308
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 1>people would eat a mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was fairly high in</v>

309
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as high as it is now,</v>

310
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a mixed diet.</v>

311
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.060
<v Speaker 1>And so what they see is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

312
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.510
<v Speaker 1>if you eat that diet and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>deficient in this nutrient,</v>

313
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get x amount of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrient,</v>

314
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.380
<v Speaker 1>you're going to develop some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrient deficiency syndrome.</v>

315
00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:21.091
<v Speaker 1>And so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

316
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 1>well we know that this level of nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 1>deficiency causes disease,</v>

317
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 1>so therefore we're going to recommend</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

318
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets this amount,</v>

319
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

320
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:33.110
<v Speaker 1>but they knew what they found out back</v>
<v Speaker 1>even at 1897,</v>

321
00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 1>there's a study where they're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and they looked at something</v>

322
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 1>called firemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know it was time and back</v>

323
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they saw that certain animals,</v>

324
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 1>if they're on a lower carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't get this disease.</v>

325
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 1>We're animals on a high cart</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate dig this disease.</v>

326
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 1>And the disease was called Berry Berry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a thiamine deficiency,</v>

327
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:53.310
<v Speaker 1>which causes neurologic problems or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

328
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.810
<v Speaker 1>congestive heart failure type problems.</v>

329
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>And so they were noticing that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals are on a low carb diet,</v>

330
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>even though the thymine levels were</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

331
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 1>really low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't getting diseases.</v>

332
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at that and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these other nutrients,</v>

333
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:05.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like manganese,</v>

334
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.900
<v Speaker 1>manganese is highly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

335
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 1>required for carbohydrate metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're on a diet where you're</v>

336
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 1>not taking any carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you've got to say,</v>

337
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe I don't need as much manganese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And despite what the RDA says,</v>

338
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:24.110
<v Speaker 1>and you can look at that for nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 1>after nutrient glucose and vitamin sees</v>

339
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 1>a huge one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

340
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 1>So vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

341
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.270
<v Speaker 1>you don't take vitamin C and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

342
00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:31.980
<v Speaker 1>really need to get scurvy and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>

343
00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:33.900
<v Speaker 1>You die is it will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

344
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you end up with bleeding in your joints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your teeth fall out,</v>

345
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 1>your gums rot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your skin opens up with sores,</v>

346
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 1>horrible disease.</v>

347
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.020
<v Speaker 1>And these people are not getting scurvy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happening is we know that</v>

348
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 1>a molecule of glucose and a molecule of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C are almost identical.</v>

349
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.830
<v Speaker 1>And so they compete for the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>transporters.</v>

350
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 1>And so if you don't have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose floating around,</v>

351
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>you need way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way less vitamin C.</v>

352
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

353
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.833
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

354
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>and this has been known for for quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while as well.</v>

355
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's fascinating because</v>

356
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 1>obviously orange juice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tons of glucose,</v>

357
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 1>tons of vitamin say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

358
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Database account,</v>

359
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.990
<v Speaker 1>cancel each other out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think what's happening,</v>

360
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:10.360
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially it just needs to be</v>

361
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 1>investigated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that a lot of people that we</v>

362
00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:16.060
<v Speaker 1>have all these vitamin deficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D deficiency,</v>

363
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 1>magnesium deficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that may be caused by just</v>

364
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:22.020
<v Speaker 1>ingesting too much carbohydrate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating it,</v>

365
00:12:22.021 --> 00:12:23.950
<v Speaker 1>creating a higher than normal need.</v>

366
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 1>So basically we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're creating higher needs for</v>

367
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:28.150
<v Speaker 1>vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

368
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>You do blood work on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

369
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't yet.</v>

370
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna probably do it once I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a year at this.</v>

372
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.100
<v Speaker 1>You haven't done any?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

373
00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:36.521
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

374
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:37.190
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do,</v>

375
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've got a lot of people to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

376
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that interested in it because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't,</v>

377
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it makes that big of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference from me.</v>

378
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it just out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to satisfy other people's</v>

379
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 1>curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have that much curiosity</v>

380
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:49.680
<v Speaker 1>personally</v>

381
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.570
<v Speaker 2>about your blood work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not really radical change in</v>

382
00:12:53.571 --> 00:12:55.550
<v Speaker 2>your diet where you're just consuming</v>
<v Speaker 2>only meat.</v>

383
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would want to see what kind of results</v>

384
00:12:57.021 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting.</v>

385
00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

386
00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean it depends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 1>if you can tell me what blood tests</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells me I'm healthy and I don't think</v>

388
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:04.500
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think if you get a really good,</v>

389
00:13:04.501 --> 00:13:04.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

390
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.980
<v Speaker 2>doctor who understands the different</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes,</v>

391
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:11.010
<v Speaker 2>hdl cholesterol and ldl cholesterol and</v>
<v Speaker 2>free testosterone available and all the</v>

392
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.760
<v Speaker 2>different nutrients that are essential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you get someone who really</v>

393
00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:19.390
<v Speaker 2>understands that and kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive examination of your blood</v>

394
00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he could benefit from it</v>

395
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.140
<v Speaker 2>greatly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also the,</v>

396
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 2>the knowledge that you can tell them</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

397
00:13:26.651 --> 00:13:28.030
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel great.</v>

398
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can get a look at this.</v>

399
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:31.570
<v Speaker 2>What are you eating and what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>media you eating?</v>

400
00:13:31.571 --> 00:13:32.404
<v Speaker 2>Where are you getting in it?</v>

401
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting point cause I,</v>

402
00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've started this,</v>

403
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

404
00:13:36.201 --> 00:13:37.230
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was new,</v>

405
00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I started doing this and got public on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and twitter and a lot of people were</v>

406
00:13:39.801 --> 00:13:40.281
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

407
00:13:40.281 --> 00:13:41.114
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

408
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing well.</v>

409
00:13:42.561 --> 00:13:43.011
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:13:43.011 --> 00:13:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm breaking some more records and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

411
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:45.920
<v Speaker 1>So let's put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain that.</v>

412
00:13:45.921 --> 00:13:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Like what raw world records he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bryce,</v>

413
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:48.410
<v Speaker 1>so on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.320
<v Speaker 1>so I've been in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

415
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.260
<v Speaker 1>So I've been an athlete my whole life</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught me and I've,</v>

416
00:13:51.261 --> 00:13:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like an athlete look pretty</v>

417
00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:54.020
<v Speaker 1>stellar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

418
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to 40 right now,</v>

419
00:13:55.881 --> 00:13:56.960
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

420
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.600
<v Speaker 1>so when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was younger I played rugby in New</v>

421
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing with some of the all</v>

422
00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:01.510
<v Speaker 1>blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

423
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.660
<v Speaker 1>at a high level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is before it was professional in</v>

424
00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:04.760
<v Speaker 1>the name of the team by the way.</v>

425
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a race plane with blacks.</v>

426
00:14:08.151 --> 00:14:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he's saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Zealand all blacks.</v>

427
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to know the history on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of an interesting sort of</v>

428
00:14:12.801 --> 00:14:13.521
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back,</v>

429
00:14:13.521 --> 00:14:15.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the 19 hundreds of New Zealand</v>

430
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.350
<v Speaker 1>guys were so fast and there's forwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>and backs,</v>

431
00:14:18.351 --> 00:14:21.660
<v Speaker 1>fours elect the lineman in the backs of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fast guys and they,</v>

432
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.420
<v Speaker 1>they were all so super fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they said they looked like they</v>

433
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:27.890
<v Speaker 1>were all backs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody type made a typo.</v>

434
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

435
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.470
<v Speaker 1>But they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like the best rugby players in</v>

436
00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:33.921
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

437
00:14:33.921 --> 00:14:35.300
<v Speaker 1>some people say South Africa is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

438
00:14:35.301 --> 00:14:38.300
<v Speaker 1>but New Zealand is pretty much the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I played down there with those guys</v>

439
00:14:38.301 --> 00:14:41.780
<v Speaker 1>and then I went into weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerlifting and I had an American</v>

440
00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:44.580
<v Speaker 1>record in the deadlift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was deadlifting close to 800 pounds is</v>

441
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.460
<v Speaker 1>drug free athlete back in the 30s and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I went on to 'em,</v>

442
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I just am strongman stuff for a few and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I went on to throwing,</v>

443
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like track and field,</v>

444
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 1>like discus and shot put and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highland games where you,</v>

445
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run around with a big caber and wear</v>

446
00:14:58.671 --> 00:14:59.090
<v Speaker 1>a kilt.</v>

447
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>And I won the world championships in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

448
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 1>And then you know what I got in my mid</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 [inaudible] I was about close to 300</v>

449
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>pounds back then I was about to 80 to 85</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

450
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:09.850
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't keep me doing this side.</v>

451
00:15:09.851 --> 00:15:11.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's when I started dieting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

452
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 1>And so I got down to pretty lean about</v>
<v Speaker 1>two 40 ish or I'm at now.</v>

453
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 1>And I started doing is indoor rowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

454
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>which is not a concept too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you remember,</v>

455
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know conor mcgregor on is,</v>

456
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that machine he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling on.</v>

457
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm sure in a lot of the Mam</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing guys know that.</v>

458
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 1>So I got on there and I started training</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

459
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:31.310
<v Speaker 1>And so what I did was there's a 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>meter row,</v>

460
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.811
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:34.100
<v Speaker 1>and this is kind of itching because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly,</v>

462
00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:34.940
<v Speaker 1>highly glycolytic.</v>

463
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

464
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 1>it's not like running a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like exact pitter explaining glycolytic.</v>

465
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 1>So glycolytic means you're burning</v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose,</v>

466
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're using muscle glycogen,</v>

467
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he had,</v>

468
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:46.560
<v Speaker 1>who's a fell on a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

469
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.080
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guy was Andy Galpin.</v>

470
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying all you got to have</v>

471
00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:50.990
<v Speaker 1>glycogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

472
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:54.290
<v Speaker 1>well to do highly glycolytic activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is a highly,</v>

473
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:56.370
<v Speaker 1>highly glycolytic activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes about a minute,</v>

474
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.120
<v Speaker 1>a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minute to minute 30 and that's,</v>

475
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.200
<v Speaker 1>that's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

476
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:01.550
<v Speaker 1>like you're going all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

477
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.510
<v Speaker 1>And so I was able to break the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 50 plus world record in that.</v>

478
00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:08.200
<v Speaker 1>And it was when I went Olin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was uh,</v>

479
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.120
<v Speaker 1>when I got to 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one minute,</v>

480
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 1>18.3 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I put it down all the way down</v>

481
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 1>and one 14 so it took four seconds off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world record without a single gram</v>

482
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 1>of carbohydrate.</v>

483
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

484
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.200
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you mean this is the,</v>

485
00:16:22.201 --> 00:16:23.690
<v Speaker 1>one of the issues with the ketogenic</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

486
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.170
<v Speaker 1>if you eat too much protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body converts that Protein Back to</v>

487
00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:28.850
<v Speaker 1>glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that they were</v>

488
00:16:28.851 --> 00:16:30.830
<v Speaker 1>saying that you have to have like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

489
00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:34.130
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to have like somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the neighborhood of 70% fats,</v>

490
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.200
<v Speaker 1>30% proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

491
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:38.530
<v Speaker 1>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another sort of thing that I</v>

492
00:16:38.531 --> 00:16:41.390
<v Speaker 1>think a lot of people sort of have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have questions about.</v>

493
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.850
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gluconeogenesis,</v>

494
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:48.710
<v Speaker 1>so that's converting protein or fat into</v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose is it's demand driven.</v>

495
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.950
<v Speaker 1>So your body doesn't just make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you get a lot of protein,</v>

496
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:54.200
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to make a bunch of blood</v>

497
00:16:54.201 --> 00:16:55.900
<v Speaker 1>sugar for the heck of it because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body doesn't need it.</v>

498
00:16:55.901 --> 00:17:00.770
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that glucose is</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely important to the body.</v>

499
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need it.</v>

500
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the nice thing about it is if you</v>

501
00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 1>regulate it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well and the best way to regulate</v>

502
00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:08.121
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well,</v>

503
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:10.430
<v Speaker 1>it's just to make your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rather than,</v>

504
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting it from Kombucha or you know,</v>

505
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.620
<v Speaker 1>eating a bunch of carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

506
00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:16.071
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

507
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what happens.</v>

508
00:17:18.711 --> 00:17:19.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so ketosis,</v>

509
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably spend significant periods of</v>

510
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 1>time in Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not always in Ketosis.</v>

511
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the point of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

512
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it ptosis is probably a good</v>

513
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:31.791
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

514
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:32.840
<v Speaker 1>periodically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>

515
00:17:32.841 --> 00:17:33.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

516
00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

517
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:36.020
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about evolutionary,</v>

518
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.500
<v Speaker 1>excuse me for interrupting you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why would it vary if your diet's not</v>

519
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:40.334
<v Speaker 1>varying?</v>

520
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Why would you be in Ketosis or out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ketosis if you're not varying your diet?</v>

521
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 1>It just eating only meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

522
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:46.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 1>because it depends on how long I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>between meals.</v>

524
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not intermittent fast,</v>

525
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:53.980
<v Speaker 1>so I intermittent feast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

526
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 1>so this is what I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

527
00:17:56.671 --> 00:17:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I think this is probably more pri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will often go,</v>

528
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the funny,</v>

529
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was in Denver,</v>

530
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.540
<v Speaker 1>a couple nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the big Brazilian,</v>

531
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get down all you can eat meat place and</v>

532
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I just to Haas Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

533
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just picked up.</v>

534
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.810
<v Speaker 1>So I went there and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had him come back 50 times.</v>

535
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I clicked everyone,</v>

536
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I said 50 frigging orders of food I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay was about six pounds of meat and</v>

537
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.190
<v Speaker 1>hundred putting away in one setting.</v>

538
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.760
<v Speaker 1>You ate six pounds of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane,</v>

539
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:24.410
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

540
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would,</v>

541
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.280
<v Speaker 1>so I put away about six pounds and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hungry for like 30 some hours.</v>

542
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.800
<v Speaker 1>So I'm basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I'm intentionally,</v>

543
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 1>fasting is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've faced it so much that I just don't</v>

544
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:36.330
<v Speaker 1>feel like eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think here's what I think,</v>

545
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you haven't,</v>

546
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 1>why do you think we have an appetite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

547
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:42.240
<v Speaker 1>what's the point of an appetite to tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you when to eat,</v>

548
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

549
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.060
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're eating the crappy wrong</v>

550
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your appetites all screwed up.</v>

551
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>So one of the problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have people eating the wrong food.</v>

552
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this,</v>

553
00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:53.280
<v Speaker 1>all this process garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full of calories,</v>

554
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.310
<v Speaker 1>sugar and crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have any nutrients in</v>

555
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:57.540
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time you're hungry,</v>

556
00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:59.010
<v Speaker 1>your body's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me more nutrition.</v>

557
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all you do is pour garbage your body,</v>

558
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 1>you're always going to be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry,</v>

559
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus the insulin spikes,</v>

560
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:05.910
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

561
00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:07.950
<v Speaker 1>so you want to know insulin is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

562
00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:10.290
<v Speaker 1>we need some insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need insulin for muscle growth.</v>

563
00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:11.280
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a useful thing.</v>

564
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.350
<v Speaker 1>The goal of insulin is not zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

565
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:14.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>

566
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:16.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want our glucose to be zero.</v>

567
00:19:16.231 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 1>We don't want our insulin to be zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't want it always,</v>

568
00:19:19.561 --> 00:19:20.820
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always spiking.</v>

569
00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:19:21.931 --> 00:19:24.240
<v Speaker 1>when you eat a big meal of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be eating.</v>

571
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:27.300
<v Speaker 1>And I'll argue that I think meets a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn good meal and we can argue,</v>

572
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:28.830
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about how it's completed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

573
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:30.170
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

574
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:31.620
<v Speaker 1>so when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 1>you dislike the next time you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to eat.</v>

576
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Your body says I need some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need energy so you can get it from fat</v>

577
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Speaker 1>when you eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also need structure.</v>

578
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And so by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating meat,</v>

579
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basically giving your body what</v>

580
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:47.100
<v Speaker 1>it's asking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that works pretty well.</v>

581
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Whose phones them on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very interesting because,</v>

582
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people would say you should eat a</v>

583
00:19:53.791 --> 00:19:55.040
<v Speaker 1>balanced diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

584
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Most people would say that in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be healthy,</v>

585
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.780
<v Speaker 1>you should consume certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruits,</v>

586
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have some,</v>

587
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.170
<v Speaker 1>some whole grains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should eat some meat.</v>

588
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.900
<v Speaker 1>And if you come along and tell people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

589
00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:12.270
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean six pounds of meat and I don't</v>

590
00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:14.820
<v Speaker 1>eat for 30 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this guy's out of his fucking mind.</v>

591
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:15.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I agree.</v>

592
00:20:15.571 --> 00:20:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

593
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.540
<v Speaker 1>2017 that's crazy.</v>

594
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.410
<v Speaker 1>It's crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can,</v>

595
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I can point to thousands and thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people and doing it in an excellent</v>

596
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:23.280
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting.</v>

597
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.840
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

598
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.060
<v Speaker 1>balanced diet is just a frigging cop</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

599
00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that fucking to tell</v>

600
00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:30.180
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm gonna tell you the mom's diet and</v>

601
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I wish you had done some blood work so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should get us some data.</v>

602
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like someone who's espousing</v>

603
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 1>this diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it'd be nice he had some hard data.</v>

604
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

605
00:20:39.631 --> 00:20:40.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I didn't know I was going to do</v>

606
00:20:40.861 --> 00:20:41.780
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just started doing it.</v>

607
00:20:41.781 --> 00:20:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I,</v>

608
00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already done it,</v>

609
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 1>so I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably get some,</v>

610
00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

611
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.030
<v Speaker 1>what did you just decide like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

612
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 1>try this for a month and then just keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

613
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I've tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I'm going to try it for a month.</v>

614
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And I just felt so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

615
00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:55.930
<v Speaker 1>well and you've been on it for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I started last December,</v>

616
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.220
<v Speaker 1>so a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

617
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 1>So a whole eat you whole year of just</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating meat cause you gotta do some</v>

618
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:02.014
<v Speaker 1>blood work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

619
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Well I probably will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

620
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:04.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is,</v>

621
00:21:04.011 --> 00:21:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at the point I'm making is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what is it going to tell me?</v>

622
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>

623
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.460
<v Speaker 1>One of the things is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

624
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a little probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I've seen hundreds of hundreds of</v>

625
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:13.600
<v Speaker 1>people who've already done blood work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know what it's going to show</v>

626
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:14.920
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

627
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:16.530
<v Speaker 1>So I've gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got this study going,</v>

628
00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.010
<v Speaker 1>we've got all these people to submitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood work.</v>

629
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

630
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably my hdl will go out and my</v>

631
00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:24.540
<v Speaker 1>triglycerides will go down.</v>

632
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.930
<v Speaker 1>My blood sugar stabilized to a low level</v>
<v Speaker 1>by my,</v>

633
00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:30.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory markers will be normal does</v>

634
00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:32.610
<v Speaker 1>because I've seen lots and lots of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's blood work already.</v>

635
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.530
<v Speaker 1>So I know it's going to show my</v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol may be up or down.</v>

636
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that we had a lot</v>

637
00:21:37.091 --> 00:21:41.350
<v Speaker 1>of people worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can talk about cholesterol and my</v>

638
00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:44.680
<v Speaker 1>view is a pretty worthless marker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.610
<v Speaker 1>by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

640
00:21:45.611 --> 00:21:47.800
<v Speaker 1>you have to take it into context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a,</v>

641
00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple people that are really,</v>

642
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:53.310
<v Speaker 1>really intelligent about cholesterol</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it really testing this source of,</v>

643
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.160
<v Speaker 1>one guy's name is Dave Feldman on</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

644
00:21:56.161 --> 00:21:59.530
<v Speaker 1>His name is Dave Kido.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another guy named Ivor Cummins,</v>

645
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 1>who's an Australian thinks both</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers.</v>

646
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:02.200
<v Speaker 1>And so this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened.</v>

647
00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:04.930
<v Speaker 1>This guy date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes on a ketogenic diet.</v>

648
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 1>He was cholesterol goes sky frigging</v>
<v Speaker 1>heights,</v>

649
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:08.020
<v Speaker 1>like 400 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

650
00:22:08.021 --> 00:22:08.740
<v Speaker 1>way up there.</v>

651
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.570
<v Speaker 1>And his doctor is freaking out and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out.</v>

652
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.940
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand this.</v>

653
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything about me is just best health</v>

654
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:19.330
<v Speaker 1>ever felt my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what he does is he starts drawing his</v>

655
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:23.380
<v Speaker 1>blood every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets a blood test and what he finds</v>

656
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:27.670
<v Speaker 1>out is that his blood cholesterol is all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the place.</v>

657
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.440
<v Speaker 1>One day it's 300 and next day it's 201</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

658
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.820
<v Speaker 1>three 50 in the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we,</v>

659
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.020
<v Speaker 1>when we go to the doctor every six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months or a year and they get a blood</v>

660
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.710
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol uson and well that's my</v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol.</v>

661
00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:40.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's always that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he found out that it's so variable.</v>

662
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.000
<v Speaker 1>They've actually known about this since</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1950s but no one has been talking</v>

663
00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:45.550
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what he figured out,</v>

664
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:47.110
<v Speaker 1>and he's a systems engineer and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineered.</v>

665
00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 1>There's some smart guys.</v>

666
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the one thing I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of talk about it,</v>

667
00:22:50.651 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 1>just to get somebody as an md or phd</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean they know everything.</v>

668
00:22:54.161 --> 00:22:57.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>plumbers and whatever,</v>

669
00:22:57.251 --> 00:22:59.000
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any formal training that</v>
<v Speaker 1>configure.</v>

670
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.820
<v Speaker 1>They're smart people and they can figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff out.</v>

671
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.640
<v Speaker 1>So he's in his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an engineer,</v>

672
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.820
<v Speaker 1>real smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what he does,</v>

673
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.710
<v Speaker 1>he figures out the cholesterol is</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically all it is,</v>

674
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.920
<v Speaker 1>is it's traveling around in your blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on energy flux.</v>

675
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.750
<v Speaker 1>So how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you've eaten a lot,</v>

676
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.120
<v Speaker 1>so if you've eaten a whole bunch of food</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your fault,</v>

677
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.720
<v Speaker 1>your liver is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to put out a bunch fat</v>

678
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.350
<v Speaker 1>cause you to burn fat as fuel and oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if we're not in a kitty Jane died.</v>

679
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.660
<v Speaker 1>So what it does is it transports fat.</v>

680
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.150
<v Speaker 1>So when you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't eaten for a while.</v>

681
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Like you fasted for a blood test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your liver says we need fat and misses</v>

682
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.140
<v Speaker 1>because we're low on energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it shoots out all this fat.</v>

683
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.520
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is cholesterol is</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruising around for a ride.</v>

684
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's just sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

685
00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

686
00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:45.520
<v Speaker 1>as a passenger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So depending on how much you eat and</v>

687
00:23:45.521 --> 00:23:47.180
<v Speaker 1>when you've eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll change your cholesterol.</v>

688
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not a very good marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can,</v>

689
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 1>you can find studies that show for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause mortality.</v>

690
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and me on it,</v>

691
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 1>cause you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the same age as I am.</v>

692
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:56.330
<v Speaker 1>I think you do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

693
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.550
<v Speaker 1>We're both these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we look at,</v>

694
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

695
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.490
<v Speaker 1>associational studies are not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

696
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.070
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at that and you say all</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause mortality,</v>

697
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:05.360

703
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.080

<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

710
00:24:23.431 --> 00:24:24.870
<v Speaker 1>and this is interesting because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

711
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.670
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian to Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to pick on vegetarians</v>

712
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 1>beings cause I know some great ones are</v>
<v Speaker 1>great people and I think,</v>

713
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there shouldn't be a war between us but</v>

714
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.300
<v Speaker 1>vegetarians and Vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one killer of vegetarian</v>

715

<v Speaker 1>which won't pick your poison.</v>

722
00:24:45.161 --> 00:24:50.161
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't understand that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar industry's hijacking of science in</v>

723
00:24:51.381 --> 00:24:56.381
<v Speaker 1>the 1950s the way they paid off those</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists to literally false advertise</v>

724
00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.970
<v Speaker 1>the idea that sugar is safe for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that saturated fat and cholesterol</v>

725
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:05.390
<v Speaker 1>is what's causing all of these issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people and heart attacks to this</v>

726
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.770
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just sort of repeat that.</v>

727
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Like they think it's Gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>

731
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.460

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

754
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.540
<v Speaker 1>He occasionally eats like something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

755
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.570
<v Speaker 1>but most of what he eats is meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Jocko willink.</v>

756
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I need more steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He eats a neat,</v>

758
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fricking health food.</v>

759
00:26:07.841 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I totally is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

760
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:12.020
<v Speaker 1>and you know there's a guy named bobby</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximus who's a,</v>

761
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.280
<v Speaker 1>who's a fitness guy.</v>

762
00:26:13.281 --> 00:26:14.810

764
00:26:18.111 --> 00:26:20.400
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if we look back into,</v>

765
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.760
<v Speaker 1>into history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's all kinds of accounts of</v>

766
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.690
<v Speaker 1>people using meat as an athletic</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancer.</v>

767
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the original Greek Olympics,</v>

768
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.650
<v Speaker 1>those guys knew that they had a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat to perform better.</v>

769
00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeders out of London,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

772
00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 1>they gave them extra meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I know they would fight better.</v>

773
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.541
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

774

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

776
00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:43.650

<v Speaker 1>They basically just ate their horses and</v>

777
00:26:43.651 --> 00:26:44.150
<v Speaker 1>their meat.</v>

778
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 3>That's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I traveled with that,</v>

779
00:26:45.661 --> 00:26:47.940

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

796
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:15.840

<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

797
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Speaker 3>in my personal record is doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had a couple of New York strips,</v>

798
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.190

<v Speaker 3>I can put down four pounds at one time</v>

814
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 3>with the people looking at you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

815
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:54.480
<v Speaker 3>he's the super lean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like obviously whatever you're eating,</v>

816
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:57.660
<v Speaker 3>your body's processing it really well</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you don't have a,</v>

817
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.300
<v Speaker 3>you don't have what someone would think</v>
<v Speaker 3>of as a steak eater.</v>

818
00:28:00.301 --> 00:28:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you tell a guy,</v>

819
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy eats two steaks a day and like,</v>

820
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:05.850
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must have a gut.</v>

821
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:11.220
<v Speaker 3>That's how that mashed potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>macaroni and cheese and stuff eat with</v>

822
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:11.551
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

823
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just,</v>

824
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:13.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

825
00:28:13.951 --> 00:28:15.690
<v Speaker 3>I put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said on that instagram page,</v>

826
00:28:15.691 --> 00:28:16.524
<v Speaker 3>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

827
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.960
<v Speaker 3>me exercising and doing stuff and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

828
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.090
<v Speaker 3>pictures and that was something that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about,</v>

829
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of the studio right before we</v>

830
00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:26.610
<v Speaker 3>came in that the studies that have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>done on people consuming meat,</v>

831
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:30.750
<v Speaker 3>and I brought this up as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a lot of misconceptions</v>

832
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:35.130
<v Speaker 3>about the studies because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>very clear when they say that people who</v>

833
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:38.820
<v Speaker 3>eat meat five times a week are more</v>
<v Speaker 3>likely to get cancer.</v>

834
00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:43.050
<v Speaker 3>What they're not telling you is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people eight along with the meat,</v>

835
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.310
<v Speaker 3>are they eating cheeseburgers or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating grass fed beef or it's grass</v>

836
00:28:47.311 --> 00:28:48.660
<v Speaker 3>finished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grass fed,</v>

837
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high in essential fatty acids healthy</v>

838
00:28:51.811 --> 00:28:52.170
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

839
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Or are they eating some bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheeseburger with a sugary drink?</v>

840
00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.180
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the rest of their diet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they consuming a lot of refined</v>

841
00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:02.460
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they consuming a lot of sugar?</v>

842
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Are they drinking alcohol?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They smoking cigarettes.</v>

843
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.880
<v Speaker 3>All you're saying is they're eating meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>five days a week.</v>

844
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not specifying in any way their</v>

845
00:29:11.611 --> 00:29:13.330
<v Speaker 3>actual overall diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

846
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.680
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't sort that very,</v>

847
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.830
<v Speaker 3>very well out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they've got all these epidemiology</v>

848
00:29:16.831 --> 00:29:20.340
<v Speaker 3>studies in basically a mediator is</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically someone and,</v>

849
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:21.420
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we statistically,</v>

850
00:29:21.421 --> 00:29:23.520
<v Speaker 3>we know they're more likely to smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more likely to drink.</v>

851
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:25.050
<v Speaker 3>They're more likely not to wear their</v>
<v Speaker 3>seatbelt.</v>

852
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.540
<v Speaker 3>They're more likely to be an accidents</v>
<v Speaker 3>are more likely not to go to their</v>

853
00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:28.350
<v Speaker 3>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

854
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.750
<v Speaker 3>they're more likely to just not to care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got,</v>

855
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 3>that's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

856
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.930
<v Speaker 3>What's this cause people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause if I tell you,</v>

857
00:29:33.931 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 3>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe eating meat's bad for you and you</v>

858
00:29:37.051 --> 00:29:38.250
<v Speaker 3>say F you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

859
00:29:38.251 --> 00:29:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about my health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

860
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.740
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just don't care.</v>

861
00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>So is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they can't</v>

862
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 1>separate that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've got all these studies where</v>

863
00:29:45.311 --> 00:29:47.410
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to separate out and say well</v>

864
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:49.990
<v Speaker 1>what Kinda what Kinda even up to smokers</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they never can take that.</v>

865
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

866
00:29:50.951 --> 00:29:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck right thing out of</v>

867
00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:55.530
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got this stuff and then all</v>

868
00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.280
<v Speaker 1>the studies are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really low strength.</v>

869
00:29:57.281 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 1>So if we look at w you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can talk about this about meat,</v>

870
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat being causing cancer.</v>

871
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Cause there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some concern about that with</v>

872
00:30:04.361 --> 00:30:06.730
<v Speaker 1>colon cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we look at smoking,</v>

873
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.070
<v Speaker 1>you know when they determine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking causes cancer,</v>

874
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:14.310
<v Speaker 1>the epidemiology showed a 2000% increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the incidence of cancer.</v>

875
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of studies when they compare</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to meat and cancer,</v>

876
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 1>they found an 18% increase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is nothing.</v>

877
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it doesn't even matter.</v>

878
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.550
<v Speaker 1>It's so percent isn't high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not not when you look at relative risk,</v>

879
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:28.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if your risk,</v>

880
00:30:28.731 --> 00:30:33.050
<v Speaker 1>if your risk of getting colon cancer is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one or say your,</v>

881
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:38.060
<v Speaker 1>your risk of getting colon cancer is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>five in a million.</v>

882
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's six in a million.</v>

883
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it dislike it,</v>

884
00:30:45.101 --> 00:30:47.980
<v Speaker 1>it's so minor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if your risk is going from five and</v>

885
00:30:47.981 --> 00:30:51.070
<v Speaker 1>a million to 300 and a million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're like,</v>

886
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it depends on the incident.</v>

887
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 1>So if it's really low to begin with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only raise it but tiny mountain,</v>

888
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.420
<v Speaker 1>it's so small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we know there was a guy</v>

889
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:05.700
<v Speaker 1>named Bradford Hill who talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical correlations on when this</v>

890
00:31:05.701 --> 00:31:09.970
<v Speaker 1>things actually matter and not to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to 200% or 300% does it even</v>

891
00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:11.860
<v Speaker 1>matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't draw any conclusion from that.</v>

892
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.970
<v Speaker 1>The problem is 200 300% difference out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like a thousand yeah.</v>

893
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:20.060
<v Speaker 1>So sort of two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be six [inaudible],</v>

894
00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of,</v>

895
00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:24.510
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of being 18% more like a</v>

896
00:31:24.511 --> 00:31:26.590
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200% more likely that those numbers are</v>

897
00:31:26.591 --> 00:31:30.570
<v Speaker 1>confusing to people though the way he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying 200% like what?</v>

898
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

899
00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:34.030
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you would have to double or triple</v>

900
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.030
<v Speaker 1>your risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 18% is not double or tripling.</v>

901
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.220
<v Speaker 1>That's only putting it up by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a fraction.</v>

902
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.153
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

903
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.470
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you separate all that stuff out and</v>

904
00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:43.181
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

905
00:31:43.181 --> 00:31:44.014
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

906
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the World Health Organization two years</v>

907
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:48.191
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>

908
00:31:48.191 --> 00:31:52.090
<v Speaker 1>two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>declared that red meat wasn't class two</v>

909
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 1>carcinogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prosec meets was a class one carcinogen.</v>

910
00:31:54.731 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said it's like plutonium and</v>

911
00:31:56.711 --> 00:31:58.870
<v Speaker 1>smoking and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody runs to runs all over the</v>

912
00:31:58.871 --> 00:31:59.430
<v Speaker 1>place with that.</v>

913
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Why'd they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's why they do that.</v>

914
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:02.990
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can read,</v>

915
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.300
<v Speaker 1>you can go on their website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

916
00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:06.340
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you what their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their conclusions were.</v>

917
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.020
<v Speaker 1>So this was done by an organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the International Association for</v>

918
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Research on cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're based on a Leland France and</v>

919
00:32:13.601 --> 00:32:14.730
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

920
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the World Health</v>

921
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Organization uses to determine their</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

922
00:32:18.731 --> 00:32:19.840
<v Speaker 1>And so there are written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

923
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides appointment right now the IRC is</v>

924
00:32:22.571 --> 00:32:24.580
<v Speaker 1>under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under investigation by the US Congress</v>

925
00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:28.810
<v Speaker 1>for using crappy science and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting political agenda.</v>

926
00:32:28.811 --> 00:32:31.600
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if that's true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that's generated by the probably</v>

927
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:33.160
<v Speaker 1>be corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like their findings,</v>

928
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 1>but so they're under investigation for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

929
00:32:35.111 --> 00:32:38.650
<v Speaker 1>But what they say is we have some weak</v>
<v Speaker 1>epidemiology,</v>

930
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.110
<v Speaker 1>which is 18% stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we think we have some strong</v>

931
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:43.820
<v Speaker 1>mechanistic reasons for this.</v>

932
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if everybody,</v>

933
00:32:45.621 --> 00:32:49.230
<v Speaker 1>you know there's isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a doctor named George Ead Ede</v>

934
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.950
<v Speaker 1>who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a psychiatrist out in Maryland</v>

935
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 1>who's got this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tremendous,</v>

936
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 1>she analyzed the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has a website called diagnosis</v>

937
00:32:56.691 --> 00:33:01.691
<v Speaker 1>diet.com so she did an analyst analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the 800 studies they used and she</v>

938
00:33:01.821 --> 00:33:05.270
<v Speaker 1>found that what they ended up doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them showed me,</v>

939
00:33:05.271 --> 00:33:07.570
<v Speaker 1>didn't cause cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a small percentage it did.</v>

940
00:33:07.571 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 1>And they looked at all these rat studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was about 20 2025 rat studies.</v>

941
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.080
<v Speaker 1>And they found like three or four of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them showed meat.</v>

942
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we gave this type of cancer,</v>

943
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.120
<v Speaker 1>if we gave this rat a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

944
00:33:20.121 --> 00:33:23.990
<v Speaker 1>amount of meat and we genetically bred</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and we gave them a ma,</v>

945
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.950
<v Speaker 1>a medicine that makes them get cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they get a little bit of change in</v>

946
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:31.430
<v Speaker 1>their colon that might turn into cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine that makes them get cancer.</v>

947
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something there.</v>

948
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a special way to make get</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

949
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:37.280
<v Speaker 1>So they have this model that it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>them get cancer really,</v>

950
00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:39.380
<v Speaker 1>really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they did is they felt,</v>

951
00:33:39.381 --> 00:33:41.180
<v Speaker 1>why did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're trying to find out if something</v>

952
00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 1>gives something cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well because they want to make it,</v>

953
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.370
<v Speaker 1>they want to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

954
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 1>they want to differentiate that as quick</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible because they've got to use a</v>

955
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:50.710
<v Speaker 1>million rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see,</v>

956
00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying is the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast way to show up.</v>

957
00:33:52.501 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 1>They get cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that,</v>

958
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:57.080
<v Speaker 1>and she explains it very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we don't know that they would</v>

959
00:33:57.081 --> 00:33:57.810
<v Speaker 1>get cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

960
00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.650
<v Speaker 1>and it's not shown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing we talked about this</v>

961
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:02.750
<v Speaker 1>before is that if you want to look at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat studies,</v>

962
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:04.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's not to say that plants give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>

963
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:09.260
<v Speaker 1>but there are pesticides and plants that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been studying rats that we eat</v>

964
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:09.890
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

965
00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Natural foods and vegetables and fruits</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also give racks cancer and so the</v>

966
00:34:14.241 --> 00:34:16.070
<v Speaker 1>only difference is we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

967
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Speaker 1>submitted some really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean things that natural compounds</v>

968
00:34:20.421 --> 00:34:23.350
<v Speaker 1>that plants extract or they write</v>
<v Speaker 1>secreted in order,</v>

969
00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:25.490
<v Speaker 1>does it discourage predation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

970
00:34:25.491 --> 00:34:27.890
<v Speaker 1>These natural substances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they feed them to rats and the</v>

971
00:34:27.891 --> 00:34:31.310
<v Speaker 1>isolate them and feed them to rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives the rads cancer at 52 they kept</v>

972
00:34:31.311 --> 00:34:34.580
<v Speaker 1>tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>27 of them is just normal food that we</v>

973
00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:37.130
<v Speaker 1>eat on [inaudible] stuff we do on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily basis.</v>

974
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.080
<v Speaker 1>So it's not to scare people out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating that stuff,</v>

975
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:42.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's just saying that's how much bs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff is based upon.</v>

976
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.180
<v Speaker 1>It just seems to me to be so crazy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

977
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a cancer study and they</v>

978
00:34:46.161 --> 00:34:49.550
<v Speaker 1>give the rat something that induces</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer in order to find out what gives</v>

979
00:34:49.551 --> 00:34:50.570
<v Speaker 1>him cancer more.</v>

980
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.570
<v Speaker 1>So they give them this compound and on</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the compound and they,</v>

981
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.690
<v Speaker 1>they check their diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

982
00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.490
<v Speaker 1>And they also feed them sugar with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

983
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So it's Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the way they do it,</v>

984
00:35:01.191 --> 00:35:02.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

985
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can extrapolate.</v>

986
00:35:03.651 --> 00:35:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Does that really matter to humans or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>

987
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.650
<v Speaker 1>It's just so hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

988
00:35:06.651 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things that animals can</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat that we can't.</v>

989
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.700
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is bizarre.</v>

990
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

991
00:35:11.271 --> 00:35:12.170
<v Speaker 1>we're not rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

992
00:35:12.171 --> 00:35:12.891
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

993
00:35:12.891 --> 00:35:14.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like the same thing when we talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

994
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer rates in the historical</v>

995
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:17.420
<v Speaker 1>populations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

996
00:35:17.421 --> 00:35:18.111
<v Speaker 1>what Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

997
00:35:18.111 --> 00:35:19.230
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have much cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

998
00:35:19.231 --> 00:35:21.410
<v Speaker 1>not until we started feeding them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

999
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.350
<v Speaker 1>the 1940 stories and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

1000
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.720
<v Speaker 1>So til we started feeding him all our</v>
<v Speaker 1>crap that they,</v>

1001
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.930
<v Speaker 1>that they started to get those diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:30.770
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1003
00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 1>it's all very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1004
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:36.740
<v Speaker 1>When you think about diet and health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have to take into account</v>

1005
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.000
<v Speaker 1>geographically,</v>

1006
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1007
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the geography that your ancestors</v>

1008
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 2>evolved in and what did they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were they accustomed to eating?</v>

1009
00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Like there's different adaptations for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nun.</v>

1010
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.500
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adaptations to cold.</v>

1011
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.890
<v Speaker 2>They probably have requirements for</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of dietary fat.</v>

1012
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:54.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

1013
00:35:54.621 --> 00:35:55.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I think is,</v>

1014
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.451
<v Speaker 1>I think we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1015
00:35:56.451 --> 00:35:58.440
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about their so like,</v>

1016
00:35:58.441 --> 00:36:00.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody is so different.</v>

1017
00:36:00.021 --> 00:36:02.810
<v Speaker 1>We have all this different genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need special diets.</v>

1018
00:36:02.811 --> 00:36:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I tend to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1019
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.770
<v Speaker 1>in certain circumstances that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

1020
00:36:06.771 --> 00:36:07.700
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1021
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:09.200
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1022
00:36:09.201 --> 00:36:11.540
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sort of split from primates.</v>

1023
00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:12.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1024
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.960
<v Speaker 1>we shared a common ancestor with</v>
<v Speaker 1>primates,</v>

1025
00:36:14.961 --> 00:36:16.400
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bonobos,</v>

1026
00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.040
<v Speaker 1>gorillas somewhere eight to 10 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1027
00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>We don't know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was back and then,</v>

1028
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:22.370
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1029
00:36:22.371 --> 00:36:24.830
<v Speaker 1>the human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pre humans kind of went one way and</v>

1030
00:36:24.831 --> 00:36:28.760
<v Speaker 1>then the apes and chimpanzees went up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>swim when we went up into the trees.</v>

1031
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.460
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1032
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.210
<v Speaker 1>even the difference between a chimpanzee</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1033
00:36:32.211 --> 00:36:33.470
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an ape,</v>

1034
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.110
<v Speaker 1>an ape or not an ape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gorilla,</v>

1035
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.420
<v Speaker 1>gorilla crushes all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1036
00:36:38.421 --> 00:36:40.310
<v Speaker 1>these all really fibers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

1037
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.930
<v Speaker 1>lots of fiber and stuff like that.</v>

1038
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees can't tolerate that as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're there.</v>

1039
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.700
<v Speaker 1>They're colon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a little smaller,</v>

1040
00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 1>will humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colin's got way,</v>

1041
00:36:48.901 --> 00:36:50.210
<v Speaker 1>way smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1042
00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.540
<v Speaker 1>And so what happened is why you and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can throw a rock really far.</v>

1043
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:55.750
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chimpanzee chimpanzee can throw,</v>

1044
00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give a Cimzia baseball,</v>

1045
00:36:57.801 --> 00:36:59.150
<v Speaker 1>they can throw in about 20 miles an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

1046
00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:02.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I can throw a baseball,</v>

1047
00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 miles an hour average guy,</v>

1048
00:37:04.131 --> 00:37:04.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get,</v>

1049
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major league baseball players are</v>

1050
00:37:06.321 --> 00:37:07.640
<v Speaker 1>throwing at 95 plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1051
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.900
<v Speaker 1>The reason we evolve to do that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're throwing shit in animals.</v>

1052
00:37:11.901 --> 00:37:12.734
<v Speaker 1>We were hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1053
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what drove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1054
00:37:14.451 --> 00:37:16.610
<v Speaker 1>our scapula has rotated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1055
00:37:16.611 --> 00:37:18.080
<v Speaker 1>tim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'll get a chimpanzee Scapula,</v>

1056
00:37:18.081 --> 00:37:18.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1057
00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side,</v>

1058
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:21.920
<v Speaker 1>it allows him to crump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climb trees and do this stuff.</v>

1059
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.400
<v Speaker 1>And so these strong climate based</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary pressures,</v>

1060
00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:27.440
<v Speaker 1>which drove us to saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1061
00:37:27.441 --> 00:37:28.310
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this ice age stuff going on.</v>

1063
00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:31.751
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1064
00:37:31.751 --> 00:37:34.550
<v Speaker 1>the climate's drawing out the fruits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jungles are going away.</v>

1065
00:37:34.551 --> 00:37:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Now it's all this grassland and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1066
00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.900
<v Speaker 1>there's not much eat in the grassland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1067
00:37:38.901 --> 00:37:39.890
<v Speaker 1>except for some animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1068
00:37:39.891 --> 00:37:41.870
<v Speaker 1>people need some bugs and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for awhile.</v>

1069
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.311
<v Speaker 1>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1070
00:37:43.311 --> 00:37:45.200
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees or even chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1071
00:37:45.201 --> 00:37:47.040
<v Speaker 1>3% of their diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1072
00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people say we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>frugivores and always should be.</v>

1073
00:37:48.971 --> 00:37:51.530
<v Speaker 1>It's fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even chimpanzees eat about 3% of</v>

1074
00:37:51.531 --> 00:37:52.820
<v Speaker 1>their diet comes from killing other</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

1075
00:37:52.821 --> 00:37:53.654
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1076
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.780
<v Speaker 1>there's this red colobus monkey</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and you can hand it or</v>

1077
00:37:56.781 --> 00:37:59.000
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chimpanzees are hunting,</v>

1078
00:37:59.001 --> 00:38:00.360
<v Speaker 1>listening to extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1079
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:01.940
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good little hunters.</v>

1080
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:02.774
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1081
00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a David attenborough documentary</v>

1082
00:38:04.931 --> 00:38:06.130
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying.</v>

1083
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.650
<v Speaker 2>And you see how organized they are to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill monkeys.</v>

1084
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.450
<v Speaker 2>They have chimps at one end of this tree</v>
<v Speaker 2>line and they're coming this way and</v>

1085
00:38:13.451 --> 00:38:16.060
<v Speaker 2>they have chips on the side and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>chase him in and then they,</v>

1086
00:38:16.061 --> 00:38:17.920
<v Speaker 2>they corner him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ambush them and they get them in</v>

1087
00:38:17.921 --> 00:38:19.780
<v Speaker 2>the center and they just swarm them.</v>

1088
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:20.761
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1089
00:38:20.761 --> 00:38:21.541
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

1090
00:38:21.541 --> 00:38:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Their brain is not even half as big as</v>
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>

1091
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when humans sort of,</v>

1092
00:38:25.111 --> 00:38:25.944
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

1093
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty clear that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>drove a lot of our evolution,</v>

1094
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.750
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ability to communicate,</v>

1095
00:38:30.751 --> 00:38:31.740
<v Speaker 1>to strategize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1096
00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:33.810
<v Speaker 1>some of the anatomic things was based</v>
<v Speaker 1>around hunting.</v>

1097
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>

1098
00:38:34.681 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I know you're a hunter Geo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know it's,</v>

1099
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.860
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think a lot.</v>

1100
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:39.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be pretty smart.</v>

1101
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Dot Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These animals I'm supposed to be when</v>

1102
00:38:42.161 --> 00:38:44.260
<v Speaker 1>you're in big groups and been back then</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they've got,</v>

1103
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:45.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

1104
00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Spears basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1105
00:38:46.481 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 1>you look at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a population in central Europe</v>

1106
00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 1>called the Gravettian is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at population markers for</v>

1107
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:55.360
<v Speaker 1>nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1108
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:57.123
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1109
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.170
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I look at is</v>
<v Speaker 1>population height.</v>

1110
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.630
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a real top height tall</v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

1111
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 1>it means that they had really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition.</v>

1112
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look at the tallest people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably ever live where these</v>

1113
00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:10.690
<v Speaker 1>gravette that teams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys were just decimating</v>

1114
00:39:10.691 --> 00:39:11.530
<v Speaker 1>mammoths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1115
00:39:11.531 --> 00:39:13.270
<v Speaker 1>they were so efficient at killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>mammoths.</v>

1116
00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And so that's probably basically all</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ate.</v>

1117
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

1118
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:18.160
<v Speaker 1>they might have a little vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are,</v>

1119
00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.680
<v Speaker 1>they were there advertise it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>six foot two.</v>

1120
00:39:20.681 --> 00:39:23.050
<v Speaker 1>And this is like 30,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1121
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.820
<v Speaker 1>So these things have been giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were giants.</v>

1122
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:27.280
<v Speaker 1>And so the people that have did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have sort of genetically are related to</v>

1123
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:30.120
<v Speaker 1>those people now are the people from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Croatia and the Netherlands were turning</v>

1124
00:39:30.121 --> 00:39:33.340
<v Speaker 1>in the tallest people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only other group that rivaled that</v>

1125
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.270
<v Speaker 1>are the neurotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1126
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Africans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are like the,</v>

1127
00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:39.460
<v Speaker 1>what to see in the Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are all about six feet tall and</v>

1128
00:39:39.461 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 1>average.</v>

1129
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 1>And their diet is primarily as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>livestock based.</v>

1130
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:47.230
<v Speaker 1>And then the other tall population</v>
<v Speaker 1>historically were the plains Indian,</v>

1131
00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.290
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the Cheyenne Injury</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indians and they just lived on mostly</v>

1132
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Speaker 1>buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of,</v>

1133
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.660
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of interesting as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best food for nutrition,</v>

1134
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1135
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm finding from a</v>

1136
00:39:57.941 --> 00:39:59.320
<v Speaker 1>performance standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1137
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:01.550
<v Speaker 1>it's just will make me feel the best and</v>
<v Speaker 1>work the best.</v>

1138
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you take vitamins or minerals or</v>

1139
00:40:04.661 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1140
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:06.301
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1141
00:40:06.301 --> 00:40:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1142
00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of,</v>

1143
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1144
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I will say I take some salt,</v>

1145
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:11.970
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my meat,</v>

1146
00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:12.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1147
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll have some Himalayan salt or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular sauna.</v>

1148
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:18.430
<v Speaker 1>How do you normally cook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Cook for yourself also time and you</v>

1149
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:19.530
<v Speaker 1>get pretty good at cooking steaks.</v>

1150
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.060
<v Speaker 1>You haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll either reverse here,</v>

1151
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to,</v>

1152
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you know how to reverse sear here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse sear a steak in a cast and cook</v>

1153
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:29.560
<v Speaker 1>it slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly low heat to talk to internal</v>

1154
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:30.410
<v Speaker 1>temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

1155
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but medium rare and then a throw in a</v>

1156
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:34.870
<v Speaker 1>pan for a couple minutes and sear it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they need it or I'll just throw it</v>

1157
00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:35.531
<v Speaker 1>on the grill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1158
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:36.400
<v Speaker 1>it depends where I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I'm at.</v>

1159
00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:38.440
<v Speaker 1>If from California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a grill,</v>

1160
00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Harish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll throw one in the grill.</v>

1161
00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 1>If I'm back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1162
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.560
<v Speaker 1>in another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New Mexico,</v>

1163
00:40:41.561 --> 00:40:42.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just,</v>

1164
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it to come and have a girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1165
00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:45.390
<v Speaker 1>So I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's that,</v>

1166
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a,</v>

1167
00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of minutes to do a lot of</v>

1168
00:40:49.301 --> 00:40:51.310
<v Speaker 1>supermarket runs cause that get</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive.</v>

1169
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.140
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be an expensive diet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1170
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.220
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1171
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:55.150
<v Speaker 1>it depends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1172
00:40:55.151 --> 00:40:56.260
<v Speaker 1>it depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1173
00:40:56.261 --> 00:40:57.850
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much I'm probably eating more than</v>

1174
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 1>the average person that does this diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm aware of.</v>

1175
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.070
<v Speaker 1>She only goes about two pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two pounds of meat.</v>

1176
00:41:03.071 --> 00:41:05.110
<v Speaker 1>And so they can do day a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1177
00:41:05.111 --> 00:41:06.720
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1178
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:07.750
<v Speaker 1>people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

1179
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:08.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1180
00:41:08.531 --> 00:41:10.660
<v Speaker 1>don't have the budget of the stupid like</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground beef and stuff like that.</v>

1181
00:41:10.661 --> 00:41:12.880
<v Speaker 1>And you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can eat two pounds of ground beef</v>

1182
00:41:12.881 --> 00:41:13.420
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1183
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.850
<v Speaker 1>under 10 bucks a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is right.</v>

1184
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:15.291
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1185
00:41:15.291 --> 00:41:16.810
<v Speaker 1>it's two cups of starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1186
00:41:16.811 --> 00:41:19.510
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually not that bad for a lot</v>

1187
00:41:19.511 --> 00:41:22.420
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's also people that have</v>

1188
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.700
<v Speaker 1>ethical concerns about the consumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>of animals,</v>

1189
00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:27.430
<v Speaker 1>especially the consumption of factory</v>
<v Speaker 1>farmed animals.</v>

1190
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a mass basis.</v>

1191
00:41:29.471 --> 00:41:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably responsible for a whole</v>

1192
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.010
<v Speaker 1>goddamn feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead Cows.</v>

1193
00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:33.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

1194
00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1195
00:41:34.731 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I think I have a concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people that eat meat should be</v>

1196
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:39.170
<v Speaker 1>concerned about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're the ones that primarily need</v>

1197
00:41:39.171 --> 00:41:42.470
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

1198
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

1199
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that,</v>

1200
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since evolution began,</v>

1201
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:50.180
<v Speaker 1>humans have been eating meat and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just what happens in nature.</v>

1202
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:52.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at how an animal's killing a</v>

1203
00:41:52.631 --> 00:41:54.590
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Elian takes down under zebra,</v>

1204
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not a pleasant experience for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

1205
00:41:57.321 --> 00:42:00.110
<v Speaker 1>And so most of the way that humans kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals now,</v>

1206
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it from a humane say,</v>

1207
00:42:01.911 --> 00:42:03.200
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty darn humane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1208
00:42:03.201 --> 00:42:04.240
<v Speaker 1>even as a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1209
00:42:04.241 --> 00:42:06.020
<v Speaker 1>if you hit an animal and you don't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1210
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:07.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't hit on the right spot,</v>

1211
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:09.000
<v Speaker 1>you got to track him down and he's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1212
00:42:09.001 --> 00:42:11.420
<v Speaker 1>it may take an hour or longer.</v>

1213
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 1>So the issue is not necessarily even</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the eventual death of the animal,</v>

1214
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:18.710
<v Speaker 1>it's also the life of the animal was</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

1215
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that too.</v>

1216
00:42:19.671 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1217
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at,</v>

1218
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:24.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1219
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.050
<v Speaker 1>if the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you've got chickens in cages and</v>

1220
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:29.750
<v Speaker 1>they can't turn around right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just as cramped in there,</v>

1221
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:30.361
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1222
00:42:30.361 --> 00:42:32.820
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons they put chicken in</v>

1223
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.670
<v Speaker 1>case cause they'll peck the hell out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

1224
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:35.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't say anything they'll just</v>

1225
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:37.430
<v Speaker 1>tear each other up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

1226
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:38.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different considerations on</v>

1227
00:42:38.921 --> 00:42:39.830
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1228
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:41.270
<v Speaker 1>if you have an animal that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1229
00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:43.310
<v Speaker 1>cause I talked to a lot of cattle</v>
<v Speaker 1>ranchers and most of them,</v>

1230
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:47.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean most of them they really care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about their animals are out in the snow</v>

1231
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:49.430
<v Speaker 1>and the rain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure their animals are fed,</v>

1232
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:50.500
<v Speaker 1>making sure they're sheltered.</v>

1233
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if an animal goes down there taking care</v>

1234
00:42:52.131 --> 00:42:52.964
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1235
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably some bad apples out</v>

1236
00:42:55.011 --> 00:42:58.640
<v Speaker 1>there and if we know about that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some Vegan documentary guy wants to</v>

1237
00:42:58.641 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 1>make a film about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then yeah,</v>

1238
00:42:59.871 --> 00:43:02.840
<v Speaker 1>those guys should be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey don't mistreat your animals.</v>

1239
00:43:02.841 --> 00:43:03.674
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1240
00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intentionally hurt them.</v>

1241
00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Don't have them standing in a pilot</v>
<v Speaker 1>crap.</v>

1242
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them some,</v>

1243
00:43:07.971 --> 00:43:08.804
<v Speaker 1>give them some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1244
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.940
<v Speaker 1>fresh air and some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ability to move.</v>

1245
00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:12.570
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1246
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.470
<v Speaker 1>if you look cows or animals in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're herd animals anyway.</v>

1247
00:43:15.471 --> 00:43:19.130
<v Speaker 1>So they hang out together anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like if they're indoors now,</v>

1248
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:22.850
<v Speaker 1>if they're indoors and they've got no</v>
<v Speaker 1>room to move around and they go in and</v>

1249
00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:23.631
<v Speaker 1>go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that'll,</v>

1250
00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think you have to kind of,</v>

1251
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just make it all black and</v>

1252
00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:29.540
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that are good at it.</v>

1253
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Some people are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bad ones need to be made not to do</v>

1254
00:43:32.811 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 1>that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't change the fact that we</v>

1255
00:43:34.761 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 1>all need to eat.</v>

1256
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:39.830
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called butcher box</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll sell you a grass fed grass</v>

1257
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:41.420
<v Speaker 2>finished beef too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They send it to you.</v>

1258
00:43:41.421 --> 00:43:43.550
<v Speaker 2>They're one of the sponsors of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1259
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:44.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1260
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I've eaten there meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very good.</v>

1261
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:49.060
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a place and we have it,</v>

1262
00:43:49.061 --> 00:43:49.894
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1263
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:55.660
<v Speaker 2>isn't there like some sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a password or something that we</v>

1264
00:43:56.541 --> 00:43:59.720
<v Speaker 2>give them to see what could find that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1265
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1266
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:05.630
<v Speaker 2>there's ways to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to search for it though.</v>

1267
00:44:05.631 --> 00:44:10.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not meat that you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't really exactly know how the</v>

1268
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:12.000
<v Speaker 2>person is raising it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1269
00:44:12.001 --> 00:44:12.834
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you can go,</v>

1270
00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 2>unless you go to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a farmer's market or</v>

1271
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:17.000
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1272
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:22.070
<v Speaker 2>You can get $10 off plus free bacon by</v>
<v Speaker 2>using the code word Rogan and butcher</v>

1273
00:44:22.071 --> 00:44:25.610
<v Speaker 2>box.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So butcher box is one option.</v>

1274
00:44:25.611 --> 00:44:27.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's,</v>

1275
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.270
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers markets are great too.</v>

1276
00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 2>You can actually meet the ranchers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1277
00:44:32.071 --> 00:44:34.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a sense of how they raise these</v>

1278
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:36.840
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think for health wise it's really</v>

1279
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:40.140
<v Speaker 2>critical to get grass fed grass raised</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the best.</v>

1280
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Did you pay attention to that or do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take whatever you can get?</v>

1281
00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:45.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think,</v>

1282
00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.131
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1283
00:44:46.131 --> 00:44:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right in the fact that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

1284
00:44:47.721 --> 00:44:52.721
<v Speaker 1>what is the most nutrient dense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the best quality I can get grass</v>

1285
00:44:53.481 --> 00:44:55.520
<v Speaker 1>fed grass finished is going to fill that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bill.</v>

1286
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you compare that to something that</v>

1287
00:44:57.801 --> 00:44:58.550
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1288
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:59.660
<v Speaker 1>fed corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1289
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And given hormones and given antibiotics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what else did I do?</v>

1290
00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.521
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

1291
00:45:05.521 --> 00:45:10.130
<v Speaker 1>you've got those things and it's fed no</v>
<v Speaker 1>grain the difference nutritionally</v>

1292
00:45:10.131 --> 00:45:11.750
<v Speaker 1>compared to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1293
00:45:11.751 --> 00:45:14.480
<v Speaker 1>cause if you don't have any money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't afford the stuff compared to</v>

1294
00:45:14.481 --> 00:45:17.000
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the crap and the supermarket</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1295
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1296
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:20.390
<v Speaker 1>so I'll use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll use a mma analogy for you.</v>

1297
00:45:20.391 --> 00:45:22.580
<v Speaker 1>So have grass fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grain fed beef is,</v>

1298
00:45:22.581 --> 00:45:25.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conor Mcgregor or GSP,</v>

1299
00:45:25.161 --> 00:45:28.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's other stuff is say some guy</v>

1300
00:45:28.071 --> 00:45:30.260
<v Speaker 1>who's like the number three contenders</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>

1301
00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 1>that close the differences.</v>

1302
00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:34.170
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you look at hormones and beat,</v>

1303
00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:34.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1304
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:35.960
<v Speaker 1>so you don't want any hormones in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

1305
00:45:35.961 --> 00:45:36.621
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1306
00:45:36.621 --> 00:45:38.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't want antibiotics in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

1307
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.260
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're in your grass fed beef,</v>

1308
00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:43.650
<v Speaker 1>even the Lq kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got hormones in that stuff</v>

1309
00:45:43.651 --> 00:45:45.290
<v Speaker 1>because the animal makes it natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

1310
00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.620
<v Speaker 1>So you're getting a ventral horn hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting on very low level.</v>

1311
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.940
<v Speaker 1>And so what they do is they give those</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals generally the same hormones.</v>

1312
00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:56.420
<v Speaker 1>It didn't increase as a percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more compared to what you</v>

1313
00:45:56.421 --> 00:45:57.830
<v Speaker 1>and I make normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they,</v>

1314
00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.370
<v Speaker 1>if we look at like grants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what maybe,</v>

1315
00:46:01.371 --> 00:46:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the numbers exactly,</v>

1316
00:46:02.751 --> 00:46:05.870
<v Speaker 1>but the scale is what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they give you,</v>

1317
00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:10.010
<v Speaker 1>if grass fed beef gives you five Nanning</v>
<v Speaker 1>rams of estrogen,</v>

1318
00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.550
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grain fed beef gives you 10 nanograms of</v>

1319
00:46:13.551 --> 00:46:16.160
<v Speaker 1>estrogen and then you compare it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs,</v>

1320
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.670
<v Speaker 1>which give you maybe 90 and you compare</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to dairy,</v>

1321
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:22.940
<v Speaker 1>which gives you 110 and then you compare</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to,</v>

1322
00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:24.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1323
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.420
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Fido estrogens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1324
00:46:26.421 --> 00:46:28.010
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in the millions,</v>

1325
00:46:28.011 --> 00:46:28.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1326
00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things like soy beans and stuff like</v>

1327
00:46:30.081 --> 00:46:31.700
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you compare it to what is your</v>

1328
00:46:31.701 --> 00:46:35.570
<v Speaker 1>body naturally make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like 30 or 40,000.</v>

1329
00:46:35.571 --> 00:46:39.210
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a really small level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think if you can afford grass fed</v>

1330
00:46:39.211 --> 00:46:40.790
<v Speaker 1>and grain fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1331
00:46:40.791 --> 00:46:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying how can you solve the</v>

1332
00:46:42.861 --> 00:46:44.240
<v Speaker 1>world's problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you're just telling,</v>

1333
00:46:44.241 --> 00:46:47.720
<v Speaker 1>if we just isolate for health only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're a poor guy and all you can</v>

1334
00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:49.850
<v Speaker 1>afford is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1335
00:46:49.851 --> 00:46:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford his grasp and mean I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't for 20 bucks a pound for this</v>

1336
00:46:52.521 --> 00:46:53.354
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1337
00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.340
<v Speaker 1>And butcher box is still too expensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1338
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.420
<v Speaker 1>then that's probably still a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>option than going back and eating,</v>

1339
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:00.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1340
00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.210
<v Speaker 1>the other crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other car,</v>

1341
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.160
<v Speaker 1>the cheetos and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1342
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:05.900
<v Speaker 1>all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even though you don't like the</v>

1343
00:47:05.901 --> 00:47:07.610
<v Speaker 1>organic fruits and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1344
00:47:07.611 --> 00:47:09.020
<v Speaker 1>it's just expensive for people.</v>

1345
00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:09.741
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1346
00:47:09.741 --> 00:47:10.371
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1347
00:47:10.371 --> 00:47:12.270
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on who your audiences,</v>

1348
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got unlimited resources and</v>

1349
00:47:14.601 --> 00:47:17.210
<v Speaker 1>most people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to say what's,</v>

1350
00:47:17.211 --> 00:47:18.044
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

1351
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a health standpoint,</v>

1352
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:23.270
<v Speaker 1>what is most affordable and what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical?</v>

1353
00:47:23.271 --> 00:47:24.800
<v Speaker 1>How do I get my health back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is,</v>

1354
00:47:24.801 --> 00:47:25.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1355
00:47:25.251 --> 00:47:26.210
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really,</v>

1356
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like saying this is the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet in the world.</v>

1357
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying you need to find out</v>

1358
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:31.690
<v Speaker 1>what works for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1359
00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.930
<v Speaker 1>But basically what you're saying is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>grass fed beef is better,</v>

1360
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:37.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's only slightly better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1361
00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the grand scheme of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1362
00:47:38.951 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 1>So if you're saying I want to be as good</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I possibly can be and that I said</v>

1363
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:44.830
<v Speaker 1>probably grass fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grain fed and grass when it's probably</v>

1364
00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:47.410
<v Speaker 1>better if you're like saying I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick and I don't want to be sick</v>

1365
00:47:47.411 --> 00:47:49.720
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'd say get what you can afford.</v>

1366
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.430
<v Speaker 1>So you really think that meat is in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways a panacea for health.</v>

1367
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:58.720
<v Speaker 1>You think that it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just eat more meat that your body</v>

1368
00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:01.570
<v Speaker 1>will be what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>More vibrant and more healthy and like</v>

1369
00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:03.820
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it about meat specifically?</v>

1370
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Well I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1371
00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:06.970
<v Speaker 1>so this is another sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>misconception.</v>

1372
00:48:06.971 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 1>So I think a lot of it's extremely well</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbed in our body.</v>

1373
00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's look at the end result of</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we,</v>

1374
00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:14.560
<v Speaker 1>what do we do when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're eating.</v>

1375
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the end result?</v>

1376
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.860
<v Speaker 1>We eat for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ill eat to get energy and to build an</v>

1377
00:48:19.861 --> 00:48:22.450
<v Speaker 1>animal tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you and I are animals or animal</v>

1378
00:48:22.451 --> 00:48:25.720
<v Speaker 1>tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most efficient way to do that is</v>

1379
00:48:25.721 --> 00:48:27.670
<v Speaker 1>just eatsa because your body has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>

1380
00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:30.310
<v Speaker 1>it says everything in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the proportions that we need it.</v>

1381
00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1382
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a misconception.</v>

1383
00:48:32.891 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hear,</v>

1384
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.470
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1385
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.970
<v Speaker 1>if he'd be a bunch of me just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit there and rot in your intestines and</v>

1386
00:48:38.971 --> 00:48:40.600
<v Speaker 1>it's going to putrefying and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1387
00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:45.490
<v Speaker 1>So they've done studies on people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have had ileostomies and these are</v>

1388
00:48:45.491 --> 00:48:46.750
<v Speaker 1>people that have had their colon</v>
<v Speaker 1>removed,</v>

1389
00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've had colon cancer,</v>

1390
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:53.170
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory bowel disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Crohn's disease where they take out</v>

1391
00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:55.930
<v Speaker 1>your whole colon and now you've got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little back what you pooped until this</v>

1392
00:48:55.931 --> 00:48:56.764
<v Speaker 1>little bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1393
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.770
<v Speaker 1>So they've looked at people and they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at what comes out when they eat</v>

1394
00:48:59.771 --> 00:49:01.930
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost nothing comes out.</v>

1395
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit of liquid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1396
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.040
<v Speaker 1>So that means all that means is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbed,</v>

1397
00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you get a bunch of fiber and</v>

1398
00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:10.930
<v Speaker 1>vegetables and plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff goes up in the back</v>

1399
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:11.830
<v Speaker 1>because you can't digest it.</v>

1400
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.960
<v Speaker 1>You got to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have bacteria in your colon</v>

1401
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.530
<v Speaker 1>to do that in humans are not really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it compared to other primates.</v>

1402
00:49:17.531 --> 00:49:20.230
<v Speaker 1>We're really bad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about probiotics?</v>

1403
00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:22.390
<v Speaker 1>So I think probiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1404
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:26.860
<v Speaker 1>the microbiome is fascinating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of research going on.</v>

1405
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:28.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people just talking all</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the stuff,</v>

1406
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.380
<v Speaker 1>how it affects your health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we,</v>

1407
00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.150
<v Speaker 1>we try to say is how do we define a</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy microbiome?</v>

1408
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:36.280
<v Speaker 1>You can't yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't know enough.</v>

1409
00:49:36.281 --> 00:49:37.540
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1410
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.340
<v Speaker 1>we can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know everything about the</v>

1411
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:42.550
<v Speaker 1>human body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to put in tens of billions of</v>

1412
00:49:42.551 --> 00:49:43.750
<v Speaker 1>different bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole different,</v>

1413
00:49:43.751 --> 00:49:46.630
<v Speaker 1>different species and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the perfect combination and</v>

1414
00:49:46.631 --> 00:49:48.730
<v Speaker 1>that's perfectly fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're so far away from knowing that</v>

1415
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:51.010
<v Speaker 1>we're in the very infancy and what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

1416
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:53.500
<v Speaker 1>So what I would say is if you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

1417
00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your joints don't hurt,</v>

1418
00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.110
<v Speaker 1>if everything's going good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then probably by definition your</v>

1419
00:49:59.111 --> 00:50:02.590
<v Speaker 1>microbiome is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating just a meat based diet,</v>

1420
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.910
<v Speaker 1>your microbiome is going to be different</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the probiotics are probably not going</v>

1421
00:50:04.911 --> 00:50:06.490
<v Speaker 1>to make a difference for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're eating,</v>

1422
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:08.910
<v Speaker 1>if you're eating a crappy diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1423
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.150
<v Speaker 1>and you're fitting your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your gut,</v>

1424
00:50:10.151 --> 00:50:12.970
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get this dysbiosis,</v>

1425
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.080
<v Speaker 1>which is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1426
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.840
<v Speaker 1>bad bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1427
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:18.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1428
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe the private probiotics might help</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that situation.</v>

1429
00:50:20.741 --> 00:50:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1430
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think there's a,</v>

1431
00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:25.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough evidence to show that that's a</v>

1432
00:50:25.991 --> 00:50:27.130
<v Speaker 1>big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1433
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 1>So you think that perhaps</v>

1434
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe the probiotics exist or maybe the</v>
<v Speaker 2>probiotics are healthy?</v>

1435
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:34.880
<v Speaker 2>It's my</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking out.</v>

1436
00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>audio levels.</v>

1437
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too loud.</v>

1438
00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:40.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not long enough.</v>

1439
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:41.063
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1440
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the probiotics you think maybe only</v>

1441
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:50.891
<v Speaker 2>beneficial if people are consuming a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of variable things are a very diet,</v>

1442
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 2>like carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of different things.</v>

1443
00:50:53.811 --> 00:50:57.500
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe the co,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probiotics are necessary to sort of</v>

1444
00:50:57.501 --> 00:50:58.880
<v Speaker 2>balance you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're thinking?</v>

1445
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that potentially could be the case.</v>

1446
00:51:00.501 --> 00:51:03.560
<v Speaker 2>So you think that the microbiome of</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who eats meat is probably</v>

1447
00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 2>designed to eat meat?</v>

1448
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:05.811
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1449
00:51:05.811 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1450
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.600
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your microbiome reacts to whatever you</v>

1451
00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:10.370
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much sleep you get,</v>

1452
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:12.350
<v Speaker 4>how much exercise you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much you eat,</v>

1453
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.510
<v Speaker 4>how much stress is in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is very,</v>

1454
00:51:14.511 --> 00:51:16.220
<v Speaker 4>very adaptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can change in a day,</v>

1455
00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:17.001
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1456
00:51:17.001 --> 00:51:19.190
<v Speaker 4>so whatever you're feeding it</v>
<v Speaker 4>chronically is going to change.</v>

1457
00:51:19.191 --> 00:51:20.900
<v Speaker 4>What wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what bacteria live there.</v>

1458
00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:21.951
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1459
00:51:21.951 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 4>it's like this thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1460
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:25.250
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to this meet putrefaction thing.</v>

1461
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:28.060
<v Speaker 4>So if we look at the definition of</v>
<v Speaker 4>putrefaction here,</v>

1462
00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:28.851
<v Speaker 4>sounds awful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1463
00:51:28.851 --> 00:51:29.750
<v Speaker 4>It's putrefying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1464
00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Putrefaction is the activity of bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 4>on protein,</v>

1465
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So protein getting your colon,</v>

1466
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:37.160
<v Speaker 4>it'll pewter fry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1467
00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.680
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we go back to these ileostomies</v>

1468
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 4>patients,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they studied people that were getting</v>

1469
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:43.760
<v Speaker 4>soy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>protein and meat,</v>

1470
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.190
<v Speaker 4>and guess which one had more protein</v>
<v Speaker 4>going into the colon?</v>

1471
00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.050
<v Speaker 4>Soy Protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So meeting and what to soit means stuff</v>

1472
00:51:51.051 --> 00:51:54.170
<v Speaker 4>means more proteins going into your</v>
<v Speaker 4>colon and your getting it more future</v>

1473
00:51:54.171 --> 00:51:55.000
<v Speaker 4>facts in that way.</v>

1474
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Is that rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I know very little about what soy</v>

1475
00:51:58.251 --> 00:52:02.590
<v Speaker 2>supposed to do to you in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising your estrogen levels.</v>

1476
00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Is that supposed to be a real thing?</v>

1477
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of people think so.</v>

1478
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:08.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's some studies that support</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1479
00:52:08.121 --> 00:52:09.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1480
00:52:09.411 --> 00:52:11.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think soy is a particularly good</v>

1481
00:52:11.151 --> 00:52:13.310
<v Speaker 4>food for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know some people will say that</v>

1482
00:52:13.311 --> 00:52:14.750
<v Speaker 4>fermented soy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1483
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:15.950
<v Speaker 4>it is a little better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1484
00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.300
<v Speaker 4>heard that's good for you actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>write,</v>

1485
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:18.830
<v Speaker 4>what does that called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to,</v>

1486
00:52:18.831 --> 00:52:20.930
<v Speaker 4>not only not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an Asian type thing,</v>

1487
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:23.450
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's certainly some</v>

1488
00:52:23.451 --> 00:52:26.870
<v Speaker 4>people that think there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>associations that guys getting</v>

1489
00:52:26.871 --> 00:52:29.020
<v Speaker 4>Gynecomastia and stuff like that from</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating too much.</v>

1490
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Guys really done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's one of those things</v>

1491
00:52:32.371 --> 00:52:33.570
<v Speaker 2>where people just tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1492
00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:34.413
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna get bitch too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Them.</v>

1493
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.050
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1494
00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:37.360
<v Speaker 4>I've got no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I honestly guys getting that from</v>

1495
00:52:37.361 --> 00:52:39.160
<v Speaker 4>anything other than steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1496
00:52:39.161 --> 00:52:40.030
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1497
00:52:40.031 --> 00:52:41.830
<v Speaker 4>they're supposedly are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know for sure.</v>

1498
00:52:41.831 --> 00:52:43.450
<v Speaker 4>I can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't say for sure.</v>

1499
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1500
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now that you've been doing this,</v>

1501
00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:50.500
<v Speaker 2>do you plan on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done it for a year now,</v>

1502
00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.640
<v Speaker 2>do you plan on continuing this for life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this your diet now or are you going</v>

1503
00:52:53.641 --> 00:52:54.820
<v Speaker 2>to mix it up a little like,</v>

1504
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.150
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to,</v>

1505
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:59.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I seriously doubt I will not eat a ton</v>

1506
00:52:59.001 --> 00:52:59.690
<v Speaker 4>of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1507
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:01.010
<v Speaker 4>I just think I feel too good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1508
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:04.550
<v Speaker 4>I think I want to feel good and perform</v>
<v Speaker 4>as good as I can for as long as I can.</v>

1509
00:53:04.551 --> 00:53:07.070
<v Speaker 4>So whether I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is what I tell people,</v>

1510
00:53:07.071 --> 00:53:09.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it for a couple months,</v>

1511
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:10.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is one of the problems,</v>

1512
00:53:10.971 --> 00:53:12.290
<v Speaker 4>so many people that have health</v>
<v Speaker 4>problems,</v>

1513
00:53:12.291 --> 00:53:15.200
<v Speaker 4>and I think a lot of it's food related</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's really hard to sort that out.</v>

1514
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:17.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're eating a hundred different</v>

1515
00:53:17.121 --> 00:53:18.890
<v Speaker 4>types of food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which one is it?</v>

1516
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna,</v>

1517
00:53:20.181 --> 00:53:21.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna drop this out.</v>

1518
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.380
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1519
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 2>and it's obviously variable in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own individual biology.</v>

1520
00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1521
00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.501
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1522
00:53:27.501 --> 00:53:30.080
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you dropped down to just meet then</v>

1523
00:53:30.081 --> 00:53:31.100
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just say,</v>

1524
00:53:31.101 --> 00:53:33.160
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm only meeting now if I add fruit back</v>

1525
00:53:33.161 --> 00:53:34.970
<v Speaker 4>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does that f me up or not?</v>

1526
00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.620
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it does and I'm like,</v>

1527
00:53:36.621 --> 00:53:38.430
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't probably eat that if I eat</v>

1528
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:42.080
<v Speaker 4>dairy backhand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So probably there'll be a point when</v>

1529
00:53:42.081 --> 00:53:42.681
<v Speaker 4>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1530
00:53:42.681 --> 00:53:43.231
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1531
00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:43.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1532
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:46.010
<v Speaker 4>maybe once in a while I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1533
00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.450
<v Speaker 4>have some berries again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1534
00:53:47.451 --> 00:53:50.150
<v Speaker 4>and then to see how I do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

1535
00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.820
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you that these guys have been</v>

1536
00:53:52.821 --> 00:53:54.320

<v Speaker 4>don't want to do that.</v>

1540

<v Speaker 4>Who was the guy that you were saying?</v>

1541

<v Speaker 4>Did you find that gentleman online?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1566
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:50.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1567
00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:50.710
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1568
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:52.070
<v Speaker 4>the stories I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1569
00:54:52.071 --> 00:54:56.330
<v Speaker 4>this is because now I'm this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>central point and I get all these crazy,</v>

1570
00:54:56.331 --> 00:54:59.360
<v Speaker 4>crazy stories of people just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just from talking about it online,</v>

1571
00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:00.141
<v Speaker 4>just from talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1572
00:55:00.141 --> 00:55:01.580
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like sending,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that?</v>

1573
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:03.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like a little movement,</v>

1574
00:55:03.321 --> 00:55:05.900
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think what you'll see over the</v>

1575
00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.250
<v Speaker 4>next year or two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a lot more people</v>

1576
00:55:07.251 --> 00:55:08.540
<v Speaker 4>doing this just to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1577
00:55:08.541 --> 00:55:09.111
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1578
00:55:09.111 --> 00:55:11.240
<v Speaker 4>it's a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people are going to do it just to</v>

1579
00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:11.571
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1580
00:55:11.571 --> 00:55:12.620
<v Speaker 4>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be a carnivore.</v>

1581
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:13.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to screw around.</v>

1582
00:55:13.761 --> 00:55:17.510
<v Speaker 4>But I think there's people that honestly</v>
<v Speaker 4>are doing it and they're really</v>

1583
00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:20.930
<v Speaker 4>seriously improving their health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think whatever works is what you</v>

1584
00:55:20.931 --> 00:55:21.710
<v Speaker 4>should do.</v>

1585
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the removal of refined</v>

1586
00:55:24.501 --> 00:55:27.560
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates almost helps everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1587
00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:28.620
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% done.</v>

1588
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:32.720
<v Speaker 2>If not the removal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the severe restriction,</v>

1589
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.760
<v Speaker 2>just restrict most car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1590
00:55:34.761 --> 00:55:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I think a day a week just have at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a fucking slice of pizza who gives</v>

1591
00:55:38.571 --> 00:55:41.000
<v Speaker 2>a shit go to town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

1592
00:55:41.001 --> 00:55:44.240
<v Speaker 2>with a cheat day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think overall refined</v>

1593
00:55:44.241 --> 00:55:49.241
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates just do not seem to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy nor normal thing for your body</v>

1594
00:55:49.521 --> 00:55:50.354
<v Speaker 2>to consume.</v>

1595
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:51.230
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we look at,</v>

1596
00:55:51.231 --> 00:55:52.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>historically,</v>

1597
00:55:52.371 --> 00:55:53.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1598
00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:56.480
<v Speaker 4>we didn't start consuming dairy and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 12,000 years going to start</v>

1599
00:55:56.481 --> 00:55:59.630
<v Speaker 4>farming until about the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those things aren't in living novel.</v>

1600
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:01.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't start eating all this</v>

1601
00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:03.260
<v Speaker 4>processed stuff all about a hundred you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1602
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:06.530
<v Speaker 4>Chris Cole came on in 1910 or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's all that crap we've invented</v>

1603
00:56:06.531 --> 00:56:09.320
<v Speaker 4>in the last century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when the high fructose corn</v>

1604
00:56:09.321 --> 00:56:13.220
<v Speaker 4>syrup came in in the 70s all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>our human body just hasn't evolved for</v>

1605
00:56:13.221 --> 00:56:14.180
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think we're getting,</v>

1606
00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:16.190
<v Speaker 4>we're getting seriously messed up.</v>

1607
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the change in our</v>

1608
00:56:18.551 --> 00:56:20.770
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a corresponding uptick and</v>

1609
00:56:20.771 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 2>diabetes and all sorts of other obesity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and health</v>

1610
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.730
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar and refined carbohydrates tills.</v>

1611
00:56:27.731 --> 00:56:28.690
<v Speaker 3>The two big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were,</v>

1612
00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:32.500
<v Speaker 3>the other debate is whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating all this meat is healthy for you.</v>

1613
00:56:32.501 --> 00:56:35.020
<v Speaker 3>And what about diverticulitis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard about people getting</v>

1614
00:56:35.021 --> 00:56:37.480
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know a d that's what brock</v>

1615
00:56:37.481 --> 00:56:39.700
<v Speaker 3>lesnar got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that they said</v>

1616
00:56:39.701 --> 00:56:41.590
<v Speaker 3>that he got it from just eating mostly</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>

1617
00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is interesting because there's</v>

1618
00:56:42.761 --> 00:56:46.960
<v Speaker 3>actually a gunny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pier e p e r r y did a study in 2014 he</v>

1619
00:56:46.961 --> 00:56:48.910
<v Speaker 3>did colonoscopies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1620
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.850
<v Speaker 3>So he actually looked at people who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first ones to do this and he</v>

1621
00:56:51.851 --> 00:56:54.970
<v Speaker 3>looked at people on these diets and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>found that the people that ate the</v>

1622
00:56:54.971 --> 00:56:59.560
<v Speaker 3>highest amount of fiber and had the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>bowel movements had the most incidents</v>

1623
00:56:59.561 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 3>of diverticulosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So diverticulosis proceeds</v>

1624
00:57:02.081 --> 00:57:04.560
<v Speaker 3>diverticulitis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So diverticulosis,</v>

1625
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 3>a little pouch that shoots out from your</v>
<v Speaker 3>colon.</v>

1626
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:09.040
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a little sack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is that eventually gets</v>

1627
00:57:09.041 --> 00:57:12.970
<v Speaker 3>infected and then you get diverticulitis</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the people that were developing</v>

1628
00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:17.540
<v Speaker 3>diverticulosis and most in his study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did two or three like this show,</v>

1629
00:57:17.541 --> 00:57:18.820
<v Speaker 3>the ones that are reading a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fiber.</v>

1630
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 3>And there's also studies on so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fiber gets caught or somethings that</v>

1631
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:24.010
<v Speaker 3>potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the question is one of the thing</v>

1632
00:57:24.011 --> 00:57:24.970
<v Speaker 3>people don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1633
00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:27.630
<v Speaker 3>cause a lot of people want to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic diets.</v>

1634
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 3>They cut out their fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1635
00:57:28.961 --> 00:57:30.310
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna get all constipated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1636
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:31.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1637
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 3>so basically I haven't had a bowel</v>
<v Speaker 3>movement in a year.</v>

1638
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got Ya.</v>

1639
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.050
<v Speaker 3>That's not true obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so what happens is you just don't</v>

1640
00:57:38.051 --> 00:57:39.270
<v Speaker 3>make anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

1641
00:57:39.271 --> 00:57:41.740
<v Speaker 3>you know all that meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes right into your small</v>

1642
00:57:41.741 --> 00:57:43.810
<v Speaker 3>intestines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absorbs from next to nothing.</v>

1643
00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:45.630
<v Speaker 3>It gets to your colon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it takes,</v>

1644
00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:46.391
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing,</v>

1645
00:57:46.391 --> 00:57:48.430
<v Speaker 3>there's hardly anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can take a little tiny coops.</v>

1646
00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if you're like one of those dudes</v>

1647
00:57:49.881 --> 00:57:51.430
<v Speaker 3>that's backed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even realize it.</v>

1648
00:57:51.431 --> 00:57:53.530
<v Speaker 3>And you got like 20 pounds of on</v>
<v Speaker 3>digestive.</v>

1649
00:57:53.531 --> 00:57:54.880
<v Speaker 3>Is that the always the funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1650
00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:56.740
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that I like John Wayne</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff like that.</v>

1651
00:57:56.741 --> 00:57:58.420
<v Speaker 3>But what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the story?</v>

1652
00:57:58.450 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh well he died with a colon full of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

1653
00:58:00.581 --> 00:58:02.170
<v Speaker 3>but they said it'd be bowling ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1654
00:58:02.171 --> 00:58:02.810
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

1655
00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:04.240
<v Speaker 3>It's probably what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't me.</v>

1656
00:58:04.241 --> 00:58:04.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1657
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.270
<v Speaker 3>look at this Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to the bathroom and you'd a</v>

1658
00:58:07.271 --> 00:58:08.620
<v Speaker 3>bunch of corn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looked down in there.</v>

1659
00:58:08.621 --> 00:58:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes there's some corn floating</v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

1660
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:11.890
<v Speaker 3>When's the last time times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost every time.</v>

1661
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.220
<v Speaker 3>When's the last time you saw a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 3>steak floating around in the toilet bone</v>

1662
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:20.380
<v Speaker 3>to bone that may have your eaten bombs</v>
<v Speaker 3>but meet this doesn't get there.</v>

1663
00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:20.911
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1664
00:58:20.911 --> 00:58:24.160
<v Speaker 3>it's a total myth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when we talk about what causes</v>

1665
00:58:24.161 --> 00:58:26.540
<v Speaker 3>constipation is probably a neurologic</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1666
00:58:26.541 --> 00:58:29.650
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a neuromuscular thinks the</v>
<v Speaker 3>colon is not correct contracting</v>

1667
00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:31.840
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It may have to do with electrolyte</v>

1668
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:34.810
<v Speaker 3>deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It certainly varies depending on my</v>

1669
00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:36.580
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I eat a lot of vegetables,</v>

1670
00:58:36.581 --> 00:58:38.200
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just comes flying out like,</v>

1671
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:40.520
<v Speaker 3>well it's because you just put more in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right,</v>

1672
00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:41.650
<v Speaker 3>so you're not constipated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>

1673
00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:43.750
<v Speaker 3>you're just putting your stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just shoveling more stuff</v>

1674
00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:44.950
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tube is sort of,</v>

1675
00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.470
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like it comes out quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I drink.</v>

1676
00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:50.440
<v Speaker 3>The craziest thing for sure for me is</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kale shakes.</v>

1677
00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:52.870
<v Speaker 3>When I drink Kale shakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>

1678
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hannah.</v>

1679
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Where are you getting about your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1680
00:58:54.971 --> 00:58:56.040
<v Speaker 3>you're getting a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1681
00:58:56.041 --> 00:58:58.210
<v Speaker 3>liquid fibers getting into your colon a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot quick,</v>

1682
00:58:58.211 --> 00:58:59.050
<v Speaker 3>cleans it all out.</v>

1683
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.610
<v Speaker 3>It makes it feel good though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It may be,</v>

1684
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:01.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some people that do it,</v>

1685
00:59:01.481 --> 00:59:04.140
<v Speaker 3>but there's no real prize for the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you,</v>

1686
00:59:04.141 --> 00:59:05.860
<v Speaker 3>at the end of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get an award for</v>

1687
00:59:05.861 --> 00:59:07.570
<v Speaker 3>more having more bowel moments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

1688
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.340
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't shit.</v>

1689
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:10.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1690
00:59:10.211 --> 00:59:11.320
<v Speaker 3>you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1691
00:59:11.321 --> 00:59:13.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm not 100% sure of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>

1692
00:59:13.031 --> 00:59:16.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm not aware of so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that side too again.</v>

1693
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people think that just in all</v>

1694
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.440
<v Speaker 3>seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start seriousness that,</v>

1695
00:59:21.441 --> 00:59:24.470
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>consuming fiber is important for like</v>

1696
00:59:24.471 --> 00:59:27.590
<v Speaker 3>bowel movements and you overall</v>
<v Speaker 3>intestinal health and all that stuff.</v>

1697
00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt.</v>

1698
00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:30.160
<v Speaker 3>The more fiber you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more battles you're going to have.</v>

1699
00:59:30.161 --> 00:59:32.040
<v Speaker 3>But what happens if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get constipated,</v>

1700
00:59:32.041 --> 00:59:34.160
<v Speaker 3>and there's another study about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looked at people with chronic</v>

1701
00:59:34.161 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 3>constipation that were always</v>
<v Speaker 3>constipated and the only thing that</v>

1702
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:39.500
<v Speaker 3>helped them was taking all fiber in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their diet,</v>

1703
00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:41.780
<v Speaker 3>grilling and then there's a study.</v>

1704
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's crazy because that's what</v>

1705
00:59:43.821 --> 00:59:46.730
<v Speaker 3>people like mute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that music is still,</v>

1706
00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:48.470
<v Speaker 3>what does that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>metamucil,</v>

1707
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:50.390
<v Speaker 3>metamucil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that like,</v>

1708
00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:51.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

1709
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what happens is what you have is you</v>

1710
00:59:53.541 --> 00:59:57.080
<v Speaker 3>got a neuromuscular problem where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>colon is not contracting the right way</v>

1711
00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:00.260
<v Speaker 3>and so you're blacked up and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just shove more fiber in there and it</v>

1712
01:00:00.261 --> 01:00:02.510
<v Speaker 3>just fills up more and more and</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually just come.</v>

1713
01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you might be the force it all</v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

1714
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.600
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not,</v>

1715
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.290
<v Speaker 3>you know how that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1716
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:08.210
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1717
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:11.390
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people will say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will tell you there was a lot of</v>

1718
01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 3>people that will tell me fiber just</v>
<v Speaker 3>jacks up their intestines.</v>

1719
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel awful and they'd taken a lot</v>

1720
01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 3>of fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have heard that before.</v>

1721
01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:21.140
<v Speaker 3>When people try five or supplements that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have issues.</v>

1722
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Now do you very due lamb occasionally or</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild game or,</v>

1723
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:27.651
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1724
01:00:27.651 --> 01:00:28.850
<v Speaker 3>depends what's available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1725
01:00:28.851 --> 01:00:30.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty happy with,</v>

1726
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.820
<v Speaker 3>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with beef,</v>

1727
01:00:31.821 --> 01:00:32.660
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was,</v>

1728
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I was in France earlier this year and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had just a bunch of lamb,</v>

1729
01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:35.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1730
01:00:35.991 --> 01:00:37.280
<v Speaker 3>that's easier to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have,</v>

1731
01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:39.110
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they'll have chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1732
01:00:39.111 --> 01:00:39.970
<v Speaker 3>having a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

1733
01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:41.570
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't get any gaming since I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>started this,</v>

1734
01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.550
<v Speaker 3>but I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've eaten elka foreign deer and you</v>

1735
01:00:43.551 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chili's and students,</v>

1736
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:46.010
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1737
01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:46.910
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

1738
01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:48.650
<v Speaker 3>but you don't necessarily eat a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken hot.</v>

1739
01:00:48.651 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:51.130
<v Speaker 3>I just find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

1741
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.850
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people like me to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1742
01:00:52.851 --> 01:00:54.980
<v Speaker 3>They just find chicken is not as</v>
<v Speaker 3>satisfying.</v>

1743
01:00:54.981 --> 01:00:56.600
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not as nutritious,</v>

1744
01:00:56.601 --> 01:00:57.620
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just kind of like,</v>

1745
01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:59.630
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't feel as satisfying when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating it.</v>

1746
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1747
01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:01.220
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably not,</v>

1748
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:02.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just harder to do that.</v>

1749
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm always trying to figure out like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that response that you get when</v>

1750
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:08.700
<v Speaker 3>you slice into a steak and it's juicy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and delicious and you're,</v>

1751
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:10.430
<v Speaker 3>your whole body goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1752
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.920
<v Speaker 3>well I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1753
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:16.450
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a primitive thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes back a hundred thousand years.</v>

1754
01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like,</v>

1755
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:19.970
<v Speaker 3>that's like the point of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1756
01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:21.800
<v Speaker 3>all it's hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did and it's just what,</v>

1757
01:01:21.801 --> 01:01:23.120
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of satisfies?</v>

1758
01:01:23.121 --> 01:01:26.220
<v Speaker 3>It's why I always try to explain to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that the difference between like</v>

1759
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.320
<v Speaker 3>domestic beef versus like a slice of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Moose tenderloin,</v>

1760
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:35.120
<v Speaker 3>like the difference in the richness of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flavor and the darkness of the meat</v>

1761
01:01:35.121 --> 01:01:37.850
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nutrition content of the food is so</v>

1762
01:01:37.851 --> 01:01:41.270
<v Speaker 3>much higher that the [inaudible] is</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher too.</v>

1763
01:01:41.271 --> 01:01:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you slice into and you're like,</v>

1764
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.230
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

1765
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.090
<v Speaker 3>your body's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of that.</v>

1766
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:48.410
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're looking at.</v>

1767
01:01:48.411 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a primal thing.</v>

1768
01:01:49.761 --> 01:01:52.130
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is satisfaction.</v>

1769
01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.240
<v Speaker 3>I know really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1770
01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:56.990
<v Speaker 3>the Vegan army has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got their troops pointed in your</v>

1771
01:01:56.991 --> 01:01:58.280
<v Speaker 3>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1772
01:01:58.310 --> 01:01:59.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1773
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:02.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a bunch of tweets about you and</v>

1774
01:02:02.541 --> 01:02:04.010
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the tweets was,</v>

1779
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:15.540
<v Speaker 3>let's like get that out and try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out what the issue was.</v>

1780
01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:16.161
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1781
01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1782
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.231
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1784
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 3>I'll just go to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my background</v>

1785
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:20.791
<v Speaker 4>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

1786
01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:21.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go to,</v>

1787
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:22.530
<v Speaker 4>I go to medical school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1788
01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 4>I go to a degree in biology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I go to medical school,</v>

1789
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.320
<v Speaker 4>then I dropped out of medical school to</v>
<v Speaker 4>play professional rugby.</v>

1790
01:02:28.321 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had just kind of a crazy,</v>

1791
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:31.740
<v Speaker 4>crazy career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I go into the military and at</v>

1792
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:33.870
<v Speaker 4>launch nuclear bombs for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1793
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five years nuclear bombs.</v>

1794
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a nuclear bomb launch officer</v>

1795
01:02:38.371 --> 01:02:40.740
<v Speaker 4>for about five years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do you still launched nuclear</v>

1796
01:02:40.741 --> 01:02:41.670
<v Speaker 4>bombs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1797
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up in Wyoming and Nebraska and Colorado</v>

1798
01:02:44.941 --> 01:02:46.750
<v Speaker 4>and their taxi detonate them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1799
01:02:46.751 --> 01:02:47.550
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where there,</v>

1800
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:51.010
<v Speaker 4>that's where you shoot them from</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually launch it.</v>

1801
01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.650
<v Speaker 4>But you will work out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was the guy that if we went to war</v>

1802
01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:57.050
<v Speaker 4>and say Donald Trump says we want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>nuke North Korea out of and the guy goes</v>

1803
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.180
<v Speaker 4>moon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a button.</v>

1804
01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:59.310
<v Speaker 4>So I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

1805
01:02:59.311 --> 01:03:02.940
<v Speaker 4>they do all this crazy psychological</v>
<v Speaker 4>screening to make sure you're not some</v>

1806
01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 4>psychopath,</v>

<v Speaker 4>wouldn't let us move,</v>

1845
01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:24.870
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't let us off the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they fly into Kurdistan,</v>

1846
01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:26.870
<v Speaker 4>which is there used to be part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Soviet Union.</v>

1847
01:04:26.871 --> 01:04:28.890
<v Speaker 4>So Union.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we've got a US base in what was</v>

1848
01:04:28.891 --> 01:04:31.680
<v Speaker 4>usually Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we stayed there for one and it's</v>

1849
01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:33.210
<v Speaker 4>freezing cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we,</v>

1850
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.350
<v Speaker 4>then we get on this c one 30 which is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>military plane.</v>

1851
01:04:35.351 --> 01:04:36.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're packed in there with the cargo</v>

1852
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:38.970
<v Speaker 4>and you fly in Afghanistan and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting at just,</v>

1853
01:04:38.971 --> 01:04:40.210
<v Speaker 4>they turn off the lights so that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1854
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.070
<v Speaker 4>hopefully they don't hit you.</v>

1855
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:42.120
<v Speaker 4>They're shooting at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should come in.</v>

1856
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:47.130
<v Speaker 4>So we get in there and then I get off</v>
<v Speaker 4>the plane and they put you in this giant</v>

1857
01:04:47.131 --> 01:04:50.000
<v Speaker 4>hall with like 300 guys on cots first</v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

1858
01:04:50.001 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 4>And then we go to the first day to go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

1859
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're taking over from the army and</v>

1860
01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:56.550
<v Speaker 4>I was in the air force at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're taking over for the arm.</v>

1861
01:04:56.551 --> 01:04:58.290
<v Speaker 4>And the first thing that rolls in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's poor,</v>

<v Speaker 4>full beard.</v>

1866
01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:09.450

<v Speaker 4>would wear beards cause it was so they</v>

1867
01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:10.284
<v Speaker 4>could blend in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1868
01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:13.110
<v Speaker 4>Both legs blown right off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean look like Holy Shit.</v>

1869
01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:13.951
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

1870
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:15.420
<v Speaker 4>this is stuff discount real.</v>

1871
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 4>So every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

1872
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:18.041
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

1873
01:05:18.041 --> 01:05:18.581

<v Speaker 4>trunk.</v>

1874
01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 4>Crazy train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would get people blown up by bombs.</v>

1875
01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean their whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their legs are being on.</v>

1876
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:24.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean the second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>third day we got there,</v>

1877
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:27.280
<v Speaker 4>we had a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a 17 year old kid in his anatomy.</v>

1878
01:05:27.281 --> 01:05:28.570
<v Speaker 4>We were taking care of enemies too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1879
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.240
<v Speaker 4>He setting up a roadside bomb to kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>our guys.</v>

1880
01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:31.601
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's from,</v>

1883
01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.090
<v Speaker 4>blows off one of his arm and most of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>hands.</v>

1884
01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:42.820
<v Speaker 4>So he's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's got nothing left,</v>

1885
01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 4>some are operating on this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do all these operations is basically</v>

1886
01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:47.680
<v Speaker 4>saved the kid's life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though he's an enemy.</v>

1887
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:48.820
<v Speaker 4>Cause there's a physician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>

1888
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.570
<v Speaker 4>that's just your job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens to this guy?</v>

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.070
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we fixed him up and takes us,</v>

1890
01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>month to get him stabilized and they</v>

1891
01:05:56.741 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 4>take them out the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Afghan army just goes and shoots him</v>

1892
01:05:59.051 --> 01:06:01.570
<v Speaker 4>in the head rail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

1893
01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:02.591
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like,</v>

1894
01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 4>what the hell are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1895
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:05.830
<v Speaker 4>it's just like we're doing all this work</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's gotten killed.</v>

1896
01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:08.410
<v Speaker 4>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did that because they knew who he</v>

1897
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.450
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They knew he was an enemy.</v>

1898
01:06:10.451 --> 01:06:11.200
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1899
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.060
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>don't play games.</v>

1901
01:06:13.571 --> 01:06:14.950
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this happened the other way too</v>

1902
01:06:14.951 --> 01:06:16.840
<v Speaker 4>around and we saw that seems like a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of wasted money.</v>

1903
01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:17.980
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a waste.</v>

1904
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.821
<v Speaker 4>It's heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Our rockets are whole ways attached to,</v>

1907
01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's the enemy,</v>

1908
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:28.550
<v Speaker 4>like you're in the military,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's my job to take care of these</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was pretty,</v>

1930
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.780
<v Speaker 4>pretty frustrating.</v>

1931
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 4>So we get in there and there's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like,</v>

1932
01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean little kids were getting these</v>
<v Speaker 4>little kids,</v>

1933
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:10.630
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three year old kids stepping on</v>

1934
01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.250
<v Speaker 4>landmines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>legs blown off.</v>

1935
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:15.730
<v Speaker 4>We had one little three year old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was,</v>

1936
01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:18.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean somebody's drug him behind a</v>

1937
01:07:18.941 --> 01:07:23.110
<v Speaker 4>truck for like a mile and they drug this</v>
<v Speaker 4>kid through the streets to the rough</v>

1938
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:25.870
<v Speaker 4>asphalt street and it legs fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>ripped off.</v>

1939
01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:29.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean as kids road rash actually is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the legs were ripped off.</v>

1940
01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:31.700
<v Speaker 4>He was burned everywhere and we're in</v>
<v Speaker 4>her training and stuff.</v>

1941
01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.540
<v Speaker 4>Why did they do that too?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1942
01:07:33.541 --> 01:07:35.010
<v Speaker 4>Just mad at their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

1943
01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.450
<v Speaker 4>It's just this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not a life friendly place,</v>

1944
01:07:37.451 --> 01:07:38.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

1945
01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.840
<v Speaker 4>life is inconsequential there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy,</v>

1946
01:07:40.841 --> 01:07:42.670
<v Speaker 4>there was our art,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we had a pediatrician who was</v>

1947
01:07:42.671 --> 01:07:44.200
<v Speaker 4>talking to this guy who was a farmer.</v>

1948
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was telling us about his tractor.</v>

1949
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was real proud again to track cause</v>

1950
01:07:48.611 --> 01:07:50.290
<v Speaker 4>real expensive to have a tractor in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1951
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:53.350
<v Speaker 4>So what he would do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because tractors real valuable,</v>

1952
01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:56.390
<v Speaker 4>he would have his kids walk in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tractor so they didn't any</v>

1953
01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:58.450
<v Speaker 4>landmines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1954
01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.920
<v Speaker 4>So if your kid had he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

1955
01:07:59.921 --> 01:08:01.660
<v Speaker 4>I can make another kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't afford it.</v>

1956
01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.680
<v Speaker 4>This is the mentality there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1957
01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.440
<v Speaker 4>it's just God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1958
01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:09.890
<v Speaker 4>I can't even hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1959
01:08:09.891 --> 01:08:11.230
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we get into,</v>

1960
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:14.020
<v Speaker 4>imagine you have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine telling your fucking</v>

1961
01:08:14.021 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 4>kid to walk in front of landmines?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can do it.</v>

1962
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.031
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be,</v>

1963
01:08:17.031 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 4>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be awful.</v>

1964
01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:21.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we get this stuff and then once,</v>

1965
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just gets given gifts.</v>

1966
01:08:22.891 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 4>This keeps getting worse.</v>

1967
01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like every day we get these people</v>

1968
01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:26.660
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1969
01:08:26.661 --> 01:08:28.910
<v Speaker 4>they're blown up and you're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>their hip sock.</v>

1970
01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:29.811
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you let your,</v>

1971
01:08:29.811 --> 01:08:31.860
<v Speaker 4>like a guy's laying there was lake</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely gone.</v>

1972
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:35.090
<v Speaker 4>You can see a spine and his hip socket</v>
<v Speaker 4>day in and day out.</v>

1973
01:08:35.091 --> 01:08:36.410
<v Speaker 4>We're seeing this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get,</v>

1974
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:38.360
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had,</v>

1975
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:40.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one we had,</v>

1976
01:08:40.401 --> 01:08:42.470
<v Speaker 4>so he's had some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember Dick Cheney was the vice</v>

1977
01:08:42.471 --> 01:08:43.160
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1978
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he flies into the base,</v>

1979
01:08:45.651 --> 01:08:47.390
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was supposed to be secret.</v>

1980
01:08:47.391 --> 01:08:50.390
<v Speaker 4>No ones wants to know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Taliban guys found out about it,</v>

1981
01:08:50.391 --> 01:08:53.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what they do is they go to our gate,</v>

1982
01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:56.540
<v Speaker 4>set off a suicide bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they just kill,</v>

1983
01:08:57.170 --> 01:09:00.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tons of people and we get all of these</v>

1984
01:09:00.201 --> 01:09:02.720
<v Speaker 4>casualties and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of them are most immersive</v>

1985
01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:03.261
<v Speaker 4>millions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1986
01:09:03.261 --> 01:09:04.850
<v Speaker 4>So we get all of these civilian</v>
<v Speaker 4>casualties,</v>

1987
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.920
<v Speaker 4>little kids and adults,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1988
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.240
<v Speaker 4>in their suicide vests.</v>

1989
01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.490
<v Speaker 4>They put all these more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1990
01:09:10.491 --> 01:09:11.750
<v Speaker 4>like these metal bearings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1991
01:09:11.751 --> 01:09:15.320
<v Speaker 4>like half inch thick metal bearing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they cover him up and covering them</v>

1992
01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.690
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they get infected and they blow</v>

1993
01:09:17.691 --> 01:09:18.441
<v Speaker 4>through people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1994
01:09:18.441 --> 01:09:21.530
<v Speaker 4>you get people with stuff going into</v>
<v Speaker 4>their brains and shattered bones</v>

01:09:21.531 --> 01:09:22.730
<v Speaker 4>everywhere and all these people that are</v>

<v Speaker 4>this stuff all the time.</v>

1999
01:09:26.601 --> 01:09:29.750
<v Speaker 4>This was the biggest one we had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we were,</v>

2000
01:09:29.751 --> 01:09:31.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we literally 40 hours straight,</v>

2005
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.790
<v Speaker 4>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in the middle of this operation,</v>

<v Speaker 4>we have nine millimeter strapped to us</v>
<v Speaker 4>and were operating,</v>

2018
01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:02.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to move around.</v>

2019
01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.520
<v Speaker 4>It's real small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're sitting in there and they say,</v>

2020
01:10:04.521 --> 01:10:07.130
<v Speaker 4>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think there's another bomber inside</v>

2021
01:10:07.131 --> 01:10:09.350
<v Speaker 4>the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2022
01:10:09.351 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 4>in the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people off.</v>

2023
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:12.560
<v Speaker 4>So you're sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2024
01:10:12.561 --> 01:10:13.970
<v Speaker 4>your butthole tightens up and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2025
01:10:13.971 --> 01:10:15.260
<v Speaker 4>well fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to keep operating.</v>

2026
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:16.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I'm trying to save this guy's</v>

2027
01:10:16.311 --> 01:10:18.050
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we keep,</v>

2028
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:19.760
<v Speaker 4>we just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we're going to go and we're going</v>

2029
01:10:19.761 --> 01:10:20.600
<v Speaker 4>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2030
01:10:20.601 --> 01:10:21.720
<v Speaker 4>So we just keep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2031
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:23.960
<v Speaker 4>we keep operating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fortunately they didn't,</v>

2032
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:25.640
<v Speaker 4>they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't find because they thought I</v>

2033
01:10:25.641 --> 01:10:27.350
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody snuck in has a casualty.</v>

2034
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.100
<v Speaker 4>So they sometimes do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They blow people up and then they'd</v>

2035
01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:32.000
<v Speaker 4>sneak in as a casualty and blow more</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2036
01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.001
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2037
01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:36.500
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of freaky and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2038
01:10:36.501 --> 01:10:38.770
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what an insane environment.</v>

2039
01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.460
<v Speaker 4>How long were you there for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six months.</v>

2040
01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:42.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2041
01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.150
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>

2042
01:10:44.151 --> 01:10:46.220
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2043
01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get out of there and you know,</v>

2044
01:10:48.141 --> 01:10:50.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just a email is a tremendous</v>

2045
01:10:50.361 --> 01:10:51.590
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was just like,</v>

2046
01:10:51.591 --> 01:10:54.470
<v Speaker 4>cause there was nothing I could see that</v>
<v Speaker 4>after that there was like,</v>

2047
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.260
<v Speaker 4>that ain't nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything I saw after that,</v>

2048
01:10:56.261 --> 01:10:58.250
<v Speaker 4>another sergeant was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is no big deal.</v>

2049
01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:01.280
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I get out and then I,</v>

2050
01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:02.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get out of the military,</v>

2051
01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:04.760
<v Speaker 4>do another five years is taking care of</v>
<v Speaker 4>normal guys in the military.</v>

2052
01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:05.594
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't do it.</v>

2053
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:07.160
<v Speaker 4>You take your troops and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2054
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.680
<v Speaker 4>Doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked for all these other hospitals</v>

2055
01:11:09.681 --> 01:11:10.220
<v Speaker 4>and did fine.</v>

2056
01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.590
<v Speaker 4>I never had any problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I get to this other hospital</v>

2057
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.041
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2058
01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:16.110
<v Speaker 4>I joined this group and they make me the</v>
<v Speaker 4>head of the group.</v>

2059
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of group?</v>

2060
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 4>It's just like an orthopedic surgery</v>
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>

2061
01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:21.090
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there when I got there,</v>

2062
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:25.560
<v Speaker 4>they were like two guys and they weren't</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing hardly any business at all.</v>

2063
01:11:25.561 --> 01:11:28.110
<v Speaker 4>I was like really slow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one knew they were there.</v>

2064
01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were in part of his big huge group,</v>

2065
01:11:30.121 --> 01:11:32.010
<v Speaker 4>had all these other doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't even know they existed.</v>

2066
01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:33.690
<v Speaker 4>So I got there and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is crap.</v>

2067
01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.060
<v Speaker 4>And one of the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause no one was seeing anything that</v>

2068
01:11:36.061 --> 01:11:37.980
<v Speaker 4>would refuse all these patients.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got there and I said,</v>

2069
01:11:37.981 --> 01:11:40.410
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go talk to all these other</v>

2070
01:11:40.411 --> 01:11:44.790
<v Speaker 4>doctors and let him know we're alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're here and that we're going to</v>

2071
01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:47.320
<v Speaker 4>see anything you want to send us and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll take care of it.</v>

2072
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 4>If we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll make sure it gets taken care of</v>

2073
01:11:48.931 --> 01:11:50.910
<v Speaker 4>the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that happened and we started growing,</v>

2074
01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:54.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we went from two guys to 12 guys and</v>

2075
01:11:54.121 --> 01:11:55.860
<v Speaker 4>about three years and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we were very,</v>

2076
01:11:55.861 --> 01:11:59.370
<v Speaker 4>very busy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Real busy group in the rival group from</v>

2077
01:11:59.371 --> 01:12:00.960
<v Speaker 4>out of town,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from across the street.</v>

2078
01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:04.860
<v Speaker 4>Didn't really like it that much because</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were taking millions of dollars from,</v>

2079
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:06.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean tens of millions of dollars in</v>
<v Speaker 4>their business,</v>

2080
01:12:06.901 --> 01:12:09.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's orthopedic surgery is very,</v>

2081
01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:11.850
<v Speaker 4>very lucrative for a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's things like cardiology where</v>

2082
01:12:11.851 --> 01:12:16.851
<v Speaker 4>they're putting in stents and surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these procedure based practices make</v>

2083
01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.320
<v Speaker 4>a lot of money for hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they really like it,</v>

2084
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're really happy and they're</v>

2085
01:12:21.361 --> 01:12:22.500
<v Speaker 4>happy with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like the,</v>

2086
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:24.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to hear them right?</v>

2087
01:12:24.211 --> 01:12:24.841
<v Speaker 4>Cause they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2088
01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.450
<v Speaker 4>you're making us a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The group Cross town doesn't like me</v>

2089
01:12:27.451 --> 01:12:29.150
<v Speaker 4>very much because I'm taking all their</v>
<v Speaker 4>money away.</v>

2090
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.710
<v Speaker 4>So they approached us and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2091
01:12:31.711 --> 01:12:33.510
<v Speaker 4>why don't you join our group and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2092
01:12:33.511 --> 01:12:34.470
<v Speaker 4>we'll take care of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

2093
01:12:34.471 --> 01:12:35.430
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do that.</v>

2094
01:12:35.431 --> 01:12:36.930
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to my partners did,</v>

2095
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.820
<v Speaker 4>they eventually left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm the only holdout guy,</v>

2096
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:41.010
<v Speaker 4>but I'm still going up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So building the group.</v>

2097
01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:43.290
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm like the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like the head of the snake,</v>

2098
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:44.124
<v Speaker 4>the rival.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2099
01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.590
<v Speaker 4>But here's what kind of happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm busy,</v>

2100
01:12:46.591 --> 01:12:48.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my patients are happy,</v>

2101
01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:50.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing really well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got low real low complication</v>

2102
01:12:50.311 --> 01:12:51.770
<v Speaker 4>rates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2103
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:52.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's,</v>

2104
01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very popular.</v>

2105
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:55.520
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on billboards,</v>

2106
01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:58.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm on magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on radios,</v>

2107
01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:58.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2108
01:12:58.961 --> 01:12:59.331
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2109
01:12:59.331 --> 01:13:00.164
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just there.</v>

2110
01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 4>Posterboard basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2111
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:06.360
<v Speaker 4>So then as I found with my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started seeing patients getting better</v>

2112
01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:07.350
<v Speaker 4>by just changing her diet.</v>

2113
01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:09.640
<v Speaker 4>And when you look in the orthopedics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2114
01:13:09.641 --> 01:13:11.040
<v Speaker 4>like bone disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like arthritis,</v>

2115
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:13.260
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing about died in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2116
01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:15.960
<v Speaker 4>you were studying about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If somebody comes into your office,</v>

2117
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:17.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll tell him,</v>

2118
01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can give you some tylenol,</v>

2119
01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.960
<v Speaker 4>we can give them you some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2120
01:13:21.961 --> 01:13:23.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and other anti inflammatory drug we can,</v>

2121
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.360
<v Speaker 4>we can sit some cortisone in your knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2122
01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:27.360
<v Speaker 4>if that doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we'll,</v>

2123
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll fence to send you to physical</v>

2124
01:13:28.561 --> 01:13:30.630
<v Speaker 4>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We might put a scope in there and have</v>

2125
01:13:30.631 --> 01:13:31.940
<v Speaker 4>none of that works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2126
01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:33.390
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is an end stage and we're going to</v>

2127
01:13:33.391 --> 01:13:34.350
<v Speaker 4>replace your knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2128
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.510
<v Speaker 4>So what I was finding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2129
01:13:36.511 --> 01:13:40.290
<v Speaker 4>as I started doing this with patients is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that these patients are getting better</v>

2130
01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:42.210
<v Speaker 4>just by changing or not putting him on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic diet.</v>

2131
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:43.470
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at that time I was doing Quito.</v>

2132
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:44.820
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

2133
01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:46.800
<v Speaker 4>try this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So mine in my nurse and I had this,</v>

2134
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:48.120
<v Speaker 4>and this is one of the things that kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2135
01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:52.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm very jaded about the way the</v>
<v Speaker 4>business side of medicine is.</v>

2136
01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.160
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this has been a pretty,</v>

2137
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.020
<v Speaker 4>pretty interesting experience for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had a nurse,</v>

2138
01:13:55.021 --> 01:13:57.780
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean she was a wonderful person.</v>

2139
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:00.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean the nicest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweetest gal in the world.</v>

2140
01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 4>She would work so hard for these</v>
<v Speaker 4>patients.</v>

2141
01:14:02.341 --> 01:14:03.081
<v Speaker 4>You take care of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2142
01:14:03.081 --> 01:14:04.350
<v Speaker 4>anything you need done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tell her,</v>

2143
01:14:04.351 --> 01:14:06.240
<v Speaker 4>hey take care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she was just awesome,</v>

2144
01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:09.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hospital said you're staying in too</v>

2145
01:14:09.181 --> 01:14:10.560
<v Speaker 4>late and we're having to pay you over</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2146
01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:11.140
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2147
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.380
<v Speaker 4>taking care of patients.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we don't care who,</v>

2148
01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:14.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you to work late because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>costs us too much money.</v>

2149
01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.450
<v Speaker 4>So it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was of these things where you're</v>

2150
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:17.410
<v Speaker 4>starting to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2151
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.270
<v Speaker 4>it's all about the money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we were like,</v>

2152
01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.910
<v Speaker 4>so all these surgeons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a surgeon,</v>

2153
01:14:21.911 --> 01:14:23.800
<v Speaker 4>you get used to using certain equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2154
01:14:23.801 --> 01:14:24.810
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2155
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:26.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm using this particular thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to replace people,</v>

2156
01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:29.230
<v Speaker 4>joints and you do it for years and years</v>
<v Speaker 4>and years and you get pretty good at it.</v>

2157
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:31.450
<v Speaker 4>And so at the hospital said is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2158
01:14:31.451 --> 01:14:34.120
<v Speaker 4>we got a bargain deal with this other</v>
<v Speaker 4>company so your guys are going to use</v>

2159
01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:35.310
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2160
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:35.861
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2161
01:14:35.861 --> 01:14:37.090
<v Speaker 4>we don't want to use that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've learned how to do this,</v>

2162
01:14:37.091 --> 01:14:40.300
<v Speaker 4>won't even how to use that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they force everybody to do this,</v>

2163
01:14:40.301 --> 01:14:41.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to say,</v>

2164
01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:43.390
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some new surgical equipment,</v>

2165
01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:44.224
<v Speaker 4>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2166
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.060
<v Speaker 4>Well basically you know there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

2167
01:14:46.061 --> 01:14:48.190
<v Speaker 4>it's like if you drive a Ford truck your</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole life,</v>

2168
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:50.140
<v Speaker 4>you know they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand what you're saying.</v>

2169
01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.011
<v Speaker 4>And then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2170
01:14:51.011 --> 01:14:52.090
<v Speaker 4>you're going to grab Chevy now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2171
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:53.840
<v Speaker 4>but this is surgical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is third semester.</v>

2172
01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.380
<v Speaker 4>This is sort of the whole reason is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to save me money.</v>

2173
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:59.310
<v Speaker 4>All the scraps were pitching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ones guys were already using them.</v>

2174
01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:00.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is the other group.</v>

2175
01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 4>We don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But our group was like,</v>

2176
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 4>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we use this stuff,</v>

2177
01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:04.331
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2178
01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:05.680
<v Speaker 4>it's stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't even know how to use this guy.</v>

2179
01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.360
<v Speaker 4>You're not adapting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not adapting.</v>

2180
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:09.040
<v Speaker 4>You're going to compromise patient care</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit.</v>

2181
01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:10.360
<v Speaker 4>For this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2182
01:15:10.361 --> 01:15:12.670
<v Speaker 4>this is one of those things where I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was very vocal against this.</v>

2183
01:15:12.671 --> 01:15:13.390
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2184
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.841
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2185
01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:15.350
<v Speaker 4>this is [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

2186
01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.590
<v Speaker 4>this is what we're trained on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2187
01:15:17.591 --> 01:15:19.060
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna end up,</v>

2188
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.140
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2189
01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:21.310
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna be patients are going to</v>

2190
01:15:21.311 --> 01:15:22.720
<v Speaker 4>be problematic from this stuff.</v>

2191
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:26.980
<v Speaker 4>So that was an aside thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there was a system where it's</v>

2192
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.240
<v Speaker 4>another thing they put in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2193
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:29.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the one thing that all</v>

2194
01:15:29.381 --> 01:15:31.690
<v Speaker 4>physicians hate this thing called an</v>
<v Speaker 4>electronic medical record.</v>

2195
01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:34.750
<v Speaker 4>He was a computer based record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that it's a computer based thing,</v>

2196
01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:37.660
<v Speaker 4>but they're awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they sit there and their main</v>

2197
01:15:37.661 --> 01:15:40.810
<v Speaker 4>function is to collect billing and to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>coding.</v>

2198
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:43.930
<v Speaker 4>So it's a capture as much information as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can so you can build more.</v>

2199
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.441
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2200
01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:47.140
<v Speaker 4>that's you know why hospital and liked</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2201
01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:49.840
<v Speaker 4>So they puts us on you and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2202
01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:51.370
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like really hard to take,</v>

2203
01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:53.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to put good information there.</v>

2204
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:55.760
<v Speaker 4>Cause all it is to generate a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>data that's totally illogical.</v>

2205
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:56.291
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

2206
01:15:56.291 --> 01:15:59.430
<v Speaker 4>you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you get 20 pages of Bs and</v>

2207
01:15:59.450 --> 01:16:00.940
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two paragraphs of stuff you need.</v>

2208
01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So where did it all go bad?</v>

2209
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.200
<v Speaker 4>So then we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so basically what happened is when I</v>

2210
01:16:05.201 --> 01:16:08.140
<v Speaker 4>started telling peach people I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to,</v>

2211
01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:08.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm tardy,</v>

2212
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:10.690
<v Speaker 4>I started talking to people out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgery,</v>

2213
01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started saying,</v>

2214
01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:15.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you need surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I started talking to the</v>

2215
01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.270
<v Speaker 4>administrators and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey guys,</v>

2216
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:20.800
<v Speaker 4>I really want to spend a day a week just</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing lifestyle counseling.</v>

2217
01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:21.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2218
01:16:21.761 --> 01:16:23.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2219
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.750
<v Speaker 4>constantly do this cause I think this</v>
<v Speaker 4>can work resentful.</v>

2220
01:16:25.751 --> 01:16:28.390
<v Speaker 4>You making the cutting motion like it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>costly surgery.</v>

2221
01:16:28.391 --> 01:16:28.930
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

2222
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:30.070
<v Speaker 4>and they are basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2223
01:16:30.071 --> 01:16:31.960
<v Speaker 4>there's no appetite for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your skill as a surgeon,</v>

2224
01:16:31.961 --> 01:16:32.890
<v Speaker 4>we want you there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2225
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:34.840
<v Speaker 4>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep making us a lot of money,</v>

2226
01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:36.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>

2227
01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2228
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:38.980
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my nurse will take him and I was</v>

2229
01:16:38.981 --> 01:16:41.890
<v Speaker 4>printing out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made a list of all his reading.</v>

2230
01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:42.551
<v Speaker 4>You remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Gary,</v>

2231
01:16:42.551 --> 01:16:43.840
<v Speaker 4>I know he had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gary Thompson denied,</v>

2232
01:16:43.841 --> 01:16:47.730
<v Speaker 4>had his book and I had Nina Teicholz his</v>
<v Speaker 4>book on and I had just got him</v>

2233
01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:49.030
<v Speaker 4>butterball up rigs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2234
01:16:49.031 --> 01:16:51.160
<v Speaker 4>all these key to Janneke things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>references.</v>

2235
01:16:51.161 --> 01:16:54.580
<v Speaker 4>And I was handing them out 2025 of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>every single day.</v>

2236
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:56.350
<v Speaker 4>And I was spending time with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>patients,</v>

2237
01:16:56.351 --> 01:16:57.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because normally you'd only get like</v>

2238
01:16:57.551 --> 01:16:59.020
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight minutes to see a patient,</v>

2239
01:16:59.021 --> 01:16:59.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>figured out the problem,</v>

2240
01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.390
<v Speaker 4>figuring out a plan and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

2241
01:17:01.391 --> 01:17:02.224
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2242
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:04.720
<v Speaker 4>now spending 20 minutes talking to these</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys about diet.</v>

2243
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.741
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2244
01:17:05.741 --> 01:17:07.780
<v Speaker 4>then I'm seeing less patients in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hospital keeps saying,</v>

2245
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2246
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:10.790
<v Speaker 4>we don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't really like that.</v>

2247
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.130
<v Speaker 4>So because I was ahead of the group and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was well liked by everybody,</v>

2248
01:17:16.150 --> 01:17:18.350
<v Speaker 4>I had really good patient records.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2249
01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:19.430
<v Speaker 4>really good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2250
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:20.740
<v Speaker 4>patient satisfaction.</v>

2251
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.120
<v Speaker 4>You'll really low complication rates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2252
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:23.954
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

2253
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.801
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't like that.</v>

2254
01:17:24.801 --> 01:17:27.110
<v Speaker 4>So then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something called Peer Review,</v>

2255
01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:28.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they can just pull your records and</v>

2256
01:17:28.761 --> 01:17:31.010
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't like the way you did this.</v>

2257
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:33.020
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna,</v>

2258
01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:33.891
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna,</v>

2259
01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:37.310
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna criticize your work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they did that and they went</v>

2260
01:17:37.311 --> 01:17:39.080
<v Speaker 4>through there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is one of the things they said,</v>

2261
01:17:39.081 --> 01:17:42.050
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every surgeon will have x amount of</v>

2262
01:17:42.051 --> 01:17:42.950
<v Speaker 4>complications,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2263
01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:43.671
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2264
01:17:43.671 --> 01:17:45.110
<v Speaker 4>if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2265
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred surgeries,</v>

2266
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.090
<v Speaker 4>about 5% of the time there's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>some complications.</v>

2267
01:17:50.091 --> 01:17:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Somebody is going to get an infection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some he's going to bleed too much.</v>

2268
01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna get a blood clot off as</v>
<v Speaker 4>an orthopedic surgeon.</v>

2269
01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.680
<v Speaker 4>Maybe one of the screws you put in</v>
<v Speaker 4>breaks or something.</v>

2270
01:17:57.681 --> 01:18:00.470
<v Speaker 4>Like those things are all complication</v>
<v Speaker 4>that happens to everybody no matter</v>

2271
01:18:00.471 --> 01:18:01.304
<v Speaker 4>what.</v>

2272
01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:05.030
<v Speaker 4>So what they said is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a low threshold,</v>

2273
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like a,</v>

2274
01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:08.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to say every year we're</v>

2275
01:18:08.031 --> 01:18:10.730
<v Speaker 4>going to give you two complications that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were your fault,</v>

2276
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause most of the time you have a</v>

2277
01:18:12.171 --> 01:18:13.500
<v Speaker 4>complication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like mentors,</v>

2278
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:15.650
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could've done equipment failure or</v>

2279
01:18:15.651 --> 01:18:16.251
<v Speaker 4>slow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll say,</v>

2280
01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:18.060
<v Speaker 4>you made the wrong decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That liberal complicates.</v>

2281
01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.940
<v Speaker 4>So they'll say you can get to a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2282
01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:24.650
<v Speaker 4>And it doesn't matter if you do a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred surgeries a year or you do 500</v>

2283
01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:26.510
<v Speaker 4>surgeries a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the numbers still too.</v>

2284
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:27.920
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

2285
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:29.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I,</v>

2286
01:18:29.441 --> 01:18:32.120
<v Speaker 4>cause I was there for like five years</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like every year was like one,</v>

2287
01:18:32.121 --> 01:18:32.781
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2288
01:18:32.781 --> 01:18:34.180
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just nothing minimal.</v>

2289
01:18:34.181 --> 01:18:35.210
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One year,</v>

2290
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:37.160
<v Speaker 4>one year they go back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you had three this year?</v>

2291
01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.001
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2292
01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:40.160
<v Speaker 4>but I did five times as many surgeries</v>
<v Speaker 4>than anybody else.</v>

2293
01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:41.420
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it doesn't matter.</v>

2294
01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.830
<v Speaker 4>We're going to work and still put it</v>
<v Speaker 4>through peer review.</v>

2295
01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.800
<v Speaker 4>So what they do is they hire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember this other group that I was</v>

2296
01:18:45.801 --> 01:18:48.320
<v Speaker 4>pissing off and it's taken $10 million a</v>
<v Speaker 4>year from,</v>

2297
01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.680
<v Speaker 4>they hire their guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy to look through my stuff.</v>

2298
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.200
<v Speaker 4>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that's what they wanted to do.</v>

2299
01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:57.560
<v Speaker 4>But why would they do that if that</v>
<v Speaker 4>person on that other side is the</v>

2300
01:18:57.561 --> 01:19:00.290
<v Speaker 4>competition?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he was in the position to do it.</v>

2301
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2302
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.780
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not supposed to have it.</v>

2303
01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:05.720
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like if you were a ability for</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy and said,</v>

2304
01:19:05.721 --> 01:19:07.940
<v Speaker 4>I want the Bella tour guide to review</v>
<v Speaker 4>the UFC.</v>

2305
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.490
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Joe Rogan sucks is an announcer.</v>

2306
01:19:10.491 --> 01:19:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm have a billet military guy go after</v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

2307
01:19:12.621 --> 01:19:14.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's total conflict of interest,</v>

2308
01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:15.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

2309
01:19:15.471 --> 01:19:16.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in,</v>

2310
01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:18.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm like this naive ethical guide.</v>

2311
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:19.161
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2312
01:19:19.161 --> 01:19:22.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I could care and reasons for</v>

2313
01:19:22.041 --> 01:19:23.960
<v Speaker 4>doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2314
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:25.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2315
01:19:25.431 --> 01:19:26.241
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2316
01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:26.841
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2317
01:19:26.841 --> 01:19:28.960
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they get it back and the guy,</v>

2318
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.250
<v Speaker 4>and they looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they looked at a dozen cases or they've</v>

2319
01:19:31.251 --> 01:19:31.801
<v Speaker 4>selected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2320
01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:33.380
<v Speaker 4>so like you pick whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>

2321
01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:34.220
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

2322
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I think six these cases were below</v>
<v Speaker 4>average.</v>

2323
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:37.580
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the way you documented</v>

2324
01:19:37.581 --> 01:19:39.140
<v Speaker 4>stuff and this and I disagree what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

2325
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:40.221
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

2326
01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:40.851
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2327
01:19:40.851 --> 01:19:41.900
<v Speaker 4>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2328
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:43.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2329
01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:44.001
<v Speaker 4>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2330
01:19:44.001 --> 01:19:45.540
<v Speaker 4>what do I need to stop operating?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone who said,</v>

2331
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.921
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2332
01:19:45.921 --> 01:19:46.340
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2333
01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:47.340
<v Speaker 4>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2334
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.490
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna do is we're going to get an</v>
<v Speaker 4>independent review,</v>

2335
01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.590
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is supposed to be someone with</v>

2336
01:19:51.591 --> 01:19:53.030
<v Speaker 4>no conflicts of interest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2337
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:58.630
<v Speaker 4>So the way this this is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen is that they were supposed to let</v>

2338
01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:02.450
<v Speaker 4>me see what the cases are and put my</v>
<v Speaker 4>comments in there,</v>

2339
01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:04.580
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were supposedly supposed to be</v>

2340
01:20:04.581 --> 01:20:07.160
<v Speaker 4>totally in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what they did and did instead is they</v>

2341
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't let me know any</v>

2342
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.280
<v Speaker 3>of the cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They told me you can't see anything.</v>

2343
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:14.850
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy that had the conflicts of</v>

2344
01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:17.880
<v Speaker 3>interest that gave him all of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>findings and send them to this guy.</v>

2345
01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this guy and I,</v>

2346
01:20:19.891 --> 01:20:20.491
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2347
01:20:20.491 --> 01:20:21.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the situation where this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

2348
01:20:21.751 --> 01:20:24.120
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found this out about six months later,</v>

2349
01:20:24.121 --> 01:20:27.150
<v Speaker 3>he is either senile or totally drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was just like,</v>

2350
01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he gets this report,</v>

2351
01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:30.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just bad.</v>

2352
01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:33.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks really bad and I'll talk about</v>

2353
01:20:33.241 --> 01:20:35.490
<v Speaker 3>some of the details in a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just looks really bad.</v>

2354
01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.290
<v Speaker 3>And they come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pull me in the office and say,</v>

2355
01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:39.390
<v Speaker 3>we got this really bad enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>independent report,</v>

2356
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:41.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2357
01:20:41.371 --> 01:20:44.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what cases where we can't tell you but</v>

2358
01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:46.320
<v Speaker 3>it's really bad and we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to suspend you privileges.</v>

2359
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.490
<v Speaker 3>We're not gonna let you work here</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2360
01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:50.760
<v Speaker 3>So essentially what you're trying to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>is they targeted you and they targeted</v>

2361
01:20:50.761 --> 01:20:54.510
<v Speaker 3>you because you were changing what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing and you were trying to</v>

2362
01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:59.540
<v Speaker 3>counsel people with lifestyle and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to pick on you and try to find</v>

2363
01:21:00.361 --> 01:21:03.210
<v Speaker 3>things that were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of the past surgeries that you</v>

2364
01:21:03.211 --> 01:21:04.890
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a combination.</v>

2365
01:21:04.891 --> 01:21:06.260
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a combination of</v>
<v Speaker 3>income,</v>

2366
01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:07.590
<v Speaker 3>no problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not,</v>

2367
01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:09.030
<v Speaker 3>some people weren't doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>intentionally,</v>

2368
01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:10.910
<v Speaker 3>but there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was definitely a,</v>

2369
01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.780
<v Speaker 3>possibly some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of that going on.</v>

2370
01:21:12.781 --> 01:21:17.460
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they get this report and the guy,</v>

2371
01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:18.271
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two people,</v>

2372
01:21:18.271 --> 01:21:20.040
<v Speaker 3>they bring me in the office say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2373
01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:21.840
<v Speaker 3>we're going to shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't go to your clinic.</v>

2374
01:21:21.841 --> 01:21:24.890
<v Speaker 3>You can't talk to anybody you work with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to deny you access to all</v>

2375
01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:25.733
<v Speaker 3>clinic charts.</v>

2376
01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:27.840
<v Speaker 3>We're going to shut off your email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't look at anything.</v>

2377
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2378
01:21:29.011 --> 01:21:30.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I just committed murder.</v>

2379
01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm some pariah and then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the guy and I'm like,</v>

2380
01:21:33.601 --> 01:21:34.434
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2381
01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like something like kid just</v>
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

2382
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something I spent my whole life</v>

2383
01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:39.930
<v Speaker 3>training for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2384
01:21:39.931 --> 01:21:42.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

2385
01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:43.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2386
01:21:43.651 --> 01:21:45.730
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're like days and</v>
<v Speaker 3>confusion,</v>

2387
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:46.490
<v Speaker 3>numb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2388
01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:47.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm like numb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2389
01:21:47.521 --> 01:21:48.354
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2390
01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:51.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to drive my fucking car off a</v>

2391
01:21:51.151 --> 01:21:51.781
<v Speaker 3>cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2392
01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:53.310
<v Speaker 3>you're like suicidal almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2393
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.260
<v Speaker 3>So the guy comes to me and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2394
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:57.660
<v Speaker 3>we got this really bad stuff on you is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go really bad.</v>

2395
01:21:57.661 --> 01:21:59.310
<v Speaker 3>We're going to take it to a committee</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a couple of days.</v>

2396
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.770
<v Speaker 3>And I think the best thing you can do is</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say,</v>

2397
01:22:01.771 --> 01:22:02.880
<v Speaker 3>you're sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write a letter.</v>

2398
01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll even help you write this letter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2399
01:22:04.771 --> 01:22:05.810
<v Speaker 3>basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>confess it to you,</v>

2400
01:22:05.811 --> 01:22:07.500
<v Speaker 3>did the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

2401
01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:09.480
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a lawyer at the time and</v>

2402
01:22:09.481 --> 01:22:10.291
<v Speaker 3>didn't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

2403
01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:11.101
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do this.</v>

2404
01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:13.230
<v Speaker 3>And so I write this letter saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2405
01:22:13.710 --> 01:22:15.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably could have done no stuff</v>

2406
01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:16.220
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno what the cases were,</v>

2407
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:19.590
<v Speaker 3>but probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you're saying this without even</v>

2408
01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.200
<v Speaker 3>have reviewed the cases that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>condemning you on?</v>

2409
01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was fuck did you not get a</v>

2410
01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:26.070
<v Speaker 3>lawyer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did afterwards,</v>

2411
01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.420
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know,</v>

2412
01:22:27.421 --> 01:22:29.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd been a straight laced ethical guy my</v>

2413
01:22:29.431 --> 01:22:32.040
<v Speaker 3>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you did afterwards the lawyer go</v>

2414
01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:35.160
<v Speaker 3>back and look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the confession or whatever you would</v>

2415
01:22:35.161 --> 01:22:36.100
<v Speaker 3>call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she says,</v>

2416
01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:39.300
<v Speaker 3>well this is preposterous because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even talking about a specific case.</v>

2417
01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Well she said it was probably something</v>
<v Speaker 3>he shouldn't have done and I would have</v>

2418
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Kelsey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this guy was on the committee that</v>

2419
01:22:44.221 --> 01:22:45.310
<v Speaker 3>condemn me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2420
01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.220
<v Speaker 3>So this is a guy that's honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they set you up.</v>

2421
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:50.400
<v Speaker 3>So in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is what I want to say that</v>

2422
01:22:50.410 --> 01:22:51.900
<v Speaker 3>because you still wanting to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor.</v>

2423
01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is,</v>

2424
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:56.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so basically they'd take this committee,</v>

2425
01:22:56.011 --> 01:22:57.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they hand this report.</v>

2426
01:22:58.110 --> 01:23:00.480
<v Speaker 3>It says all this bad stuff and the hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my confession,</v>

2427
01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:01.510
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is all I,</v>

2428
01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:02.940
<v Speaker 3>this is basically what they have to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2429
01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 3>No one knows anything about the cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this</v>

2430
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.170
<v Speaker 4>is all these people that are doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not surgeons.</v>

2431
01:23:08.171 --> 01:23:09.370
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All they are is,</v>

2432
01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:12.130
<v Speaker 4>it would be like if you were reviewing</v>
<v Speaker 4>mma guys,</v>

2433
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:13.840
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's say you want to kick somebody</v>

2434
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 4>out of the UFC because you said it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>performance isn't up to snuff.</v>

2435
01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:19.600
<v Speaker 4>And you went to a much a tennis players</v>
<v Speaker 4>and golfers and said,</v>

2436
01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.620
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't think he hasn't his take 10% it</v>

2437
01:23:22.621 --> 01:23:24.180
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I see what I'm saying.</v>

2438
01:23:24.181 --> 01:23:26.120
<v Speaker 4>So these people have no frigging clue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2439
01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.720
<v Speaker 4>They have no clue about what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have specific cases to go</v>

2440
01:23:29.721 --> 01:23:31.690
<v Speaker 4>specific cases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not allowed to talk about this</v>

2441
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:35.230
<v Speaker 4>cause I don't know the specific cases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I railroad job.</v>

2442
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.990
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then I,</v>

2443
01:23:37.991 --> 01:23:38.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2444
01:23:38.361 --> 01:23:40.450
<v Speaker 4>I kind of will come out of this haze and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked and I said,</v>

2445
01:23:40.451 --> 01:23:41.980
<v Speaker 4>we'll give you a fair hearing.</v>

2446
01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:45.160
<v Speaker 4>Says what they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A fear of federal law requires us to</v>

2447
01:23:45.161 --> 01:23:46.360
<v Speaker 4>give you a fair hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2448
01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:50.170
<v Speaker 4>So I get a lawyer and this is expensive</v>
<v Speaker 4>as shit,</v>

2449
01:23:50.171 --> 01:23:50.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

2450
01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:52.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't have an income anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm spending all this money in the</v>

2451
01:23:52.621 --> 01:23:55.870
<v Speaker 4>lawyers fees and it's taken the hospital</v>
<v Speaker 4>to drags out.</v>

2452
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:58.030
<v Speaker 4>They won't release records for like six</v>
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>

2453
01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:01.540
<v Speaker 4>So six months goes by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean here I got four small kids.</v>

2454
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:02.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

2455
01:24:02.891 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 4>am I going to feed my kid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My kids are in school like one autistic</v>

2456
01:24:05.351 --> 01:24:07.510
<v Speaker 4>son and he's therapy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

2457
01:24:07.511 --> 01:24:08.510
<v Speaker 4>this is tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2458
01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.840
<v Speaker 4>so going through this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so six months ago,</v>

2459
01:24:10.841 --> 01:24:13.570
<v Speaker 4>the layer and then I finally get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cases right and I started looking</v>

2460
01:24:13.571 --> 01:24:15.070
<v Speaker 4>through the cases and what the guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote.</v>

2461
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:19.780
<v Speaker 4>And not only are there errors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are egregious errors and there's</v>

2462
01:24:19.781 --> 01:24:21.340
<v Speaker 4>multiple when they're just horrible.</v>

2463
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:22.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just so wrong.</v>

2464
01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:23.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2465
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:25.240
<v Speaker 4>that's why I said the guy has seen her</v>
<v Speaker 4>drunk.</v>

2466
01:24:25.241 --> 01:24:28.420
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you a couple of examples and</v>
<v Speaker 4>any orthopedic surgeons is listening to</v>

2467
01:24:28.421 --> 01:24:30.160
<v Speaker 4>us know immediately what I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

2468
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:31.840
<v Speaker 4>But I'll try and make it make sense for</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people.</v>

2469
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.810
<v Speaker 4>So the of these 12 cases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two of them were something called a</v>

2470
01:24:34.811 --> 01:24:37.000
<v Speaker 4>reverse shoulder replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is,</v>

2471
01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:38.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you showed a word's out,</v>

2472
01:24:38.351 --> 01:24:39.760
<v Speaker 4>you can replace your shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2473
01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:43.540
<v Speaker 4>Just shoulder replacements on people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you put in there?</v>

2474
01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:45.460
<v Speaker 4>Like some sort of an artificial joint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2475
01:24:45.461 --> 01:24:47.230
<v Speaker 4>So then this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this what I'm talking about</v>

2476
01:24:47.231 --> 01:24:48.970
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>normally it's a ball and socket joint,</v>

2477
01:24:48.971 --> 01:24:50.150
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's something called a reverse</v>

2478
01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:52.580
<v Speaker 4>shoulder replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you basically switch it around and</v>

2479
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:55.630
<v Speaker 4>you put the ball where the socket was</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the socket where the ball was,</v>

2480
01:24:55.631 --> 01:24:57.250
<v Speaker 4>which sounds totally crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2481
01:24:57.910 --> 01:25:01.750
<v Speaker 4>This was developed in France in the 80s</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the FDA approved this in 2004</v>

2482
01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:06.010
<v Speaker 4>it's a 2004 was approved in the u s and</v>
<v Speaker 4>originally it was approved for one</v>

2483
01:25:06.011 --> 01:25:06.791
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2484
01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:10.270
<v Speaker 4>If your shoulder is totally arthritic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2485
01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:12.040
<v Speaker 4>real bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arthur and you don't have a rotator cuff</v>

2486
01:25:12.041 --> 01:25:13.930
<v Speaker 4>anymore and it's completely gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2487
01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:15.910
<v Speaker 4>So that's what it was first approved</v>
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>

2488
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:18.130
<v Speaker 4>But over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the next five,</v>

2489
01:25:18.131 --> 01:25:19.960
<v Speaker 4>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people started using it for all these</v>

2490
01:25:19.961 --> 01:25:21.040
<v Speaker 4>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And getting really,</v>

2491
01:25:21.041 --> 01:25:23.930
<v Speaker 4>really good results with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you come in there with a blasted</v>

2492
01:25:23.931 --> 01:25:25.630
<v Speaker 4>apart shoulder that's crashed and</v>
<v Speaker 4>broken,</v>

2493
01:25:25.631 --> 01:25:28.150
<v Speaker 4>you're an older person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People do that all the time.</v>

2494
01:25:28.151 --> 01:25:29.200
<v Speaker 4>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I did.</v>

2495
01:25:29.230 --> 01:25:31.150
<v Speaker 4>I basically put a noise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2496
01:25:31.151 --> 01:25:33.610
<v Speaker 4>reverse shoulder and a person that broke</v>
<v Speaker 4>their arm at this twice.</v>

2497
01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:37.840
<v Speaker 4>And not only did the patient do well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the patient was happy as can be.</v>

2498
01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.680
<v Speaker 4>They're great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

2499
01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.900
<v Speaker 4>no one knew what the outcomes of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>patients in this patient is.</v>

2500
01:25:40.901 --> 01:25:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Happy as can be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the guy writes because he's old,</v>

2501
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:46.120
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or drunk or doesn't know the new record.</v>

2502
01:25:46.121 --> 01:25:48.340
<v Speaker 4>He hasn't read literature and 10 he put</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in backwards.</v>

2503
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:49.390
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he puts,</v>

2504
01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:51.580
<v Speaker 4>it's not indicated for this student.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only reason to do,</v>

2505
01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:54.910
<v Speaker 4>and it's for an arthritic guy with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a missing road ticket.</v>

2506
01:25:54.911 --> 01:25:56.560
<v Speaker 4>But he doesn't know that over the last</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 years,</v>

2507
01:25:56.650 --> 01:25:58.180
<v Speaker 4>all kinds of different reasons to use</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2508
01:25:58.181 --> 01:26:02.800
<v Speaker 4>So he basically tells us committee he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the wrong operation when anybody</v>

2509
01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:05.150
<v Speaker 4>denay that that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2510
01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.250
<v Speaker 4>So there's another case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It a guy.</v>

2511
01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>

2512
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.650
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to keep just going over</v>
<v Speaker 4>case after case.</v>

2513
01:26:09.651 --> 01:26:10.960
<v Speaker 4>It's going to get a little dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2514
01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:13.310
<v Speaker 4>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where does it stand right now?</v>

2515
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:17.540
<v Speaker 4>So basically what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they drag us out for a year and a</v>

2516
01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.230
<v Speaker 4>half,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2517
01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 4>And they finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2518
01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:20.661
<v Speaker 4>and at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2519
01:26:20.661 --> 01:26:23.030
<v Speaker 4>I tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I gotta tell you this part,</v>

2520
01:26:23.031 --> 01:26:26.060
<v Speaker 4>so I go through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is important.</v>

2521
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:28.040
<v Speaker 4>I go through and compile all of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>cases,</v>

2522
01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:30.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And get all the data to refute this and</v>

2523
01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:32.540
<v Speaker 4>pull all these references and textbooks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all this stuff.</v>

2524
01:26:32.541 --> 01:26:34.430
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a walk in the park,</v>

2525
01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:35.264
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>

2526
01:26:35.770 --> 01:26:36.531
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2527
01:26:36.531 --> 01:26:39.260
<v Speaker 4>anybody that sees us in the right mind</v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to see that they screwed up and</v>

2528
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:43.160
<v Speaker 4>there's all these Arabs that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I see in discovery process,</v>

2529
01:26:43.161 --> 01:26:45.380
<v Speaker 4>you send all this information in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they fail.</v>

2530
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:46.880
<v Speaker 4>Then they realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

2531
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:50.210
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of Eric's in here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now they have to pick a hearing</v>

2532
01:26:50.211 --> 01:26:51.260
<v Speaker 4>officer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2533
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.820
<v Speaker 4>Who's like the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2534
01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:53.980
<v Speaker 4>His word goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they pick it up,</v>

2535
01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:56.720
<v Speaker 4>they get another search,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like give me a list of surgeons to</v>

2536
01:26:56.721 --> 01:26:57.640
<v Speaker 4>choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2537
01:26:57.641 --> 01:27:00.200
<v Speaker 4>you can have any of these guys you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I looked through the list and</v>

2538
01:27:00.201 --> 01:27:02.510
<v Speaker 4>there's one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you remember that group that I was</v>

2539
01:27:02.511 --> 01:27:04.940
<v Speaker 4>competing with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's in that group and I'm like,</v>

2540
01:27:04.941 --> 01:27:06.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't want him cause he's on the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>

2541
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.911
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2542
01:27:07.911 --> 01:27:11.630
<v Speaker 4>he just retired and we went and we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to make you use him.</v>

2543
01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.750
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they pick the judge and then on top</v>

2544
01:27:14.751 --> 01:27:18.110
<v Speaker 4>of that they pay him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're paying this guy,</v>

2545
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.790
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they review all this stuff and I've</v>

2546
01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:21.980
<v Speaker 4>got this stuff and I'm going through</v>
<v Speaker 4>case after case where I'm like,</v>

2547
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:24.470
<v Speaker 4>the patient didn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the patient was doing great,</v>

2548
01:27:24.471 --> 01:27:26.210
<v Speaker 4>they didn't get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with them.</v>

2549
01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:28.340
<v Speaker 4>And the lawyers from the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2550
01:27:28.341 --> 01:27:29.450
<v Speaker 4>well you can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no harm,</v>

2551
01:27:29.451 --> 01:27:30.350
<v Speaker 4>no foul stuff.</v>

2552
01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:31.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

2553
01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:32.893
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one got,</v>

2554
01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:34.790
<v Speaker 4>everybody's doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's like,</v>

2555
01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:35.511
<v Speaker 4>well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2556
01:27:35.511 --> 01:27:37.220
<v Speaker 4>you could've done something different or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2557
01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:38.031
<v Speaker 4>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2558
01:27:38.031 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 4>if you look at a malpractice case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first thing you have to do is prove</v>

2559
01:27:40.251 --> 01:27:41.084
<v Speaker 4>harm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2560
01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.710
<v Speaker 4>If no one gets hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing there.</v>

2561
01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.330
<v Speaker 4>And it's not that anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one got hurt,</v>

2562
01:27:44.331 --> 01:27:47.270
<v Speaker 4>no one did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's just like so the,</v>

2563
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:49.040
<v Speaker 4>so the guy at the end of it goes through</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he says,</v>

2564
01:27:49.041 --> 01:27:50.420
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were a lot of errors,</v>

2565
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're paying this guy and they</v>

2566
01:27:52.161 --> 01:27:55.910
<v Speaker 4>chick chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think you gave patients too much</v>

2567
01:27:55.911 --> 01:27:58.310
<v Speaker 4>choice in their care,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

2568
01:27:58.311 --> 01:27:59.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

2569
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:01.303
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if I,</v>

2570
01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 4>if the criticism was that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all they had pieces now he said</v>

2571
01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:09.890
<v Speaker 4>it was really bad air and they said you</v>
<v Speaker 4>gave patients too much choice and you</v>

2572
01:28:09.891 --> 01:28:11.600
<v Speaker 4>didn't document stuff as well as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>should have.</v>

2573
01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I still think that they should have</v>

2574
01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:14.454
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just manage it.</v>

2575
01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.820
<v Speaker 4>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the decision to make based on</v>

2576
01:28:16.821 --> 01:28:18.890
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I will guarantee if anybody who was</v>

2577
01:28:18.891 --> 01:28:22.070
<v Speaker 4>on that committee that knew me cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>people knew me on the committee knew I</v>

2578
01:28:22.071 --> 01:28:23.690
<v Speaker 4>was a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they never had problems with me.</v>

2579
01:28:23.691 --> 01:28:25.700
<v Speaker 4>So that's why they were shocked when</v>
<v Speaker 4>this came out.</v>

2580
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:28.880
<v Speaker 4>But if they knew that information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 100% convinced that would be a</v>

2581
01:28:28.881 --> 01:28:30.080
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what does it stand?</v>

2582
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:33.560
<v Speaker 4>So then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get done with that and then the state</v>

2583
01:28:33.561 --> 01:28:34.960
<v Speaker 4>gets involved because the state has to</v>
<v Speaker 4>respond.</v>

2584
01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:39.530
<v Speaker 4>Any complaints the state state gets this</v>
<v Speaker 4>complaint stayed in New Mexico and it's</v>

2585
01:28:39.531 --> 01:28:41.840
<v Speaker 4>kind of weird because my next door</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighbors on the state board and I'm</v>

2586
01:28:41.841 --> 01:28:44.210
<v Speaker 4>just like totally avoiding the guy cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to influence anything.</v>

2587
01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.980
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be giving them flowers.</v>

2588
01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.300
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just didn't want to do.</v>

2589
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:48.290
<v Speaker 4>And I even told him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2590
01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:50.210
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my next door neighbor is on your board.</v>

2591
01:28:50.211 --> 01:28:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't want,</v>

2592
01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:53.180
<v Speaker 4>I want to be totally ethical about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a story.</v>

2593
01:28:53.181 --> 01:28:53.661
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2594
01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:54.310
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they said,</v>

2595
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:55.310
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all my flowers.</v>

2596
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe we can maybe give him an elk</v>

2597
01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.010
<v Speaker 4>stack or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then the board gets us and they say,</v>

2598
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:01.650
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

2599
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 4>this is a</v>

2600
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.410
<v Speaker 3>bad recommendation and we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you two options.</v>

2601
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:06.230
<v Speaker 3>You can suspend your license,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2602
01:29:06.231 --> 01:29:08.730
<v Speaker 3>you can voluntarily suspend your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each surrender your license,</v>

2603
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:12.150
<v Speaker 3>or you can go to trial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2604
01:29:12.151 --> 01:29:14.340
<v Speaker 3>we can do another hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which probably didn't take a year.</v>

2605
01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.920
<v Speaker 3>It's going to cost you tons of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2606
01:29:16.921 --> 01:29:18.120
<v Speaker 3>which I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just tired of this.</v>

2607
01:29:18.121 --> 01:29:20.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of lawyers spending all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>money and I'm not,</v>

2608
01:29:20.491 --> 01:29:22.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm still trying to figure out how am I</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna feed my kids.</v>

2609
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.040
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2610
01:29:24.090 --> 01:29:26.400
<v Speaker 3>the state says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or what you can do is we'll send you to</v>

2611
01:29:26.401 --> 01:29:28.380
<v Speaker 3>a place and I'll evaluate you</v>
<v Speaker 3>independently.</v>

2612
01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.480
<v Speaker 3>And then if everything goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll give you a license back.</v>

2613
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.010
<v Speaker 3>So that I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2614
01:29:32.011 --> 01:29:33.150
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm tired of this.</v>

2615
01:29:33.151 --> 01:29:36.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to spend $100,000 and wait</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year when I can go to this place and</v>

2616
01:29:36.811 --> 01:29:39.930
<v Speaker 3>spend $12,000 and get evaluated and go</v>
<v Speaker 3>from there.</v>

2617
01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:41.130
<v Speaker 3>So I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where I was this week.</v>

2618
01:29:41.131 --> 01:29:43.020
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Denver being with these other</v>

2619
01:29:43.021 --> 01:29:45.030
<v Speaker 3>surgeons and they were just like going</v>
<v Speaker 3>through all this case,</v>

2620
01:29:45.031 --> 01:29:45.421
<v Speaker 3>case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>

2621
01:29:45.421 --> 01:29:46.171
<v Speaker 3>What would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you do?</v>

2622
01:29:46.171 --> 01:29:48.990
<v Speaker 3>What would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I am clearly,</v>

2623
01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:50.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though I haven't done this stuff in</v>

2624
01:29:50.641 --> 01:29:52.590
<v Speaker 3>two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm clearly convinced that they're going</v>

2625
01:29:52.591 --> 01:29:53.424
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2626
01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.740
<v Speaker 3>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're going to say,</v>

2627
01:29:55.741 --> 01:29:57.490
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go operate with somebody for taking lots</v>

2628
01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.130
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at those cases where you were</v>

2629
01:29:59.131 --> 01:30:00.900
<v Speaker 3>judged upon poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

2630
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:01.920
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

2631
01:30:01.921 --> 01:30:03.720
<v Speaker 3>because they wanted to be totally into</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking insane.</v>

2632
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:04.960
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2633
01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.790
<v Speaker 3>how do you make a lemon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm living off my savings.</v>

2634
01:30:09.090 --> 01:30:10.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saved up some money.</v>

2635
01:30:10.201 --> 01:30:12.330
<v Speaker 3>So I lived off that and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's mostly yet,</v>

2636
01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just kind of slowly watching my</v>

2637
01:30:14.641 --> 01:30:15.780
<v Speaker 3>savings dwindle down.</v>

2638
01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.540
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ has got to be stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of stressful.</v>

2639
01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:19.021
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2640
01:30:19.021 --> 01:30:21.390
<v Speaker 3>I've got a girlfriend in Mexico living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2641
01:30:21.391 --> 01:30:22.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be,</v>

2642
01:30:22.141 --> 01:30:22.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've got kids who,</v>

2643
01:30:22.961 --> 01:30:25.230
<v Speaker 3>we've got kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a kid with her and I've got</v>

2644
01:30:25.231 --> 01:30:27.090
<v Speaker 3>three kids with my ex wife and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>all young kids.</v>

2645
01:30:27.091 --> 01:30:28.770
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I said I'm traveling back and</v>

2646
01:30:28.771 --> 01:30:29.550
<v Speaker 3>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2647
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:30.450
<v Speaker 3>back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2648
01:30:30.451 --> 01:30:31.560
<v Speaker 3>trying to support these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2649
01:30:31.561 --> 01:30:34.140
<v Speaker 3>I had to pull my kids out of school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to put them in a different school</v>

2650
01:30:34.170 --> 01:30:36.870
<v Speaker 3>because the income wasn't there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2651
01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:38.160
<v Speaker 3>it's so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a pain.</v>

2652
01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:40.980
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda kinda sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where's the Stan as far as like</v>

2653
01:30:40.981 --> 01:30:42.600
<v Speaker 3>getting your license reinstated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2654
01:30:42.601 --> 01:30:46.190
<v Speaker 3>so probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was just in Denver,</v>

2655
01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.460
<v Speaker 3>they said it'll take about eight weeks.</v>

2656
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:48.930
<v Speaker 3>So they'll give me a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll give me a plan,</v>

2657
01:30:48.970 --> 01:30:49.501
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2658
01:30:49.501 --> 01:30:50.520
<v Speaker 3>we think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2659
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:53.310
<v Speaker 3>I am almost a hundred percent convinced</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to say,</v>

2660
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need you to go work with some dude</v>

2661
01:30:56.641 --> 01:30:58.080
<v Speaker 3>for a couple months cause you're out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>

2662
01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.760
<v Speaker 3>And I think I'll probably end up doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2663
01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Then the board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the State Board will review what they</v>

2664
01:31:02.311 --> 01:31:03.360
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in longer they say,</v>

2665
01:31:03.361 --> 01:31:04.194
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2666
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.450
<v Speaker 3>you know what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll give it back to me.</v>

2667
01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:08.070
<v Speaker 3>So insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2668
01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:08.911
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2669
01:31:08.911 --> 01:31:09.660
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2670
01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:11.010
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't blame the state board.</v>

2671
01:31:11.370 --> 01:31:13.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe the people who are on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the committee because they were</v>

2672
01:31:13.081 --> 01:31:14.160
<v Speaker 3>clueless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what I,</v>

2673
01:31:14.210 --> 01:31:16.350
<v Speaker 3>I blame someone competence by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>administrators,</v>

2674
01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:17.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2675
01:31:17.611 --> 01:31:19.560
<v Speaker 3>and just whoever reviewed me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2676
01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:24.060
<v Speaker 3>if it were a caveman times Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go with a big club and like what the</v>

2677
01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:25.051
<v Speaker 3>F,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2678
01:31:25.051 --> 01:31:26.070
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2679
01:31:26.071 --> 01:31:27.510
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very disheartening.</v>

2680
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:28.530
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2681
01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:32.370
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's going through a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar type situation,</v>

2682
01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:35.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was also a surgeon.</v>

2683
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:36.690
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2684
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:39.330
<v Speaker 3>it's theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people need to understand that</v>

2685
01:31:39.331 --> 01:31:41.880
<v Speaker 3>the medical business is in fact a</v>
<v Speaker 3>business now.</v>

2686
01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:44.580
<v Speaker 3>And we think of hospitals as being these</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely,</v>

2687
01:31:44.970 --> 01:31:48.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a egalitarian places that just,</v>

2688
01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:51.270
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they exist to heal people and to do the</v>

2689
01:31:51.271 --> 01:31:53.070
<v Speaker 3>best job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sort of do,</v>

2690
01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.500
<v Speaker 3>but they also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need to make a lot of money.</v>

2691
01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got to pay the light bills.</v>

2692
01:31:56.821 --> 01:31:57.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>

2693
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there's a point,</v>

2694
01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:01.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets kind of like you've got to make</v>

2695
01:32:01.631 --> 01:32:04.930
<v Speaker 3>a decision between patient care and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2696
01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the CEO making,</v>

2697
01:32:06.491 --> 01:32:08.680
<v Speaker 3>making a little extra now they do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>with animals too.</v>

2698
01:32:08.681 --> 01:32:09.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be really careful.</v>

2699
01:32:09.791 --> 01:32:13.300
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who had a recent</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation happened with his dog where,</v>

2700
01:32:13.301 --> 01:32:14.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were telling his dog him,</v>

2701
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:18.820
<v Speaker 3>his dog needed to get some crazy surgery</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't have the money for it.</v>

2702
01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.260
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you sure?</v>

2703
01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.610
<v Speaker 3>You sure they need to end?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2704
01:32:21.611 --> 01:32:23.650
<v Speaker 3>I had to ask them over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2705
01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:25.480
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in filing the veterinarian said,</v>

2706
01:32:25.481 --> 01:32:28.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could try a steroid,</v>

2707
01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:30.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the dog and see if that works.</v>

2708
01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Fucking fixed it 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2709
01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:37.510
<v Speaker 3>And the steroid costs like 150 bucks</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus some $30,000 surgery.</v>

2710
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:41.200
<v Speaker 3>But they kept pushing this surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would have fused that dog's discs.</v>

2711
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:43.130
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this needs to happen,</v>

2712
01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.140
<v Speaker 3>need to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2713
01:32:44.150 --> 01:32:46.960
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no other options and we've</v>

2714
01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:51.640
<v Speaker 3>exhausted all possible options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then finally after asking over and</v>

2715
01:32:51.641 --> 01:32:54.490
<v Speaker 3>over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she suggested meekly this,</v>

2716
01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:56.680
<v Speaker 3>which instantly fixed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2717
01:32:56.681 --> 01:33:00.050
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda like two months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dog was 100% you know it's got,</v>

2718
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.281
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2719
01:33:00.281 --> 01:33:01.210
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know he hit Chris,</v>

2720
01:33:01.211 --> 01:33:03.160
<v Speaker 3>Chris around here a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to listen to a little bit of</v>

2721
01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:03.430
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2722
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:04.780
<v Speaker 3>And then in his premise at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>

2723
01:33:04.781 --> 01:33:06.550
<v Speaker 3>which I haven't read his book yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's great.</v>

2724
01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem with Western</v>

2725
01:33:08.321 --> 01:33:09.154
<v Speaker 3>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2726
01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:13.750
<v Speaker 3>we're facing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like a war against chronic</v>

2727
01:33:13.751 --> 01:33:15.610
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're being invaded by,</v>

2728
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:17.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember Independence Day where that all</v>

2729
01:33:17.561 --> 01:33:20.770
<v Speaker 3>of this in doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got bb guns.</v>

2730
01:33:20.890 --> 01:33:24.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean the stuff we are shooting at them</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't work for chronic disease.</v>

2731
01:33:24.011 --> 01:33:24.641
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Acute stuff,</v>

2732
01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:25.361
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2733
01:33:25.361 --> 01:33:27.670
<v Speaker 3>there's some stuff that we have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful technology,</v>

2734
01:33:27.671 --> 01:33:31.480
<v Speaker 3>but the run of the mill diabetes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>obesity doctors are great for fixing</v>

2735
01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:34.570
<v Speaker 3>broken jump joy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>

2736
01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.550
<v Speaker 3>Even even like arthritis and I sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day,</v>

2737
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:40.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we were trained properly in nutrition</v>

2738
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:41.500
<v Speaker 3>and exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2739
01:33:41.501 --> 01:33:42.670
<v Speaker 3>that's what I've known my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2740
01:33:42.671 --> 01:33:44.230
<v Speaker 3>and I know what I'm doing exercise wise.</v>

2741
01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:47.860
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we were allowed to do that and</v>

2742
01:33:47.861 --> 01:33:49.900
<v Speaker 3>instead of training all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2743
01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:54.850
<v Speaker 3>radiology technicians and blood draw</v>
<v Speaker 3>technicians and nursing assistants,</v>

2744
01:33:54.851 --> 01:33:57.250
<v Speaker 3>if you had an army of preventative</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2745
01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:59.230
<v Speaker 3>bit of medicine people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2746
01:33:59.231 --> 01:34:01.690
<v Speaker 3>and then we train all these people to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>into people's homes.</v>

2747
01:34:02.410 --> 01:34:04.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Chris was talking about that and</v>

2748
01:34:04.481 --> 01:34:08.140
<v Speaker 3>just get the crap out of their diet and</v>
<v Speaker 3>show them how to be healthier,</v>

2749
01:34:08.141 --> 01:34:09.010
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you would,</v>

2750
01:34:09.011 --> 01:34:10.600
<v Speaker 3>you would save,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2751
01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:13.140
<v Speaker 3>it's funny watching the politicians</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate about healthcare,</v>

2752
01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.080
<v Speaker 3>how to fund it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2753
01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:17.950
<v Speaker 3>it's like you guys are arguing about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tie can't tannic as it's coming up in</v>

2754
01:34:17.951 --> 01:34:20.560
<v Speaker 3>the iceberg and you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're arguing about the color of the</v>

2755
01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:21.790
<v Speaker 3>deck chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2756
01:34:21.791 --> 01:34:24.760
<v Speaker 3>we're going over a cliff and we're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>fixing it.</v>

2757
01:34:24.761 --> 01:34:27.970
<v Speaker 3>By keeping putting bandaids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to write it.</v>

2758
01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:31.000
<v Speaker 3>The technology's not going to fix</v>
<v Speaker 3>diabetes.</v>

2759
01:34:31.001 --> 01:34:32.980
<v Speaker 3>Nutritionist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that this is a year of</v>

2760
01:34:32.981 --> 01:34:35.620
<v Speaker 3>essentially dealing with the problem and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's already gotten to a point where</v>

2761
01:34:35.621 --> 01:34:36.630
<v Speaker 3>you're in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2762
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2763
01:34:37.690 --> 01:34:38.590
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy,</v>

2764
01:34:38.591 --> 01:34:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Peter Attia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know who he is,</v>

2765
01:34:40.211 --> 01:34:43.030
<v Speaker 3>but he talks about when he was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgeon,</v>

2766
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:46.300
<v Speaker 3>he felt like he was at the bottom of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>building and somebody is throwing eggs</v>

2767
01:34:46.301 --> 01:34:49.120
<v Speaker 3>off and his job is to catch the eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2768
01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:49.751
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2769
01:34:49.751 --> 01:34:51.520
<v Speaker 3>why would just have the guy stop fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown out?</v>

2770
01:34:52.090 --> 01:34:54.550
<v Speaker 3>But that's what medicine is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just catching me eggs.</v>

2771
01:34:54.551 --> 01:34:57.010
<v Speaker 3>And so instead of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should be investing,</v>

2772
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:57.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

2773
01:34:57.411 --> 01:34:58.340
<v Speaker 3>we talk about prevention,</v>

2774
01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:00.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't do anything for prevention.</v>

2775
01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:02.180
<v Speaker 2>It's so little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the problem,</v>

2776
01:35:02.181 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 2>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it is,</v>

2777
01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:06.080
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work the way we've designed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2778
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

2779
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:11.360
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of money in fixing you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a whole lot of money in</v>

2780
01:35:11.361 --> 01:35:12.380
<v Speaker 2>telling you to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2781
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:13.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not.</v>

2782
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is a changing climate though</v>

2783
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:17.870
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of,</v>

2784
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:20.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people at Chris Kresser and Robb Wolf</v>

2785
01:35:20.901 --> 01:35:23.600
<v Speaker 2>and doctor Rhonda Patrick and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>

2786
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:27.440
<v Speaker 2>they're giving out really good nutrition</v>
<v Speaker 2>advice and people changing the way they</v>

2787
01:35:27.441 --> 01:35:31.490
<v Speaker 2>eat and think about food and it's having</v>
<v Speaker 2>a massive effect on the inflammation</v>

2788
01:35:31.491 --> 01:35:34.010
<v Speaker 2>that they carry in their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know so many people that used to have</v>

2789
01:35:34.011 --> 01:35:35.520
<v Speaker 2>joint pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2790
01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:37.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great example is,</v>

2791
01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:39.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2792
01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:43.370
<v Speaker 2>the primal kitchen assistant mark</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sisson's book,</v>

2793
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:45.050
<v Speaker 2>which is fantastic.</v>

2794
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:48.170
<v Speaker 2>And His story mark story about having</v>
<v Speaker 2>his own,</v>

2795
01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:50.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory issues with his hands.</v>

2796
01:35:50.091 --> 01:35:52.820
<v Speaker 2>He had some pretty severe arthritis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought it was just going to be with</v>

2797
01:35:52.821 --> 01:35:54.740
<v Speaker 2>him forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He changed his diet,</v>

2798
01:35:54.741 --> 01:35:59.741
<v Speaker 2>reduces all the refined carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes on this protein,</v>

2799
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:02.180
<v Speaker 2>high fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it all goes away.</v>

2800
01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many examples of that.</v>

2801
01:36:05.181 --> 01:36:09.080
<v Speaker 2>And I just watched this documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>called what's with wheat and it's all</v>

2802
01:36:09.081 --> 01:36:09.930
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2803
01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:11.900
<v Speaker 2>glyphosate in the wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2804
01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:15.440
<v Speaker 2>roundup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how when they say it's safe for</v>

2805
01:36:15.441 --> 01:36:16.760
<v Speaker 2>people to consume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

2806
01:36:16.761 --> 01:36:19.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it only affects plants and bacteria.</v>

2807
01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.050
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what about your microbiome?</v>

2808
01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Your microbiome is filled with bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're killing that stuff.</v>

2809
01:36:24.861 --> 01:36:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't think of that as being an</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

2810
01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't think of sedentary lifestyle as</v>

2811
01:36:32.901 --> 01:36:34.580
<v Speaker 2>being an issue when it comes to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2812
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:38.420
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate cause for you to wind up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hospital needing surgery.</v>

2813
01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.750
<v Speaker 2>But it absolutely is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2814
01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.420
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you one of the things I used</v>

2815
01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:41.961
<v Speaker 2>to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you know,</v>

2816
01:36:41.961 --> 01:36:43.850
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a surgeon you like somebody</v>

2817
01:36:43.851 --> 01:36:46.460
<v Speaker 2>comes in with bad arthritis and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>placed her knee and they feel better for</v>

2818
01:36:46.461 --> 01:36:47.960
<v Speaker 2>a while and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2819
01:36:47.961 --> 01:36:49.460
<v Speaker 2>that's great man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really helped this person.</v>

2820
01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Then they come in next year and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are other needs all jacked up.</v>

2821
01:36:52.311 --> 01:36:55.340
<v Speaker 2>And then you a that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you should have just done</v>

2822
01:36:55.341 --> 01:36:56.750
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't need our threat.</v>

2823
01:36:56.751 --> 01:36:57.800
<v Speaker 2>It didn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2824
01:36:57.890 --> 01:37:00.110
<v Speaker 2>didn't need surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other time that I've had</v>

2825
01:37:00.111 --> 01:37:02.780
<v Speaker 2>conversations with people that their dad</v>
<v Speaker 2>that needs a,</v>

2826
01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:05.300
<v Speaker 2>an artificial knee and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you sure?</v>

2827
01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2828
01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:08.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's limping bad.</v>

2829
01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really can't take it anymore.</v>

2830
01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you exhausted all possible options?</v>

2831
01:37:11.901 --> 01:37:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Like what have you done about the Diet?</v>

2832
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:13.833
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he won't.</v>

2833
01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:15.080
<v Speaker 2>He's not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2834
01:37:15.081 --> 01:37:15.950
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not into that.</v>

2835
01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here's a problem because no one's</v>

2836
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:20.320
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated the Diet works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I will tell you this is,</v>

2837
01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.620
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2838
01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:23.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's demonstrated it in terms of</v>

2839
01:37:23.541 --> 01:37:24.760
<v Speaker 2>like scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2840
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:26.320
<v Speaker 2>But I will tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2841
01:37:26.321 --> 01:37:26.900
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2842
01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:29.740
<v Speaker 2>cause I told you because I'm a freak</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

2843
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm just eating meat and I'm doing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletic stuff and nobody says you're an</v>

2844
01:37:32.361 --> 01:37:35.180
<v Speaker 2>l or your genetic freak or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're an n equals one.</v>

2845
01:37:35.181 --> 01:37:37.520
<v Speaker 2>So we made this website called n equals</v>
<v Speaker 2>many meters,</v>

2846
01:37:37.521 --> 01:37:39.860
<v Speaker 2>other air force guy that he's also a</v>
<v Speaker 2>corner bar.</v>

2847
01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:40.730
<v Speaker 2>We got this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we said,</v>

2848
01:37:40.731 --> 01:37:44.600
<v Speaker 2>well what if people started gathering</v>
<v Speaker 2>this information together and we could</v>

2849
01:37:44.601 --> 01:37:46.220
<v Speaker 2>start documenting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we did.</v>

2850
01:37:46.221 --> 01:37:48.380
<v Speaker 2>So we put out a survey on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2851
01:37:48.381 --> 01:37:50.150
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of you guys would be willing to</v>

2852
01:37:50.151 --> 01:37:52.280
<v Speaker 2>go 90 days and just eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat a bunch of steaks?</v>

2853
01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.170
<v Speaker 2>And I had like 400 I didn't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>many followers by like 400 people.</v>

2854
01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:56.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll do it.</v>

2855
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:58.200
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we put the,</v>

2856
01:37:58.201 --> 01:37:58.561
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2857
01:37:58.561 --> 01:38:02.120
<v Speaker 3>we developed this website and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>called n equals many Dotcom for people</v>

2858
01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:04.380
<v Speaker 3>want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we developed this website and then we</v>

2859
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:07.900
<v Speaker 3>start getting these first equal sign or</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat q eqs spell.</v>

2860
01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I put an equals on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a website now.</v>

2861
01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:14.040
<v Speaker 3>And he and e q u a l many doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2862
01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:18.780
<v Speaker 3>So we do this and we get all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that sign up and we ended up</v>

2863
01:38:18.781 --> 01:38:21.780
<v Speaker 3>having about close to a hundred people</v>
<v Speaker 3>just do 90 days.</v>

2864
01:38:21.781 --> 01:38:23.100
<v Speaker 3>It just any meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we,</v>

2865
01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:24.300
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

2866
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:27.690
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of scientific route things</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can criticize about this.</v>

2867
01:38:27.691 --> 01:38:30.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just guys ate meat and egg though</v>

2868
01:38:30.721 --> 01:38:32.640
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2869
01:38:32.641 --> 01:38:35.400
<v Speaker 3>when we got done and I've got the</v>
<v Speaker 3>results that we just,</v>

2870
01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:36.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're still analyzing the data because</v>

2871
01:38:36.901 --> 01:38:38.480
<v Speaker 3>we're all doing this for free and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to weren't,</v>

2872
01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:39.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to get people to help us</v>

2873
01:38:39.811 --> 01:38:43.620
<v Speaker 3>analyze the data and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of these hundred people,</v>

2874
01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:46.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's about 85 action of these people.</v>

2875
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:49.050
<v Speaker 3>We ask them what happened to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>general health?</v>

2876
01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:51.690
<v Speaker 3>What happened to your sexual health?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened to your exercise capacity?</v>

2877
01:38:51.691 --> 01:38:53.460
<v Speaker 3>What happens to your gi health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your skin,</v>

2878
01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:57.030
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we asked all these questions and there</v>

2879
01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:59.580
<v Speaker 3>was maybe one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1% where they said it got worse.</v>

2880
01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:02.490
<v Speaker 3>99% got better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much better.</v>

2881
01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Or say to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2882
01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:05.910
<v Speaker 3>it was just like unanimously everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>

2883
01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much either the same or is it</v>

2884
01:39:08.341 --> 01:39:11.460
<v Speaker 3>possible that there's some bias in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>group because they're following you?</v>

2885
01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2886
01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:13.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm well aware of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2887
01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:14.613
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2888
01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2889
01:39:15.091 --> 01:39:17.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's interesting but then we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting some old lab data.</v>

2890
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:20.400
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know you like about lab data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I get people and I don't have access</v>

2891
01:39:20.401 --> 01:39:22.640
<v Speaker 3>to all the data and I didn't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to have access to the</v>

2892
01:39:22.641 --> 01:39:22.750
<v Speaker 3>date.</v>

2893
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:26.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to bias myself against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm getting fed the data and I'm</v>

2894
01:39:26.011 --> 01:39:30.210
<v Speaker 3>seeing that people's blood pressure is</v>
<v Speaker 3>normalizing people's hemoglobin.</v>

2895
01:39:30.211 --> 01:39:32.430
<v Speaker 3>A one C,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has never had measure glucose is</v>

2896
01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:36.900
<v Speaker 3>normalizing people's inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Markers are normalizing,</v>

2897
01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:39.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these markers of disease are going</v>

2898
01:39:39.991 --> 01:39:41.440
<v Speaker 3>in the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2899
01:39:41.530 --> 01:39:42.960
<v Speaker 3>we're just seeing good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2900
01:39:42.961 --> 01:39:45.960
<v Speaker 3>because in a lot of the people will say</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat causes diabetes.</v>

2901
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Me Causes Hypertension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had,</v>

2902
01:39:47.461 --> 01:39:49.890
<v Speaker 3>the only time I've ever seen me causes</v>
<v Speaker 3>diabetes.</v>

2903
01:39:49.891 --> 01:39:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that wacky?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2904
01:39:51.061 --> 01:39:54.210
<v Speaker 3>The health documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has been widely disproven and we</v>

2905
01:39:54.211 --> 01:39:55.950
<v Speaker 3>had on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rewrote a whole piece about that,</v>

2906
01:39:55.951 --> 01:39:59.520
<v Speaker 3>debunking that and like how much stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that it's like fake science.</v>

2907
01:39:59.521 --> 01:40:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Like what they're saying about meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>causing diabetes.</v>

2908
01:40:02.341 --> 01:40:03.650
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2909
01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:04.301
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2910
01:40:04.301 --> 01:40:06.510
<v Speaker 3>they look some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they use them associational stuff and</v>

2911
01:40:06.511 --> 01:40:07.410
<v Speaker 3>that's all they ever do.</v>

2912
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:10.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like some associations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're putting it out as if it's</v>

2913
01:40:10.171 --> 01:40:13.410
<v Speaker 3>100% factual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like the sounding the alarms,</v>

2914
01:40:13.411 --> 01:40:16.620
<v Speaker 3>like this is what's causing diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's meet me while they're completely</v>

2915
01:40:16.621 --> 01:40:19.710
<v Speaker 3>ignoring the consumption of all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>refined carbohydrates,</v>

2916
01:40:19.711 --> 01:40:21.720
<v Speaker 3>these people are eating with the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2917
01:40:21.721 --> 01:40:23.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's totally true.</v>

2918
01:40:23.670 --> 01:40:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2919
01:40:25.441 --> 01:40:27.840
<v Speaker 3>and so one of the thing is so nice about</v>
<v Speaker 3>studying these people,</v>

2920
01:40:27.841 --> 01:40:29.100
<v Speaker 3>they're just eating meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2921
01:40:29.101 --> 01:40:33.060
<v Speaker 3>you isolate a variable you to isolate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know what happens when you just</v>

2922
01:40:33.061 --> 01:40:33.391
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2923
01:40:33.391 --> 01:40:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Are they allowed to take supplements</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the time we had so many?</v>

2924
01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:39.180
<v Speaker 3>We the what we said we document it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2925
01:40:39.181 --> 01:40:41.250
<v Speaker 3>We had them document stuff and some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them do some,</v>

2926
01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was Kinda like one of those things</v>

2927
01:40:42.751 --> 01:40:44.050
<v Speaker 3>where we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause we,</v>

2928
01:40:44.051 --> 01:40:45.320
<v Speaker 3>we'd never done this before and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2929
01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:47.490
<v Speaker 3>and we made them document all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and a lot of people,</v>

2930
01:40:47.610 --> 01:40:49.860
<v Speaker 3>some of the people initially dropped out</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we made them document too much</v>

2931
01:40:49.861 --> 01:40:51.250
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's too much of a hassle looking</v>

2932
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 3>at Portland stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had percentage dropped</v>

2933
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.750
<v Speaker 4>out because he just didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 4>documents stuff.</v>

2934
01:40:55.751 --> 01:40:58.600
<v Speaker 4>We had a certain percentage of dropped</v>
<v Speaker 4>out because they didn't feel,</v>

2935
01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.190
<v Speaker 4>they felt like they had the low energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2936
01:41:00.191 --> 01:41:01.720
<v Speaker 4>And so a lot of people when they do</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2937
01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:03.410
<v Speaker 4>they just can't eat very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2938
01:41:03.411 --> 01:41:05.590
<v Speaker 4>they get full and they're not eating</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

2939
01:41:05.591 --> 01:41:08.500
<v Speaker 4>And so that's one of the biggest things</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell people when they switch over this</v>

2940
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:10.150
<v Speaker 4>eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's your job.</v>

2941
01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:13.040
<v Speaker 4>That's what I tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to eat edd initially.</v>

2942
01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.920
<v Speaker 4>Didn't they just eat until they're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>hungry anymore?</v>

2943
01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:18.220
<v Speaker 4>Well the problem is you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem is a lot of people lose</v>

2944
01:41:18.221 --> 01:41:19.090
<v Speaker 4>weight on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2945
01:41:19.091 --> 01:41:21.550
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people get lean on this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

2946
01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:23.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hunger goes down pretty low because</v>

2947
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:23.831
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2948
01:41:23.831 --> 01:41:25.480
<v Speaker 4>you're eating a lot of fat and eating a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of protein.</v>

2949
01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.440
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're eating,</v>

2950
01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:28.030
<v Speaker 4>if you're eating Ribeye steaks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2951
01:41:28.031 --> 01:41:30.850
<v Speaker 4>that's probably about 70% fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30% protein,</v>

2952
01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:32.800
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean it's,</v>

2953
01:41:32.801 --> 01:41:34.480
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really satisfying.</v>

2954
01:41:34.481 --> 01:41:36.220
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2955
01:41:36.221 --> 01:41:36.970
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2956
01:41:36.970 --> 01:41:38.080
<v Speaker 4>they tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tend to under,</v>

2957
01:41:38.081 --> 01:41:40.730
<v Speaker 4>cause no one's used to like if I sold</v>
<v Speaker 4>you joe go eat four pounds of meat a</v>

2958
01:41:40.731 --> 01:41:41.800
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be like,</v>

2959
01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:42.521
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2960
01:41:42.521 --> 01:41:44.650
<v Speaker 4>I know you like eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean even that's probably a big</v>

2961
01:41:44.651 --> 01:41:45.820
<v Speaker 4>town a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot,</v>

2962
01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:47.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so to get used to that,</v>

2963
01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:49.120
<v Speaker 4>it takes awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't,</v>

2964
01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:51.940
<v Speaker 4>it depends on your activity level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I work out pretty damn hard and I</v>

2965
01:41:51.941 --> 01:41:54.040
<v Speaker 4>do it pretty often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2966
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:56.530
<v Speaker 4>so I mean,</v>

2985
01:42:26.031 --> 01:42:27.650
<v Speaker 4>and I haven't tested it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have a couple of people who have</v>

2986
01:42:27.651 --> 01:42:29.510
<v Speaker 4>done this and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to get more data.</v>

2987
01:42:29.511 --> 01:42:31.370
<v Speaker 4>I've had a couple people have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It said their testosterone level went</v>

2988
01:42:31.371 --> 01:42:31.800
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2989
01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:35.730
<v Speaker 4>like they went on to all meet their</v>
<v Speaker 4>testosterone went up about 20% and so I</v>

2990
01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:36.231
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2991
01:42:36.231 --> 01:42:37.250
<v Speaker 4>well that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2992
01:42:37.251 --> 01:42:40.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't put a lot of faith and just a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of anecdotes.</v>

2993
01:42:40.011 --> 01:42:41.450
<v Speaker 4>So that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of people that go on the</v>

2994
01:42:41.451 --> 01:42:44.510
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic diet because the cholesterol</v>
<v Speaker 4>is actually the precursor to</v>

2995
01:42:44.511 --> 01:42:45.990
<v Speaker 4>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2996
01:42:46.090 --> 01:42:47.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of interesting if you look at,</v>

2997
01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:49.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>red meat consumption in the U S and in</v>

2998
01:42:49.941 --> 01:42:54.941
<v Speaker 4>1977 so red meat has gone down about 30</v>
<v Speaker 4>to 40% really?</v>

2999
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:59.930
<v Speaker 4>We used to be way more in the 70s we ate</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 30 40% more red meat than we do</v>

3000
01:42:59.931 --> 01:43:01.010
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No kidding.</v>

3001
01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:03.230
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also our testosterone levels have</v>

3002
01:43:03.231 --> 01:43:07.670
<v Speaker 4>dropped significantly and population</v>
<v Speaker 4>testosterone levels have dropped about</v>

3003
01:43:07.671 --> 01:43:08.504
<v Speaker 4>that same amount.</v>

3004
01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Bullied a lot of red mean I would've</v>
<v Speaker 2>never imagined me</v>

3005
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:13.000
<v Speaker 4>the last.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we listened.</v>

3006
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.990
<v Speaker 4>We used to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3007
01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's another interesting fact.</v>

3008
01:43:16.510 --> 01:43:18.550
<v Speaker 4>Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hong Kong,</v>

3009
01:43:18.551 --> 01:43:21.820
<v Speaker 4>right now if you look up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you google Hong Kong life expectancy,</v>

3010
01:43:21.821 --> 01:43:24.100
<v Speaker 4>they live the longest out of anybody on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

3011
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:28.060
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They eat about 40% more red meat than we</v>

3012
01:43:28.061 --> 01:43:31.510
<v Speaker 4>do in the US and them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they have the longest lived people</v>

3013
01:43:31.511 --> 01:43:33.070
<v Speaker 4>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is interesting.</v>

3014
01:43:33.710 --> 01:43:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd read something that said that 100%</v>

3015
01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:40.130
<v Speaker 2>of all people that live over a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3016
01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:44.630
<v Speaker 2>it was some high number of all people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that live over a hundred consume red</v>

3017
01:43:44.631 --> 01:43:45.070
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

3018
01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:45.791
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't doubt it.</v>

3019
01:43:45.791 --> 01:43:46.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting cause you know the,</v>

3020
01:43:46.851 --> 01:43:48.330
<v Speaker 4>the other vegans really liked to point</v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

3021
01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:51.860
<v Speaker 4>okay now it's a blue zone and edelman</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I suppose they looked at the people</v>

3022
01:43:51.861 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

3023
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.140
<v Speaker 3>lived over a hundred in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Okinawa.</v>

3024
01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:56.780
<v Speaker 3>None of them were vegetarians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them ate meat.</v>

3025
01:43:57.370 --> 01:43:59.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot.</v>

3026
01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:04.190
<v Speaker 3>Not a lot of good solid evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a Vegan is a solution to a long</v>

3027
01:44:04.191 --> 01:44:04.940
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3028
01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:05.511
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that,</v>

3029
01:44:05.511 --> 01:44:07.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's different propaganda</v>

3030
01:44:07.281 --> 01:44:08.270
<v Speaker 3>out there and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3031
01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.310
<v Speaker 3>here's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3032
01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:11.240
<v Speaker 3>if you want to do veganism and it makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>you healthy,</v>

3033
01:44:11.241 --> 01:44:12.980
<v Speaker 3>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people can't do it.</v>

3034
01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:14.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that about right,</v>

3035
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:17.720
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not just talking about if you want</v>

3036
01:44:17.721 --> 01:44:19.430
<v Speaker 3>to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about people that are</v>

3037
01:44:19.431 --> 01:44:22.460
<v Speaker 3>proselytizing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they have this idea and they push</v>

3038
01:44:22.461 --> 01:44:25.010
<v Speaker 3>this idea down everybody's throats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we're just looking at the actual</v>

3039
01:44:25.011 --> 01:44:26.810
<v Speaker 3>data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the health data,</v>

3040
01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:29.000
<v Speaker 3>like what's good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's bad for you?</v>

3041
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:32.510
<v Speaker 3>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no like overwhelming evidence</v>

3042
01:44:32.511 --> 01:44:34.280
<v Speaker 3>that the Vegan ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way to go,</v>

3043
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.940
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not.</v>

3044
01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:35.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there,</v>

3045
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:36.620
<v Speaker 3>their studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like to push,</v>

3046
01:44:36.621 --> 01:44:38.390
<v Speaker 3>but there's also studies that show that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3047
01:44:38.391 --> 01:44:39.260
<v Speaker 3>the opposite effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3048
01:44:39.261 --> 01:44:43.130
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the epic Oxford study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which had about 60,000 people in it,</v>

3049
01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:44.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they showed that vegetarians,</v>

3050
01:44:44.901 --> 01:44:47.360
<v Speaker 3>vegans live no longer than meat eaters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no difference.</v>

3051
01:44:47.361 --> 01:44:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though the mediators are probably</v>

3052
01:44:49.161 --> 01:44:50.840
<v Speaker 3>the guys that don't care about their</v>
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>

3053
01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:51.770
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it made,</v>

3054
01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:54.530
<v Speaker 3>not only is it not protective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it may be a negative.</v>

3055
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:56.450
<v Speaker 3>You can look at it and study out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>

3056
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:59.630
<v Speaker 3>it looked at 240,000 people called the</v>
<v Speaker 3>45 and up study.</v>

3057
01:44:59.870 --> 01:45:01.250
<v Speaker 3>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegans,</v>

3058
01:45:01.251 --> 01:45:02.410
<v Speaker 3>vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no loan,</v>

3059
01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:03.920
<v Speaker 3>no lever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no longer life,</v>

3060
01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.810
<v Speaker 3>no better health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's Kinda like,</v>

3061
01:45:06.250 --> 01:45:07.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who do you believe in?</v>

3062
01:45:07.251 --> 01:45:09.200
<v Speaker 3>These guys have their studies that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to quote and you can share</v>

3063
01:45:09.201 --> 01:45:11.150
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can cherry pick all day and other</v>

3064
01:45:11.151 --> 01:45:12.320
<v Speaker 3>people can cherry pick all day.</v>

3065
01:45:12.710 --> 01:45:15.180
<v Speaker 3>It's just bs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my best advantage,</v>

3066
01:45:15.181 --> 01:45:17.540
<v Speaker 3>advices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is I think the best advice you</v>

3067
01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:18.860
<v Speaker 3>can give anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3068
01:45:18.861 --> 01:45:22.010
<v Speaker 3>until we start seeing dudes walking</v>
<v Speaker 3>around that are in shape.</v>

3069
01:45:22.011 --> 01:45:25.430
<v Speaker 3>And Jack did 120 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to know what the right</v>

3070
01:45:25.431 --> 01:45:28.520
<v Speaker 3>thing to do is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the best advice you can have is</v>

3071
01:45:28.521 --> 01:45:31.100
<v Speaker 3>to get strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get healthy,</v>

3072
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:32.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move well,</v>

3073
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:34.130
<v Speaker 3>do everything you can to make your</v>
<v Speaker 3>health good.</v>

3074
01:45:34.131 --> 01:45:36.410
<v Speaker 3>And that's the best you can do because</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're healthy today,</v>

3075
01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:38.090
<v Speaker 3>odds are you're going to be healthier</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>

3076
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:39.920
<v Speaker 3>So you know the fact that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

3077
01:45:39.921 --> 01:45:43.640
<v Speaker 3>you're still got a lot of muscle on you</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 50 means you're more likely to have</v>

3078
01:45:43.641 --> 01:45:45.400
<v Speaker 3>someone you're 60 I mean there's just no</v>
<v Speaker 3>dot.</v>

3079
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:50.030
<v Speaker 3>That's the biggest correlated the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the best predictors of long life</v>

3080
01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.650
<v Speaker 3>is your exercise capacity.</v>

3081
01:45:51.650 --> 01:45:54.120
<v Speaker 3>And I think we should bring this up</v>
<v Speaker 3>while we're talking about Vegan diets or</v>

3082
01:45:54.121 --> 01:45:57.230
<v Speaker 3>southern darts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a standard American diet of</v>

3083
01:45:57.231 --> 01:46:00.500
<v Speaker 3>even eating a bunch of shitty food and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fried chicken and bullshit and</v>

3084
01:46:00.501 --> 01:46:03.350
<v Speaker 3>cheeseburgers and sodas and you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegan,</v>

3085
01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:05.360
<v Speaker 3>you will be healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3086
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Well cause you're going to remove all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shitty process food out of your</v>

3087
01:46:08.901 --> 01:46:11.390
<v Speaker 3>diet all the night try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all the stuff that's unnecessary.</v>

3088
01:46:11.391 --> 01:46:13.250
<v Speaker 3>All the preservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do that,</v>

3089
01:46:13.251 --> 01:46:16.250
<v Speaker 3>you will be healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't necessarily mean the</v>

3090
01:46:16.251 --> 01:46:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Vegan diets the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3091
01:46:18.531 --> 01:46:21.230
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means that the American diet that</v>

3092
01:46:21.231 --> 01:46:26.190
<v Speaker 3>everybody like rightly criticized as is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrong way to go vegan diet.</v>

3093
01:46:26.191 --> 01:46:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Certainly better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3094
01:46:27.921 --> 01:46:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can do bob on any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better than that.</v>

3095
01:46:29.841 --> 01:46:31.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean just like in a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3096
01:46:31.821 --> 01:46:33.380
<v Speaker 3>this is another point I bring on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3097
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:35.840
<v Speaker 3>cause one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the differences between what I</v>

3098
01:46:35.841 --> 01:46:37.870
<v Speaker 3>sort of think is healthy and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3099
01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:39.500
<v Speaker 3>I'll come out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know for sure.</v>

3100
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:42.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm still learning this stuff and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to investigate it.</v>

3101
01:46:42.111 --> 01:46:44.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to put my body to test and</v>

3102
01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:45.860
<v Speaker 3>have other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3103
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:47.750
<v Speaker 3>give me data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I,</v>

3104
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:49.710
<v Speaker 3>what we want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a big group out there and says</v>

3105
01:46:49.711 --> 01:46:50.030
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't</v>

3106
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:52.680
<v Speaker 4>eat a lot of protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should really restrict your protein.</v>

3107
01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:56.460
<v Speaker 4>There is some data that talks about</v>
<v Speaker 4>something called [inaudible] that you</v>

3108
01:46:56.461 --> 01:46:57.810
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you know,</v>

3109
01:46:57.811 --> 01:47:01.020
<v Speaker 4>it causes cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it inhibits longevity and then</v>

3110
01:47:01.021 --> 01:47:05.920
<v Speaker 4>these lesser animals like mice and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little tadpoles nematode things and you</v>

3111
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:06.763
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3112
01:47:07.050 --> 01:47:10.440
<v Speaker 4>and then there was another group of</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists out there is getting Stuart</v>

3113
01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.420
<v Speaker 4>Phillips out of Canada that's looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3114
01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:14.400
<v Speaker 4>And it shows that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3115
01:47:14.401 --> 01:47:16.410
<v Speaker 4>the more protein you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when you get older,</v>

3116
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:18.030
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the longer you're going to preserve</v>

3117
01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:19.410
<v Speaker 4>muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the better your quality of life isn't</v>

3118
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:20.940
<v Speaker 4>likely longer you're going to live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3119
01:47:20.941 --> 01:47:22.770
<v Speaker 4>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3120
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:25.170
<v Speaker 4>what happens if you autopsy and old</v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

3121
01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get some money and you got an old</v>

3122
01:47:26.581 --> 01:47:28.680
<v Speaker 4>folks home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their brain has shrunk.</v>

3123
01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:30.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their muscles have shrunk and away the</v>

3124
01:47:30.571 --> 01:47:33.870
<v Speaker 4>protein in their bones have shrunk and</v>
<v Speaker 4>away their kidneys have shrunk,</v>

3125
01:47:33.871 --> 01:47:35.790
<v Speaker 4>their hardest shrunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their skin has shrunk,</v>

3126
01:47:35.791 --> 01:47:38.060
<v Speaker 4>everything's shrunk because lost all</v>
<v Speaker 4>this protein.</v>

3127
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:40.500
<v Speaker 4>What happens is as you get older and</v>
<v Speaker 4>older,</v>

3128
01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:43.110
<v Speaker 4>you lose some of the capacity to digest</v>
<v Speaker 4>meat.</v>

3129
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:46.290
<v Speaker 4>And so what happens is where does your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body get that protein from?</v>

3130
01:47:47.010 --> 01:47:50.460
<v Speaker 4>It just starts taking it from yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start autocad cannibalizing yourself</v>

3131
01:47:50.970 --> 01:47:52.260
<v Speaker 4>to sustain function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3132
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:56.070
<v Speaker 4>it's sustained cellular function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're not getting that replaced,</v>

3133
01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:59.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through diet and meet as outstanding</v>

3134
01:47:59.551 --> 01:48:01.050
<v Speaker 4>source of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3135
01:48:01.051 --> 01:48:02.430
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be frailer and frailer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3136
01:48:02.431 --> 01:48:05.790
<v Speaker 4>we have an obesity epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we also have a frailty epidemic.</v>

3137
01:48:05.791 --> 01:48:09.150
<v Speaker 4>There's people that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean by the time they're 40 I mean</v>

3138
01:48:09.151 --> 01:48:10.410
<v Speaker 4>they may be obese but their weakest</v>

3139
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.130
<v Speaker 2>B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3140
01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:13.460
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people that are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sedentary lifestyles.</v>

3141
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:15.570
<v Speaker 2>One of the biggest killers of your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3142
01:48:15.571 --> 01:48:16.800
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many people that you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it,</v>

3143
01:48:16.801 --> 01:48:18.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to a guy the other day and</v>

3144
01:48:18.691 --> 01:48:22.410
<v Speaker 2>it looked like you could just grab his</v>
<v Speaker 2>arm and pull it off his body.</v>

3145
01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Like his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his shoulders were sunk in.</v>

3146
01:48:25.381 --> 01:48:26.950
<v Speaker 2>There was like no muscle tone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all.</v>

3147
01:48:26.951 --> 01:48:30.930
<v Speaker 2>And he had no exercise is that there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>none in his life ever.</v>

3148
01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe they made them do gym in high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school and that was it.</v>

3149
01:48:33.871 --> 01:48:36.960
<v Speaker 2>And he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's younger than me and he was falling</v>

3150
01:48:36.961 --> 01:48:38.260
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

3151
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:41.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I had 50 or like the bar for a</v>

3152
01:48:41.411 --> 01:48:43.460
<v Speaker 4>healthy 50 or normal 50 year old is you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3153
01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:46.410
<v Speaker 4>way down low and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like total outliers,</v>

3154
01:48:46.411 --> 01:48:48.030
<v Speaker 4>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that we exercise and have a</v>

3155
01:48:48.031 --> 01:48:50.970
<v Speaker 4>little muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that puts you in the 99% tall</v>

3156
01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:53.390
<v Speaker 2>and it's interesting if you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue it.</v>

3157
01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:56.480
<v Speaker 2>The thing about it is like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I take a week off man,</v>

3158
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:58.990
<v Speaker 2>boy do I feel it more at 50 than I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>it third?</v>

3159
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

3160
01:48:59.991 --> 01:49:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

3161
01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:04.070
<v Speaker 2>But I could still get back in shape and</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get back in shape,</v>

3162
01:49:04.071 --> 01:49:07.580
<v Speaker 2>you just got to keep it going and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keep it going,</v>

3163
01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:09.340
<v Speaker 2>it will work for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

3164
01:49:09.341 --> 01:49:12.920
<v Speaker 2>It's what we compare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting because what we</v>

3165
01:49:12.921 --> 01:49:16.310
<v Speaker 2>compare in terms of normal body</v>
<v Speaker 2>function,</v>

3166
01:49:16.311 --> 01:49:18.740
<v Speaker 2>like the normal capacity that your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

3167
01:49:19.130 --> 01:49:22.790
<v Speaker 2>we're really generally looking at people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had just the average person.</v>

3168
01:49:22.791 --> 01:49:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Well the average person doesn't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise very hard.</v>

3169
01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:28.370
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't have a lot of data on people</v>

3170
01:49:28.371 --> 01:49:29.600
<v Speaker 2>that are in their fifties it's still</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3171
01:49:29.610 --> 01:49:31.220
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not letting this go.</v>

3172
01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:32.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to keep this fucking body</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>

3173
01:49:33.110 --> 01:49:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make sure I lift heavy</v>
<v Speaker 2>weights.</v>

3174
01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do hard cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do sprinting and kickboxing</v>

3175
01:49:38.571 --> 01:49:41.720
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of shit that requires</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive energy.</v>

3176
01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:43.400
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do that,</v>

3177
01:49:43.401 --> 01:49:46.130
<v Speaker 2>your body can stay vibrant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be diligent.</v>

3178
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:48.400
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to understand this,</v>

3179
01:49:48.401 --> 01:49:51.850
<v Speaker 2>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're just a casual person who just</v>

3180
01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:53.110
<v Speaker 2>kind of like half as is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3181
01:49:53.111 --> 01:49:55.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe we'll take a spin class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck,</v>

3182
01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:55.790
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3183
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:58.330
<v Speaker 2>your body's gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to rot off and fall apart.</v>

3184
01:49:58.331 --> 01:50:01.060
<v Speaker 2>But if you just decide to be militant</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>

3185
01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:04.150
<v Speaker 2>you can keep a functional body far</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>

3186
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:08.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just about ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also just about the use of your</v>

3187
01:50:08.951 --> 01:50:11.680
<v Speaker 2>meat vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my body could do a lot of shit that</v>

3188
01:50:11.681 --> 01:50:12.850
<v Speaker 2>most people's bodies can't.</v>

3189
01:50:12.850 --> 01:50:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Like if I want to pick something up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to call somebody.</v>

3190
01:50:15.341 --> 01:50:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I just pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3191
01:50:16.751 --> 01:50:18.610
<v Speaker 2>And that just that alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3192
01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:20.920
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know that you can carry yourself.</v>

3193
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:25.330
<v Speaker 2>To know that you can do 50 chin ups to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you can move your body around</v>

3194
01:50:25.331 --> 01:50:28.300
<v Speaker 2>in a way that most people find to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost impossible.</v>

3195
01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my body to work better.</v>

3196
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:33.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like having a race car and you can</v>

3197
01:50:33.191 --> 01:50:37.300
<v Speaker 2>choose what horsepower engine it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on how much work you put on it.</v>

3198
01:50:37.570 --> 01:50:39.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's essentially what your body is.</v>

3199
01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:41.980
<v Speaker 2>You can choose how much tread you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your tires.</v>

3200
01:50:41.981 --> 01:50:44.470
<v Speaker 2>You can choose how good the suspension</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3201
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:47.050
<v Speaker 2>how supple it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how well it can maneuver based on</v>

3202
01:50:47.051 --> 01:50:51.940
<v Speaker 2>how much pyogenic exercises you do or</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many different explosive maneuvers,</v>

3203
01:50:51.941 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean and presses and things along those</v>

3204
01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:55.540
<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get that body to work.</v>

3205
01:50:55.541 --> 01:50:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3206
01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:57.090
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3207
01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:59.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at animals in the wild,</v>

3208
01:50:59.031 --> 01:50:59.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3209
01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:01.520
<v Speaker 4>if you're looking at a pack of animals</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting hunted,</v>

3210
01:51:01.521 --> 01:51:03.680
<v Speaker 4>which one's going to get killed and</v>
<v Speaker 4>which one are they going to pick out?</v>

3211
01:51:03.681 --> 01:51:04.820
<v Speaker 4>The Flyer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the frail,</v>

3212
01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:06.080
<v Speaker 4>the slow week one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3213
01:51:06.081 --> 01:51:08.270
<v Speaker 4>The old one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a human and we don't get</v>

3214
01:51:08.271 --> 01:51:10.070
<v Speaker 4>hunted by alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're a human,</v>

3215
01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:11.241
<v Speaker 4>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3216
01:51:11.241 --> 01:51:13.400
<v Speaker 4>my one was my peak athletic cism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3217
01:51:13.401 --> 01:51:17.000
<v Speaker 4>maybe 25 maybe 30 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in our 33rd 35 somewhere in</v>

3218
01:51:17.001 --> 01:51:17.834
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like your,</v>

3219
01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:19.610
<v Speaker 4>that's your top performance for most</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3220
01:51:19.670 --> 01:51:22.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The closer you can maintain that ability</v>

3221
01:51:22.671 --> 01:51:25.400
<v Speaker 4>as long as you possibly can and do</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it takes to get there,</v>

3222
01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:27.440
<v Speaker 4>the farther you are away from death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3223
01:51:27.441 --> 01:51:29.000
<v Speaker 4>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just simple nature.</v>

3224
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:31.220
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the slow the week they get eaten,</v>

3225
01:51:31.221 --> 01:51:32.360
<v Speaker 4>they die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get disease,</v>

3226
01:51:32.361 --> 01:51:33.194
<v Speaker 4>it become disabled.</v>

3227
01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:34.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3228
01:51:34.491 --> 01:51:36.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm 50 now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be a 60 year old guy</v>

3229
01:51:36.321 --> 01:51:38.000
<v Speaker 4>that's walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>limping around,</v>

3230
01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:39.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>needing assistance.</v>

3231
01:51:39.401 --> 01:51:40.280
<v Speaker 4>Somebody that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3232
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:42.440
<v Speaker 4>lift my groceries for me and this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we have.</v>

3233
01:51:42.441 --> 01:51:43.640
<v Speaker 4>Or even a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3234
01:51:43.641 --> 01:51:45.410
<v Speaker 4>women should be out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strength Training,</v>

3235
01:51:45.411 --> 01:51:47.310
<v Speaker 4>getting stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>swinging a heavy kettle bells.</v>

3236
01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:49.700
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] that's the other thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you brought up explosiveness,</v>

3237
01:51:49.701 --> 01:51:54.080
<v Speaker 4>because I think we're finally starting s</v>
<v Speaker 4>we finally went away from jogging.</v>

3238
01:51:54.110 --> 01:51:54.591
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3239
01:51:54.591 --> 01:51:57.110
<v Speaker 4>we went from the 1960s to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3240
01:51:57.111 --> 01:51:58.760
<v Speaker 4>early two thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's jogging.</v>

3241
01:51:58.761 --> 01:52:01.880
<v Speaker 4>That's what you do for health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then people started discovering strength</v>

3242
01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.440
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now we get people that are in there</v>

3243
01:52:03.441 --> 01:52:06.140
<v Speaker 4>lifting a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think what you also have to do,</v>

3244
01:52:06.141 --> 01:52:06.931
<v Speaker 4>and this is something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I,</v>

3245
01:52:06.931 --> 01:52:08.480
<v Speaker 4>I've got this whole training system</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3246
01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:09.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3247
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:12.530
<v Speaker 4>helping people with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think you have to do the explosive</v>

3248
01:52:12.531 --> 01:52:13.100
<v Speaker 4>work too.</v>

3249
01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:13.940
<v Speaker 4>So I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3250
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.470
<v Speaker 4>I get in there with medicine balls and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think a lot of people want to use,</v>

3251
01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:19.370
<v Speaker 4>I take medicine balls and I try to break</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking things.</v>

3252
01:52:19.371 --> 01:52:21.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I throw him as hard as I can,</v>

3253
01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:22.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm jumping,</v>

3254
01:52:22.581 --> 01:52:24.140
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm jumping with a vest on,</v>

3255
01:52:24.141 --> 01:52:24.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff,</v>

3256
01:52:24.621 --> 01:52:26.960
<v Speaker 4>you have to build up two and a half test</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be done in a safe manner.</v>

3257
01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:28.201
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sprinting,</v>

3258
01:52:28.201 --> 01:52:30.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm on an Airdyne bike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have you been on an Airdyne June?</v>

3259
01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:31.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love those.</v>

3260
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:33.260
<v Speaker 4>Those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was gonna say you gotta get one for</v>

3261
01:52:33.261 --> 01:52:36.510
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's all to have you bought new ones.</v>

3262
01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:37.611
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3263
01:52:37.611 --> 01:52:40.340
<v Speaker 4>Here's what I would tell you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a company called octane fitness.</v>

3264
01:52:40.341 --> 01:52:44.010
<v Speaker 4>It makes an Airdyne X.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably better than that aerosault</v>

3265
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.960
<v Speaker 4>bike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3266
01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:45.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3267
01:52:45.590 --> 01:52:46.510
<v Speaker 4>Pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

3268
01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:48.200
<v Speaker 4>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Octane fitness.</v>

3269
01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.770
<v Speaker 4>Codeine x nine x.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's better about it?</v>

3270
01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:53.390
<v Speaker 4>It's just solid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3271
01:52:53.391 --> 01:52:55.400
<v Speaker 4>it's solid as can be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just,</v>

3272
01:52:55.401 --> 01:52:55.970
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

3273
01:52:55.970 --> 01:52:57.200
<v Speaker 4>you can just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3274
01:52:57.201 --> 01:52:58.130
<v Speaker 4>in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3275
01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:00.680
<v Speaker 4>cause I've done everything train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean our broken world records on the</v>

3276
01:53:00.681 --> 01:53:02.570
<v Speaker 4>concept too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I know how to do the intense stuff</v>

3277
01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:05.740
<v Speaker 4>that airdyne those type things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The best thing you could do for the</v>

3278
01:53:05.741 --> 01:53:06.561
<v Speaker 4>short sprints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3279
01:53:06.561 --> 01:53:07.820
<v Speaker 4>they're still out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3280
01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:11.150
<v Speaker 4>there's so metabolically demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3281
01:53:11.151 --> 01:53:12.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they charged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3282
01:53:12.141 --> 01:53:14.530
<v Speaker 4>I think the only thing that I've always</v>
<v Speaker 4>had reservations about it,</v>

3283
01:53:14.531 --> 01:53:19.430
<v Speaker 4>it's like the sitting down part as far</v>
<v Speaker 4>as what I feel that like you would get</v>

3284
01:53:19.431 --> 01:53:21.560
<v Speaker 4>more exercise if you're supporting your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body weight.</v>

3285
01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:22.341
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3286
01:53:22.341 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3287
01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:24.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a skier you can do stuff like</v>

3288
01:53:24.801 --> 01:53:25.634
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3289
01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:28.880
<v Speaker 4>but I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get on that thing and you go as</v>

3290
01:53:28.881 --> 01:53:31.400
<v Speaker 4>hard as you fucking can for 30 seconds</v>
<v Speaker 4>or a minute,</v>

3291
01:53:31.401 --> 01:53:33.680
<v Speaker 4>a minute Seymour's man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time I did it for a minute,</v>

3292
01:53:33.681 --> 01:53:35.180
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I'm literally going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>drowned.</v>

3293
01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3294
01:53:36.261 --> 01:53:37.460
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I,</v>

3295
01:53:37.461 --> 01:53:38.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's what I do.</v>

3296
01:53:38.271 --> 01:53:40.400
<v Speaker 4>I'd tell I call these things chainsaw</v>
<v Speaker 4>intervals.</v>

3297
01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:43.190
<v Speaker 4>So I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretend there's some fucking maniac with</v>

3298
01:53:43.191 --> 01:53:46.640
<v Speaker 4>a chainsaw to cut you off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3299
01:53:46.641 --> 01:53:47.960
<v Speaker 4>you've got to go as hard as you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

3300
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.863
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

3301
01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:49.611
<v Speaker 4>I've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got,</v>

3302
01:53:49.611 --> 01:53:52.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't have that at home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to know the regular downwards</v>

3303
01:53:52.190 --> 01:53:54.020
<v Speaker 4>and I keep ranking the damn thing cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go too hard.</v>

3304
01:53:54.021 --> 01:53:55.250
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just not strong enough.</v>

3305
01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:57.890
<v Speaker 4>But when I go to the commercial gym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy that they just made that</v>

3306
01:53:57.891 --> 01:53:59.780
<v Speaker 4>and they showed they and told him he had</v>
<v Speaker 4>me doing it ahead of,</v>

3307
01:53:59.781 --> 01:54:02.800
<v Speaker 4>there's another mma guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I can't remember any member's</v>

3308
01:54:02.810 --> 01:54:04.650
<v Speaker 4>name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was like a pride champion guy,</v>

3309
01:54:04.710 --> 01:54:08.240
<v Speaker 4>like pride six or seven and they want it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's at the gym I'm at sometimes in</v>

3310
01:54:08.241 --> 01:54:08.990
<v Speaker 4>southern California.</v>

3311
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:11.480
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean that thing is you just try</v>

3312
01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:12.150
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have those?</v>

3313
01:54:12.150 --> 01:54:14.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure those guys would come up here</v>
<v Speaker 4>and let you demo it,</v>

3314
01:54:14.150 --> 01:54:16.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just get on there and go.</v>

3315
01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:18.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is the thing I talked about</v>

3316
01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:19.700
<v Speaker 4>when I talk about high intensity</v>
<v Speaker 4>interval training.</v>

3317
01:54:19.701 --> 01:54:23.030
<v Speaker 4>You know a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't get the high intensity part.</v>

3318
01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:23.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do,</v>

3319
01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.870
<v Speaker 4>they'll do two bottles where they'll go</v>
<v Speaker 4>90% a hundred percent of the first one</v>

3320
01:54:26.871 --> 01:54:30.020
<v Speaker 4>and the by the time the third one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're down to like 60% because the</v>

3321
01:54:30.021 --> 01:54:31.700
<v Speaker 4>rest intervals are too short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>

3322
01:54:31.701 --> 01:54:34.280
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go like somebody's going to kill you for</v>

3323
01:54:34.281 --> 01:54:38.150
<v Speaker 4>20 seconds and then rest three or four</v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes and then go again.</v>

3324
01:54:38.151 --> 01:54:39.530
<v Speaker 4>Cause then you keep hitting that high</v>
<v Speaker 4>intense.</v>

3325
01:54:39.531 --> 01:54:41.960
<v Speaker 4>What I do with exercise when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight lifting,</v>

3326
01:54:41.961 --> 01:54:43.220
<v Speaker 4>I take big breaks now.</v>

3327
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:45.130
<v Speaker 4>They used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for weightlifting,</v>

3328
01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:47.480
<v Speaker 4>I used to do like I just tried to burn</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself out.</v>

3329
01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:48.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to failure.</v>

3330
01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:51.440
<v Speaker 4>Short is like if I get 30 seconds break,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hi,</v>

3331
01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:52.131
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next set,</v>

3332
01:54:52.131 --> 01:54:52.964
<v Speaker 4>next set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3333
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:55.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem with that is you're just</v>

3334
01:54:55.011 --> 01:54:56.660
<v Speaker 4>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows what your training at the time.</v>

3335
01:54:56.661 --> 01:54:58.160
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a time to do the training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3336
01:54:58.161 --> 01:54:59.510
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3337
01:54:59.511 --> 01:55:00.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I break it up and I tell people how</v>

3338
01:55:00.891 --> 01:55:01.671
<v Speaker 4>to train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like look,</v>

3339
01:55:01.671 --> 01:55:04.250
<v Speaker 4>you train it for explosive and that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing you care about.</v>

3340
01:55:04.251 --> 01:55:05.870
<v Speaker 4>You don't get tired cause you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna,</v>

3341
01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:08.510
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna waste here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to be tense enough.</v>

3342
01:55:08.511 --> 01:55:10.370
<v Speaker 4>The same thing with the sprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>

3343
01:55:10.371 --> 01:55:13.610
<v Speaker 4>We'll lift and give yourself enough of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>break so that you can focus and do what</v>

3344
01:55:13.611 --> 01:55:14.420
<v Speaker 4>you need to do.</v>

3345
01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:17.570
<v Speaker 4>Then when it's conditioning time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can go get tired of that shit.</v>

3346
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:19.300
<v Speaker 4>Do it with lightweights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3347
01:55:19.670 --> 01:55:20.870
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the problems would like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3348
01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:23.990
<v Speaker 4>I think crossfit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of good elements to their,</v>

3349
01:55:23.991 --> 01:55:25.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of people that do</v>
<v Speaker 4>well with it,</v>

3350
01:55:25.401 --> 01:55:27.230
<v Speaker 4>but some of the exercises they pick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3351
01:55:27.231 --> 01:55:30.830
<v Speaker 4>like when you get tired doing snatches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the odds of you getting fucked up.</v>

3352
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:32.320
<v Speaker 4>Our high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very high.</v>

3353
01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.670
<v Speaker 4>So I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do something that's,</v>

3354
01:55:34.730 --> 01:55:37.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard and it's tiring and when you</v>

3355
01:55:37.431 --> 01:55:39.470
<v Speaker 4>get tired and your form breaks down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to get hurt.</v>

3356
01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:40.580
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she may do medicine,</v>

3357
01:55:40.581 --> 01:55:43.350
<v Speaker 4>ball slams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're jumping up and down on a box and</v>

3358
01:55:43.351 --> 01:55:44.184
<v Speaker 4>then you fuck up.</v>

3359
01:55:44.290 --> 01:55:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your shit bloody.</v>

3360
01:55:45.511 --> 01:55:45.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

3361
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:48.150
<v Speaker 3>what's the point of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just have a,</v>

3362
01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been told ropes are a great one for</v>

3363
01:55:50.161 --> 01:55:52.620
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no consequences to exhaust.</v>

3364
01:55:52.621 --> 01:55:53.610
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>

3365
01:55:53.611 --> 01:55:54.840
<v Speaker 3>that's the way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've been,</v>

3366
01:55:54.841 --> 01:55:57.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been training for almost 40 years,</v>

3367
01:55:57.091 --> 01:55:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Joe and I haven't taken a week off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taking a week off is all that,</v>

3368
01:55:59.521 --> 01:56:00.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take a week off.</v>

3369
01:56:00.251 --> 01:56:02.280
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know as you take too much time,</v>

3370
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:03.930
<v Speaker 3>you just don't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Miss.</v>

3371
01:56:03.931 --> 01:56:07.950
<v Speaker 3>The other thing about this diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my recovery passage capacity is huge.</v>

3372
01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can train super-intense every single</v>

3373
01:56:11.190 --> 01:56:11.450
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3374
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:12.990
<v Speaker 3>without a break,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is Kinda Nice.</v>

3375
01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:14.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the other thing that I get</v>

3376
01:56:14.941 --> 01:56:16.710
<v Speaker 3>people telling me all the time is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>doing all this personal record for non</v>

3379
01:56:21.571 --> 01:56:22.170
<v Speaker 3>athletes.</v>

3380
01:56:22.170 --> 01:56:23.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

3381
01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:26.400
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm talking about,</v>

3382
01:56:26.401 --> 01:56:27.061
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3383
01:56:27.061 --> 01:56:28.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get these people all the time,</v>

3384
01:56:28.261 --> 01:56:28.681
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3385
01:56:28.681 --> 01:56:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm hitting pushup records chinup</v>
<v Speaker 3>records.</v>

3386
01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:32.820
<v Speaker 3>But dead lift went up 100 pounds and</v>
<v Speaker 3>three months from,</v>

3387
01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:34.560
<v Speaker 3>from just eating meat and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3388
01:56:34.561 --> 01:56:37.200
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have people that are telling</v>

3389
01:56:37.201 --> 01:56:38.034
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I put my dad on his tie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3391
01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:42.090
<v Speaker 3>He's 74 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two months in the Diet.</v>

3392
01:56:42.091 --> 01:56:42.990
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>

3395
01:56:48.721 --> 01:56:50.580
<v Speaker 3>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just putting on muscle just cause</v>

3396
01:56:50.581 --> 01:56:53.160
<v Speaker 3>he's taken in so much animal tissue.</v>
