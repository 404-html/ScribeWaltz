00:04:43.921 --> 00:04:43.921
<v Speaker 1>the aging process.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Lysol on your Dick and this is,</v>

225
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.410
<v Speaker 1>isn't there a certain thing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>with chicks,</v>

231
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>a chick can't do,</v>

232
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in her past where you can just accept </v>

310
00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:33.721
<v Speaker 1>head because I know people get connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>with things.</v>

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to suck on this beard son Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But going back to what you're talking </v>

376
00:15:19.911 --> 00:15:24.911
<v Speaker 1>about is a bit weird fetishes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that people should just </v>

377
00:15:24.911 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 1>embrace what they are and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find.</v>

378
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.300
<v Speaker 1>All was saying too that I was saying,</v>

379
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.020
<v Speaker 2>me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

380
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:35.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is just an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's good to connect </v>

381
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:35.050
<v Speaker 2>violence and sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

382
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.570
<v Speaker 2>I connected feet with sex for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of this freaky girl that had did</v>

383
00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another wrong with that.</v>

384
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:43.751
<v Speaker 2>No one's getting hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you connect violence when sex and </v>

385
00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 2>then you get with somebody that you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>like and maybe she isn't into that shit,</v>

386
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

387
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest,</v>

388
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.070
<v Speaker 1>the violent sexual relationships really </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a lot of fucking shelf life.</v>

389
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.280
<v Speaker 1>She gotta assume you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>another girlfriend after this one that </v>

390
00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 1>wants you to choke her and brutalize </v>
<v Speaker 1>macro in the head.</v>

391
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.760
<v Speaker 1>How long are you going to stay with her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

392
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have kids and then like </v>

393
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.880
<v Speaker 1>involve them into the whole man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously</v>

394
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 2>people adapt and change and evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just,</v>

395
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.490
<v Speaker 2>there's something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about violence like </v>

396
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.600
<v Speaker 2>attacking and sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one thing about fucking someone </v>

397
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's another thing about,</v>

398
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:17.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it,</v>

399
00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 2>when it becomes some sort of like a sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a rape thing,</v>

400
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 2>like a rape fantasy,</v>

401
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.830
<v Speaker 1>some weird shit about rape fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is weird.</v>

402
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I do a joke about that Auto </v>

403
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Rocca fixation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like my,</v>

404
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole thing is get a spotter.</v>

405
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.350
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like get a buddy.</v>

406
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit there when you hang yourself.</v>

407
00:16:36.601 --> 00:16:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And you're whacking it and when your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes roll,</v>

408
00:16:38.401 --> 00:16:41.010
<v Speaker 1>they lift you up for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

409
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.660
<v Speaker 1>But because they're so scared of putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out there that they,</v>

410
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.920
<v Speaker 1>they hide hustling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

411
00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:49.320
<v Speaker 1>It would be a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean look,</v>

412
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:50.350
<v Speaker 1>think about all the shit</v>

413
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.760
<v Speaker 2>priest do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

414
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.240
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somehow,</v>

415
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgive themselves for it or justify it.</v>

416
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.060
<v Speaker 2>There was that one priest that Baptist </v>
<v Speaker 2>minister,</v>

417
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:04.061
<v Speaker 2>very famous guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously they're not the same as </v>

418
00:17:04.061 --> 00:17:06.011
<v Speaker 2>priests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who he died with a black dildo up </v>

419
00:17:06.011 --> 00:17:10.121
<v Speaker 2>his ass in a wet suit hanging because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>did the auto erotic association thing.</v>

420
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Just think of all the shit that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's willing to justify,</v>

421
00:17:13.461 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>

422
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

423
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.110
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a bad example because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said he was a bishop,</v>

424
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.440
<v Speaker 2>but hopefully they'll catch a priest </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the exact same thing and this will</v>

425
00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:26.441
<v Speaker 2>make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this poor guy couldn't just tell </v>

426
00:17:26.441 --> 00:17:26.441
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm in the weird.</v>

429
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm afraid I'm gonna die.</v>

430
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So coming to watch me beat up,</v>

431

<v Speaker 1>you can choke yourself or whack off on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it about people that just trip </v>

<v Speaker 4>Basic Man on the face and ass man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

463
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 3>there's two totally different things </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to,</v>

464
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:54.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with breast sexuality,</v>

465
00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:59.451
<v Speaker 3>what would make some sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's natural tits where you have </v>

466
00:18:59.451 --> 00:19:02.160
<v Speaker 3>conflict is a natural natural draw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just purely sexual.</v>

467
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 3>But there's a different draw with fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>tits,</v>

468
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 3>with fake tits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still a draw and you feel stupid</v>

469
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:13.221
<v Speaker 3>for being drawn to these stupid things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know that they're really </v>

470
00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:15.741
<v Speaker 3>just bags of water underneath the skin </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not the same draw from real </v>

471
00:19:15.741 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 3>tits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's something,</v>

472
00:19:16.801 --> 00:19:21.801
<v Speaker 3>a little extra dirty about the fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little extra turn you on a bit because</v>

473
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:23.340
<v Speaker 3>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's the,</v>

474
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 3>she wants so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

475
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:26.070
<v Speaker 3>I want to make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

476
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I really like that you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they could say that it's like that.</v>

477
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 3>They're just trying to look attractive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that good.</v>

478
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.670
<v Speaker 3>But what does that mean?</v>

479
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.380
<v Speaker 3>You want to look like somebody wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

480
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:36.210
<v Speaker 3>You want people to really want to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

481
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.780
<v Speaker 3>I would agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless it's one of those like,</v>

482
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got to be because of their really</v>

483
00:19:39.991 --> 00:19:40.580
<v Speaker 3>droopy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

484
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.760
<v Speaker 3>But for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

485
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:42.470
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

486
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.480
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>breast implants if you want to do it </v>

487
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:47.480
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong.</v>

488
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.180
<v Speaker 3>If I was a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably have,</v>

489
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:49.290

<v Speaker 3>How about breastfeeding?</v>

492
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 3>I think that's when girls is give up </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it hurts too much because that's</v>

493
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:57.990
<v Speaker 3>the only thing I can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a girl a long time ago.</v>

<v Speaker 6>fun shit.</v>

661
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.980
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

662
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.840
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever thought about why they </v>
<v Speaker 6>heckle?</v>

663
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:20.660
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

664
00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 6>there's a whole bunch of reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

665
00:26:22.521 --> 00:26:24.230
<v Speaker 6>They're all fucked up in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one,</v>

666
00:26:24.231 --> 00:26:25.850
<v Speaker 6>no one heckles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a cool person.</v>

667
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:30.890
<v Speaker 6>It's not what you would do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think girls heckled because they're </v>

668
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.570
<v Speaker 6>either attracted to you or they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're mad at someone else's.</v>

669
00:26:32.571 --> 00:26:37.571
<v Speaker 6>The center of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There could be that or you could be </v>

670
00:26:37.571 --> 00:26:40.901
<v Speaker 6>offensive to them and they feel like </v>
<v Speaker 6>they have the need to shut you up or </v>

671
00:26:40.901 --> 00:26:41.600
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can stop you.</v>

672
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:46.601
<v Speaker 6>I've had that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've experienced that before where I </v>

673
00:26:46.601 --> 00:26:46.601
<v Speaker 6>felt</v>

674
00:26:46.601 --> 00:26:46.601
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

675
00:26:46.601 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 2>like what I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a girl didn't agree with what I was</v>

676
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:49.020
<v Speaker 2>saying and she just was not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear it.</v>

677
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.730
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't hear it and she had a yell </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out.</v>

678
00:26:50.731 --> 00:26:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I've had that happen before where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

679
00:26:52.981 --> 00:26:57.981
<v Speaker 2>you could tell they just can't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like they're just too much a </v>

680
00:26:57.981 --> 00:26:57.981
<v Speaker 2>control freak or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

681
00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.480
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line is I've seen a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I didn't enjoy,</v>

682
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just left,</v>

683
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole thing.</v>

684
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:08.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like I hate comment cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with that man.</v>

685
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:13.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to know a bunch of people </v>

686
00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:13.450
<v Speaker 2>thought that guy socked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

687
00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:13.990
<v Speaker 2>if people pay them in cards or just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>mailing lists there.</v>

688
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:19.030
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much the club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get your information to </v>

689
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 2>advertise for it is boats also to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>feedback.</v>

690
00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 2>They read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they read the feedback.</v>

691
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:26.481
<v Speaker 2>Then I think there's some good things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because of a bunch of people got </v>

692
00:27:26.481 --> 00:27:26.970

693
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.940
<v Speaker 2>they should know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

694
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:33.050
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to find your own fucking </v>

695
00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:33.050
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

696
00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:33.750
<v Speaker 2>And until people knew what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of shows that I did were</v>

697
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:35.250
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people get offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

698
00:27:35.251 --> 00:27:40.251
<v Speaker 2>people that came to see like the fear </v>
<v Speaker 2>factor guy or some guy from television </v>

699
00:27:40.251 --> 00:27:44.301
<v Speaker 2>that they thought was cute and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about all kinds of crazy shit </v>

700
00:27:44.301 --> 00:27:48.650
<v Speaker 2>that they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't necessarily want to hear </v>

701
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:48.650
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

702
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.740
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally understand the whole feedback </v>

703
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:51.740
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

704
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm a yelp elite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get into the best thing about the </v>

705
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.950
<v Speaker 2>internet is all the criticism that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

706
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.790
<v Speaker 2>It seems to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's not,</v>

707
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 2>but it is because some of it is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it is very constructive.</v>

708
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Even if they're douchey about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

709
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.580
<v Speaker 2>think about how you would criticize </v>
<v Speaker 2>something anonymously if you were to </v>

710
00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:10.580
<v Speaker 2>totally anonymous and you weren't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>performer.</v>

711
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:15.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you saw something like it fucking </v>

712
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:15.620
<v Speaker 2>sucked donkey text.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy blows,</v>

713
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.560
<v Speaker 2>he's got this ridiculous outlook on </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

714
00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not well thought out at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear him making his dumb</v>

715
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:20.820
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:28:20.821 --> 00:28:25.821
<v Speaker 2>that's what you'd say if you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally anonymous and that's what </v>

717
00:28:25.821 --> 00:28:25.821
<v Speaker 2>they're going to say two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but guess what,</v>

718
00:28:25.821 --> 00:28:29.031
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the real reaction to you and it </v>

719
00:28:29.031 --> 00:28:31.341
<v Speaker 2>may be valid and it may not be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might be just fucking idiots who </v>

720
00:28:31.341 --> 00:28:34.791
<v Speaker 2>look for negative shit and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can't look at anything in a </v>

721
00:28:34.791 --> 00:28:38.271
<v Speaker 2>positive way and they could be jealous </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they could have all sorts of other </v>

722
00:28:38.271 --> 00:28:39.960
<v Speaker 2>issues where they don't like other men </v>
<v Speaker 2>having success or anybody having success</v>

723
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.670
<v Speaker 2>because they're unhappy if that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible too.</v>

724
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.040
<v Speaker 2>But it's also possible they got some </v>
<v Speaker 2>good points,</v>

725
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:44.880
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

726
00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:49.881
<v Speaker 2>I think it's real hard for us as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as comedians performance to totally </v>

727
00:28:49.881 --> 00:28:50.310
<v Speaker 2>objective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at your shit.</v>

728
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:51.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you don't want to.</v>

729
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you don't want to edit your </v>
<v Speaker 2>material or edit your writing or you </v>

730
00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.021
<v Speaker 2>don't want to like go back on it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>improve it again and improve it again </v>

731
00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:00.021
<v Speaker 2>and try to figure out like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with it?</v>

732
00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:01.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you get lazy,</v>

733
00:29:01.021 --> 00:29:05.250
<v Speaker 2>but people all that shit on Youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments and message boards,</v>

734
00:29:05.251 --> 00:29:06.570
<v Speaker 2>comments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all good for you,</v>

735
00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:11.571
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that that's the best </v>

736
00:29:11.571 --> 00:29:11.571
<v Speaker 2>thing for your psyche to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

737
00:29:11.571 --> 00:29:13.050
<v Speaker 2>to really see things objective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee.</v>

738
00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

739
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.850
<v Speaker 4>The biggest thing I get on youtube is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that drives me crazy is when people call</v>

740
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:20.370
<v Speaker 4>me racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just can't stand it because I'm really</v>

741
00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:21.600
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just can't,</v>

742
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.230
<v Speaker 4>can't even read that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't read anybody on the,</v>

743
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.260
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Internet because 90 percent of </v>

744
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.301
<v Speaker 4>them are people that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be just somebody you know </v>

745
00:29:32.301 --> 00:29:33.950
<v Speaker 4>fucking with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might just be an interesting.</v>

746
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.270
<v Speaker 2>We've got a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell this before you go.</v>

747
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.750
<v Speaker 2>We had a friend who broke up with a girl</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she got on every one of his youtube </v>

748
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 2>videos</v>

749
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 1>and would write nasty fucking comments </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

750
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:47.940
<v Speaker 1>She created like a whole profile just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck with them and that's what it is and</v>

751
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.950
<v Speaker 1>it easily or it's just one obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that's making multiple accounts </v>

752
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:54.970
<v Speaker 1>to make it seem like there's all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people flocking to you.</v>

753
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.830
<v Speaker 1>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that think you suck.</v>

754
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying we know somebody that does </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

755
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:05.100
<v Speaker 1>It does happen occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's not really worth </v>

756
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:05.530
<v Speaker 1>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

757
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the tone?</v>

758
00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 1>What are they saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they just being retarded?</v>

759
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.980
<v Speaker 1>But is it valid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something to it.</v>

760
00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it because it doesn't leave it.</v>

761
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave like he has a valid point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made the comment if it's just some </v>

762
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 1>stupid ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes no sense.</v>

763
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Some of you just want attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want attention.</v>

764
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:24.940
<v Speaker 1>They just want to react to that 15 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>olds on the computer.</v>

765
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Then you watch the documentary with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos Mencia.</v>

<v Speaker 1>youtube we heard about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a documentary called I am comic</v>

771
00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:46.591
<v Speaker 1>and in the comic documentary they talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them and see where he just youtube </v>

772
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.740

773
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.780
<v Speaker 1>He's just so he doesn't admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he explains what everyone's always </v>

774
00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.330
<v Speaker 1>accused him of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

775
00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.500
<v Speaker 1>he actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

776
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.980
<v Speaker 1>he actually like Jay tries to justify it</v>
<v Speaker 1>by saying that it's like sampling.</v>

777
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I actually wouldn't care about this at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

778
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:06.460
<v Speaker 1>So after you showed it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really was amazing.</v>

779
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:10.150

<v Speaker 1>imagine he would ever do.</v>

780
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have thought that it would have </v>

781
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:15.180
<v Speaker 1>been some sort of thinly veiled joke or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

782
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:15.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like come up with some sort of a</v>

784
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.270
<v Speaker 1>justification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

785
00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:21.760
<v Speaker 1>people are jealous or something and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just half asset,</v>

<v Speaker 7>When I come to a comedy club,</v>

810
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:28.190
<v Speaker 7>you better one bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You better get the forecast stage </v>

811
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:31.030
<v Speaker 7>because if anything even remotely funny,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to make it mine and Oh,</v>

812
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:33.240
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shouldn't Mexican in the front.</v>

813
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:36.630
<v Speaker 7>I'm like a rapper.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sampled and make it my own.</v>

814
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 7>What does it really my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what it sounds like,</v>

815
00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.080
<v Speaker 7>my kind of like somebody else's.</v>

816
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.730
<v Speaker 1>That's almost like watching a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>implode.</v>

817
00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:56.910
<v Speaker 1>There's something about seeing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what he's trying to do and make </v>

818
00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:56.910
<v Speaker 1>it look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

819
00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:58.160
<v Speaker 1>like he's a bad ass and he doesn't give </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fuck sort of like,</v>

820
00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I rob people,</v>

821
00:32:59.611 --> 00:33:02.790
<v Speaker 1>like a rapper would say it was the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing he could do.</v>

822
00:33:02.791 --> 00:33:07.791
<v Speaker 1>I think he needs to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he needs to finally come clean </v>

823
00:33:07.791 --> 00:33:10.731
<v Speaker 1>with it because that's the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you want us to live the next 30 </v>

824
00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:10.731
<v Speaker 1>years being the joke like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

825
00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:11.010
<v Speaker 1>watch out for that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

826
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I think he just had to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to justify it.</v>

827
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.920
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's trying to actually figure </v>

828
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:19.920
<v Speaker 1>out a way where it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

829
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Did you notice how he kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y'all had this amazing memory?</v>

830
00:33:21.781 --> 00:33:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I have this amazing memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're like,</v>

831
00:33:23.641 --> 00:33:26.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you did this is one time to kind of</v>

832
00:33:26.001 --> 00:33:28.190
<v Speaker 1>go up A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember that.</v>

833
00:33:28.191 --> 00:33:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

834
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

835
00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:31.870
<v Speaker 2>how about the dude doesn't have anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>written down.</v>

836
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.780
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that as a comic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something,</v>

837
00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

838
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:38.640
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of parts to being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comic like you,</v>

839
00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:40.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this can't stand up.</v>

840
00:33:40.511 --> 00:33:45.511
<v Speaker 2>Comedy is not just your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how you get those ideas out and </v>

841
00:33:45.511 --> 00:33:47.500
<v Speaker 2>that needs honing and you'll take these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

842
00:33:47.501 --> 00:33:49.810
<v Speaker 2>You'll have an idea for a bit or an idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>for something.</v>

843
00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:55.410
<v Speaker 2>I write everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write out what I think about </v>

844
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:55.410
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write out what I think about a subject</v>

845
00:33:55.410 --> 00:34:00.121
<v Speaker 2>just so I know like what my real </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and points are and then once I </v>

846
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:00.400
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I start dissecting it.</v>

847
00:34:00.401 --> 00:34:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's funny about this,</v>

848
00:34:01.751 --> 00:34:04.150
<v Speaker 2>when we get to the meat of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I feel about this.</v>

849
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me get to the meat of this.</v>

850
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Now let me get on stage and let me </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what's the best way to do </v>

851
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:10.440
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to introduce this part of the</v>

852
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.061
<v Speaker 2>idea first?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to go right into the </v>

853
00:34:15.061 --> 00:34:15.061
<v Speaker 2>punchline right away so it's totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected,</v>

854
00:34:15.061 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 2>but right to the meat of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the joke and then like build onto the </v>

855
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 2>thing once I've already told them what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

856
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.400
<v Speaker 2>build onto it afterwards and make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just more ridiculous.</v>

857
00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Like how am I gonna approach this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a,</v>

858
00:34:23.321 --> 00:34:25.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of craft to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

859
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alibaba,</v>

860
00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.280
<v Speaker 2>that invites involves writing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can sort of remember it,</v>

861
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gone through periods of time where </v>

862
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch of bits that they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of came up on stage,</v>

863
00:34:36.161 --> 00:34:41.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were attached to other bits </v>

864
00:34:41.161 --> 00:34:41.161
<v Speaker 2>and then they branched out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>became bits of their own.</v>

865
00:34:41.161 --> 00:34:45.480
<v Speaker 2>But I never actually wrote them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just knew how to do them from doing a </v>

866
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:45.480
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

867
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.900
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to create,</v>

868
00:34:46.901 --> 00:34:49.480
<v Speaker 2>to really give something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some time and some consideration,</v>

869
00:34:49.481 --> 00:34:52.810
<v Speaker 2>you've got to sit in front of a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of paper and think you know,</v>

870
00:34:52.811 --> 00:34:57.811
<v Speaker 2>you kinda right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're doing standup and you're </v>

871
00:34:57.811 --> 00:34:57.811
<v Speaker 2>not writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

872
00:34:57.811 --> 00:34:59.140
<v Speaker 2>I kinda know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda think that you're just,</v>

873
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:04.320
<v Speaker 2>how is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are those even really truly your </v>

874
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.301
<v Speaker 2>opinions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your opinions are like all </v>

875
00:35:06.301 --> 00:35:06.301
<v Speaker 2>conglomerated with all the people around</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

876
00:35:06.301 --> 00:35:09.010
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know what the opinion is </v>
<v Speaker 2>until it's you by yourself.</v>

877
00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Your act is alive until it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

878
00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.270
<v Speaker 2>It's constantly evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

879
00:35:13.271 --> 00:35:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I always say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say that it's almost like A.</v>

880
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's very pretentious sounding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I say it's almost like a living,</v>

881
00:35:18.041 --> 00:35:23.041
<v Speaker 2>breathing philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to say philosophy </v>

882
00:35:23.041 --> 00:35:24.280
<v Speaker 2>because that sounds really fucking yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and pull yourself,</v>

883
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:26.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that it's a philosophy,</v>

884
00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:31.591
<v Speaker 2>but it's the way of looking at life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is my way of looking at </v>

885
00:35:31.591 --> 00:35:35.371
<v Speaker 2>this particular situation that's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on and this particular time and then </v>

886
00:35:35.371 --> 00:35:39.001
<v Speaker 2>once it's recorded it's like frozen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes like know part of you </v>

887
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:39.001
<v Speaker 2>know</v>

888
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:39.480
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who your life was.</v>

889
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's.</v>

890
00:35:40.141 --> 00:35:41.200
<v Speaker 3>But that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

891
00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:46.260
<v Speaker 3>So everything I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to turn into a joke at some </v>

892
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.260
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

893
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.610
<v Speaker 3>how much time do you spend actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in front of pieces of paper or </v>

894
00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.730
<v Speaker 3>computer writing here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a little different man.</v>

895
00:35:50.731 --> 00:35:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll sit down and write,</v>

896
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:56.220
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I have to flow on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get going.</v>

897
00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.410
<v Speaker 3>I'll write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But literally man,</v>

898
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.440
<v Speaker 3>I talked to myself all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just worked a bit worse a bit and like</v>

899
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:05.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be okay here.</v>

900
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

901
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:08.250
<v Speaker 3>Tag Tag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tag cut down.</v>

902
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:13.430
<v Speaker 3>And I don't want to work at too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get on stage one time </v>

903
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:15.150
<v Speaker 3>getting the natural part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

904
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

905
00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.330
<v Speaker 3>And then just flow and see where it goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just try to talk through it.</v>

906
00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:24.330
<v Speaker 3>And isn't it funny how you got an idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you write it out and you think that </v>

907
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.550
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna say it one way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then when you're on stage at the </v>

908
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:27.660
<v Speaker 3>moment just tells you to say it a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

909
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.840
<v Speaker 3>And now little difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pam could make this fucking huge </v>

910
00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.811
<v Speaker 3>reaction to just a word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tweak a bit man or a pause or </v>

911
00:36:35.811 --> 00:36:37.380
<v Speaker 3>just to setting it up correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

912
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:39.060
<v Speaker 3>there's such a craft to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

913
00:36:39.061 --> 00:36:41.730
<v Speaker 3>It's just something that you're always </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking with you.</v>

914
00:36:41.731 --> 00:36:43.140
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so satisfying.</v>

915
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.060
<v Speaker 3>But for a lot of people it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>stressful.</v>

916
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:50.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of dudes that eventually </v>

917
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.450
<v Speaker 3>they want to get out and they want to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>tv shows and shit like that because just</v>

918
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:52.580
<v Speaker 3>doing the standup all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just relying only on the standup.</v>

919
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.200
<v Speaker 3>It's just such a fucking wild ride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

920
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need like Louis C,</v>

921
00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:58.200
<v Speaker 3>k does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

922
00:36:58.201 --> 00:36:59.640
<v Speaker 3>He does it crazy,</v>

930
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Do you find yourself always been able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with some mat?</v>

931
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I go like a month without </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing anything I like and I'm like,</v>

932
00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.040
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so go nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 3>what fixes that we'd,</v>

935
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.880
<v Speaker 3>we'd fixes the shit out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't smoke weed though?</v>

936
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I quit pretty much drink too.</v>

937
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:37.860
<v Speaker 3>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at w,</v>

938
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.040
<v Speaker 3>when did you stop drinking again about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

939
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:45.680
<v Speaker 3>like two months ago after Canada attempt</v>
<v Speaker 3>to believe through an them towels.</v>

940
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Then what's your addiction right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What division do you got going on right </v>

941
00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:50.830
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any.</v>

942
00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like a finger in,</v>

943
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:57.440
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the way I think you should look </v>

944
00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.321
<v Speaker 3>at pot when it comes to comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Po is like a turbo charger for your </v>

945
00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:01.470
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideas that you have normally,</v>

946
00:38:01.471 --> 00:38:04.080
<v Speaker 3>they'll become much more expressive to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go down different alleys.</v>

947
00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:09.410
<v Speaker 3>It's an enhancer for your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't appreciate how much of an </v>

948
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:10.590
<v Speaker 3>enhancer it is because it's associated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with silliness.</v>

949
00:38:10.591 --> 00:38:15.591
<v Speaker 3>It's associated with losers and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to sit on the couch and eat </v>

950
00:38:15.591 --> 00:38:16.830
<v Speaker 3>munchies and it's associated with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of dumb,</v>

951
00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:21.831
<v Speaker 3>Lazy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is that the effect of </v>

952
00:38:21.831 --> 00:38:23.280
<v Speaker 3>marijuana is fucking magical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much to it.</v>

953
00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:28.281
<v Speaker 3>There's so much creatively that happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you when you're writing and you get </v>

954
00:38:28.281 --> 00:38:30.600
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These ideas just come flowing 300,</v>

955
00:38:30.601 --> 00:38:35.601
<v Speaker 3>400 percent better than when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>sober and don't recognize can you kind </v>

956
00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:40.120
<v Speaker 3>of treated as an end theologian treated </v>
<v Speaker 3>as something that's helping to enlighten</v>

957
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:45.121
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>treat it as something that you're gonna </v>

958
00:38:45.121 --> 00:38:45.121
<v Speaker 3>use as a tool as you just want to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up and party.</v>

959
00:38:45.121 --> 00:38:46.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the fine line because if you're a</v>

960
00:38:46.631 --> 00:38:49.660
<v Speaker 3>guy who doesn't have the best self </v>
<v Speaker 3>control and that's what most comics are,</v>

961
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:52.750
<v Speaker 3>most of us are fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why we do comedy in the first</v>

962
00:38:52.751 --> 00:38:54.430
<v Speaker 3>place because we really couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything else.</v>

963
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise we would've done something </v>
<v Speaker 3>else because it beginning.</v>

964
00:38:56.591 --> 00:38:58.810
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking hard and no one thinks </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to make it.</v>

965
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 3>You literally have to have almost no </v>
<v Speaker 3>options and the guys who do have options</v>

966
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:04.360
<v Speaker 3>tend to go to those options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

967
00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:09.450
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even if even if you do have those </v>

968
00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:10.210
<v Speaker 3>options span and it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a comic is going to blow shit off,</v>

969
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.560
<v Speaker 3>there's just no way around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

970
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:17.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the only way we got to be where </v>

971
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:17.940
<v Speaker 3>we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be fucking above rapper.</v>

972
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be at least fucked up.</v>

973
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.310
<v Speaker 3>One starts at like rappers.</v>

974
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so hard to wrangle,</v>

975
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:28.561
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to just fuck was my original </v>

976
00:39:28.561 --> 00:39:30.841
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You thought I was smoking weed enhances </v>

977
00:39:30.841 --> 00:39:30.841
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially music.</v>

978
00:39:30.841 --> 00:39:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I think you should do is just,</v>

979
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:34.600
<v Speaker 3>if you want to try it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to do it at all,</v>

980
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 3>treated as if you're going to go through</v>
<v Speaker 3>and experience.</v>

981
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Don't treat it as if you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up and party.</v>

982
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.900
<v Speaker 3>That's how I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I write,</v>

983
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.230
<v Speaker 3>I treated it as if I'm ready to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to experience something.</v>

984
00:39:44.231 --> 00:39:46.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go deeper into my mind and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say,</v>

985
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just get fucked up.</v>

986
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Put them on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do some writing,</v>

987
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:49.930
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I say,</v>

988
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:51.310
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting ready to right here.</v>

989
00:39:51.311 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 3>I got these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to,</v>

990
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:55.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in touch with the spirit world.</v>

991
00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just thinks of it as a fucking tool to </v>

992
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:00.540
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

993
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:00.540
<v Speaker 3>If it didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

994
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 3>and if it wasn't illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't have all these things attached</v>

995
00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:05.110
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think that shit is magic.</v>

996
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.620
<v Speaker 3>It makes fucking way better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes food taste better,</v>

997
00:40:08.621 --> 00:40:11.520
<v Speaker 3>it makes you nicer and it makes you way </v>
<v Speaker 3>funnier.</v>

998
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Way more creative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way more honest.</v>

999
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.650
<v Speaker 3>Like your shit resonates more when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're high.</v>

1000
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can perform high dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My head just try.</v>

1001
00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:25.680
<v Speaker 3>I think some people are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're wired different because I </v>

1002
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.660
<v Speaker 3>understand being to stumbling on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think when I'm.</v>

1003
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:32.730
<v Speaker 3>When I'm stoned I think about something </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I obsess about something and like </v>

1004
00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.400
<v Speaker 3>ideas and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't actually like my,</v>

1005
00:40:33.401 --> 00:40:35.920
<v Speaker 3>like my okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying,</v>

1006
00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:39.700
<v Speaker 3>but the reason why you don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on stage stone would be fun.</v>

1007
00:40:39.701 --> 00:40:44.701
<v Speaker 3>It's because going on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a comfortable part of your </v>

1008
00:40:44.701 --> 00:40:44.701
<v Speaker 3>everyday life.</v>

1009
00:40:44.701 --> 00:40:45.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like you know how you can sit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>edit stoned,</v>

1010
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:50.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get high and then it makes you </v>

1011
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:50.900
<v Speaker 3>more creative and it's more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't like talking to people.</v>

1012
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Usually when I'm still in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I,</v>

1013
00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:56.701
<v Speaker 3>if I get stoned and talked to my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be worse than if I was </v>

1014
00:40:56.701 --> 00:40:56.701
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what you mean?</v>

1015
00:40:56.701 --> 00:40:56.950
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for me,</v>

1016
00:40:56.951 --> 00:40:58.660
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just an experience thing.</v>

1017
00:40:58.661 --> 00:41:01.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just like you got to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable with the experience and when</v>

1018
00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 3>you've been doing comedy for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing it 22 years almost.</v>

1019
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be 22 years in August.</v>

1020
00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:08.440
<v Speaker 3>That's a long ass time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1021
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:13.590
<v Speaker 3>When you're doing it for that long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really does become just like another </v>

1022
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:13.590
<v Speaker 3>thing you do in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

1023
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:18.340
<v Speaker 3>doesn't freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you get high it's like you just </v>

1024
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:22.590
<v Speaker 3>tune into that thing better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can just fucking connect to it </v>

1025
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:22.590
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1026
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:26.410
<v Speaker 3>When did you start smoking weed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think when I first met you,</v>

1027
00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:28.150
<v Speaker 3>you weren't a weed smoker?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1028
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:29.470
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>

1029
00:41:29.471 --> 00:41:31.160
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was for losers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>

1030
00:41:31.161 --> 00:41:32.590
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what made that change?</v>

1031
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.590
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried it.</v>

1032
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1033
00:41:34.881 --> 00:41:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo is the dude who turned me </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto it because Eddie and I were,</v>

1034
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.690
<v Speaker 2>we met at Jujitsu and we were going out </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lunch or talking about some shit.</v>

1035
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:43.000
<v Speaker 2>And he's a smart dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1036
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.460
<v Speaker 2>we had really similar philosophies on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of different things on,</v>

1037
00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:52.140
<v Speaker 2>on politics and on the way the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>works and like how strange everything </v>

1038
00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:52.140
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a very curious,</v>

1039
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 2>very similar point of view to mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he would talk about getting high all</v>

1040
00:41:56.331 --> 00:41:58.910
<v Speaker 2>the time and doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making this music and shit.</v>

1041
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck is that good for you man?</v>

1042
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pontus makes you fucking lazy.</v>

1043
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1044
00:42:04.791 --> 00:42:05.050
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1045
00:42:05.051 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all propaganda.</v>

1046
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:08.060
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know what you're doing,</v>

1047
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:10.310
<v Speaker 2>if you smoke the wrong kind of weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you smoke too much,</v>

1048
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:11.450
<v Speaker 2>if you do it when you're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1049
00:42:11.451 --> 00:42:12.770
<v Speaker 2>you associate all these negative things </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>

1050
00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 2>just try it.</v>

1051
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.430
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1052
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

1053
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:17.210
<v Speaker 2>let's try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from that day,</v>

1054
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.820
<v Speaker 2>from that day getting high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized I'm like,</v>

1055
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

1056
00:42:21.141 --> 00:42:26.141
<v Speaker 2>Here's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a plant that gives you an </v>

1057
00:42:26.141 --> 00:42:28.160
<v Speaker 2>altered state of consciousness that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually makes things seem more.</v>

1058
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:31.310
<v Speaker 2>You're more sensitive to things and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you more aware of.</v>

1059
00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:35.540
<v Speaker 2>It feels like some weird like </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence enhancer,</v>

1060
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:38.050
<v Speaker 2>it feels like it makes you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you dopey,</v>

1061
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.340
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that sometimes you get so </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with one idea,</v>

1062
00:42:40.341 --> 00:42:44.290
<v Speaker 2>you can't multitask at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you get how to fucking,</v>

1063
00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you spell someone's name and your</v>

1064
00:42:46.101 --> 00:42:51.101
<v Speaker 2>phone or if you can get some weird shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you forget what you were talking about </v>

1065
00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:53.660
<v Speaker 2>because there's just so much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a flood and it's just the.</v>

1066
00:42:53.661 --> 00:42:55.610
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key to the experience to using it as</v>

1067
00:42:55.611 --> 00:43:00.611
<v Speaker 2>to learning how to relax and learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to get rid of all the shit that </v>

1068
00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:00.611
<v Speaker 2>makes you paranoid.</v>

1069
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Because when dudes get paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you freak out about shit,</v>

1070
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.200
<v Speaker 2>you should be freaking out about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck it is,</v>

1071
00:43:06.201 --> 00:43:07.460
<v Speaker 2>you're freaking out about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you.</v>

1072
00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:09.620
<v Speaker 2>When you get high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is something that you've put in the</v>

1073
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:14.621
<v Speaker 2>back of your head and you're avoiding </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an issue that you need to </v>

1074
00:43:14.621 --> 00:43:15.380
<v Speaker 2>resolve and once you do resolve those </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

1075
00:43:15.381 --> 00:43:17.300
<v Speaker 2>once you don't have anything fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your head.</v>

1076
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Once you let come to terms with who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in this life and and try to put it,</v>

1077
00:43:21.481 --> 00:43:23.630
<v Speaker 2>put out good energy and you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with it,</v>

1078
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:28.990
<v Speaker 2>then you can ride that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when you get high you can fucking </v>

1079
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:32.350
<v Speaker 2>tune into it all so you can get really </v>
<v Speaker 2>high and not be paranoid and instead of </v>

1080
00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:33.710
<v Speaker 2>being paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn how to like,</v>

1081
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:38.711
<v Speaker 2>let go and tune into some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher state of truth than what you're </v>

1082
00:43:39.351 --> 00:43:40.850
<v Speaker 2>normally able to experience.</v>

1083
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:45.970
<v Speaker 2>You can see things in a perspective that</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem to be available to you in a</v>

1084
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:49.520
<v Speaker 2>sober state as much as you meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as you try to release.</v>

1085
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Even if I'm in an isolation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about there's a </v>

1086
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.610
<v Speaker 2>connection that plant gives you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else,</v>

1087
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we just,</v>

1088
00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:02.440
<v Speaker 2>we have it categorized as something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like silly and we have it </v>

1089
00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:02.480
<v Speaker 2>categorized as something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1090
00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.670
<v Speaker 2>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we watched this movie,</v>

1091
00:44:04.671 --> 00:44:09.671
<v Speaker 2>it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is totally true to you can do </v>

1092
00:44:09.671 --> 00:44:09.671
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you smoke like couch weed,</v>

1093
00:44:09.671 --> 00:44:12.620
<v Speaker 2>but you can also smoke weed and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out the universe.</v>

1094
00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean Carl Sagan used to smoke weed </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

1095
00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:21.090
<v Speaker 6>Why it is I think the propaganda that </v>
<v Speaker 6>went along with the people who didn't </v>

1096
00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:21.100
<v Speaker 6>want you thinking like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>that stuff.</v>

1098
00:44:24.281 --> 00:44:27.790
<v Speaker 6>It's like when you get high or you do </v>
<v Speaker 6>shrooms and all that stuff,</v>

1099
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:29.620
<v Speaker 6>you start seeing things differently.</v>

1100

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know the people who say that all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them don't smoke weed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>retards.</v>

1119

<v Speaker 2>these people that are just their life is</v>

1124
00:45:29.311 --> 00:45:34.311
<v Speaker 2>a fucking holy rack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The relationships are filled with </v>

1125
00:45:34.311 --> 00:45:37.250
<v Speaker 2>fucking yelling and screaming and chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of dysfunctional bullshit </v>

1126
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:39.810
<v Speaker 2>and drugs and alcoholism and in hate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger.</v>

1127
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:42.360
<v Speaker 2>And these kids grow up in that and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucked.</v>

1128
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they grew up in that.</v>

1129
00:45:43.621 --> 00:45:48.621
<v Speaker 2>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get poor programming when they're </v>

1130
00:45:48.621 --> 00:45:50.271
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they never figured out how to really </v>

1131
00:45:50.271 --> 00:45:50.271
<v Speaker 2>see the world and healthy and loving </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1132
00:45:50.271 --> 00:45:51.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always need either always angry.</v>

1133
00:45:51.871 --> 00:45:56.871
<v Speaker 2>There was always negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how they're fucking </v>

1134
00:45:56.871 --> 00:45:59.090
<v Speaker 2>programmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to program kids just </v>

1135
00:45:59.090 --> 00:45:59.090
<v Speaker 2>like them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless something snaps them out of it,</v>

1136
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:03.620
<v Speaker 2>whether they get addicted to meditation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and become a monk or getting into </v>

1137
00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.670
<v Speaker 2>martial arts or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn,</v>

1138
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.920
<v Speaker 2>learn how to do a fucking sport where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get out of here wherever the </v>

1139
00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:09.920
<v Speaker 2>fuck you are you're at and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1140
00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and figure things out for yourself.</v>

1141
00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:16.250
<v Speaker 2>But you need to like really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>rethink your whole world when you're </v>

1142
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.280
<v Speaker 2>raised like that for most people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so fucking hard.</v>

1143
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of nowhere.</v>

1144
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I think people are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just slowly dying.</v>

1145
00:46:21.811 --> 00:46:26.811
<v Speaker 2>It's just like to go out there and learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>about all this stuff takes effort and I </v>

1146
00:46:26.811 --> 00:46:27.870
<v Speaker 2>just saw my chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't want to do that.</v>

1147
00:46:27.871 --> 00:46:32.871
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're too lazy and they want you to </v>

1148
00:46:32.871 --> 00:46:32.871
<v Speaker 2>think the way they're thinking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what being a right wing person is</v>

1151
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:42.501
<v Speaker 2>all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what people who are nationalism </v>

<v Speaker 2>internationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's all about.</v>

1153
00:46:42.501 --> 00:46:45.210
<v Speaker 2>It's all about you thinking like we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all part of this one thing.</v>

1154

1157
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Their idols crashes and Burns instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>

00:46:56.221 --> 00:46:58.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we don't have.</v>

1159
00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.240
<v Speaker 2>We don't see it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1160

<v Speaker 2>Anybody you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to talk this fucking thing out.</v>

1163
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.410
<v Speaker 2>You can't say you have the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many questions.</v>

1164
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:15.390
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too tricky.</v>

1165
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.460
<v Speaker 2>You never have crossed over and come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1166
00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:22.461
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them have never even had </v>

1167
00:47:22.461 --> 00:47:24.111
<v Speaker 2>alternate experiences like psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences that they can add to their </v>

1168
00:47:24.111 --> 00:47:24.150
<v Speaker 2>model of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1169
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:29.151
<v Speaker 2>there's altered states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be achieved by fucking plants on </v>

1170
00:47:29.151 --> 00:47:29.151
<v Speaker 2>this that are growing here on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

1171
00:47:29.151 --> 00:47:33.401
<v Speaker 2>Know if there really was God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think it would just leave things </v>

1172
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:33.401
<v Speaker 2>like that there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if God,</v>

1173
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:35.020
<v Speaker 2>if there was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a god and he had a plan.</v>

1174
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:40.170
<v Speaker 2>If you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you really should believe in </v>

1175
00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics because they're there for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking reason.</v>

1176
00:47:40.331 --> 00:47:43.360
<v Speaker 2>God's not just going to put some shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes you have these beautiful,</v>

1177
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:44.440
<v Speaker 2>loving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>

1178
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:48.160
<v Speaker 2>incredibly mind expanding experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a dumb coincidence.</v>

1179
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a dumb coincidence that that</v>

1180
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 2>grows on cow shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're religious,</v>

1181
00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.900
<v Speaker 2>you should be into psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences and if you into psychedelic </v>

1182
00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:01.591
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you're going to say is </v>

1183
00:48:01.591 --> 00:48:01.591
<v Speaker 2>no one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't know.</v>

1184
00:48:01.591 --> 00:48:02.620
<v Speaker 2>There's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no answers.</v>

1185
00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:08.010
<v Speaker 2>We all have to try to figure out what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best model of behavior for this </v>

1186
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:12.421
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the best way we can get by with </v>

1187
00:48:12.421 --> 00:48:13.030
<v Speaker 2>the most positive energy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we don't know what the fuck am I</v>

1188
00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 2>believe in Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1189
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:15.550
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1190
00:48:15.551 --> 00:48:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck did I do.</v>

1191
00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:20.710
<v Speaker 2>I totally believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be like,</v>

1192
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:22.800
<v Speaker 2>it might not happen today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow,</v>

1193
00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 2>a year from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will come back.</v>

1194
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my take on Karma.</v>

1195
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even the way we think of Karma,</v>

1196
00:48:29.621 --> 00:48:31.780
<v Speaker 2>we think of it selfishly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we think,</v>

1197
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:36.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do bad things because I </v>

1198
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:36.810
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1199
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:36.810
<v Speaker 2>good things come back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to do good things.</v>

1200
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:38.500
<v Speaker 2>So the good thing come back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1201
00:48:38.501 --> 00:48:40.420
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even the term Karma,</v>

1202
00:48:40.421 --> 00:48:42.340
<v Speaker 2>like the way people use it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Karma.</v>

1203
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 2>See what happened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Karma.</v>

1204
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:46.150
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like self justifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1205
00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I think the way to look at it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1206
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:54.270
<v Speaker 2>and this is all shit that I like decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>on after I had dmt trips,</v>

1207
00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:59.510
<v Speaker 2>is that I think all the energy that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>put out,</v>

1208
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:04.670
<v Speaker 2>so it's sort of your choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of your choice to be positive </v>

1209
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 2>and when you're positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive will resonate more positive.</v>

1210
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:08.920
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put yourself in a,</v>

1211
00:49:08.921 --> 00:49:11.050
<v Speaker 2>in a group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put yourself in a,</v>

1212
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:11.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1213
00:49:11.941 --> 00:49:15.490
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a think group that are all like that.</v>

1214
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.530
<v Speaker 2>When you're positive and you're like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>friendly,</v>

1215
00:49:17.531 --> 00:49:20.020
<v Speaker 2>loving person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to naturally have that kind</v>

1216
00:49:20.021 --> 00:49:21.790
<v Speaker 2>of behavior from your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to,</v>

1217
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:26.820
<v Speaker 2>they're going to feel like they can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way with you and that's going to </v>

1218
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.011
<v Speaker 2>ripple out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all the people that are gonna be </v>

1219
00:49:29.011 --> 00:49:31.321
<v Speaker 2>in your circle after awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to be like loving </v>

1220
00:49:31.321 --> 00:49:31.570
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool people and that's possible,</v>

1221
00:49:31.571 --> 00:49:32.830
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can all do that.</v>

1222
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:36.160
<v Speaker 2>We literally can all do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just hard to do.</v>

1223
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:37.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

1224
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.660
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find cool people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find people that you can,</v>

1225
00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.040
<v Speaker 2>you can open up with and you'd be cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it and you get to a point in your </v>

1226
00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.440
<v Speaker 2>life where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1227
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.570
<v Speaker 2>you want them to be successful.</v>

1228
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:53.050
<v Speaker 2>You want them to be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want great things for them,</v>

1229
00:49:53.051 --> 00:49:55.810
<v Speaker 2>like literally want that for them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as you would want it for you.</v>

1230
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of thinking of Karma as like,</v>

1231
00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do good thing.</v>

1232
00:49:59.391 --> 00:50:01.120
<v Speaker 2>So do good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come back to you.</v>

1233
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:05.920
<v Speaker 2>It's more to me like your energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all energy and when you,</v>

1234
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:10.950
<v Speaker 2>you resonate positive energy and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you push forth positive energy is </v>

1235
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:14.470
<v Speaker 2>fucking hippie and crystals and yoga </v>
<v Speaker 2>beads as that sounds.</v>

1236
00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I really think that shit is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how the universe works.</v>

1237
00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're a negative negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>

1238
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Shit's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to,</v>

1239
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:27.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think a lot of the times when we </v>

1240
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.390
<v Speaker 2>have negative content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our life,</v>

1241
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1242
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:31.620
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is a mathematical problem and some </v>

1243
00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:31.620
<v Speaker 2>things will come up in your life.</v>

1244
00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>

1245
00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Job Boss,</v>

1246
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:35.180
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's things that come up in your life</v>

1247
00:50:35.181 --> 00:50:40.181
<v Speaker 2>that are absolutely negative and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>your job to figure out how the fuck to </v>

1248
00:50:40.181 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 2>get past this part of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that simple.</v>

1249
00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 2>You don't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my fucking job sucks.</v>

1250
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 2>There's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My boss was a Douche,</v>

1251
00:50:45.561 --> 00:50:49.450
<v Speaker 2>so I'm getting fucking ulcers because my</v>
<v Speaker 2>boss is fucking always on my ass.</v>

1252
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:50.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm always nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1253
00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:52.490
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an intelligence test.</v>

1254
00:50:52.491 --> 00:50:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>

1255
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:54.350
<v Speaker 2>you've reached a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:56.030
<v Speaker 2>It might be very difficult to solve this</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1257
00:50:56.031 --> 00:50:58.670
<v Speaker 2>You might have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have obligations that you have</v>

1258
00:50:58.671 --> 00:51:03.671
<v Speaker 2>to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this problem might take you a couple </v>

1259
00:51:03.671 --> 00:51:05.741
<v Speaker 2>of years to solve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's your fucking job to solve this </v>

1260
00:51:05.741 --> 00:51:05.741
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Douche bag.</v>

1261
00:51:05.741 --> 00:51:06.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not your job to go to the doctor </v>

<v Speaker 4>And so I'm waiting.</v>

1294
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:31.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to just go buy this frugal</v>
<v Speaker 4>shopper.</v>

1295
00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:36.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to buy three versions of </v>

1296
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:36.580
<v Speaker 4>Avatar about him not winning the Oscar</v>

1297
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:38.220
<v Speaker 2>gives a fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1298
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.050
<v Speaker 2>These are goofy jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1299
00:52:40.051 --> 00:52:40.880
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you're,</v>

1300
00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:44.450
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have awards that you'd give to art.</v>

1301
00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Who can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is he to say what is good?</v>

1302
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.400
<v Speaker 2>There's shit that people like that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate.</v>

1303
00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:51.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's women that thought sex necessity</v>

1304
00:52:51.291 --> 00:52:53.000
<v Speaker 2>to is the greatest movie in the history </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

1305
00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Would I have liked to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

1306
00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:56.500
<v Speaker 4>Did you watch Kimmel last night?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1307
00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.650
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They ran out of power and they,</v>

1308
00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:01.210
<v Speaker 4>that's what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all right.</v>

1309
00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:03.370
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I looked at it and I'm like,</v>

1310
00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.440
<v Speaker 4>that's completely the marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1311
00:53:05.441 --> 00:53:10.441
<v Speaker 4>that's completely like a good idea to </v>
<v Speaker 4>advertise the green Hornet trailer that </v>

1312
00:53:10.441 --> 00:53:10.720
<v Speaker 4>they premiered and stuff like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they,</v>

1313
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:13.420
<v Speaker 4>it was weird because they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have power for the cameras,</v>

1314
00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:17.230
<v Speaker 4>but yet then they're in a room where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tvs are on and the lights are on.</v>

1315
00:53:17.231 --> 00:53:17.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1316
00:53:17.951 --> 00:53:18.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the,</v>

1317
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.980
<v Speaker 4>what kind of cameras do not just </v>
<v Speaker 4>plugging a lot I guess.</v>

1318
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.710
<v Speaker 4>And we can find out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can find out what it was.</v>

1319
00:53:23.711 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 4>Genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was John Barris will tell us.</v>

1320
00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.250

<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>But what's weird is that that uh,</v>

1324
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:39.711
<v Speaker 4>I bet that got so much ratings because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that you don't have that little </v>

1325
00:53:39.711 --> 00:53:42.740
<v Speaker 4>gimmick and stuff like that.</v>

1333
00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:02.950
<v Speaker 4>and so the whole episode was filmed with</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in Australia even though I was </v>

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:06.891
<v Speaker 4>gigging out there and I came back and I </v>

<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1391
00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:16.420
<v Speaker 2>There's something about heckling in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>store that leads much quicker to </v>

1392
00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:17.000
<v Speaker 2>violence and anger and like real </v>
<v Speaker 2>tension.</v>

1393
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:22.150
<v Speaker 2>I've never had people throw shit at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've had two people throw things at </v>

1394
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.150
<v Speaker 2>me at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

1395
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 4>so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's some big fuck in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1399
00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:37.730
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>original room and he's yelling at </v>

1400
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:39.721
<v Speaker 1>somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when he ultimately got knocked </v>

1401
00:56:39.721 --> 00:56:41.620
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knocked out holtzman.</v>

1402
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Lawrence was fucked up in the </v>

1403
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:47.160
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if he was fucked up.</v>

1404
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I might've been added that part to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in a big night for him though,</v>

1405
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 1>like ICM was down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the people from ICM,</v>

1406
00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:55.540
<v Speaker 1>it come down to see holtzman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they saw him get knocked out.</v>

1407
00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:00.400
<v Speaker 1>They saw the crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence might've just changed his whole</v>

1408
00:57:00.401 --> 00:57:01.450
<v Speaker 1>career path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1409
00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:06.451
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to become a movie star </v>

1410
00:57:06.451 --> 00:57:06.451
<v Speaker 1>band without change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holtmann's career path.</v>

1411
00:57:06.451 --> 00:57:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1412
00:57:06.791 --> 00:57:07.960
<v Speaker 1>what if those guys were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1413
00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:09.560
<v Speaker 1>we love this comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said they were like,</v>

1414
00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:11.550
<v Speaker 1>did he just got knocked out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1415
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1416
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:17.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holtzman was the type of guy that would </v>

1417
00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:17.790
<v Speaker 1>kill kill comedians.</v>

1418
00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:22.740
<v Speaker 1>He would kill us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a lot of people that didn't </v>

1419
00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:22.840
<v Speaker 1>see it as a goof and they thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1420
00:57:22.841 --> 00:57:25.330
<v Speaker 1>he was just this really Douchey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry man.</v>

1421
00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:30.600
<v Speaker 1>He didn't see how funny it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main fucked up shit that he was </v>

1422
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:30.600
<v Speaker 1>saying with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that character.</v>

1423
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Now the comedy store doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

1424
00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:37.920
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comedy store is such a dark evil </v>

1425
00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.260
<v Speaker 1>fucking place for people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1426
00:57:38.261 --> 00:57:43.261
<v Speaker 1>The comedy store used to be Ciro's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightclub and Bugsy Siegel ran that </v>

1427
00:57:43.261 --> 00:57:44.980
<v Speaker 1>place in the fifties and the forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever the fuck it was.</v>

1428
00:57:44.981 --> 00:57:46.210
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the forties,</v>

1429
00:57:46.211 --> 00:57:51.211
<v Speaker 1>forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bugsy Siegel apparently had a bunch of </v>

1430
00:57:51.211 --> 00:57:52.510
<v Speaker 1>people murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1431
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Shane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently,</v>

1432
00:57:54.551 --> 00:57:59.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody that works there has these </v>

1433
00:57:59.551 --> 00:57:59.551
<v Speaker 1>creepy fucking horror stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1434
00:57:59.551 --> 00:58:01.840
<v Speaker 1>they all talk about ghosts and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that said,</v>

1435
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:06.000
<v Speaker 1>almost everybody that works there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and does drugs with a,</v>

1436
00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:06.610
<v Speaker 1>the grants salt.</v>

1437
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:09.180
<v Speaker 1>My friends always found funny about </v>
<v Speaker 1>ghost man is like,</v>

1438
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you ever watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1439
00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:13.850
<v Speaker 1>paranormal shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1440
00:58:13.851 --> 00:58:16.510
<v Speaker 1>and those show up and they'll interview </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person and there'll be like,</v>

1441
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:21.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then fire came out of the walls and </v>

1442
00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:22.760
<v Speaker 1>the blood was everywhere and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do like dead time thing when see</v>

1443
00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:25.000
<v Speaker 1>that curtain move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1444
00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:27.910
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all night vision and a basement.</v>

1445
00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:32.440
<v Speaker 1>What's that noise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every show nobody ever goes on video you</v>

1446
00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:37.441
<v Speaker 1>have to do is fucking go to a cemetery </v>
<v Speaker 1>like midnight on Halloween and just go </v>

1447
00:58:37.441 --> 00:58:39.670
<v Speaker 1>find somebody that murdered wife or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and start making fun</v>

1448
00:58:39.671 --> 00:58:40.390
<v Speaker 1>of her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1449
00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And like nothing will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go,</v>

1450
00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.610
<v Speaker 1>has ever killed anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1451
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you like,</v>

1452
00:58:48.041 --> 00:58:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always taught that like ghosts.</v>

1453
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all energy man.</v>

1454
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:56.440
<v Speaker 1>And maybe energy gets lost in some kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of wealth transfer.</v>

1455
00:58:56.470 --> 00:59:01.470
<v Speaker 1>If you look at our existence on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet as it were in a frequency.</v>

1456
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:02.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

1457
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you don't understand how this </v>
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

1458
00:59:05.591 --> 00:59:10.591
<v Speaker 1>but quantum physicists believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 11 dimensions as the current </v>

1459
00:59:10.591 --> 00:59:11.950
<v Speaker 1>model of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 different dimensions.</v>

1460
00:59:11.951 --> 00:59:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we can't to intercede those 11</v>
<v Speaker 1>different dimensions and if we,</v>

1461
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:18.250
<v Speaker 1>from what we know about like radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>waves,</v>

1462
00:59:18.251 --> 00:59:19.780
<v Speaker 1>think about like radio waves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about how,</v>

1463
00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>97 point one is loud and clear</v>

1464
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.110
<v Speaker 2>and I have to do is turn that dial and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on one.</v>

1465
00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven point nine.</v>

1466
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Totally different music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loud and clear.</v>

1467
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like there are frequencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very specific frequencies.</v>

1468
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:33.080
<v Speaker 2>If that exists with something as </v>
<v Speaker 2>intangible as radio waves,</v>

1469
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:36.380
<v Speaker 2>how do we not assume that that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work with reality as well?</v>

1470
00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you know,</v>

1471
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:43.090
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's so many different things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are tuned in around us all the </v>

1472
00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:45.701
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just on a frequency that we </v>

1473
00:59:45.701 --> 00:59:45.701
<v Speaker 2>can't detect and it doesn't interact </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this frequency,</v>

1474
00:59:45.701 --> 00:59:50.530
<v Speaker 2>but all this shit is going on together </v>
<v Speaker 2>in one big just fucking crazy cosmic </v>

1475
00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:51.340
<v Speaker 2>soup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1476
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

1477
00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:55.100
<v Speaker 2>anything's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ghosts,</v>

1478
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:55.970
<v Speaker 2>there could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1479
00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.530
<v Speaker 2>what a ghost could be somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

1480
00:59:57.531 --> 01:00:02.531
<v Speaker 2>The energy of the experience of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to them when they got murdered </v>

1481
01:00:02.531 --> 01:00:02.531
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1482
01:00:02.531 --> 01:00:04.450
<v Speaker 2>because it's always like horror stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

1483
01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.650
<v Speaker 2>The guy had an awesome life and now he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ghost.</v>

1484
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:10.440
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking brutally raped and murdered</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they,</v>

1485
01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:15.441
<v Speaker 2>they roamed that house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that experience maybe the </v>

1486
01:00:15.441 --> 01:00:17.860
<v Speaker 2>spiritual horror and shock and </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists so powerful that it actually </v>

1487
01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.040
<v Speaker 2>leaves like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1488
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:24.070
<v Speaker 2>you know when your monitor gets frozen </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a screen and then it like stays on </v>

1489
01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:28.391
<v Speaker 2>that image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like the ghost of that image in </v>

1490
01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:28.391
<v Speaker 2>the background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1491
01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Because it got too much energy from that</v>
<v Speaker 2>one position.</v>

1492
01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:32.080
<v Speaker 2>It got locked into that one pattern and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so the old,</v>

1493
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:35.150
<v Speaker 2>especially those old shitty screens </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't turned in you.</v>

1494
01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:40.170
<v Speaker 2>You would burn in an image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible that an image of </v>

1495
01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 2>someone dying and extremely horrible way</v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually burned into the world.</v>

1496
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.800
<v Speaker 2>But that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people are completely </v>

1497
01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:47.800
<v Speaker 2>fucking full of shit and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb.</v>

1498
01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.910
<v Speaker 2>They're just in basements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking goggles on.</v>

1499
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Why is it always gay guys and fat chicks</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that shit,</v>

1500
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:56.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's the same people that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>into like goth music and spring,</v>

1501
01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:59.030
<v Speaker 2>the spring or breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the cheater breed.</v>

1502
01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:01.070
<v Speaker 2>It's all those shows that the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>breed,</v>

1503
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:06.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a Brita human as there's always </v>

1504
01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:07.130
<v Speaker 2>people that are looking for something </v>
<v Speaker 2>mysterious,</v>

1505
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:09.050
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I love monster quest.</v>

1506
01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:14.051
<v Speaker 2>I got a little bit of that in myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like getting into like fucking </v>

1507
01:01:14.051 --> 01:01:16.220
<v Speaker 2>secret shit to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think sasquatch is real?</v>

1508
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten so far as like read.</v>

1509
01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I've probably read a dozen books on </v>
<v Speaker 2>sasquatch.</v>

1510
01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:22.700
<v Speaker 2>I tell there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real might be,</v>

1511
01:01:22.701 --> 01:01:24.620
<v Speaker 2>but this is why I might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>

1512
01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:29.621
<v Speaker 2>there's an animal called gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] that lived in Asia and that </v>

1513
01:01:29.621 --> 01:01:31.820
<v Speaker 2>animal lived exactly where the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians who came across the bering strait</v>

1514
01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:36.821
<v Speaker 2>and came to America and eventually </v>
<v Speaker 2>became the native Americans that they </v>

1515
01:01:36.821 --> 01:01:36.821
<v Speaker 2>came from the same place.</v>

1516
01:01:36.821 --> 01:01:41.020
<v Speaker 2>So if this animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this big gigantic eight foot tall </v>

1517
01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:44.770
<v Speaker 2>bipedal primate that actually lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was in North America,</v>

1518
01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:47.450
<v Speaker 2>if it came across the bering strait with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who's to say it didn't,</v>

1519
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:49.650
<v Speaker 2>that could live in the Pacific northwest</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1520
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>but actually seeing it by now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would've me,</v>

1521
01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:54.440
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something.</v>

1522
01:01:54.441 --> 01:01:59.441
<v Speaker 2>From living in the mountains and from </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to people that live in the </v>

1523
01:01:59.441 --> 01:01:59.441
<v Speaker 2>mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1524
01:01:59.441 --> 01:02:02.380
<v Speaker 2>there's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many mountain lions are so </v>

1525
01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:02.390
<v Speaker 2>many bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many fucking animals up there</v>

1526
01:02:02.391 --> 01:02:05.720
<v Speaker 2>and you rarely see them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is when you do see them,</v>

1527
01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>you see live ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never find a dead one.</v>

1528
01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:13.060
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare because the forest eats </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking animals and if you're in a </v>

1529
01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.020
<v Speaker 2>place like the Pacific northwest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you fly over that area,</v>

1530
01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.080
<v Speaker 2>it's so dense like you don't realize how</v>
<v Speaker 2>vast the forest until you fly over </v>

1531
01:02:20.521 --> 01:02:20.640
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1532
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.640
<v Speaker 2>It's basically a rain forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Pacific northwest is incredibly </v>

1533
01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.970
<v Speaker 2>dense woods where nobody goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the Loch Ness.</v>

1534
01:02:26.971 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stupid.</v>

1535
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:33.501
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fucking killer whales in the </v>

1536
01:02:33.501 --> 01:02:33.501
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're real.</v>

1537
01:02:33.501 --> 01:02:34.470
<v Speaker 2>They're super intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They speak in dialects,</v>

1538
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:39.471
<v Speaker 2>they save people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time they murder peoples in </v>

1539
01:02:39.471 --> 01:02:41.931
<v Speaker 2>captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are real things that are killer </v>

1540
01:02:41.931 --> 01:02:41.931
<v Speaker 2>whales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Save people,</v>

1541
01:02:41.931 --> 01:02:41.931
<v Speaker 2>save people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1542
01:02:41.931 --> 01:02:46.131
<v Speaker 2>No killer was ever killed anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about the size or the loch </v>

1543
01:02:46.131 --> 01:02:47.570
<v Speaker 2>ness monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just wrote that off that quickly.</v>

1544
01:02:47.571 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't do shit.</v>

1545
01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:51.810
<v Speaker 2>This guy might just be a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That tall guy that lives in.</v>

1546
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not totally sold on bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sold.</v>

1547
01:02:56.491 --> 01:03:01.491
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that it exists on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact same level of bullshit,</v>

1548
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we would have found them,</v>

1549
01:03:05.371 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's possible that with the loch </v>
<v Speaker 2>ness monsters,</v>

1550
01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:11.040
<v Speaker 2>they think it's might be Aplysia sore </v>
<v Speaker 2>that somehow or another got landlocked,</v>

1551
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:13.770
<v Speaker 2>but there's not enough evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've looked really hard.</v>

1552
01:03:13.771 --> 01:03:18.771
<v Speaker 2>They've done sonar searches of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire ocean floor or the entire lock </v>

1553
01:03:18.771 --> 01:03:18.771
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1554
01:03:18.771 --> 01:03:20.690
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the woods and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1555
01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.460
<v Speaker 2>in Oregon or something like that where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you really can't get in there.</v>

1556
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just one specific body of water so </v>

1557
01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.821
<v Speaker 2>they can do a pretty thorough job of </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking inside for anything big that </v>

1558
01:03:31.821 --> 01:03:34.470
<v Speaker 2>swims and if there's a fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been around for a long time,</v>

1559
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:37.500
<v Speaker 2>chances are there's a family of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He spot a few of them and then that spot</v>

1560
01:03:37.501 --> 01:03:42.501
<v Speaker 2>and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't find anything that if you </v>

1561
01:03:42.501 --> 01:03:44.610
<v Speaker 2>only get a blip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a fucking turtle farts or </v>

1562
01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:44.610
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1563
01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:50.450
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't interest me because it </v>

1564
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.660
<v Speaker 2>doesn't do anything to the primate thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>interests me because of the.</v>

1565
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:55.670
<v Speaker 2>The idea that this thing could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>superintelligence just like champs and </v>

1566
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 2>avoid people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know who the Congo.</v>

1567
01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1568
01:03:57.591 --> 01:04:02.591
<v Speaker 2>there's an animal in the Congo that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've just recently discovered </v>

1569
01:04:02.591 --> 01:04:03.310
<v Speaker 2>recently being they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They confirmed it in the 1990.</v>

1570
01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:08.370
<v Speaker 2>It's called the Bondo ape or the billy </v>
<v Speaker 2>ape and what this is is a gigantic </v>

1571
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.860
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're much bigger than regular.</v>

1572
01:04:10.861 --> 01:04:15.861
<v Speaker 2>Chimpanzees is like six feet tall and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they stand upright and they have gray </v>

1573
01:04:15.861 --> 01:04:19.761
<v Speaker 2>hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them have gray hair and they </v>

1574
01:04:19.761 --> 01:04:19.761
<v Speaker 2>fucking sleep on the ground like </v>
<v Speaker 2>gorillas.</v>

1575
01:04:19.761 --> 01:04:21.600
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing fucks with them.</v>

1576
01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:23.550
<v Speaker 2>And there's two types of chimps that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1577
01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:25.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that live in that part of the</v>

1578
01:04:25.201 --> 01:04:26.730
<v Speaker 2>jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call them,</v>

1579
01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.430
<v Speaker 2>the regular ones are tree beaters and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lion killers.</v>

1580
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.760
<v Speaker 2>There's tree beaters in lion killers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys were recently in the Congo </v>

1581
01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.970
<v Speaker 2>filming this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a bonafide,</v>

1582
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.640
<v Speaker 2>absolute real animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have DNA,</v>

1583
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.500
<v Speaker 2>they have photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have video,</v>

1584
01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:43.440
<v Speaker 2>they have bones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a first samples,</v>

1585
01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:45.390
<v Speaker 2>they have all these different things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that show that it's some sort of a,</v>

1586
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:50.540
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a new species of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees and it's fucking living in </v>

1587
01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know where it is.</v>

1588
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:56.690
<v Speaker 2>They know where it is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't fucking know about this </v>

1589
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:57.270
<v Speaker 2>until this wasn't confirmed until like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nineties,</v>

1590
01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:02.300
<v Speaker 2>like [inaudible] 94,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was when they all came to a </v>

1591
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:02.300
<v Speaker 2>consensus and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1592
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.661
<v Speaker 2>this is a real animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will have a giant chimp that sleeps on </v>

1593
01:05:05.661 --> 01:05:06.780
<v Speaker 2>the fucking ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have video of one evening a Jaguar.</v>

1594
01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These fucking guys came upon it and it </v>

1595
01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:12.140
<v Speaker 2>was eating a Jaguar.</v>

1596
01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.160
<v Speaker 2>They don't know if it killed the Jaguar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not but the local say they do.</v>

1597
01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.170
<v Speaker 2>But what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1598
01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:19.180
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real animal.</v>

1599
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a real animal that lives in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congo.</v>

1600
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible that there could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>some super high,</v>

1601
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:29.190
<v Speaker 2>high intelligence level primate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive just with a couple hundred of </v>

1602
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:32.380
<v Speaker 2>them in a very small part of the woods </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have amazing hearing,</v>

1603
01:05:32.381 --> 01:05:37.381
<v Speaker 2>an amazing sense of smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just avoid humans because it's </v>

1604
01:05:37.381 --> 01:05:37.960
<v Speaker 2>too difficult to get to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they stayed tightly packed in.</v>

1605
01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:40.520
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of fucking food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're vegetarians there,</v>

1606
01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>which they probably are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they wouldn't be eating </v>

1607
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1608
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1609
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:49.981
<v Speaker 2>If there were predators at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there had been people and then we would </v>

1610
01:05:49.981 --> 01:05:49.981
<v Speaker 2>hear crazy stories about the meeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1611
01:05:49.981 --> 01:05:54.090
<v Speaker 2>but everybody that sees them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody gets eaten in the middle of the </v>

1612
01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:54.090
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gets their tent pulled apart.</v>

1613
01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>So most likely they're like gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gorillas are vegetarians to.</v>

1614
01:05:56.711 --> 01:06:01.711
<v Speaker 2>So they're probably just a big fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian animal that lives in the </v>

1615
01:06:01.711 --> 01:06:01.711
<v Speaker 2>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that exists,</v>

1616
01:06:01.711 --> 01:06:02.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's fucking possible.</v>

1617
01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:05.880
<v Speaker 6>What was the animal that they thought </v>
<v Speaker 6>was the mermaid?</v>

1618
01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:11.540
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how lonely were you when you thought </v>

<v Speaker 6>it was on Huffington Post.</v>

1665
01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:55.550
<v Speaker 6>One of these smiling pirate cooks turned</v>
<v Speaker 6>on all of his crew and he gave all the </v>

1666
01:07:57.481 --> 01:08:01.290
<v Speaker 6>hostages guns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's feeding them because you know,</v>

1667
01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:03.180
<v Speaker 6>they were getting abused.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was feeding them.</v>

1668
01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.050
<v Speaker 6>They started hearing the pirates talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>about harvesting their organs.</v>

1669
01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.880
<v Speaker 6>So he got them all like guns and they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they attacked the,</v>

1670
01:08:11.881 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 6>killed all the pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now here's what's crazy is no country</v>

1676
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they were Douche bags.</v>

<v Speaker 3>because they're so broke and like all </v>

1716
01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:21.071
<v Speaker 3>the rich guys get all the chicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like that's why they get </v>

1717
01:10:21.071 --> 01:10:21.071
<v Speaker 3>promised like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1718
01:10:21.071 --> 01:10:22.820
<v Speaker 3>you get all these virgins and you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff.</v>

1719
01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:25.160
<v Speaker 3>Those are also the people that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to doing something because they just</v>

1720
01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:26.960
<v Speaker 3>want to belong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to be special.</v>

1721
01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:31.961
<v Speaker 3>They want to be treated like they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>special and you know when they're </v>

1722
01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:31.961
<v Speaker 3>getting someone to become a suicide </v>
<v Speaker 3>bomber.</v>

1723
01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:33.260
<v Speaker 3>If you ever looked at like there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>

1724
01:10:33.261 --> 01:10:37.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what show was on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were in somewhere in the Middle</v>

1725
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.760
<v Speaker 3>East and they have this school and on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the school they had these photographs of</v>

1726
01:10:40.761 --> 01:10:45.761
<v Speaker 3>these people that have blown themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and we're all this religious writing </v>

1727
01:10:45.761 --> 01:10:48.731
<v Speaker 3>on it and there was a big sign above the</v>
<v Speaker 3>school that says today's children are </v>

1728
01:10:48.731 --> 01:10:52.841
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow's holy martyrs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like God damn like they're there.</v>

1729
01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.220
<v Speaker 3>The attention that they give to those </v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

1730
01:10:55.221 --> 01:10:58.010
<v Speaker 3>they make them out to be heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make them out to be special that so</v>

1731
01:10:58.011 --> 01:11:01.100
<v Speaker 3>many people want people's love and </v>
<v Speaker 3>affection and they want.</v>

1732
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:04.580
<v Speaker 3>They want to be special so badly that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're willing to do almost anything.</v>

1733
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy,</v>

1734
01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:07.010
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1735
01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:12.011
<v Speaker 3>don't you wish you go back in time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just rewrite some of the religious </v>

1736
01:11:12.011 --> 01:11:12.920
<v Speaker 3>books?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take out all the asshole stuff.</v>

1737
01:11:12.921 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like throughout</v>

1738
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.920
<v Speaker 2>time people have always bullshitted </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people to control them.</v>

1739
01:11:16.921 --> 01:11:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so simple.</v>

1740
01:11:17.971 --> 01:11:19.980
<v Speaker 2>It's so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's existed forever.</v>

1741
01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.550
<v Speaker 2>What's amazing though is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit that worked like 2000 years ago</v>

1742
01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.740
<v Speaker 2>still works today just because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>

1743
01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:26.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1744
01:11:26.581 --> 01:11:27.870
<v Speaker 2>this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what it is.</v>

1745
01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1746
01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:29.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1747
01:11:29.631 --> 01:11:34.631
<v Speaker 2>when you really get into it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start reading about women being treated </v>

1748
01:11:34.631 --> 01:11:35.220
<v Speaker 2>as second class citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>condoning slavery,</v>

1749
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:40.250
<v Speaker 2>condoning murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the crazy shit that's in religious </v>

1750
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:44.361
<v Speaker 2>texts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that nutty shit that people still </v>

1751
01:11:44.361 --> 01:11:44.370
<v Speaker 2>suck on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand years later,</v>

1752
01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 2>years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought that religion was more </v>

1753
01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.550
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like early science,</v>

1754
01:11:50.551 --> 01:11:53.430
<v Speaker 2>like people trying to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just laying down the law,</v>

1755
01:11:53.431 --> 01:11:58.431
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's laying down the law and laying it </v>

1756
01:11:58.431 --> 01:11:58.431
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wants to stay.</v>

1757
01:11:58.431 --> 01:12:00.360
<v Speaker 2>I listen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause if you don't go down,</v>

1758
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:01.350
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

1759
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:04.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've got to keep dummies in </v>
<v Speaker 2>line with crazy talk and that crazy talk</v>

1760
01:12:04.801 --> 01:12:08.840
<v Speaker 2>spread and it became a good way to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>social order intact.</v>

1761
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Key people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1762
01:12:09.661 --> 01:12:10.910
<v Speaker 2>in small towns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1763
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:15.920
<v Speaker 2>go to the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's all happy and friendly and </v>

1764
01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:15.920
<v Speaker 2>it makes everybody together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1765
01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.940
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at like all these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are doing fucked up things in the </v>

1766
01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:19.940
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1767
01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:20.250
<v Speaker 2>whether it's suicide bombers were Somali</v>
<v Speaker 2>pirates,</v>

1768
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:22.860
<v Speaker 2>they come from somewhere that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks.</v>

1769
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:26.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's what it all boils down to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their life fucking sucks though.</v>

1770
01:12:26.371 --> 01:12:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Somali pirates did you know the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>story behind that?</v>

1771
01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Why they became pirates?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1772
01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:33.630
<v Speaker 2>they call themselves the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they call themselves the fucking,</v>

1773
01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:38.070
<v Speaker 2>the volunteer coastguard of Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they call themselves.</v>

1774
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:43.490
<v Speaker 2>And what happened was European ships and</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies and I believe some Americans </v>

1775
01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:49.281
<v Speaker 2>to we're dumping waste into their waters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fucking up there fishing man.</v>

1776
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.160
<v Speaker 2>And they found out about this because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are fish were dying and what they </v>

1777
01:12:55.351 --> 01:13:00.351
<v Speaker 2>did was kidnap a boat that was illegally</v>
<v Speaker 2>trespassing through their waters and </v>

1778
01:13:00.991 --> 01:13:05.991
<v Speaker 2>they demanded a ransom because this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the boats that was polluting the </v>

1779
01:13:05.991 --> 01:13:06.630
<v Speaker 2>waters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these guys were fishermen,</v>

1780
01:13:06.631 --> 01:13:11.631
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were fishermen that had their </v>

1781
01:13:11.631 --> 01:13:11.631
<v Speaker 2>livelihoods fucked up and taken away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from them.</v>

1782
01:13:11.631 --> 01:13:14.810
<v Speaker 2>So they turned to crime and they started</v>
<v Speaker 2>jacking people because they've got so </v>

1783
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:18.681
<v Speaker 2>much from the first boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just turned it into a business and </v>

1784
01:13:18.681 --> 01:13:19.540
<v Speaker 2>now they just jack people constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dudes.</v>

1785
01:13:19.541 --> 01:13:21.150
<v Speaker 2>You're getting jacked all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1786
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:26.330
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are hundreds of miles out to sea </v>

1787
01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.330
<v Speaker 2>just looking for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:27.940
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about the 16 year old </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl?</v>

1789
01:13:27.941 --> 01:13:30.100
<v Speaker 4>That's my whole point about saying her </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the world.</v>

1790
01:13:30.101 --> 01:13:31.240
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1791
01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:34.850

<v Speaker 4>it's a whole different game to women's</v>

1792
01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:38.490
<v Speaker 2>parents are so foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so foolish.</v>

1793
01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:40.920
<v Speaker 2>There's one thing to let some experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone something.</v>

1794
01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:44.490
<v Speaker 2>There's another thing to put someone out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the wild just to get it.</v>

1795
01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.220
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to get a rush out of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he made it across,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you did something that could kill you </v>

1797
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.520

<v Speaker 2>Is it so difficult and you did it.</v>

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:39.730
<v Speaker 2>There's a giant fucking hole where oil </v>
<v Speaker 2>is leaking out of the ocean.</v>

1943
01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1944
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.400
<v Speaker 2>we might have a fucking problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gotta make sure this is ruining the </v>

1945
01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.840
<v Speaker 2>ocean for hundreds and hundreds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of miles.</v>

1946
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:53.080
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out this federal judge has </v>

1947
01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.151
<v Speaker 2>stock in the company and in Trans Ocean </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have stock his stock at five </v>

1948
01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 2>different companies that are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the selling business.</v>

1949
01:19:58.630 --> 01:20:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker can literally profit </v>

1950
01:20:03.630 --> 01:20:04.070
<v Speaker 2>from his own decision.</v>

1951
01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.050
<v Speaker 4>How crazy is they should not be allowed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do this.</v>

1952
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 4>Should not be allowed</v>

1953
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 1>to have money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that guy,</v>

1954
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:12.210
<v Speaker 1>if that guy was on the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have said,</v>

1955
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1956
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:16.050
<v Speaker 1>we see that you have stock in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this company that could,</v>

1957
01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your decisions could adversely affect</v>

1958
01:20:18.871 --> 01:20:23.871
<v Speaker 1>you financially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to remove you from this </v>

1959
01:20:23.871 --> 01:20:23.871
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1960
01:20:23.871 --> 01:20:26.590
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what rational person like with </v>

1961
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:26.590
<v Speaker 1>everything though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you win a prize at,</v>

1962
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:27.000
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

1963
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:29.070
<v Speaker 1>do you work for NBC or any of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>affiliates?</v>

1964
01:20:29.071 --> 01:20:34.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how like everything always is </v>

1965
01:20:34.071 --> 01:20:34.240
<v Speaker 1>with everyone else except the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not as voided from it.</v>

1966
01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:37.380
<v Speaker 1>That's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How these guys have this detach,</v>

1967
01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:40.640
<v Speaker 1>detach from just humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1968
01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:45.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just straight evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that would think that the oil </v>

1969
01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:49.371
<v Speaker 1>business knows exactly what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and that this couldn't happen </v>

1970
01:20:49.371 --> 01:20:49.371
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1971
01:20:49.371 --> 01:20:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Just because it's only happened a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>times in history,</v>

1972
01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.690
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that these things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorating at a rapid pace and that,</v>

1973
01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:58.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that have been around for a </v>

1974
01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.021
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how long they're gonna </v>

1975
01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:00.021
<v Speaker 1>last things happen.</v>

1976
01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Things fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole,</v>

1977
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:02.710
<v Speaker 1>there's other wells out there that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>built like this one.</v>

1978
01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:04.650
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1979
01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:07.650
<v Speaker 1>the whole deregulation thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so ridiculous.</v>

1980
01:21:07.651 --> 01:21:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Like what the market needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deregulation.</v>

1981
01:21:09.541 --> 01:21:11.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes no sense.</v>

1982
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:14.820
<v Speaker 1>That's like saying we don't need laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we'll just regulate each other.</v>

1983
01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1984
01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 1>we get crazy too and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1985
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:21.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to lower the pressure labor to </v>

1986
01:21:21.741 --> 01:21:21.741
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to go to China.</v>

1987
01:21:21.741 --> 01:21:21.860
<v Speaker 1>We have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking?</v>

1988
01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.700
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1989
01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:28.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just kind of stopped being too </v>

1990
01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:28.760
<v Speaker 1>greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1991
01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.120
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get less profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to get a fucking.</v>

1992
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.120
<v Speaker 1>What you're selling is a product that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not made on people.</v>

1993
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:35.160
<v Speaker 1>People's fucking souls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1994
01:21:35.161 --> 01:21:40.161
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sell a product that's </v>

1995
01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:41.541
<v Speaker 1>not poor people that live in a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>village and in China and then they have </v>

1996
01:21:41.541 --> 01:21:43.500
<v Speaker 1>to look at what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foxconn and we talk about all the time.</v>

1997
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:46.170
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking company that makes iphone </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts and shit.</v>

1998
01:21:46.171 --> 01:21:51.171
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got people killing themselves left </v>

1999
01:21:51.171 --> 01:21:53.271
<v Speaker 1>and right over there who left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're literally shutting down all </v>

2000
01:21:53.271 --> 01:21:54.780
<v Speaker 1>their plants because there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicides and there's so much scandal.</v>

2001
01:21:55.050 --> 01:22:00.050
<v Speaker 1>These people are working like God knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>how many hours a day they're living on </v>

2002
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.050
<v Speaker 1>the site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2003
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.990
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what companies are doing,</v>

2004
01:22:00.991 --> 01:22:02.880
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Companies are going to people like that.</v>

2005
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:07.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the iphone too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Walmart's to worst to that company </v>

2006
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:08.070
<v Speaker 1>makes the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2007
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Or at least parts of the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No warrants the worst.</v>

2008
01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2009
01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.150
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go.</v>

2010
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:15.930
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that hype at all.</v>

2011
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I think Walmart does a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you either can see that point of </v>

2012
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:25.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walmart comes in and they don't pay </v>

2013
01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:27.861
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also see a walmart fucking </v>

2014
01:22:27.861 --> 01:22:28.490
<v Speaker 1>striving for jobs and that go into these</v>
<v Speaker 1>towns.</v>

2015
01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Really disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2016
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:35.870
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do is they keep driving down </v>

2017
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:38.751
<v Speaker 1>the price and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so eventually these people who produced </v>

2018
01:22:38.751 --> 01:22:41.040
<v Speaker 1>the goods they buy are going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost go to slave labor.</v>

2019
01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's either or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think either one of you guys is </v>

2020
01:22:46.190 --> 01:22:46.190
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both right,</v>

2021
01:22:46.190 --> 01:22:50.420
<v Speaker 1>but what what Walmart does is it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in to a community and it basically has </v>

2022
01:22:51.121 --> 01:22:52.620
<v Speaker 1>the lowest prices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2023
01:22:52.770 --> 01:22:57.770
<v Speaker 1>So it puts mom and pop stores the pops </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this stuff out and then seems </v>

2024
01:22:57.770 --> 01:23:01.180
<v Speaker 1>like a good idea and they don't pay a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real good wage to work there to what?</v>

2025
01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Go to Walmart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that person makes six bucks an </v>

2026
01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:06.240
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other jobs gone.</v>

2027
01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:06.240
<v Speaker 1>You got to go</v>

2028
01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:09.100
<v Speaker 4>work somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But before that,</v>

2029
01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.970
<v Speaker 4>before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no jobs that didn't exist.</v>

2030
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:16.090
<v Speaker 4>Those 300 jobs at blacksmith goes out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>business right here.</v>

2031
01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 4>But you know what the big thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>retail is dead no matter what.</v>

2032
01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:20.770
<v Speaker 4>So Walmart could be doing all they want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2033
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.350
<v Speaker 4>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Walmart ain't as cheap as fuck.</v>

2034
01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:24.610
<v Speaker 4>And Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazon.</v>

2035
01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Amazon is not his fucking growing like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>monster.</v>

2036
01:23:27.671 --> 01:23:32.080
<v Speaker 4>I buy groceries now on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm buying coconut water by the case.</v>

2037
01:23:32.081 --> 01:23:37.081
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even need to be a costco member </v>

2038
01:23:37.081 --> 01:23:37.081
<v Speaker 4>or any of that because they sell the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same shit now.</v>

2039
01:23:37.081 --> 01:23:39.150
<v Speaker 4>And you don't have to be a costco </v>
<v Speaker 4>delivered to your house,</v>

2040
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:44.220
<v Speaker 4>they deliver it right to your house and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can put it on schedule like I want </v>

2041
01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:44.220
<v Speaker 4>this every two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2042
01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:46.330
<v Speaker 4>automatically ship going somewhere and </v>
<v Speaker 4>buying something helps your community.</v>

2043
01:23:46.331 --> 01:23:51.331
<v Speaker 4>Would you do that to a point?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm also not going to pay $300 more </v>

2044
01:23:51.331 --> 01:23:52.460
<v Speaker 4>for a fucking tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2045
01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:53.930
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

2046
01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.460
<v Speaker 4>fucking think of what's next in your job</v>
<v Speaker 4>career.</v>

2047
01:23:57.461 --> 01:24:00.190
<v Speaker 4>If you can't sell this TV cheaper than </v>
<v Speaker 4>this person,</v>

2048
01:24:00.191 --> 01:24:01.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to buy it simple.</v>

2049
01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:07.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that people have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>obligation to be able to continue to </v>

2050
01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:11.401
<v Speaker 3>sell you things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if something comes along the </v>

2051
01:24:11.401 --> 01:24:11.401
<v Speaker 3>consultings for much cheaper and at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same quality,</v>

2052
01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.810
<v Speaker 3>if it's the same product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2053
01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:13.490
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2054
01:24:13.491 --> 01:24:15.190
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm loyal to friends and I,</v>

2055
01:24:15.191 --> 01:24:20.191
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of businesses that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>support that I know charge more than </v>

2056
01:24:20.191 --> 01:24:21.310
<v Speaker 3>they probably should for things like our</v>
<v Speaker 3>pot doctor,</v>

2057
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.570
<v Speaker 3>but I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2058
01:24:22.571 --> 01:24:24.610
<v Speaker 3>it's just like I have a sense of loyalty</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them,</v>

2059
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.880
<v Speaker 3>but I've got some discretionary income </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't man,</v>

2060
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:30.720
<v Speaker 3>300 bucks is a lot of fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why would you pay $3?</v>

2061
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Was being generous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 300 bucks plus no tax plus free </v>

2062
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:41.050
<v Speaker 3>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just can't get the kind of deals </v>

2063
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:41.050
<v Speaker 3>that Walmart can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2064
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:41.500
<v Speaker 3>tough shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

2065
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:43.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it's either or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2066
01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:44.740
<v Speaker 3>I can see both points of view.</v>

2067
01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:49.740
<v Speaker 3>I see Brian's point of view where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps communities and it brings in jobs </v>

2068
01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:52.981
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I can see your point of view that </v>

2069
01:24:52.981 --> 01:24:52.981
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2070
01:24:52.981 --> 01:24:52.990
<v Speaker 3>you're given these people this mediocre </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and they fucking.</v>

2071
01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.600
<v Speaker 3>They don't really save jobs because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>put some businesses under.</v>

2072
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:57.370
<v Speaker 3>It's okay man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all just change.</v>

2073
01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Just normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2074
01:24:58.781 --> 01:24:59.970
<v Speaker 3>There's no good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2075
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.560
<v Speaker 3>some people just aren't meant to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors and lawyers.</v>

2076
01:25:02.561 --> 01:25:06.200
<v Speaker 3>And when you take away all their </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities to like build stuff on,</v>

2077
01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.170
<v Speaker 3>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a true though?</v>

2078
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:08.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

2079
01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:11.920
<v Speaker 3>You just have to offer a service that </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people aren't offering for less.</v>

2080
01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:12.890
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't</v>

2081
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.000
<v Speaker 4>just have to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure to figure it out </v>

2082
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:18.270
<v Speaker 4>because if whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if Walmart can get it cheaper,</v>

2083
01:25:18.271 --> 01:25:23.271
<v Speaker 4>you have to figure out either how you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could get it cheap or have a service </v>

2084
01:25:23.271 --> 01:25:23.271
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Walmart doesn't work.</v>

2085
01:25:23.271 --> 01:25:26.520
<v Speaker 3>My family's been in this business for 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking years.</v>

2086
01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.850
<v Speaker 3>If you say it's okay for Walmart coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>to our town where we grew up,</v>

2087
01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:32.010
<v Speaker 3>you don't own the town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want a patch of dirt.</v>

2088
01:25:32.011 --> 01:25:34.440
<v Speaker 3>You don't own the rights to sell what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying about that.</v>

2089
01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:39.650
<v Speaker 3>But it's like it goes back to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's like capitalism and free </v>

2090
01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:42.771
<v Speaker 3>enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this isn't what it was like 200 </v>

2091
01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:42.771
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2092
01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:45.780
<v Speaker 3>when everything started to definitely </v>
<v Speaker 3>says it was mom and pops.</v>

2093
01:25:45.810 --> 01:25:48.840
<v Speaker 3>Now you got these huge corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>

2094
01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:54.080
<v Speaker 3>when the Supreme Court says that a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation is like an individual,</v>

2095
01:25:54.211 --> 01:25:57.720
<v Speaker 3>while they're not a kazillion billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars behind them.</v>

2096
01:25:59.450 --> 01:26:02.400
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about for a campaign </v>
<v Speaker 3>contribution.</v>

2097
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>Even in the</v>

2098
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:05.120
<v Speaker 4>market though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2099
01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:08.510
<v Speaker 4>we'll find a way to sell for less than </v>
<v Speaker 4>Walmart.</v>

2100
01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:13.511
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never can because they buy in such </v>

2101
01:26:13.511 --> 01:26:13.511
<v Speaker 4>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:26:13.511 --> 01:26:16.000
<v Speaker 4>But that's not even it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was saying you didn't have to do that </v>

2103
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.580
<v Speaker 4>or you have to find a new service at </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Walmart doesn't offer like that.</v>

2104
01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:19.080
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're selling phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2105
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:21.860
<v Speaker 4>I will have a cell that you're the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>phone.</v>

2106
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:23.120
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna be a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But guess what,</v>

2107
01:26:23.121 --> 01:26:24.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be coming to,</v>

<v Speaker 4>all your contacts over there.</v>

2111
01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:34.070
<v Speaker 4>Fucking walmart ain't going to do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2112
01:26:34.350 --> 01:26:36.950
<v Speaker 4>You got to change with the Times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2113
01:26:36.951 --> 01:26:39.440
<v Speaker 4>These stores that I went in the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>day too,</v>

2114
01:26:39.441 --> 01:26:43.880
<v Speaker 4>like this store and I bought a Webcam </v>
<v Speaker 4>just because,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the one at best buy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were sold out.</v>

2117
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:47.870
<v Speaker 4>So I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2118
01:26:47.871 --> 01:26:50.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll go to this little mom and pop </v>
<v Speaker 4>electronic store.</v>

2119
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:53.330
<v Speaker 4>And they had like an old version of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Webcam.</v>

2120
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:54.620
<v Speaker 4>It was dusty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2121
01:26:54.621 --> 01:26:55.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just sitting here going like,</v>

2122
01:26:55.850 --> 01:27:00.850
<v Speaker 4>this is an old product that a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same price as the new product </v>

2123
01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:01.490
<v Speaker 4>at best buy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2124
01:27:01.491 --> 01:27:03.960
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even want to even buy it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what?</v>

2125
01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:08.980
<v Speaker 4>They can't even turn enough product to </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're shit they're selling is </v>

2126
01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:10.000
<v Speaker 4>outdated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not current shit.</v>

2127
01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.570
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem.</v>

2128
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:16.690
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not Walmart's far as the change of </v>

2129
01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:16.690
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Amazon,</v>

2130
01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:19.961
<v Speaker 4>it's all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you think you're going to have a </v>

2131
01:27:19.961 --> 01:27:21.671
<v Speaker 4>retail store in today's times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to really fucking start using </v>

2132
01:27:21.671 --> 01:27:22.280
<v Speaker 4>your brain because you need to offer a </v>
<v Speaker 4>service that fucking,</v>

2133
01:27:22.281 --> 01:27:24.620
<v Speaker 4>I can't Amazon just going to kill you </v>
<v Speaker 4>regardless.</v>

2134
01:27:24.621 --> 01:27:29.621
<v Speaker 4>And then we're not even care about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Walmart and Amazon's gonna kill Walmart </v>

2135
01:27:29.621 --> 01:27:29.621
<v Speaker 4>eventually.</v>

2136
01:27:29.621 --> 01:27:33.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big corporations aren't killing all </v>

2137
01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.021
<v Speaker 2>businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always gonna have like </v>

2138
01:27:35.021 --> 01:27:35.021
<v Speaker 2>restaurants that are great restaurants </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know the cook is awesome.</v>

2139
01:27:35.021 --> 01:27:36.200
<v Speaker 2>He's always got interesting stuff to eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2140
01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.030
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get that from some </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking chain.</v>

2141
01:27:38.031 --> 01:27:39.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some corporate chain you're going to get</v>

2142
01:27:39.681 --> 01:27:42.560
<v Speaker 2>like there's gonna be places of you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>always going to want to go do that,</v>

2143
01:27:42.561 --> 01:27:47.561
<v Speaker 2>have personality to them to have flair </v>
<v Speaker 2>that offer a certain environment or </v>

2144
01:27:47.561 --> 01:27:51.191
<v Speaker 2>ambiance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as long as the way things are </v>

2145
01:27:51.191 --> 01:27:51.191
<v Speaker 2>continuing to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they're going,</v>

2146
01:27:51.191 --> 01:27:53.390
<v Speaker 2>there's so many fucking people in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2147
01:27:53.391 --> 01:27:56.840
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These corporations get so big because of</v>

2148
01:27:56.841 --> 01:27:58.130
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many,</v>

2149
01:27:58.250 --> 01:28:00.080
<v Speaker 2>so many people to pull under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2150
01:28:00.081 --> 01:28:05.081
<v Speaker 2>there's so much to go after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like that's a trend </v>

2151
01:28:05.081 --> 01:28:05.320
<v Speaker 2>that's going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the idea of us,</v>

2152
01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:10.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into little small groups and </v>

2153
01:28:10.321 --> 01:28:10.321
<v Speaker 2>businesses and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and goods being distributed like that.</v>

2154
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.050
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to continue to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger and bigger.</v>

2155
01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.380
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of that woman who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 25 kids?</v>

2156
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Which one is she should be shot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that on that TV show now?</v>

2157
01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:21.260
<v Speaker 2>There's a will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one TV show,</v>

2158
01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:24.750
<v Speaker 2>the family that I was like 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>21 or something,</v>

2159
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:29.770
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that lady adopted this woman's </v>

2160
01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:29.770
<v Speaker 2>literally gave birth like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2161
01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:33.830
<v Speaker 2>that lady gave birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lady on the TV show really like </v>

2162
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:34.570
<v Speaker 2>super religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole family.</v>

2163
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Family's really cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on a rigid schedule and serial </v>

2164
01:28:39.610 --> 01:28:39.610
<v Speaker 2>killers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think are in their family?</v>

2165
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:41.630
<v Speaker 2>They're all cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all friendly.</v>

2166
01:28:41.631 --> 01:28:46.631
<v Speaker 2>They're all happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all looking at the sense of </v>

2167
01:28:46.631 --> 01:28:48.491
<v Speaker 2>community they have down to a science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think serial killers come from </v>

2168
01:28:48.491 --> 01:28:49.740
<v Speaker 2>loneliness and abandonment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Religious.</v>

2169
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:51.770
<v Speaker 2>These people aren't abused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>

2170
01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:53.270
<v Speaker 2>They seem happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2171
01:28:53.271 --> 01:28:55.250
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're little loony with the religion.</v>

2172
01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2173
01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Have hot sex orgies and we don't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>know about it,</v>

2174
01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 4>but 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 years and how dare you,</v>

2175
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.800
<v Speaker 3>do you think they should like why do we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need 25 of them?</v>

2176
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:06.920
<v Speaker 3>You know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what my deal is.</v>

2177
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Way Better to have 25 people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice and happy than 25 people that are </v>

2178
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:15.591
<v Speaker 3>all fucked up and strung out on drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fucking angry and shooting people </v>

2179
01:29:15.591 --> 01:29:17.730
<v Speaker 3>and whatever those people on that show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched that show once the kids,</v>

2180
01:29:17.850 --> 01:29:20.320
<v Speaker 3>they might be all ate up with Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>

2181
01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:21.870
<v Speaker 3>They're talking happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're good people.</v>

2182
01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:23.790
<v Speaker 3>They're good people too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That whole Jesus thing,</v>

2183
01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:28.791
<v Speaker 3>man is good for a lot of folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very whether or not you want to </v>

2184
01:29:28.791 --> 01:29:32.901
<v Speaker 3>question whether or not you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective about the source of all the </v>

2185
01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:33.630
<v Speaker 3>stories that are in the Bible and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the bottom line is.</v>

2186
01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Most Christians are trying to be nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2187
01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:38.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's all about.</v>

2188
01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:38.920
<v Speaker 3>It's a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2189
01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:42.540
<v Speaker 3>Imagine them without religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that before,</v>

2190
01:29:42.541 --> 01:29:44.420
<v Speaker 3>and people think I'm bullshitting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2191
01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:44.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2192
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm patronizing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not.</v>

2193
01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I think religion for a lot of people is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a good thing.</v>

2194
01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.920
<v Speaker 3>The idea behind it is all a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just believing that you've got the </v>

2195
01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:55.860
<v Speaker 3>fucking answers because you've committed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>

2196
01:29:56.010 --> 01:30:01.010
<v Speaker 3>That's where the problem comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when people get </v>

2197
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.010
<v Speaker 3>aggressive with their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their commitment,</v>

2198
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:03.930
<v Speaker 3>they have a commitment and you'll have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to scratch my personal savior.</v>

2199
01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:09.160
<v Speaker 3>How about the fucking guy that we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about them last week they went </v>

2200
01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.451
<v Speaker 3>to a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in Afghanistan right now looking </v>

2201
01:30:11.451 --> 01:30:13.491
<v Speaker 3>for Osama bin Ladin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They arrested him 52 fucking years old </v>

2202
01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:16.520
<v Speaker 3>on dialysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This looney toons saving up all his </v>

2203
01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:17.170
<v Speaker 3>money and one of the reasons why he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going over there to kill Osama bin Ladin</v>

2204
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:19.230
<v Speaker 3>is because he said bad things about our </v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

2205
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.420
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are your friends?</v>

2206
01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:29.780

<v Speaker 3>I don't trust anyone who's too into </v>

2207
01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:29.970
<v Speaker 3>anything to what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2208
01:30:29.971 --> 01:30:33.060
<v Speaker 3>even if I walk in and saw Jesus Christ </v>
<v Speaker 3>or Brett Farve,</v>

2209

<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's so true.</v>

2212
01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.750
<v Speaker 3>People that are fucking obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

<v Speaker 3>on the street and hand them books and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and tell them God.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Kong?</v>

<v Speaker 3>they're obsessed with video games.</v>

2223
01:31:04.141 --> 01:31:08.910
<v Speaker 3>It's great to do those people exist to </v>
<v Speaker 3>real people.</v>

2224
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:12.840
<v Speaker 3>We used to be a part of a clan and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>guess I still am.</v>

2225
01:31:12.841 --> 01:31:14.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in it for life.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2227
01:31:16.670 --> 01:31:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I used to play eight hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a t one line installed in my house</v>

2228
01:31:21.271 --> 01:31:26.271
<v Speaker 3>back when there was nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you can't get cable in my </v>

2229
01:31:26.271 --> 01:31:29.001
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get ISD n which is only like </v>

<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2231

<v Speaker 3>120 k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2234

<v Speaker 3>I think that's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sdn is maybe 140 and there wasn't </v>

2235
01:31:40.371 --> 01:31:44.211
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're paying your latency between </v>

2236
01:31:44.211 --> 01:31:44.211
<v Speaker 3>service was too high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you would play there'd be a lag.</v>

2237
01:31:44.211 --> 01:31:46.370
<v Speaker 3>It sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had a fucking t one lines installed</v>

<v Speaker 3>just so that I could play quake online </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's out like a microwave</v>

2243
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 6>and it just makes you feel really hot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be non lethal way for that</v>

2244
01:32:04.901 --> 01:32:06.790
<v Speaker 6>crowd control.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're just going to start frying.</v>

<v Speaker 6>they had the no war sign.</v>

2250

<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's who you're going to use it on.</v>

2251

<v Speaker 6>Like they were old,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no size.</v>

<v Speaker 6>They just have it over there just in </v>
<v Speaker 6>case this the.</v>

2255
01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:32.560

2256
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 2>looking actively at the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq war,</v>

2257
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I read a story online about coming up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some sort of a weapon to make men </v>

2258
01:32:41.771 --> 01:32:46.590
<v Speaker 2>have gay feelings for each other to turn</v>

<v Speaker 3>They shoot everybody in the fucking head</v>
<v Speaker 3>and throw them in the ocean and they </v>

2347
01:36:19.630 --> 01:36:19.630
<v Speaker 3>just disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one ever hears about it.</v>

2348
01:36:19.630 --> 01:36:22.700
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking fucking surrounds Zmq </v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken.</v>

2349
01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Alright everybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2350
01:36:24.090 --> 01:36:29.090
<v Speaker 3>this general that just stepped up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said all kinds of crazy shit about </v>

2351
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2352
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:30.050
<v Speaker 3>there's Tris I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck his name is.</v>

2353
01:36:30.170 --> 01:36:31.060
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2354
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:33.440
<v Speaker 3>they just made them resign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he resigned.</v>

2355
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:37.400
<v Speaker 3>It turns out this is the same guy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>signed off on the Pat Tillman story.</v>

2356
01:36:37.401 --> 01:36:40.700
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to get everybody to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it's Pat Tillman was died by the</v>

2357
01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:43.100
<v Speaker 3>fighting the enemy when actually was </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed by friendly fire.</v>

2358
01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Same fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an asshole.</v>

2359
01:36:44.811 --> 01:36:46.080
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes over there,</v>

2360
01:36:46.081 --> 01:36:47.990
<v Speaker 3>it basically tells the troops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2361
01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:51.080
<v Speaker 3>this is going like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like you're the guy who came up</v>

2362
01:36:51.081 --> 01:36:52.760
<v Speaker 3>with a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you blame him.</v>

2363
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:54.560
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of speculation.</v>

2364
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:59.590
<v Speaker 3>I always listened to Opie and Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 3>today and people were calling in and </v>

2365
01:36:59.590 --> 01:37:00.050
<v Speaker 3>talking about it and they were saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they think that he might have tried</v>

2366
01:37:00.051 --> 01:37:00.610
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2367
01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:04.040
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to leave and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the way he could not just leave</v>

2368
01:37:04.041 --> 01:37:06.200
<v Speaker 3>but leave and get his point across,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2369
01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:07.970
<v Speaker 3>that he calculated this and did it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose.</v>

2370
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:12.970
<v Speaker 3>So he made this big statement about them</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he knew it was going to be in </v>

2371
01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:14.370
<v Speaker 3>rolling stone and then he gets fired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2372
01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.970
<v Speaker 3>Or gets forced to resign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then this issue,</v>

2373
01:37:16.971 --> 01:37:21.971
<v Speaker 3>whatever he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets out there across the whole world </v>

2374
01:37:21.971 --> 01:37:21.971
<v Speaker 3>because of the fact that he opened his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth and in rolling stone and that they</v>

2375
01:37:21.971 --> 01:37:26.891
<v Speaker 3>reacted and that they fired him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This becomes an issue that people want </v>

2376
01:37:26.891 --> 01:37:30.251
<v Speaker 3>to hear more about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then he gets a fucking book deal and </v>

2377
01:37:30.251 --> 01:37:30.251
<v Speaker 3>he'd get a book deal for several million</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

2378
01:37:30.251 --> 01:37:31.640
<v Speaker 3>If you're fucking smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll be on Fox News.</v>

2379
01:37:32.010 --> 01:37:34.700
<v Speaker 3>If it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the legality is as far</v>

2380
01:37:34.701 --> 01:37:39.701
<v Speaker 3>as like what you're allowed to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about when you're allowed to talk about </v>

2381
01:37:39.701 --> 01:37:39.701
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're a high level military guy,</v>

2382
01:37:39.701 --> 01:37:41.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the United States army like he is,</v>

2383
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:43.340
<v Speaker 3>but I would think that that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking smooth move.</v>

2384
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:44.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think.</v>

2385
01:37:44.970 --> 01:37:46.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why just fucking quit?</v>

2386
01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 3>You don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't like Obama.</v>

2387
01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:50.390
<v Speaker 3>Why quit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not just make a stink mega stank?</v>

2388
01:37:50.391 --> 01:37:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows you made a stink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Write a book,</v>

2389
01:37:51.951 --> 01:37:53.840

<v Speaker 2>I mean look at Sarah Palin.</v>

2392
01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2393

<v Speaker 2>This is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This really is true sex bomb.</v>

2433
01:39:40.701 --> 01:39:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Those who complain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military should make love not war.</v>

2434
01:39:44.001 --> 01:39:46.310
<v Speaker 2>May Be happy to know that at least on </v>
<v Speaker 2>one occasion,</v>

2435
01:39:46.311 --> 01:39:51.311
<v Speaker 2>the military scientists were searching </v>
<v Speaker 2>for ways to break down the enemy with </v>

2436
01:39:51.311 --> 01:39:53.120
<v Speaker 2>aching desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sex bomb,</v>

2437
01:39:53.121 --> 01:39:58.121
<v Speaker 2>or in saucier headlines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gay bomb scientists consider </v>

2438
01:39:58.121 --> 01:40:01.091
<v Speaker 2>developing a chemical weapon with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aphrodisiac qualities that would make </v>

2439
01:40:01.091 --> 01:40:04.961
<v Speaker 2>the enemy soldiers hopelessly physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted to one another as to paralyze </v>

2440
01:40:05.211 --> 01:40:07.220
<v Speaker 2>their ranks and destroy morale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that good?</v>

2441
01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:11.000
<v Speaker 4>Credible scientists wizard like some 18 </v>
<v Speaker 4>year old guy from high school.</v>

2442
01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:16.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make some gay bombs out </v>

2443
01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:16.020
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2444
01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:20.440
<v Speaker 4>that's what the Pentagon hires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they have access to the </v>

2445
01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:20.440
<v Speaker 4>best sign,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they just said they talked about it.</v>

2446
01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.620
<v Speaker 4>They didn't actually do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen to you,</v>

2447
01:40:21.621 --> 01:40:22.940
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even want to believe.</v>

2448
01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:25.940
<v Speaker 4>I believe they actually tried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2449
01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:31.020
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe I don't put it past the </v>

2450
01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.071
<v Speaker 4>Pentagon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also find it like if they even </v>

2451
01:40:33.071 --> 01:40:33.071
<v Speaker 4>were thinking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they probably just said move.</v>

2452
01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:34.510
<v Speaker 4>We could make a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's good.</v>

2453
01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:35.180
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's cool.</v>

2454
01:40:35.210 --> 01:40:36.520
<v Speaker 4>They'll try and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2455
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.230
<v Speaker 4>they're saying aphrodisiacs right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they were together with men</v>

2456
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:44.390
<v Speaker 2>and there was only men around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't be able to help </v>

2457
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.390
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea,</v>

2458
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2459
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:46.990
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you break down what sexual desire is,</v>

2460
01:40:46.991 --> 01:40:50.740
<v Speaker 2>there must be some sort of a trigger in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our brains for sexual desire,</v>

2461
01:40:50.770 --> 01:40:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

2462
01:40:51.791 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a chemical trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they can</v>

2463
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:59.130
<v Speaker 1>mimic that and find a way to get it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>people blast blasted out in a haze and </v>

2464
01:40:59.130 --> 01:41:00.760
<v Speaker 1>you inhale it as you breathe and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden you can.</v>

2465
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Thing they would do though is sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing they would do though is </v>

2466
01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.280
<v Speaker 1>they would be making money off that like</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>

2467
01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Why would they sell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew as porn ever.</v>

2468
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Why would they sell it when they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make x amount of money from it?</v>

2469
01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:19.500
<v Speaker 1>When they could use it and take over </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries they could take over task to </v>

2470
01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:20.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2471
01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:22.810
<v Speaker 1>and why would you sell it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you sold it then other people</v>

2472
01:41:22.811 --> 01:41:24.820
<v Speaker 1>would have access to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to use it.</v>

2473
01:41:24.821 --> 01:41:25.900
<v Speaker 1>If the military is gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use it.</v>

2474
01:41:25.901 --> 01:41:26.660
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2475
01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 1>the military is not going to turn into </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of fucking,</v>

2476
01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:31.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vendor start selling some product.</v>

2477
01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.770
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have late night </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials.</v>

2478
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:37.630
<v Speaker 1>The theory that like the Samurais were </v>
<v Speaker 1>the days.</v>

2479
01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:44.220
<v Speaker 1>That's why they fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got my tattoo on my arm son </v>

2480
01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:47.760
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just don't talk because it has so </v>

2481
01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:51.071
<v Speaker 1>much come in their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why pirates pirates dress </v>

2482
01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:52.400
<v Speaker 1>flamboyantly flamboyantly you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word they're all gay stop plants on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's was wearing.</v>

2484

<v Speaker 1>and shit back then?</v>

2485
01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Big Sashes and fucking pirates were </v>
<v Speaker 1>super gay and flamboyant silk shirts.</v>

2486
01:42:04.271 --> 01:42:09.271
<v Speaker 1>We're not taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vikings and pirates aren't the same </v>

2487
01:42:09.271 --> 01:42:09.271
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

2491
01:42:11.581 --> 01:42:16.480
<v Speaker 1>That's why Nordic chicks are so hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they raped and pillaged all the </v>

2492
01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:16.660
<v Speaker 1>best ones.</v>

<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2496
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Big Difference between that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pirates pirates are sucking Dick and </v>

2530
01:43:49.811 --> 01:43:52.110

<v Speaker 3>I might have bills y'all.</v>

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.480
<v Speaker 3>My favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my funniest,</v>

2541
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:22.280

<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

2542
01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:24.430
<v Speaker 3>but the thing about south park was when </v>
<v Speaker 3>Saddam Hussein,</v>

2543
01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:28.190
<v Speaker 3>when they had Saddam saying being gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the devil and remember he had a big</v>

2544
01:44:28.191 --> 01:44:33.191
<v Speaker 3>rubber Dick and so funny that I saw that</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie in a theater full of Mexicans when</v>

2545
01:44:35.961 --> 01:44:38.270
<v Speaker 3>they called God the biggest bitch of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mall.</v>

2546
01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:42.650
<v Speaker 3>You just felt the room energy turn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got mad.</v>

2547
01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They're did Mohammed,</v>

2549
01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:51.060
<v Speaker 3>you need to get camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was at that party at for a brief </v>

2550
01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:51.060
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2551
01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be a bomb here is that many </v>

2552
01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:57.290
<v Speaker 3>people were threatening their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really were worried about that.</v>

2553
01:44:57.430 --> 01:45:02.430
<v Speaker 3>The people were threatening their lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were making fun of </v>

2554
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:05.020
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they saying that the time square </v>

2555
01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:07.361
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was something the time square guy </v>

2556
01:45:07.361 --> 01:45:07.361
<v Speaker 3>sounds like he's retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2557
01:45:07.361 --> 01:45:11.840
<v Speaker 3>we talked to people that know bombs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand construction of bombs and </v>

2558
01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:14.861
<v Speaker 3>like this could have never worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole bunch of things work </v>

2559
01:45:14.861 --> 01:45:14.861
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect in order.</v>

2560
01:45:14.861 --> 01:45:16.610
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have any experience doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>set it up wrong,</v>

2561
01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:17.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

2562
01:45:17.361 --> 01:45:22.361
<v Speaker 3>this is all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He seems like it's just a fucking </v>

2563
01:45:22.361 --> 01:45:22.361
<v Speaker 3>retard that they had over there.</v>

2564
01:45:22.361 --> 01:45:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Disenfranchise God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing his house,</v>

2565
01:45:23.541 --> 01:45:25.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of a guy and you know,</v>

2566
01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:28.730
<v Speaker 3>just wants something to connect </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves to something significant.</v>

2567
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.260
<v Speaker 3>So he decides he's going to be a martyr </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2568
01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:35.990
<v Speaker 3>like when they came up to on the plane </v>
<v Speaker 3>he asked them if they were FBI or CIA.</v>

2569
01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:37.400
<v Speaker 3>He asked them what they were in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York,</v>

2570
01:45:37.410 --> 01:45:39.740
<v Speaker 3>priests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York police or CIA or FBI.</v>

2571
01:45:39.741 --> 01:45:41.150
<v Speaker 3>What are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to know.</v>

2572
01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:42.490
<v Speaker 3>He want to know who is getting arrested </v>
<v Speaker 3>bias.</v>

2573
01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:44.960
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to get fucking caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a dumb ass.</v>

2574
01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:50.140
<v Speaker 3>So I think there are groups out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are trying to do fucked up shit to </v>

2575
01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:50.390
<v Speaker 3>Americans for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There definitely are.</v>

2576
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:52.430
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is the dudes who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>joining these things,</v>

2577
01:45:52.431 --> 01:45:53.870
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking mess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2578
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're idiots.</v>

2579
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:59.870
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're either idiots or they're all </v>

2580
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.990
<v Speaker 3>fucked up or nobody's signing up to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this shit.</v>

2581
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:01.550
<v Speaker 3>If they got it all together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2582
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.300
<v Speaker 3>the key to making the world safe is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing all the fucked up people.</v>

2583
01:46:05.301 --> 01:46:08.120
<v Speaker 3>It's making sure that people coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it together,</v>

2584
01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:12.560
<v Speaker 3>do your best to make sure there's plenty</v>
<v Speaker 3>of cool people do your best to make sure</v>

2585
01:46:12.561 --> 01:46:17.561
<v Speaker 3>the kids are raised correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you just set up good schools and </v>

2586
01:46:17.561 --> 01:46:19.730
<v Speaker 3>community centers and do things to try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to enhance the lives of children,</v>

2587
01:46:19.731 --> 01:46:21.610
<v Speaker 3>to make them grow up to be more positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2588
01:46:21.630 --> 01:46:26.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way to fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to do that when they </v>

2589
01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:26.630
<v Speaker 3>just keep pulling money out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>education?</v>

2590
01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2591
01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:29.900
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough incentive to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're rich,</v>

2592
01:46:29.901 --> 01:46:31.610
<v Speaker 3>rich people put their kids in private </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools.</v>

2593
01:46:31.670 --> 01:46:32.500
<v Speaker 3>So they look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2594
01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:34.130
<v Speaker 3>the situation like this other people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>

2595
01:46:34.131 --> 01:46:35.240
<v Speaker 3>fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2596
01:46:35.241 --> 01:46:38.540
<v Speaker 3>but it's your problem to manage those </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids grow up and they're disenfranchised</v>

2597
01:46:38.541 --> 01:46:40.090
<v Speaker 3>and fucking dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2598
01:46:40.150 --> 01:46:45.150

<v Speaker 3>with you now if you go to like places </v>

2599
01:46:45.150 --> 01:46:46.400
<v Speaker 3>like Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

2600
01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:51.090

<v Speaker 3>they seem to be more like a group.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2693
01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:20.400
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what Sam triple and I were </v>

2694
01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:22.411
<v Speaker 3>talking about on the way over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about why is America so </v>

2695
01:50:22.411 --> 01:50:22.411
<v Speaker 3>aggressive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're saying,</v>

2696
01:50:22.411 --> 01:50:23.920
<v Speaker 3>well you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the people that came to America are</v>

2697
01:50:23.921 --> 01:50:26.110
<v Speaker 3>the people that were so fed up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe.</v>

2698
01:50:26.111 --> 01:50:31.111
<v Speaker 3>There were so ambitious that they got on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking boat and sailed across oceans </v>

2699
01:50:31.111 --> 01:50:31.111
<v Speaker 3>to get over here.</v>

2700
01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:36.260
<v Speaker 3>They put themselves through serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most aggressive of the aggressive </v>

2701
01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:36.260
<v Speaker 3>and once they got here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2702
01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:39.400
<v Speaker 3>they were desperado and a lot of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>got here during the depression or before</v>

2703
01:50:39.401 --> 01:50:40.390
<v Speaker 3>the depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2704
01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:43.170
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them got here back then and </v>
<v Speaker 3>those fucking people do.</v>

2705
01:50:43.210 --> 01:50:44.910
<v Speaker 3>The people grew up in the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2706
01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:47.080
<v Speaker 3>they had a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were fucking hard people,</v>

2707
01:50:47.081 --> 01:50:47.980
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were hard,</v>

2708
01:50:47.981 --> 01:50:52.981
<v Speaker 3>hard times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hear stories about soup lines and </v>

2709
01:50:52.981 --> 01:50:53.180
<v Speaker 3>whole families being outside and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2710
01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:54.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean you see some of the photos from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2711
01:50:54.611 --> 01:50:56.530
<v Speaker 3>from the depression era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was scary,</v>

2712
01:50:56.531 --> 01:51:01.531
<v Speaker 3>scary shit for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those people grew up hard and they </v>

2713
01:51:01.531 --> 01:51:02.830
<v Speaker 3>grew up aggressive and those are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones that stayed and they had kids.</v>

2714
01:51:02.831 --> 01:51:05.020
<v Speaker 3>And then they had kids and that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>

2715
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.410
<v Speaker 3>aggressive attitude of survival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still still there.</v>

2716
01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:08.800
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

2717
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:14.430
<v Speaker 3>And then that's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about this before about </v>

2718
01:51:14.430 --> 01:51:17.431
<v Speaker 3>California so weird is because all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were dissatisfied with the </v>

2719
01:51:17.431 --> 01:51:20.731
<v Speaker 3>east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all slowly made their way </v>

2720
01:51:20.731 --> 01:51:20.731
<v Speaker 3>further and further and further and </v>
<v Speaker 3>further west.</v>

2721
01:51:20.731 --> 01:51:25.350
<v Speaker 3>And you mix them with people just want </v>
<v Speaker 3>fame and they know that the most </v>

2722
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:28.441
<v Speaker 3>aggressive be aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>La has got to be the freakiest fucking </v>

2723
01:51:28.441 --> 01:51:32.251
<v Speaker 3>place to live ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's gotta be like Hollywood </v>

<v Speaker 3>government car.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Why didn't?</v>

2736
01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 3>Because they were raised by idiots for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2737
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:04.230
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing that because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>human nature to do it because they're </v>

2738
01:52:04.230 --> 01:52:08.011
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're born into a fucked up situation </v>

2739
01:52:08.011 --> 01:52:08.011
<v Speaker 3>with a ton of struggle by a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that can't cope and doesn't,</v>

2740
01:52:08.011 --> 01:52:08.740
<v Speaker 3>don't balance things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2741
01:52:08.741 --> 01:52:11.320
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>born into poverty.</v>

2742
01:52:11.321 --> 01:52:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Alot of them born into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2743
01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:15.280
<v Speaker 3>immigration situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of fucking stripe.</v>

2744
01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:17.260
<v Speaker 3>You're uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're raising kids right now.</v>

2745
01:52:17.261 --> 01:52:22.261
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you feel like raising kids is almost </v>

2746
01:52:22.261 --> 01:52:25.000
<v Speaker 3>like raising a wild animal almost where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to like teach them,</v>

2747
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:28.390
<v Speaker 3>you have to almost house trained them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that.</v>

2748
01:52:28.391 --> 01:52:31.780
<v Speaker 3>So I know you don't want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>your children's not specific like that.</v>

2749
01:52:31.781 --> 01:52:34.030
<v Speaker 3>It's much more different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like an alien.</v>

2750
01:52:34.031 --> 01:52:35.860
<v Speaker 3>So like something that doesn't even know</v>
<v Speaker 3>this world,</v>

2751
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild animal has their own instincts and </v>

2752
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:41.000
<v Speaker 3>you have to kind of tone them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've had wild cats before.</v>

2753
01:52:41.190 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I would feral cats that were raised </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside or they were born outside and </v>

2754
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 3>they're wild man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feral</v>

2755
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:46.850
<v Speaker 2>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when you get.</v>

2756
01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:49.700
<v Speaker 2>I got mine when he was a kitten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was only like two months old.</v>

2757
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:51.440
<v Speaker 2>He was maybe three months old at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

2758
01:52:51.441 --> 01:52:56.441
<v Speaker 2>but he was wild as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean wild like hissing at you and </v>

2759
01:52:56.441 --> 01:52:58.780
<v Speaker 2>fucking leaping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clawing the walls and Mon.</v>

2760
01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:01.310
<v Speaker 2>I first got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a friend of mine that I went to high</v>

2761
01:53:01.311 --> 01:53:04.310
<v Speaker 2>school with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a bunch of them in her apartment</v>

2762
01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:09.311
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a parking lot area and this </v>

2763
01:53:09.311 --> 01:53:09.311
<v Speaker 2>female federal Canada at a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>kittens.</v>

2764
01:53:09.311 --> 01:53:13.190
<v Speaker 2>So she decIded she was gonna catch the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kittens and give them two houses and she</v>

2765
01:53:13.191 --> 01:53:15.380
<v Speaker 2>gave one of them to me and so I took </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking cat.</v>

2766
01:53:15.381 --> 01:53:20.381
<v Speaker 2>This cat was crazy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd never seen anything like it </v>

2767
01:53:20.381 --> 01:53:21.860
<v Speaker 2>ever in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had a couple of days off work so I</v>

2768
01:53:21.861 --> 01:53:23.990
<v Speaker 2>decided I'm going to have to get this </v>
<v Speaker 2>cat delight me.</v>

2769
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.520
<v Speaker 2>I've got this cat is going to live in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

2770
01:53:25.521 --> 01:53:27.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna have to get this cat to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>chill with me.</v>

2771
01:53:27.710 --> 01:53:32.710
<v Speaker 2>So I put one of my bedrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put a bed in it that I don't normally </v>

2772
01:53:32.710 --> 01:53:36.620
<v Speaker 2>sleep in and I put some cat food in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and some water and I just slept in</v>

2773
01:53:36.621 --> 01:53:41.621
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read books for two days and wrote </v>

2774
01:53:41.621 --> 01:53:41.621
<v Speaker 2>material and hung out with this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>cat until he became my friend,</v>

2775
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:43.160
<v Speaker 2>but dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy.</v>

2776
01:53:43.161 --> 01:53:48.161
<v Speaker 2>I'd pick him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would start purring and then I would </v>

2777
01:53:48.161 --> 01:53:48.620
<v Speaker 2>put them down as soon as I put them </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

2778
01:53:49.810 --> 01:53:53.210
<v Speaker 2>go fucking crazy and run away from me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fucking tried to climb up the walls.</v>

2779
01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:58.360
<v Speaker 2>It was like when I would pick them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the warmth and the comfort in the fact </v>

2780
01:53:58.360 --> 01:53:58.360
<v Speaker 2>that I was giving him affection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a keanu he could relax,</v>

2781
01:53:58.360 --> 01:53:59.940
<v Speaker 2>that I was going to do good things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as I put them down,</v>

2782
01:53:59.941 --> 01:54:04.941
<v Speaker 2>it's was like immediate terror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's nothing or nothing like raising </v>

2783
01:54:04.941 --> 01:54:04.941
<v Speaker 2>a wild animal.</v>

2784
01:54:04.941 --> 01:54:09.400
<v Speaker 2>It'S like raising something that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist and all of a sudden it gets </v>

2785
01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:10.940
<v Speaker 2>brought forth into this dimension with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely clean slate.</v>

2786
01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:13.940
<v Speaker 2>They have no knowledge of what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2787
01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:18.970
<v Speaker 2>They have certain tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tendencies towards being needy or </v>

2788
01:54:18.970 --> 01:54:21.020
<v Speaker 2>aggressive or tendencies towards being </v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed and they,</v>

2789
01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:24.470
<v Speaker 2>their personality is definitely very and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not that's genetic,</v>

2790
01:54:24.471 --> 01:54:26.960
<v Speaker 2>whether or not that's just when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were born,</v>

2791
01:54:26.961 --> 01:54:28.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was going on,</v>

2792
01:54:28.581 --> 01:54:29.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my wife's body,</v>

2793
01:54:29.961 --> 01:54:34.961
<v Speaker 2>what was going on with her diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's going on with their genetics </v>

2794
01:54:34.961 --> 01:54:34.961
<v Speaker 2>was going on with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2795
01:54:34.961 --> 01:54:38.950
<v Speaker 2>the fucking solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows what influences </v>

2796
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.950
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether astrology is really not.</v>

2797
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:43.990
<v Speaker 2>And then from there you just get this </v>
<v Speaker 2>blank slate and you got to raise this </v>

2798
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.240
<v Speaker 2>blank slate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's really,</v>

2799
01:54:44.610 --> 01:54:46.200
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem like the community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2800
01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:51.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people think of it as like this </v>

2801
01:54:51.370 --> 01:54:51.370
<v Speaker 2>burden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2802
01:54:51.370 --> 01:54:51.370
<v Speaker 2>oh gotta raise this kid.</v>

2803
01:54:51.370 --> 01:54:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I used to always think that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it was like that you have kids.</v>

2804
01:54:52.191 --> 01:54:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Like god becomes a burden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotta take care of the kids,</v>

2805
01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.730
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't seem like that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me it seems it's fucking awesome.</v>

2806
01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:01.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're raising this new little</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving creature,</v>

2807
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:02.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little,</v>

2808
01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:07.860
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little awesome person that you love so </v>

2809
01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:07.860
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2810
01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Like you want to do it like you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be with them.</v>

2811
01:55:08.271 --> 01:55:09.860
<v Speaker 2>You never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel like a burden to me,</v>

2812
01:55:09.861 --> 01:55:11.450
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a lot of fun.</v>

2813
01:55:11.451 --> 01:55:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes it requires a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

2814
01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:15.890
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to get things done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's fun.</v>

2815
01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.350
<v Speaker 2>But it was also.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The problem was just too much </v>

2838
01:56:13.861 --> 01:56:16.260
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much inequality in the way children </v>

2839
01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:16.260
<v Speaker 2>are raised as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much,</v>

2840
01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:19.680
<v Speaker 2>too many situations where people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like looking at people that have things </v>

2841
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:19.680
<v Speaker 2>on tv and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not me?</v>

01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that makes her competition in </v>

2845
01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:28.980
<v Speaker 2>certain in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you See things that other people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>you wish and wish you had and it forces </v>

3105
02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:43.650
<v Speaker 3>I was already.</v>

<v Speaker 3>how do you explain that away?</v>

3108
02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:49.510
<v Speaker 3>I got fake jujitsu dummies in my garage </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I practice on,</v>

3109
02:07:49.511 --> 02:07:51.910
<v Speaker 3>like if I can't get to class and I got </v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit I got to work on,</v>

02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:57.060
<v Speaker 3>I'll work out on the dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go over moves on a dummy because it's </v>

02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:57.460
<v Speaker 3>like it's above a dump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make them for gracie jujitsu,</v>

3112
02:07:58.090 --> 02:08:00.400

3232
02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:51.260
<v Speaker 3>the flashlight has made it into my act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's like I have a whole chunk on</v>

3233
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:56.290
<v Speaker 3>the flashlight and how the chunks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the best way to do </v>

3234
02:12:56.541 --> 02:12:57.960
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

3235
02:12:58.110 --> 02:13:00.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who I really emulated.</v>

3236
02:13:00.111 --> 02:13:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Where I learned that from was richard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jenny,</v>

3237
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:04.460
<v Speaker 3>because richard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jenny would write and he would write the</v>

3238
02:13:04.461 --> 02:13:05.870
<v Speaker 3>shit out of a subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

3239
02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:08.750
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was always impressed when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would go to see him that this guy,</v>

3240
02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:11.120
<v Speaker 3>like when a guy has just one thing on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject,</v>

3241
02:13:11.121 --> 02:13:13.160
<v Speaker 3>he brings up a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a thing on it,</v>

3242
02:13:13.161 --> 02:13:15.140
<v Speaker 3>and then he moves onto the next subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always feel like,</v>

3243
02:13:15.141 --> 02:13:20.141
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just started toucHing on the </v>

3244
02:13:20.141 --> 02:13:20.141
<v Speaker 3>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sure that that's all the angles that</v>

3245
02:13:20.141 --> 02:13:20.150
<v Speaker 3>are in that subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3246
02:13:20.151 --> 02:13:22.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like I got enough out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that experience,</v>

3247
02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:23.660
<v Speaker 3>but when I would go see richard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jenny,</v>

3248
02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:26.720
<v Speaker 3>that guy would like write these big long</v>
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>

3249
02:13:26.721 --> 02:13:28.100
<v Speaker 3>but right when he thought he was done </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it,</v>

3250
02:13:28.190 --> 02:13:30.790
<v Speaker 3>he would hit you with more shit with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it made it funnier and funnier.</v>

3251
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 3>More ridiculous as it</v>

3252
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:37.010
<v Speaker 2>got along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I learned how to do that from him </v>

3253
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:37.010
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3254
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:39.000
<v Speaker 2>you do chunks to men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Electronic store guys do chunks,</v>

3255
02:13:39.001 --> 02:13:39.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3256
02:13:39.890 --> 02:13:42.510
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys from there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have similar styles.</v>

3257
02:13:42.540 --> 02:13:44.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd go loose.</v>

3258
02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:47.550
<v Speaker 2>It's not like verbatim same way every </v>
<v Speaker 2>night because that place is like a chaos</v>

3259
02:13:47.551 --> 02:13:48.130
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3260
02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:49.860
<v Speaker 2>You can't go up there and do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monologue.</v>

3261
02:13:50.250 --> 02:13:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to hear that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3262
02:13:52.590 --> 02:13:54.450
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to interact with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people at some point.</v>

3263
02:13:54.451 --> 02:13:55.530
<v Speaker 2>That's why hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showcase.</v>

3264
02:13:55.540 --> 02:13:59.360
<v Speaker 2>And I think showcasing for something Is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just so not natural,</v>

3265
02:13:59.630 --> 02:14:00.540
<v Speaker 2>like seven minutes.</v>

3266
02:14:00.810 --> 02:14:03.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And just go up there and a to z and it's</v>

3267
02:14:03.781 --> 02:14:05.010
<v Speaker 6>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not what I do.</v>

3268
02:14:05.011 --> 02:14:08.150
<v Speaker 6>It's like I like to be in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>talk about what's going on.</v>

3269
02:14:08.590 --> 02:14:13.590
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because kennison who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite comics and I think </v>

3270
02:14:13.590 --> 02:14:14.650
<v Speaker 2>one of yours as well always had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

3271
02:14:14.710 --> 02:14:16.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a comedy store guy as well.</v>

3272
02:14:17.110 --> 02:14:20.440
<v Speaker 2>he always had the problem where he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes me 10 minutes to get cooking.</v>

3273
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:25.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do like seven minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got a problem and he didn't want to </v>

3274
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:28.411
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the rodney dangerfield specialist </v>

3275
02:14:28.411 --> 02:14:28.411
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

3276
02:14:28.411 --> 02:14:28.411
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3277
02:14:28.411 --> 02:14:28.411
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a lot of time.</v>

3278
02:14:28.411 --> 02:14:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Like he had a concern about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3279
02:14:29.681 --> 02:14:34.681
<v Speaker 2>I think we both have that style that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from the chaos of that fuckIng </v>

3280
02:14:34.681 --> 02:14:34.681
<v Speaker 2>crazy comedy store</v>

3281
02:14:34.681 --> 02:14:35.530
<v Speaker 6>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3282
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:38.040
<v Speaker 6>When I walk up on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

3283
02:14:38.050 --> 02:14:40.120
<v Speaker 6>it takes me a little longer than </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody else.</v>

3284
02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:42.250
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when there's people who walk up on stage</v>

3285
02:14:42.251 --> 02:14:47.251
<v Speaker 6>and they have a certain look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you kind of know what they're going to </v>

3286
02:14:47.251 --> 02:14:48.370
<v Speaker 6>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So people like our rem board,</v>

3287
02:14:48.430 --> 02:14:53.430
<v Speaker 6>do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like john gibberella goes up with a hat </v>

3288
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:54.460
<v Speaker 6>and he looks like one of the guys from </v>
<v Speaker 6>south park and talks like this,</v>

<v Speaker 6>What's going on here?</v>

3293
02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.770
<v Speaker 6>It always takes me like a couple </v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes.</v>

3294
02:15:08.771 --> 02:15:13.771
<v Speaker 6>I'm fine with that now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when I first started I was always </v>

3295
02:15:13.771 --> 02:15:13.771
<v Speaker 6>get very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>off in a bad direction,</v>

3297

<v Speaker 2>but for whatever reason it never took </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

3411

<v Speaker 2>When I saw him,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That guy should have been a giant.</v>

3455
02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Should've been fucking headlining </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere over the world.</v>

3456
02:20:50.361 --> 02:20:52.700
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that no one knows about.</v>

3457
02:20:53.530 --> 02:20:57.320
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also something about what we</v>

3458
02:20:57.321 --> 02:20:58.400
<v Speaker 3>knew about these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3460
02:21:03.460 --> 02:21:06.431
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm listening to the little comics </v>

02:21:06.431 --> 02:21:06.431
<v Speaker 3>that we knew that were really funny and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're describing.</v>

3462
02:21:06.431 --> 02:21:08.780
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people asking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we know these people?</v>

3463
02:21:08.781 --> 02:21:10.490
<v Speaker 3>Why would we care about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are these people?</v>

3464
02:21:10.730 --> 02:21:12.350

<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

3468
02:21:19.540 --> 02:21:21.080
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about comedy and what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>our history and to us it's interesting.</v>

3469
02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:22.550
<v Speaker 3>People that are into comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be.</v>

3470
02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:24.230

<v Speaker 3>You're not helping.</v>

3475
02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:32.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not helping bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Negative shit.</v>

3476
02:21:32.541 --> 02:21:37.541
<v Speaker 3>It's not helping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting to me and I think I </v>

3477

<v Speaker 3>watching all these different guys.</v>

3481
02:21:45.890 --> 02:21:48.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the most Important</v>
<v Speaker 3>things about comedy development is being</v>

3482
02:21:48.621 --> 02:21:50.360
<v Speaker 3>around a bunch of other really funny </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And it's a blessing too because like </v>

<v Speaker 3>they just weren't.</v>

3573
02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was kat williams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just not into a shit man </v>

3574
02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:24.680

<v Speaker 2>first hbo appearance?</v>

<v Speaker 2>charismatic and powerful standups ever </v>

3586

<v Speaker 2>def jam at the time.</v>

3588
02:26:03.581 --> 02:26:06.250

3645
02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:37.430
<v Speaker 3>show became part of the lexicon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm rich bitch.</v>

3646
02:28:37.431 --> 02:28:39.110
<v Speaker 3>How many people just would yell that </v>
<v Speaker 3>out?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

3650
02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:49.040
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had an impact that nothing else did,</v>

3651
02:28:49.041 --> 02:28:54.041
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when he stepped away from that </v>

3652
02:28:54.041 --> 02:28:54.041
<v Speaker 3>and everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3653
02:28:54.041 --> 02:28:56.570
<v Speaker 3>he really doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was mad at him at all.</v>

3654
02:28:56.571 --> 02:28:59.690
<v Speaker 3>I always wonder if like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you killed like the golden goose.</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3657
02:29:04.011 --> 02:29:06.350
<v Speaker 3>He can do whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he gives a fuck.</v>

3658
02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:08.050
<v Speaker 3>If he wanted to sell out stadiums,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3659
02:29:08.051 --> 02:29:08.840
<v Speaker 3>he could sell out stadiums.</v>

3660
02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:13.840
<v Speaker 3>He's not trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's showing up at comedy clubs like </v>

3661
02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:16.091
<v Speaker 3>unannounced and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's showing up and doing guest spots </v>

3662
02:29:16.091 --> 02:29:16.710
<v Speaker 3>and shit and going up for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours here and there where he's not even</v>

3663
02:29:16.711 --> 02:29:19.790
<v Speaker 3>like having people pay to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing that many real shows.</v>

3772
02:33:42.511 --> 02:33:45.390
<v Speaker 6>He introduces me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm want to say he doesn't even wait for</v>

3774
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:54.550
<v Speaker 6>I've never seen anyone do this before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Runs a full sprint off the stage to the </v>

3775
02:33:54.661 --> 02:33:57.840
<v Speaker 6>side,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to his left leaves the stage gmt.</v>

3776
02:33:58.530 --> 02:34:01.410
<v Speaker 6>I go up to make you feel uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get up there.</v>

3777
02:34:01.411 --> 02:34:03.310
<v Speaker 6>I got this joke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always drop when I fall.</v>

<v Speaker 6>we can fucking do this.</v>

3781
02:34:10.531 --> 02:34:11.970
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Money.</v>

3782
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know.</v>

3783
02:34:13.290 --> 02:34:15.190
<v Speaker 3>They probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them didn't know who you were.</v>

3784
02:34:15.191 --> 02:34:20.191
<v Speaker 3>They were just going to see some comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've maybe heard your name or </v>

3785
02:34:20.191 --> 02:34:20.200
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was as national headline of go,</v>

3786
02:34:20.201 --> 02:34:21.480
<v Speaker 3>just destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3787
02:34:21.481 --> 02:34:24.700
<v Speaker 3>in just trying to bury me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he loves to do.</v>

3788
02:34:24.701 --> 02:34:26.230
<v Speaker 3>he's a sick person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3789
02:34:26.530 --> 02:34:29.380
<v Speaker 3>You know the mark marin podcast was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>

3790
02:34:29.381 --> 02:34:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Listen to it because it was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to a crazy person.</v>

3791
02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:34.630
<v Speaker 3>The crazy thing is he bumped marin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marin was at the improv once.</v>

3792
02:34:34.631 --> 02:34:39.631
<v Speaker 3>He bumped marin for like an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marin didn't even say anything to them </v>

3793
02:34:39.631 --> 02:34:39.631
<v Speaker 3>until the second podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3794
02:34:39.631 --> 02:34:40.480
<v Speaker 3>the first time he didn't bring it up </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3795
02:34:40.481 --> 02:34:41.710
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why'd you bump me for an hour?</v>

3796
02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:46.090
<v Speaker 3>I'll fuck you forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that whole thing about that video is</v>

3797
02:34:46.091 --> 02:34:51.091
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like he brought that on himself to </v>

3798
02:34:51.091 --> 02:34:51.091
<v Speaker 3>new videos.</v>

3799
02:34:51.091 --> 02:34:55.680
<v Speaker 3>The craziest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just flat out positions and </v>

3800
02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:57.550
<v Speaker 3>that's where he is where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obvious who was on stage for.</v>

3801
02:34:57.580 --> 02:34:58.750
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3802
02:34:58.990 --> 02:35:03.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were there before you left and you </v>

3803
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:03.990
<v Speaker 3>came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3804
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he brought that on self.</v>

3805
02:35:04.661 --> 02:35:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see what the situation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullying or anything like that.</v>

3806
02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:10.390
<v Speaker 3>That's his mare and being silly marries </v>
<v Speaker 3>a contrarian.</v>

3807
02:35:10.391 --> 02:35:15.391
<v Speaker 3>He's always trying to find some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>unique angle that other people don't </v>

3808
02:35:15.391 --> 02:35:15.391
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my biggest problem.</v>

3809
02:35:15.391 --> 02:35:15.670
<v Speaker 3>So he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's complained about,</v>

3810
02:35:15.671 --> 02:35:20.671
<v Speaker 3>and I love baron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't complain about joke stealing </v>

3811
02:35:20.671 --> 02:35:23.310
<v Speaker 3>and then he did a lot of dumb shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only did they complete,</v>

3812
02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:28.380
<v Speaker 3>this is what marin does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marin compared it to people being </v>

3813
02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:29.200
<v Speaker 3>influenced by people that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people that sound like people,</v>

3814
02:35:29.201 --> 02:35:29.660
<v Speaker 3>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

3815
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:30.600
<v Speaker 3>I've been guilty of.</v>

3816
02:35:30.650 --> 02:35:31.420
<v Speaker 3>we've all been given.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3817
02:35:31.421 --> 02:35:32.480
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3818
02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:34.420
<v Speaker 3>when you get influenced by people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not.</v>

3819
02:35:34.421 --> 02:35:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Plagiarism does a huge fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between that plagiarism.</v>

3820
02:35:37.781 --> 02:35:42.781
<v Speaker 3>It's a ridiculous comparison and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other thing that he said was that I </v>

3821
02:35:42.781 --> 02:35:42.781
<v Speaker 3>thought was really kind of fucked up was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

3822
02:35:42.781 --> 02:35:47.431
<v Speaker 3>like he made it through comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did everything to comedy and just had a </v>

3823
02:35:47.431 --> 02:35:49.120
<v Speaker 3>lot of hard work and he can't wait to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take away the fact that he worked hard.</v>

3824
02:35:49.121 --> 02:35:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck are you talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about?</v>

3825
02:35:50.890 --> 02:35:55.890
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>stealing and then he also said that he </v>

3826
02:35:55.890 --> 02:35:55.890
<v Speaker 3>thought that the video should have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>released,</v>

3827
02:35:55.890 --> 02:35:57.070
<v Speaker 3>that we should have handled this within </v>
<v Speaker 3>the community.</v>

3828
02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:59.290
<v Speaker 3>This is all coming from a guy who's got </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking podcast.</v>

3829
02:35:59.291 --> 02:36:04.291
<v Speaker 3>We're four hours talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>sounded like a 10 minute video or </v>

3830
02:36:04.291 --> 02:36:06.850
<v Speaker 3>podcast talking about it on more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>one occasion.</v>

3831
02:36:06.850 --> 02:36:10.450
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silly marin's fucking karma,</v>

3832
02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:11.980
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that was,</v>

3833
02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:14.500
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wanted that to happen,</v>

3834
02:36:14.530 --> 02:36:15.340
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

3835
02:36:15.341 --> 02:36:20.341
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted him to not be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted him to not do what he was </v>

3836
02:36:20.341 --> 02:36:23.401
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't want to set out to try to </v>

3837
02:36:23.401 --> 02:36:23.401
<v Speaker 3>fucking destroy somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

3838
02:36:23.401 --> 02:36:24.910
<v Speaker 3>We had a problem we had a deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how,</v>

3839
02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:30.240
<v Speaker 3>how bad was the store?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many times have you seen people </v>

3840
02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:32.941
<v Speaker 3>freak the fuck out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that guy was in the back of the </v>

3841
02:36:32.941 --> 02:36:32.941
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do.</v>

3842
02:36:32.941 --> 02:36:34.080
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The funniest thing about him is like,</v>

3843
02:36:34.150 --> 02:36:38.860
<v Speaker 3>he's so easy to follow if like if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually did my material,</v>

3844
02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:44.040
<v Speaker 3>it's so easy to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want to do your good shit </v>

3845
02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:44.140
<v Speaker 3>because it was in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3846
02:36:44.170 --> 02:36:47.710
<v Speaker 3>So I just go to crowd work and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes great and sometimes it doesn't.</v>

3847
02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3848
02:36:49.180 --> 02:36:54.180
<v Speaker 3>that was what was missing from this </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole discussion with the real problem </v>

3849
02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:55.390
<v Speaker 3>with having something like that is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not anyone's free of guilt.</v>

3850
02:36:55.420 --> 02:36:58.000
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is what the situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

3851
02:36:58.001 --> 02:37:03.001
<v Speaker 3>As someone who is ruining an artistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and creating a bunch of </v>

3852
02:37:03.001 --> 02:37:04.510
<v Speaker 3>stress and tension all for their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal gain.</v>

3853
02:37:04.511 --> 02:37:08.470
<v Speaker 3>And this isn't respected by the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are selling the art form.</v>

3854
02:37:08.471 --> 02:37:09.940
<v Speaker 3>The people that are owning the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>club,</v>

3855
02:37:10.090 --> 02:37:12.340
<v Speaker 3>that people that are like the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why a comedy club is open,</v>

3856
02:37:12.341 --> 02:37:17.341
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a place to buy drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a place to watch comedians perform </v>

3857
02:37:17.341 --> 02:37:17.341
<v Speaker 3>and who you</v>

3858
02:37:17.341 --> 02:37:20.600
<v Speaker 2>got someone who's actively victimizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other participants in this community</v>

3859
02:37:20.601 --> 02:37:23.640
<v Speaker 2>that keeps you alive and you're letting </v>
<v Speaker 2>that person for short term.</v>

3860
02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:26.620
<v Speaker 6>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just they're not artists.</v>

3861
02:37:26.621 --> 02:37:28.540
<v Speaker 6>They're selling art.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are not artists.</v>

3862
02:37:28.541 --> 02:37:31.270
<v Speaker 6>They don't respect it the way an artist </v>
<v Speaker 6>respects,</v>

3863
02:37:31.310 --> 02:37:32.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3864
02:37:32.370 --> 02:37:37.370
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just things he said on that podcast in </v>

3865
02:37:37.370 --> 02:37:38.200
<v Speaker 6>terms of just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3866
02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:40.520
<v Speaker 6>he sits still.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He acts,</v>

3867
02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:45.540
<v Speaker 6>he says he doesn't sit in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he sits in the room texting who you </v>

3868
02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:45.540
<v Speaker 6>texting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your texting yourself.</v>

3869
02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:49.330
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's like if you really wanted </v>
<v Speaker 6>people not to hate you anymore,</v>

3870
02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:51.580
<v Speaker 6>you would never go in the room when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>weren't performing.</v>

3871
02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:55.090
<v Speaker 6>I have this theory dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if if you're a guy who's been doing</v>

3872
02:37:55.091 --> 02:37:59.350
<v Speaker 6>comedy over like 10 to 12 years and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're like watching like open mics,</v>

3873
02:37:59.740 --> 02:38:02.740
<v Speaker 6>you're probably,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're fishing for material</v>

3874
02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:08.440
<v Speaker 2>or you could be a really curious person </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to see the beginnings again and </v>

3875
02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:11.541
<v Speaker 2>see horrible failures and see like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like to watch somebody like </v>

3876
02:38:11.541 --> 02:38:13.040
<v Speaker 2>real nervous and uncomfortable to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>there the whole night and just be.</v>

3877
02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3878
02:38:14.191 --> 02:38:19.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that anybody watching an </v>

3879
02:38:19.191 --> 02:38:19.191
<v Speaker 2>open mic night is definitely a thief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but suspect there's.</v>

3880
02:38:19.191 --> 02:38:24.020
<v Speaker 2>You can get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can cherry pick some great ideas </v>

3881
02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:24.020
<v Speaker 2>that people don't know how to work in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>open mic night.</v>

3882
02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3883
02:38:24.630 --> 02:38:26.820
<v Speaker 2>how many times you watched an open mic </v>
<v Speaker 2>night not micro go,</v>

3884
02:38:26.821 --> 02:38:27.720
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good idea.</v>

3885
02:38:27.721 --> 02:38:30.300
<v Speaker 2>He's not doing it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a great fucking idea of using</v>

3886
02:38:30.301 --> 02:38:32.250
<v Speaker 2>go tell them how to tweak it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3887
02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:33.570
<v Speaker 2>that's a nice thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3888
02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:36.930
<v Speaker 2>I've had people do that to me and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool when someone comes up to you</v>

3889
02:38:36.931 --> 02:38:38.910
<v Speaker 2>like lucy kay was the last one to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me.</v>

3890
02:38:38.911 --> 02:38:43.911
<v Speaker 2>He saw my sat and then afterwards he </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually wrote a bunch of shit down and </v>

3891
02:38:43.911 --> 02:38:44.190
<v Speaker 2>he gave me a couple of cool ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

3892
02:38:44.420 --> 02:38:47.070
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>

3893
02:38:47.450 --> 02:38:52.450
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's the best right now as far </v>

3894
02:38:52.450 --> 02:38:52.450
<v Speaker 2>as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the most prolific,</v>

3895
02:38:52.450 --> 02:38:53.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the patent as well.</v>

3896
02:38:53.761 --> 02:38:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Patents and another one who I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

3897
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:57.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think penn is very funny.</v>

3898
02:38:57.431 --> 02:38:57.830
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3899
02:38:57.831 --> 02:39:02.831
<v Speaker 6>I have this whole thing about </v>
<v Speaker 6>alternative comedy and I find it very </v>

3900
02:39:02.831 --> 02:39:06.511
<v Speaker 6>funny because like the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>almost like the mount rushmore of </v>

3901
02:39:06.511 --> 02:39:07.150
<v Speaker 6>alternative comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is like,</v>

3902
02:39:07.310 --> 02:39:09.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pat and sarah silverman,</v>

3903
02:39:10.180 --> 02:39:15.180
<v Speaker 6>I'm David Cross and zach alpha nag.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like they're funny people.</v>

3904
02:39:15.701 --> 02:39:17.110
<v Speaker 6>They have set up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have punchline.</v>

3905
02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:18.960
<v Speaker 6>There is no alternative to it.</v>

3906
02:39:20.190 --> 02:39:22.350
<v Speaker 2>The exact same conversation yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>

3907
02:39:22.351 --> 02:39:27.351
<v Speaker 2>Like what is alternative comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are these mainstream comedians talk </v>

3908
02:39:27.351 --> 02:39:29.330
<v Speaker 2>about mainstream subjects and they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up comedy form.</v>

3909
02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:30.520
<v Speaker 2>How is that alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

3910
02:39:30.690 --> 02:39:33.000
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to define what alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy is.</v>

3911
02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:35.600
<v Speaker 6>I just think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as far as I can tell,</v>

3912
02:39:35.601 --> 02:39:38.690
<v Speaker 6>it's a look now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you have all five.</v>

3913
02:39:38.691 --> 02:39:41.210
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't because like I did the vancouver</v>

3914
02:39:41.211 --> 02:39:44.150
<v Speaker 6>comedy festival with the vivid video </v>
<v Speaker 6>comedy tour.</v>

3915
02:39:44.151 --> 02:39:49.151
<v Speaker 6>It was me two porn stars and nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was all nerds and I would watch like </v>

3916
02:39:49.730 --> 02:39:53.120
<v Speaker 6>their sets and they talk about this shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've heard everybody talk about,</v>

3917
02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:55.970
<v Speaker 6>but they did it with glasses on and </v>
<v Speaker 6>reading off a notebook.</v>

3918
02:39:56.210 --> 02:40:00.470
<v Speaker 6>It's like the closest thing to </v>
<v Speaker 6>alternative comedy might be a.</v>

3919
02:40:00.890 --> 02:40:03.590
<v Speaker 6>Is it tim and eric's great show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good jobs.</v>

3920
02:40:03.770 --> 02:40:08.770
<v Speaker 6>Those guys are brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're not going for your normal </v>

3921
02:40:08.770 --> 02:40:08.770
<v Speaker 6>like setup,</v>
<v Speaker 6>punch.</v>

3922
02:40:08.770 --> 02:40:13.570
<v Speaker 6>ThAt might be alternative kaufman this </v>
<v Speaker 6>like they're brilliant to.</v>

3923
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:15.960
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did with that.</v>

3924
02:40:15.961 --> 02:40:18.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know lord dale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see that one?</v>

3925
02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:19.840
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the greatest one of all time.</v>

3926
02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:24.860
<v Speaker 3>That where the grinding and choking they</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck and it's all psychedelic and crazy </v>

3927
02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:26.130
<v Speaker 3>neon jumping in fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

3928
02:40:26.131 --> 02:40:27.090
<v Speaker 3>humbling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humbling,</v>

3929
02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:29.970
<v Speaker 3>humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like real alternative comedy.</v>

3930
02:40:29.971 --> 02:40:32.190
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rest of it is just like.</v>

3931
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:33.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

3932
02:40:33.211 --> 02:40:33.620
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

3933
02:40:33.621 --> 02:40:35.520
<v Speaker 3>You're onstage with notes and that makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>it alternative.</v>

3934
02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:40.760
<v Speaker 3>What they've done is they've created an </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment where they can go with w </v>

3935
02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:42.900
<v Speaker 3>zero performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3936
02:40:43.260 --> 02:40:45.420
<v Speaker 3>on purpose and they don't like people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>perform,</v>

3937
02:40:45.421 --> 02:40:47.790
<v Speaker 3>which is understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people like soft music,</v>

3938
02:40:47.791 --> 02:40:49.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people like real calm,</v>

3939
02:40:49.051 --> 02:40:50.970
<v Speaker 3>soft music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like metal,</v>

3940
02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:51.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all.</v>

3941
02:40:51.901 --> 02:40:54.180
<v Speaker 3>It's all a choice issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like all sorts.</v>

3942
02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:56.610
<v Speaker 3>like I like jeff foxworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mankato crazy,</v>

3943
02:40:56.611 --> 02:40:56.950
<v Speaker 3>but I think.</v>

3944
02:40:57.060 --> 02:40:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I think he's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude is funny bro.</v>

3945
02:40:59.161 --> 02:40:59.710
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

3946
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:05.000
<v Speaker 3>I could dig alan degeneracy man back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the day watching her specialty cable </v>

3947
02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:05.190
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got some great fucking jokes.</v>

3948
02:41:05.430 --> 02:41:10.430
<v Speaker 3>I like a wide range of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people get very particular about </v>

3949
02:41:10.430 --> 02:41:10.920
<v Speaker 3>the comedy music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about comedy,</v>

3950
02:41:10.921 --> 02:41:12.240
<v Speaker 3>about literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about everything.</v>

3951
02:41:12.570 --> 02:41:15.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of shit to enjoy,</v>

3952
02:41:15.031 --> 02:41:15.990
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

3953
02:41:16.010 --> 02:41:18.540
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be exactly your speed</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you to enjoy it.</v>

3954
02:41:18.541 --> 02:41:23.541
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of shit that's good that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't necessarily resonate with how </v>

3955
02:41:23.541 --> 02:41:24.060
<v Speaker 3>you would do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still I enjoy it.</v>

3956
02:41:24.450 --> 02:41:26.880
<v Speaker 3>The only people that drive me crazy are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the clean nazis.</v>

3957
02:41:27.350 --> 02:41:30.330
<v Speaker 3>Especially if they're like the filthiest</v>
<v Speaker 3>people offstage.</v>

3958
02:41:30.390 --> 02:41:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're making a business decision.</v>

3959
02:41:32.401 --> 02:41:34.170
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make that decision,</v>

3960
02:41:34.171 --> 02:41:36.270
<v Speaker 3>But don't get mad at me because I'm me </v>
<v Speaker 3>on stage.</v>

3961
02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:38.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amplified,</v>

3962
02:41:38.521 --> 02:41:39.700
<v Speaker 3>but still mia.</v>

3963
02:41:39.860 --> 02:41:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that a lot.</v>

3964
02:41:40.891 --> 02:41:41.340
<v Speaker 3>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3965
02:41:41.341 --> 02:41:43.140
<v Speaker 3>they get upset at you because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3966
02:41:43.150 --> 02:41:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Talk about silicon cock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too much hate douche bag.</v>

3967
02:41:45.061 --> 02:41:46.140
<v Speaker 3>I think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

3968
02:41:46.170 --> 02:41:47.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to talk about whatever I want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

3969
02:41:47.490 --> 02:41:49.260
<v Speaker 3>You talk about whatever you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about me.</v>

3970
02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:54.640
<v Speaker 3>lee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Funny idea that there's something bad </v>

3971
02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:54.640
<v Speaker 3>about swear words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so juvenile.</v>

3972
02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:59.420
<v Speaker 3>All words are artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We make words to two so we can relay </v>

3973
02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:02.901
<v Speaker 3>what we're seeing and there's all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of adjectives that are just as </v>

3974
02:42:02.901 --> 02:42:03.270
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea that freakin is okay.</v>

3975
02:42:03.271 --> 02:42:08.271
<v Speaker 3>Like creek clean people say freaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>this freaking guy and they feel clean </v>

3976
02:42:08.271 --> 02:42:12.231
<v Speaker 3>and free of any wrongdoing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you say fucking with the same </v>

3977
02:42:12.231 --> 02:42:13.770
<v Speaker 3>story like seminar that you screwing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so weird.</v>

3978
02:42:13.771 --> 02:42:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look in like music,</v>

3979
02:42:16.141 --> 02:42:21.141
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else is so dirty now and now </v>

3980
02:42:21.141 --> 02:42:21.840
<v Speaker 3>like there's very little clean comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>left though.</v>

3981
02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:23.610
<v Speaker 3>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not very common anymore.</v>

3982

<v Speaker 3>going on through the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3984
02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:31.440
<v Speaker 3>through the improv chains and it was at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3985
02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:36.441
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arizona improv comedy based on the bible</v>

02:42:40.470 --> 02:42:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I've seen guys do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy named brad stein who was</v>

3989
02:42:44.430 --> 02:42:47.460
<v Speaker 3>really not very funny in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day.</v>

3990
02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:50.460
<v Speaker 3>He just was real hacky and just gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3991
02:42:50.461 --> 02:42:55.461
<v Speaker 3>he became this like really right wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>christian comic and just started </v>

3992
02:42:55.461 --> 02:42:58.860
<v Speaker 3>crushing and like selling out giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>places and some books and I got a cd.</v>

3993
02:42:58.861 --> 02:43:01.620
<v Speaker 3>I bought it at a used record store just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was curious.</v>

3994
02:43:01.950 --> 02:43:04.800
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the strangest cds I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever heard in my life.</v>

3995
02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Completely devoid of like humor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just like weird cheerleading,</v>

3996
02:43:09.091 --> 02:43:12.000

3998
02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:20.011
<v Speaker 6>because eventually they be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're human and it catches up with </v>
