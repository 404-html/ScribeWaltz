<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

18
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I have reading glasses that I've worn </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last few years,</v>

19
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 2>like two or three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I hit like 46 and that's when it</v>

20
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.820
<v Speaker 2>just started going eee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd look at my phone like,</v>

21
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does that look like shit?</v>

22
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.370
<v Speaker 2>It really is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Adam Carolla did my podcast and</v>

23
00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:01.204
<v Speaker 2>he left some glasses over who loved </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading glasses and I picked up his </v>

24
00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:05.710
<v Speaker 2>reading glasses and I put them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

25
00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see,</v>

26
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.640
<v Speaker 2>I can fucking see clear now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's really frustrating</v>

27
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.003
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wear contacts because I have a </v>

28
00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 3>scar on this eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Low from A.</v>

29
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what from the only thing I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can think of is he said it was something</v>

30
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:23.064
<v Speaker 3>as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a pillow fight I had with my </v>

31
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:26.214
<v Speaker 3>friend Keith in like third grade and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember him hitting me in an open eye </v>

32
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 3>and just being down for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just as kids,</v>

33
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

34
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.063
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hurt.</v>

35
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you only thing I could.</v>

36
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.041
<v Speaker 3>Totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

37
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a scar on the outer layer of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyeball.</v>

38
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Can they do something about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they like,</v>

39
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.733
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can start messing with it </v>

40
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.620
<v Speaker 3>with this guy is a really good eye </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor.</v>

41
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't mess with it if you don't have to.</v>

42
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 3>But if I look through that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

43
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 3>it's a little cloudy always even with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the glasses.</v>

44
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.240
<v Speaker 3>So this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

45
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.243
<v Speaker 3>because of the little bumpy scar I can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a contact on so they'll go with the </v>

46
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 3>glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

47
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 3>you say it's a new look when I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have glasses on,</v>

48
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 3>I just had these glasses for like two </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

49
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 3>But everyone I've</v>

50
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.313
<v Speaker 2>get used to people wearing glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like greg fitzsimmons wears glasses and </v>

51
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.650
<v Speaker 2>sometimes he doesn't wear glasses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 2>The glasses or the odd thing that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls sexy.</v>

56
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.760
<v Speaker 2>There's something about a girl wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>glasses.</v>

57
00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>pulled up tight blouse,</v>

60
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 2>a skirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping off papers.</v>

61
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.960

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

62
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.870
<v Speaker 2>A smart girl is sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.093

<v Speaker 2>it off and gets all slutty and lets her </v>

64
00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 2>hair down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is that like what it is?</v>

66
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:56.980

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.060
<v Speaker 2>He's like five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

120
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:40.620
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 to 65.</v>

121
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.483
<v Speaker 2>Just a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive Samoan though he's the Super </v>

122
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:46.284
<v Speaker 2>Samoan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like samoans in general are really </v>

123
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:51.120
<v Speaker 2>powerful people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a thick people.</v>

124
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.390
<v Speaker 2>They are a durable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful race of people.</v>

125
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:56.040
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing because you need to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

126
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.053
<v Speaker 2>Those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

127
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v Speaker 4>and his island folk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were traveling in canoes back and </v>

128
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 4>forth across the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably.</v>

129
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 4>It probably required severe physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>strength.</v>

130
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you see Polynesians,</v>

131
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 4>Hawaiians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them,</v>

132
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking stout people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Time Midi.</v>

133
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.280
<v Speaker 4>Well just like just solid built,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking powerful.</v>

134
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 4>But there are big download too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you're in a canoe,</v>

135
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:26.474
<v Speaker 4>you're just all upper body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they kind of carry those canoes to </v>

136
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to carry stuff.</v>

137
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:34.991
<v Speaker 4>You're probably packing out your camps </v>
<v Speaker 4>and running up hills and eating coconuts</v>

138
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 4>with your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

139
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.760
<v Speaker 4>how would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hold the Samoans.</v>

140
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:40.683
<v Speaker 4>They were able to hold the canoes over </v>
<v Speaker 4>their head and then pick up coconuts </v>

141
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.960
<v Speaker 4>with their toes as they walked and bite </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

142
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 4>Like an apple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

143
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 4>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost had me son of a bitch.</v>

144
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.201
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

145
00:06:52.201 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 4>I was going over my head.</v>

146
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 4>I was doing it like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was mimicking it.</v>

147
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 4>Why would they put the commute down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

148
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of a hurry are they in that he</v>

149
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.094
<v Speaker 4>can't pick up on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looking at the whole thing was so </v>

150
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 4>confusing and then when you said bite it</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an APP on my.</v>

151
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.340
<v Speaker 4>He got me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

152
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 4>but wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a kid playing football.</v>

153
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was.</v>

154
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.663
<v Speaker 4>I kind of went between groups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there were the jocks and the </v>

155
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:15.284
<v Speaker 4>burnouts where the kids get into high in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the back and then there were the band </v>

156
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My kids are in school now.</v>

157
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those classifications don't really exist</v>

158
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

159
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.320
<v Speaker 4>They're like Bros,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jocks and skaters and yet we're so old.</v>

160
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.970
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't be talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>

161
00:07:32.971 --> 00:07:33.804
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be mad like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even know what the fuck you're talking </v>

162
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

163
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.221
<v Speaker 4>Old Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

164
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 4>I literally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

165
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:39.640
<v Speaker 4>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't go to.</v>

166
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm not in seventh grade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to ask questions and they don't.</v>

167
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 4>A smart girls get high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

168
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.530
<v Speaker 4>A bookworm docs are in choir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more acceptable to be yourself.</v>

169
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 4>They grew up in a time when you could be</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything and do anything.</v>

170
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.250
<v Speaker 4>No one and no one shit on you for trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that real.</v>

171
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

172
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 4>If that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally true.</v>

173
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 4>They have a whole different way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at the world.</v>

174
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:08.324
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They look at the way we were raised as </v>

175
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.893
<v Speaker 4>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just saying the mean shit to other </v>

176
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:19.781
<v Speaker 4>people and people just shitting on you </v>
<v Speaker 4>for trying anything that we look at that</v>

177
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:21.914
<v Speaker 4>like it's cavemen times feel like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would call someone fat what you would </v>

178
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 4>call someone retarded or gay or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean all that stuff is,</v>

179
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot of word speak conversation,</v>

180
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:32.864
<v Speaker 4>but it's manifested itself into the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>these kids were raised and they're </v>

181
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 4>sweeter and kinder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

182
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

183
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 4>That's so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you got to see like real cultural</v>

184
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:43.484
<v Speaker 4>evolution because if you go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning of the 20th century and those </v>

185
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:48.404
<v Speaker 4>poor people that were surviving through </v>
<v Speaker 4>the depression and you ever read any </v>

186
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 4>books on the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grapes of Wrath,</v>

187
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.050
<v Speaker 4>there was a</v>

188
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 5>book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was called mcgurty.</v>

189
00:08:59.100 --> 00:08:59.933
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

190
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.953
<v Speaker 5>by a guy named Bob Burns who's a famous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a billiards historian and he wrote this </v>

191
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:06.234
<v Speaker 5>book about a Pool Hustler during the </v>
<v Speaker 5>depression that traveled literally by </v>

192
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:11.064
<v Speaker 5>train car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a Hobo from town to town and found </v>

193
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:14.634
<v Speaker 5>people to gamble with these bars and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they would hustle and pretend they </v>

194
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 5>didn't play very well and lose a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit of money.</v>

195
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 5>And then when money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

196
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:20.820
<v Speaker 5>that kind of it already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

197
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 5>But it was a really depressing book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

198
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just people are suffering,</v>

199
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:26.304
<v Speaker 5>people are suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there was this one story where he </v>

200
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:29.993
<v Speaker 5>was literally a knocking on this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 5>house begging for food and the guy </v>

201
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.800
<v Speaker 5>brought him out some sausage and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

202
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.673
<v Speaker 5>and they had like a soup together and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>was just describing the food that this </v>

203
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 5>guy had given him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like how,</v>

204
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 5>how wonderful it was and how amazing it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was in that moment.</v>

205
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 5>Like he was literally dying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like his body was giving out from hunger</v>

206
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 5>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in America in 1920 9:30</v>

207
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 5>is that when the depression was official</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the stock market crash was 29.</v>

208
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 5>It's so scary that the stock market is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>real thing.</v>

209
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.333
<v Speaker 5>Like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to explain this to someone </v>

210
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 5>like what my frustration with it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I was like,</v>

211
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just looked at it this way.</v>

212
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.830
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know if you're,</v>

213
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 5>if you're a financial person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

214
00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:12.241
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're so,</v>

215
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 5>let's do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I really think it works that way,</v>

216
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 5>but this is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the world and you look at</v>

217
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 5>all the people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the number of people's tastes constant,</v>

218
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.763
<v Speaker 5>the resources stay constant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's kind of the same amount of </v>

219
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:25.764
<v Speaker 5>metal as the same amount of silicon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the same amount of all the </v>

220
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 5>different materials we use to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

221
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:32.803
<v Speaker 5>The same countries are in place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The monies to say what the fuck </v>

222
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.443
<v Speaker 5>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That all the sudden everything's </v>

223
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:39.024
<v Speaker 5>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you had this state where like you </v>

224
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 5>have prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's wonderful,</v>

225
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 5>people are doing great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the stock market crashes</v>

226
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:49.663
<v Speaker 3>and when the stock market crashes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people lose their jobs and </v>

227
00:10:52.611 --> 00:10:53.444
<v Speaker 3>mortgage rates go get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's fucked and this just like </v>

228
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 3>this terrible period of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

229
00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.830
<v Speaker 3>of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

230
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.883
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile the earth is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like we create these </v>

231
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.380
<v Speaker 3>disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we create these,</v>

232
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.813
<v Speaker 3>these systematic dislike in there like </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside the system that we've created </v>

233
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:12.973
<v Speaker 3>well as disaster and it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the system that we've built to </v>

234
00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:17.744
<v Speaker 3>survive and be able to trade goods and </v>
<v Speaker 3>food and homeless and the structure we </v>

235
00:11:23.931 --> 00:11:28.190
<v Speaker 3>built to live and be safe from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside elements on this planet.</v>

236
00:11:28.191 --> 00:11:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So weird when that thing.</v>

237
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.070
<v Speaker 3>But that thing has to run and it runs by</v>
<v Speaker 3>money and money circulates.</v>

238
00:11:34.071 --> 00:11:36.170
<v Speaker 3>All that stuff all around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

239
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.620
<v Speaker 3>There's still money when all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

240
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.663
<v Speaker 3>but it's up here clogged with these with</v>
<v Speaker 3>very select places and then the rest of </v>

241
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:45.914
<v Speaker 3>the flow just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no more water coming to these </v>

242
00:11:47.631 --> 00:11:50.480
<v Speaker 3>tributaries anymore that everybody goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>tanking.</v>

243
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.343
<v Speaker 3>Such a goofy system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what that feels like that like </v>

244
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:54.214
<v Speaker 3>someone</v>

245
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 2>took windows 95 and just kept upgrading </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

246
00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Right now we are in 2017 and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a new operating system.</v>

247
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.640
<v Speaker 2>We get a new operating system for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking computer,</v>

248
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 2>which is not really that God damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

249
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.453
<v Speaker 2>All in all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could choose between a good </v>

250
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 2>operating system for life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a much better,</v>

251
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.980
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more updated operating system for,</v>

252
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 2>for civilization or whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could get online.</v>

253
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.300
<v Speaker 2>You Got Online and 95 you your shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>would work.</v>

254
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

255
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.700
<v Speaker 2>what do you do when you're writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>emails?</v>

256
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.543
<v Speaker 2>You checking your twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time do you take online would </v>

257
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:29.830
<v Speaker 2>work fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would work size a web.</v>

258
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Browsers didn't crash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go to the websites.</v>

259
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.190
<v Speaker 2>It's way more important to have a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>operating system for life.</v>

260
00:12:36.191 --> 00:12:37.750
<v Speaker 2>We don't even touch that stupid thing.</v>

261
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.470
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too massive.</v>

262
00:12:39.471 --> 00:12:42.800
<v Speaker 3>And what really bothers me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's really been on my mind lately,</v>

263
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.460
<v Speaker 3>is that you can't escape the herd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

264
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.440
<v Speaker 3>can't right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the.</v>

265
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Everything was really crashing in 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that scenario that you're talking</v>

266
00:12:54.531 --> 00:12:57.990
<v Speaker 3>about where everything just stopped like</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the top people were like,</v>

267
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.150
<v Speaker 3>the economy is grinding to a halt this </v>
<v Speaker 3>afternoon,</v>

268
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:03.973
<v Speaker 3>that calamity right took everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>savings and messed it up and all this </v>

269
00:13:07.311 --> 00:13:11.030
<v Speaker 3>stuff so now and everybody had to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through it.</v>

270
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:12.343
<v Speaker 3>Now things have kind of come back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're coming back and there's this </v>

271
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:16.723
<v Speaker 3>trump bump on the stock market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things are really going really high and </v>

272
00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:21.404
<v Speaker 3>then some people think it's a bubble and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just a false thing and it's </v>

273
00:13:25.131 --> 00:13:25.964
<v Speaker 3>going to crash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some people even say it's going to </v>

274
00:13:28.731 --> 00:13:32.270
<v Speaker 3>crash worse than 2008 if things go </v>
<v Speaker 3>really haywire.</v>

275
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.880
<v Speaker 3>My question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we know that,</v>

276
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.430
<v Speaker 3>how do I get out of the way of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tsunami?</v>

277
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.860
<v Speaker 3>Why do I have to go with everybody else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can?</v>

278
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.410
<v Speaker 3>What can I do with my money where I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be safe from this,</v>

279
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.010
<v Speaker 3>these tides that take everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good question,</v>

280
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.070
<v Speaker 3>but I think the question that </v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed that question is,</v>

281
00:13:52.071 --> 00:13:53.930
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck are we still doing it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

282
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.130
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be a better question </v>
<v Speaker 3>because this seems crazy.</v>

283
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.260
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to reboot it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>

284
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.130
<v Speaker 3>Just</v>

285
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.000
<v Speaker 2>are you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

286
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

287
00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:04.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

288
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not fucking zero education and </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics.</v>

289
00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:09.630
<v Speaker 2>I know almost nothing about how all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff</v>

290
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.493
<v Speaker 3>stuff works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a show two weekends ago for these </v>

291
00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:16.800
<v Speaker 3>financial people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really Fun show,</v>

292
00:14:16.801 --> 00:14:18.210
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like their private event.</v>

293
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.283
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking to them after after the show</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the bar we meet and greet kind of </v>

294
00:14:23.731 --> 00:14:28.731
<v Speaker 3>thing and some of these guys who are our</v>
<v Speaker 3>age who are just economic guys,</v>

295
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:29.963
<v Speaker 3>they're in finance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start these conversations about </v>

296
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.453
<v Speaker 3>buying and selling properties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shifting stocks and bonds and all this </v>

297
00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:42.240
<v Speaker 3>and where did the bond market doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're speaking Chinese</v>

298
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.080
<v Speaker 2>and I felt like a 10 year old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

299
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:50.350
<v Speaker 2>this is what the rich people talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I understood.</v>

300
00:14:50.511 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Some of you know</v>

301
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.813
<v Speaker 5>what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what it's like to me it's like </v>

302
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:54.524
<v Speaker 5>when someone starts bringing up like </v>
<v Speaker 5>chess moves when we're talking about </v>

303
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 5>specific chess games,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Kasparov playing some dude.</v>

304
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they start,</v>

305
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rook to king two or whatever the numbers</v>

306
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:04.431
<v Speaker 5>are on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

307
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:05.730
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is he doing?</v>

308
00:15:05.731 --> 00:15:07.500
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's happening in him?</v>

309
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.010
<v Speaker 5>I knew a guy and he went to prison and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

310
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Speaker 5>when he came out of prison he had </v>
<v Speaker 5>learned to play chess in his head.</v>

311
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.153
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he could sit there and him and this </v>

312
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:20.050
<v Speaker 5>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was this kid who is this.</v>

313
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.070
<v Speaker 5>It was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really interesting guy.</v>

314
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:24.320
<v Speaker 5>It was really tiny kid that used to come</v>
<v Speaker 5>to this pool,</v>

315
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 5>so super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he was like this little,</v>

316
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:28.184
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like almost like a fucking honeybadger </v>

317
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.480
<v Speaker 5>probably funny kid pool where you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>like pick fights with people.</v>

318
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 5>And he was a tiny little guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was so little that people will be like,</v>

319
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 5>why is this guy doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

320
00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 5>he was super fucking smart soup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess he just felt,</v>

321
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt like,</v>

322
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.813
<v Speaker 5>I guess he felt like he had establishes </v>
<v Speaker 5>his place in the social pecking order </v>

323
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:48.134
<v Speaker 5>because you're so little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a pool hall and he was a really </v>

324
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:50.864
<v Speaker 5>smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think it's tragic to yell at </v>

325
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:54.350
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like one time he yelled at me,</v>

326
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

327
00:15:56.871 --> 00:16:00.660
<v Speaker 5>He was probably like 15 or 16 and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

328
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.760
<v Speaker 5>25.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what are you crazy?</v>

330
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:05.924
<v Speaker 5>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to have a conversation with that </v>

331
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.840
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not your,</v>

332
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm not your enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're arguing over a pool game.</v>

333
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.590
<v Speaker 5>You know what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Don't say you're a take me outside and </v>
<v Speaker 5>go listen to that.</v>

335
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.050
<v Speaker 5>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

336
00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15th.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

338
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.470

<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

339
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.453
<v Speaker 5>I'm not your enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to figure out who's right </v>

340
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.793
<v Speaker 5>on a foul foul as foul is whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 5>like maybe a foot off while you're </v>

341
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.043
<v Speaker 5>playing pool and maybe your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your tip touch the ball before it was </v>

342
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:34.694
<v Speaker 5>supposed to and you try to ignore it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then someone calls you on or the hit is </v>

343
00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:40.000
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't hit the number ball.</v>

344
00:16:40.001 --> 00:16:41.210
<v Speaker 5>You're supposed to have your play nine </v>
<v Speaker 5>ball.</v>

345
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 5>The other guy's supposed to get ball in </v>
<v Speaker 5>hand,</v>

346
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.263
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's a competitive thing that a </v>

347
00:16:43.901 --> 00:16:44.451
<v Speaker 5>tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

348
00:16:44.451 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 5>those conversations get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get pretty emotional.</v>

349
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:47.804
<v Speaker 5>People got really upset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I definitely did not fall because </v>

350
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:50.894
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden he was like trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>start a fight and how little we have </v>

351
00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:54.590
<v Speaker 5>tall was not big at all.</v>

352
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:55.583
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this was like right after I just </v>

353
00:16:57.471 --> 00:17:01.940
<v Speaker 5>said I just maybe had my last fight and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple of years before that,</v>

354
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 5>so I was still kickbox and I was still </v>
<v Speaker 5>training all the time and I was like,</v>

355
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:06.554
<v Speaker 5>this is the craziest conversation I </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't believe I'm having with this </v>

356
00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:10.160
<v Speaker 5>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I pulled them outside.</v>

357
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.510
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just had,</v>

358
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just kind of a down to earth,</v>

359
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotTa,</v>

360
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:16.403
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to get respect from these </v>

361
00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:18.080
<v Speaker 5>fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

362
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.420
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not like someone's going to hit you.</v>

363
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.621
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

364
00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:22.454
<v Speaker 5>you got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was a planned thing because this </v>

365
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.453
<v Speaker 5>fucking kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was cool afterwards because I had </v>

366
00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:27.854
<v Speaker 5>this kind of conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knew that if we ever did have a </v>

367
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:33.680
<v Speaker 5>conversation before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was never going to go to a bad place.</v>

368
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.200
<v Speaker 5>I was just going to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

369
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.150
<v Speaker 5>So it made it a nice thing because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a wizard.</v>

370
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 5>He's a really smart kid and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and for pool is that I like,</v>

371
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:43.580
<v Speaker 5>is that like chess?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like.</v>

372
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.091
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

373
00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:44.924
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

374
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.131
<v Speaker 5>Vantage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

375
00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:49.100
<v Speaker 5>because you're also smart in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>execution of your shot.</v>

376
00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 5>Like one of the things about pool is the</v>
<v Speaker 5>execution of your shots should be almost</v>

377
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Speaker 5>effortless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You rely on your structure,</v>

378
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.743
<v Speaker 5>you rely on your stance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you rely on your technique and it's </v>

379
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:01.164
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be like incredibly gentle </v>
<v Speaker 5>and smart people can figure that out </v>

380
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Speaker 5>better than dumb people how to get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead of slamming the ball,</v>

381
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 5>instead of using your muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead they'd stroke the ball where the</v>

382
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 5>weight of the queue is kind of doing all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the work.</v>

383
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:15.563
<v Speaker 5>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kid was so fucking smart that him </v>

384
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:17.874
<v Speaker 5>and that prison guy would get together </v>
<v Speaker 5>and play chess in their head cheese and </v>

385
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 5>I would sit there like a stupid a pool.</v>

386
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.540
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I sat there and I just pulled up a stool</v>

387
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 5>and I just watched them playing chess in</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

388
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:34.860
<v Speaker 5>They went through a full game in their </v>
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>

389
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:36.240
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is so crazy.</v>

390
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.940
<v Speaker 5>They know where all the pieces are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So crazy.</v>

391
00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.220
<v Speaker 5>That's what it was like with these </v>
<v Speaker 5>financial guys.</v>

392
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:42.780
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

393
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 5>They're just smarter because even though</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was never that great in math,</v>

394
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:47.850
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could not have.</v>

395
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.910
<v Speaker 5>My head isn't built for talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that stuff.</v>

396
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.133
<v Speaker 5>They're smarter in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is what it's like when you hear </v>

397
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 5>them talking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like night to rook six.</v>

398
00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>

399
00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.950
<v Speaker 5>where is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's happening?</v>

400
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:00.270
<v Speaker 5>Where's the grid?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand the grit,</v>

401
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.880
<v Speaker 5>but it's even more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're talking about dividends,</v>

402
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:03.923
<v Speaker 5>bonds and fucking I know and they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>make a lot of money because they just </v>

403
00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:08.370
<v Speaker 5>have that knowledge.</v>

404
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.590
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And some of them start doing coke,</v>

405
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 5>then they get crazy and leave their </v>
<v Speaker 5>families.</v>

406
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like a.</v>

407
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 5>that's what business where people go off</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rails,</v>

408
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 5>but like what can you do to protect </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself?</v>

409
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 5>Say trump goes off the rails and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stock market goes down again.</v>

410
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.893
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing you can do right now to </v>

411
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:29.070
<v Speaker 5>prepare yourself for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

412
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 5>you can put your money in cash,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then it's not growing.</v>

413
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.330
<v Speaker 5>I think the amount of pressure that guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>under is probably unmanageable.</v>

414
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.170
<v Speaker 5>I think very few people can manage that </v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure.</v>

415
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.620
<v Speaker 5>I think that job's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it should be real.</v>

416
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it should be a job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should be five people.</v>

417
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.170
<v Speaker 5>It shouldn't be a ton of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

418
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think five people's enough.</v>

419
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:51.600
<v Speaker 5>I said I don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

420
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:52.463
<v Speaker 5>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it almost should be all of </v>

421
00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:54.210
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

422
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.043
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

423
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.510
<v Speaker 5>it just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like if you wanted to give your</v>

424
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.780
<v Speaker 5>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

425
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.030
<v Speaker 5>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>papa wanted to give you a reasons why we</v>

426
00:20:03.031 --> 00:20:03.864
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be engaging in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>military action against North Korea or </v>

427
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 5>whatever's next.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would have to do it.</v>

428
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.160
<v Speaker 5>You have to write it out or you'd have </v>
<v Speaker 5>to record it,</v>

429
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.100
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to give a coherent reason why</v>

430
00:20:14.101 --> 00:20:15.710
<v Speaker 5>you feel and that that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

431
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.210
<v Speaker 5>that would be considered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you'd be like one person,</v>

432
00:20:18.211 --> 00:20:21.780
<v Speaker 5>imagine if there's 350 million of us or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the hell it is.</v>

433
00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 5>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone having single opinion,</v>

434
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:26.893
<v Speaker 5>a new wants to complex comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinion on any sort of an action that </v>

435
00:20:31.081 --> 00:20:33.930
<v Speaker 5>any thing in the government is doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that represents us.</v>

436
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.040
<v Speaker 5>That's what the government is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's these people.</v>

437
00:20:37.041 --> 00:20:37.874
<v Speaker 5>It's boiled down to a few people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are supposed to successfully represent </v>

438
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.443
<v Speaker 5>us and all of our ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's no way they could know what </v>

439
00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:45.990
<v Speaker 5>our ideas are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

440
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 5>but you can come close being like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

441
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.620
<v Speaker 4>this my town,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go to Congress and be like,</v>

442
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:53.800
<v Speaker 4>my state really thinks weed should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>legal.</v>

443
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.630
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the consensus sort of.</v>

444
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of.</v>

445
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:03.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how accurate or inaccurate </v>
<v Speaker 4>and in certain ways.</v>

446
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.160
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

447
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is strange though.</v>

448
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:11.341
<v Speaker 4>I mean to be that president to be one </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy and it really is a thing about,</v>

449
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are huge guy,</v>

450
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:18.811
<v Speaker 4>there is one guy on the top of virgin or</v>
<v Speaker 4>tesla or but they know it's their job to</v>

451
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:24.070
<v Speaker 4>run things in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have people doing stuff for them?</v>

452
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:29.071
<v Speaker 4>It's almost a job that's more about </v>
<v Speaker 4>poise and intelligence and patients than</v>

453
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:31.414
<v Speaker 4>it is like taking everybody's thing on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's so unsettling about the </v>

454
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 4>time right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want someone,</v>

455
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.123
<v Speaker 4>you want dad to be at the steering wheel</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you feel good and safe in the back </v>

456
00:21:43.071 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 4>seat.</v>

457
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.403
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why a lot of people are really </v>

458
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:45.934
<v Speaker 4>excited about trump because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>confident and if you're a confident </v>

459
00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:54.511
<v Speaker 4>older man who's successful people like </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a natural instinct like an Alpha</v>

460
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:57.290
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzees now it's an Alpha factor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

461
00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.203
<v Speaker 4>It's a total.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a total instinct to try to </v>

462
00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:04.330
<v Speaker 4>acquiesce and also an instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The challenge is to be a big instinct to</v>

463
00:22:04.331 --> 00:22:05.164
<v Speaker 4>challenge him because of who he is too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he sees weaknesses and see we can </v>

464
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.040
<v Speaker 4>swipe out his ankle and it shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>exist.</v>

465
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:13.350
<v Speaker 4>Folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is this,</v>

466
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 4>this is highlighting what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody's like,</v>

467
00:22:17.141 --> 00:22:17.974
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know anything about politics </v>

468
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:20.230
<v Speaker 4>and you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

469
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 4>I know so little about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot I don't know a lot about.</v>

470
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:27.670
<v Speaker 4>A lot of things does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody does,</v>

471
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:32.050
<v Speaker 4>but I know one thing I know that I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>see patterns and trends.</v>

472
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.273
<v Speaker 4>I see them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty good at it and I see a </v>

473
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:40.441
<v Speaker 4>pattern and trend in our communication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our expression of ideas.</v>

474
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 4>It's like what you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>with kids today.</v>

475
00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.173
<v Speaker 4>I'm not surprised by that at all and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>excited by it because I think that I </v>

476
00:22:46.811 --> 00:22:48.700
<v Speaker 4>think that people are more openminded </v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

477
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

478
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.730
<v Speaker 4>they're way smarter than I was when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was their age.</v>

479
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.370
<v Speaker 4>If you talk to like an average 10 year </v>
<v Speaker 4>old or 11 year old,</v>

480
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.800
<v Speaker 4>they know so much more about how the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world works and I did when I was asking.</v>

481
00:22:57.801 --> 00:23:01.840
<v Speaker 4>The amount of work they have to do in </v>
<v Speaker 4>school is 10 times what we had,</v>

482
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.230
<v Speaker 4>but they're still all being trapped by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same system,</v>

483
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.570
<v Speaker 4>which they still have the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>educational system,</v>

484
00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:08.404
<v Speaker 4>which I think is fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You make kids go to school all day and </v>

485
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:13.360
<v Speaker 4>then at the end of that you give them </v>
<v Speaker 4>homework.</v>

486
00:23:13.361 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 4>How about fuck you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many hours in a day is there?</v>

487
00:23:17.231 --> 00:23:20.080
<v Speaker 4>You're preparing people for suck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's what you're doing.</v>

488
00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:21.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My kids,</v>

489
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.430
<v Speaker 4>they were up til 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>at night doing work,</v>

490
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.210
<v Speaker 4>not hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not screw it around like fuck man.</v>

491
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That takes away your life life.</v>

492
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.840
<v Speaker 4>It's really important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially especially when it's a.</v>

493
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.053
<v Speaker 4>it's a curriculum in the public schools </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is geared towards a manufacturing </v>

494
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 4>middleclass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's learning in that</v>

495
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.200
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learning like robots,</v>

496
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:49.063
<v Speaker 2>if you want these kids to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could work so much smarter about </v>

497
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.233
<v Speaker 2>more uptodate teaching methods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are going to apply to get </v>

498
00:23:56.031 --> 00:23:58.010
<v Speaker 2>jobs going out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's like,</v>

499
00:23:58.011 --> 00:23:59.530
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend a little time on that door.</v>

500
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Also training people to put their energy</v>
<v Speaker 2>into things that don't bring them joy.</v>

501
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:08.780
<v Speaker 2>They're training a certain kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline of certain kind of morose,</v>

502
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:14.100
<v Speaker 2>like dark gray cloud disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're totally right to the factory with</v>

503
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:18.180
<v Speaker 2>a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

504
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.750
<v Speaker 2>stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order to stay alive,</v>

505
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:22.910
<v Speaker 2>we have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

506
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

507
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.370
<v Speaker 2>row those fucking boats across the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your kid like,</v>

508
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.060
<v Speaker 2>but wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to board man.</v>

509
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Tony Hawk makes way more than you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad.</v>

510
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm so much happier there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

511
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.510
<v Speaker 2>you mean it's so many people that want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do so many things and they could.</v>

512
00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.250
<v Speaker 2>They could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could,</v>

513
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.500
<v Speaker 2>but as a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

514
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:43.100
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

515
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm go for it.</v>

516
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

517
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I've got two and one is not into school </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not into it.</v>

518
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Pull them out and I got home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She seems like a comedian.</v>

519
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Like she is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sheet she dropped.</v>

520
00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.490
<v Speaker 2>She seems the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's funny.</v>

521
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't care about authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's clever.</v>

522
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Just not into school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's probably smart.</v>

523
00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.810
<v Speaker 2>She is dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is,</v>

524
00:25:05.811 --> 00:25:07.430
<v Speaker 2>but she's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she sees her dad.</v>

525
00:25:07.431 --> 00:25:08.840
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy doesn't do nothing.</v>

526
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Sits around talking shit about bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

527
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.870
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's baking bread.</v>

528
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 2>He's always smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baking bread or going to a show.</v>

529
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Billy's dad just had a heart attack.</v>

530
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Billy's Dad freaking out and he works </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a financial institution.</v>

531
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.013
<v Speaker 2>You don't go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't go to the stuff and put as a </v>

532
00:25:28.641 --> 00:25:29.660
<v Speaker 2>parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be like,</v>

533
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hang out.</v>

534
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be just hanging out,</v>

535
00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:34.550
<v Speaker 2>but you can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find your groove,</v>

536
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.350
<v Speaker 2>find a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then get into it.</v>

537
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.233
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think introducing kids to things that </v>

538
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:41.000
<v Speaker 2>they can get into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super important,</v>

539
00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:42.560
<v Speaker 2>but what about the school thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you,</v>

540
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.740
<v Speaker 2>if your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your kid brings home sees,</v>

541
00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:48.920
<v Speaker 2>do you get on her or do you say you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to step it up.</v>

542
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.023
<v Speaker 2>There's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stepping it up is making her that drone </v>

543
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.753
<v Speaker 2>both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a real problem and it's that </v>

544
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.793
<v Speaker 2>kind of learning is boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all of a sudden I was not in the </v>

545
00:25:57.561 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 2>science at school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get enough science as an adult,</v>

546
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:02.810
<v Speaker 2>as an adult.</v>

547
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:03.643
<v Speaker 2>I constantly read scientific American </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch all those science shows on tv </v>

548
00:26:08.811 --> 00:26:12.000
<v Speaker 2>about fucking space in astrology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make it look strong.</v>

549
00:26:12.001 --> 00:26:13.620
<v Speaker 2>You rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>

550
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.133
<v Speaker 2>The cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen the Neil degrasse Tyson </v>

551
00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:17.084
<v Speaker 2>series the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't wait for that thing to come </v>

552
00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 2>on every week we celebrated when that </v>
<v Speaker 2>came on.</v>

553
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science is fascinating.</v>

554
00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:25.970
<v Speaker 2>They find these seven new exoplanets </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they think have it life.</v>

555
00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

556
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like earth.</v>

557
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>

558
00:26:29.661 --> 00:26:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I could not have given less of a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care about any of it.</v>

559
00:26:34.431 --> 00:26:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why boring teachers?</v>

560
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.613
<v Speaker 2>Math teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent if Neil degrasse tyson </v>

561
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.400
<v Speaker 2>was my astronomy teacher in school or </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught astrophysics</v>

562
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.230
<v Speaker 4>or whatever and taught it the way he </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaches things.</v>

563
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:51.240
<v Speaker 4>Like when he talks about stuff he gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>you so excited about the ideas that he's</v>

564
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.110
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any cause he's able,</v>

565
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.000
<v Speaker 4>he's intelligent and can explain it in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>way that you'll understand it.</v>

566
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.183
<v Speaker 4>I think his passion for it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she was really excited by and when </v>

567
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the other thing,</v>

568
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:04.314
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like it's engineered to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>that way and I don't want to get all </v>

569
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:07.524
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy tower seven on anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at the idea of school </v>

570
00:27:11.941 --> 00:27:12.774
<v Speaker 4>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck are they paying those </v>

571
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:17.190
<v Speaker 4>teachers so little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean teachers,</v>

572
00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:22.620
<v Speaker 4>they have arguably the most important </v>
<v Speaker 4>job in developing your child.</v>

573
00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 4>Outside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's you,</v>

574
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:26.860
<v Speaker 4>the parent and then the teacher?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

575
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.713
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how many teachers are just kind of </v>

576
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.113
<v Speaker 4>barely getting by with a total ceiling </v>
<v Speaker 4>on how much money that can make your </v>

577
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:33.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

578
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 4>Because my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my science teacher was,</v>

579
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:42.240
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't like being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a stressed out chain smoking,</v>

580
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.980
<v Speaker 4>angry guy and bad shitty clothes because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't afford anything else.</v>

581
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 4>This guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life pressures are so huge.</v>

582
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:55.020
<v Speaker 4>He can't be like jazzed about science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's worried about getting kicked out of</v>

583
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:57.660
<v Speaker 4>his apartment and whether he's get lung </v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer from smoking,</v>

584
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:58.523
<v Speaker 4>from chain smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you did pay this guy twice what he </v>

585
00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:03.880
<v Speaker 4>was making,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd be relaxed.</v>

586
00:28:03.881 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 4>He'd be motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd be into it.</v>

587
00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 4>He could spend more time putting plated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

588
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 4>but if that's what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you want to be a teacher,</v>

589
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:11.904
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you know how much you are going to </v>

590
00:28:12.541 --> 00:28:13.620
<v Speaker 4>get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

591
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:14.603
<v Speaker 4>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those things where you're </v>

592
00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:16.464
<v Speaker 4>getting paid that much because people </v>
<v Speaker 4>have decided you're getting paid that </v>

593
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:19.614
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They decided to only allocate a certain </v>

594
00:28:20.821 --> 00:28:21.654
<v Speaker 4>amount of resources towards education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but meanwhile think about how much more </v>

595
00:28:24.061 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 4>money they spend on military.</v>

596
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.183
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just going to say that there's no </v>

597
00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:30.450
<v Speaker 4>talk right now about increasing spending</v>
<v Speaker 4>for schools.</v>

598
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.343
<v Speaker 4>That's probably the most important thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could do is make less losers schools </v>

599
00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.440
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the most.</v>

600
00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:38.743
<v Speaker 4>It is the most important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is there an advantage to keeping </v>

601
00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 4>some part of the population dumb man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the big fight.</v>

602
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's the big conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory,</v>

603
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:50.370
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think it's a conspiracy.</v>

604
00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.293
<v Speaker 4>I think it is just a convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think once people are in a community </v>

605
00:28:55.531 --> 00:28:56.364
<v Speaker 4>that's poor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no incentive for the wealthy </v>

606
00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:01.710
<v Speaker 4>people that are in government or running</v>
<v Speaker 4>government to say,</v>

607
00:29:01.711 --> 00:29:06.030
<v Speaker 4>let's allocate a an inordinate amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>resources to try to rebuild these areas.</v>

608
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 4>They don't benefit from that or people </v>
<v Speaker 4>with money.</v>

609
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.230
<v Speaker 4>The only way you can get them to benefit</v>
<v Speaker 4>from that.</v>

610
00:29:10.231 --> 00:29:11.064
<v Speaker 4>I saw that chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rapper donated a million dollars to </v>

611
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.270
<v Speaker 4>Chicago public school system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Congratulations to that guy.</v>

612
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.510
<v Speaker 4>That's a fucking awesome human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is a class Berlin.</v>

613
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.510
<v Speaker 4>If you could donate a million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much did you make kid?</v>

614
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.660
<v Speaker 4>Hashtag balling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

615
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.990
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that it's.</v>

616
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:36.050
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessarily a conspiracy as </v>
<v Speaker 4>much as it's just easy to ignore now.</v>

617
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.183
<v Speaker 4>The people who don't have political </v>
<v Speaker 4>influence and the people making the </v>

618
00:29:39.301 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 4>decisions put their kids in school and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have to worry.</v>

619
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

620
00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 3>if everybody had to go to their local </v>
<v Speaker 3>public school I,</v>

621
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:46.490
<v Speaker 3>but things</v>

622
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:47.121
<v Speaker 5>change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

623
00:29:47.121 --> 00:29:48.800
<v Speaker 5>it's worse because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

624
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:49.663
<v Speaker 5>you're making things less safe because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're creating more crime because you </v>

625
00:29:52.191 --> 00:29:53.024
<v Speaker 5>creating more disenfranchised people and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're creating more of a need to stay </v>

626
00:29:56.331 --> 00:29:58.640
<v Speaker 5>in your wealthy communities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

627
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.080
<v Speaker 5>He know how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

628
00:30:00.081 --> 00:30:02.020
<v Speaker 5>it is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's um,</v>

629
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:04.760
<v Speaker 5>it's something that there's no incentive</v>
<v Speaker 5>to change.</v>

630
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.290
<v Speaker 5>It's not like there's a giant amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure to look at the same way we look</v>

631
00:30:09.291 --> 00:30:10.124
<v Speaker 5>at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to go to Afghanistan and make </v>

632
00:30:10.891 --> 00:30:12.270
<v Speaker 5>sure it doesn't fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

633
00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 5>Are you fucking Chicago's falling apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

634
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:15.980
<v Speaker 5>like we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's right there.</v>

635
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:17.350
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to go to Afghanistan.</v>

636
00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:20.500
<v Speaker 5>We haven't done shit about Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Detroit is completely full.</v>

637
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.790
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of fucked up spots in this</v>
<v Speaker 5>country where there's dangerous.</v>

638
00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.890
<v Speaker 5>Was Flint still doesn't have good water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

639
00:30:25.891 --> 00:30:27.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that still going on in Flint,</v>

640
00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:28.784
<v Speaker 5>Michigan?</v>

641
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Worse now because they're cutting out </v>
<v Speaker 3>the abolishing the clean water acts,</v>

642
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:38.390
<v Speaker 3>so it's gonna get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going to happen?</v>

643
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.353
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all are nervous about a lot of </v>

644
00:30:40.101 --> 00:30:40.934
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My only focus is the environment and </v>

645
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.613
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with that because that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>care the most about and I don't like my </v>

646
00:30:49.371 --> 00:30:50.204
<v Speaker 3>kids to be sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also something you can't pull back </v>

647
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.390
<v Speaker 3>everything in reversing every emission </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

648
00:30:59.391 --> 00:31:04.391
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come to California who </v>
<v Speaker 3>has the most advanced emissions controls</v>

649
00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:05.743
<v Speaker 3>and it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to force California to </v>

650
00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:13.460
<v Speaker 3>lessen the emissions restrictions the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that the rest of the country is,</v>

651
00:31:13.461 --> 00:31:15.830
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to go back like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

652
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.890
<v Speaker 3>They're changing emissions there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what they're doing.</v>

653
00:31:18.891 --> 00:31:23.891
<v Speaker 3>They're not funding satellites that keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>track of global,</v>

654
00:31:24.321 --> 00:31:26.120
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of climate change.</v>

655
00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.980
<v Speaker 3>They're going to cut off the information</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you don't complain when you're.</v>

656
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.263
<v Speaker 3>When Miami's underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're putting a waste back in in the </v>

657
00:31:36.111 --> 00:31:36.944
<v Speaker 3>waters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're taking all the regulations off </v>

658
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:45.410
<v Speaker 3>the head of the EPA is the guy who sued </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit out of the EPA,</v>

659
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.680
<v Speaker 3>hates the EPA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're tearing it all down.</v>

660
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Can I ask you a question?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom?</v>

661

<v Speaker 3>This is where they're opening the door </v>

663
00:31:57.711 --> 00:31:59.330
<v Speaker 3>for all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just.</v>

664
00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can ask me a question.</v>

665
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.900
<v Speaker 3>Are you a cook?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

666
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.640
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what that means?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

667
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.940
<v Speaker 5>People who are anti trump when you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>a.</v>

668
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.791
<v Speaker 5>that's a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

669
00:32:11.791 --> 00:32:12.270
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

670
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.103
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my only focus is what's going to happen </v>

671
00:32:14.341 --> 00:32:17.560
<v Speaker 5>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also more like a demo.</v>

672
00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.830
<v Speaker 5>What is the official definition?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again?</v>

673
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:20.803
<v Speaker 5>It used to be cuckold based on cuckold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is who likes watching other men </v>

674
00:32:24.811 --> 00:32:25.644
<v Speaker 5>fuck his wife because there's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>level of porn and then what's the </v>

675
00:32:28.861 --> 00:32:30.210
<v Speaker 5>official definition?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now?</v>

676
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.120
<v Speaker 5>It was confusing to us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but sort of a political thing.</v>

677
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.670
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of like pretending you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>progressive when you're not new one.</v>

678
00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.681
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>misogyny</v>

680
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:45.490
<v Speaker 2>and fear of those who use the term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

681
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.610
<v Speaker 2>that's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What does cook me?</v>

683
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.210

<v Speaker 2>feckless?</v>

684
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Spineless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and decidedly pathetic.</v>

685
00:33:01.011 --> 00:33:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Specimen of manliness is a derivative of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the turn.</v>

686
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that makes sense.</v>

687
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Huckle anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why people?</v>

688
00:33:06.591 --> 00:33:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Why angry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>White people love calling people.</v>

689
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I agree with white men is Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun word to call.</v>

690
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:19.460
<v Speaker 2>People prefer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was insulting when you said it really</v>

691
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.400
<v Speaker 2>felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say it on the news,</v>

692
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just like fuck,</v>

693
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 2>but it's with so it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

694
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:28.890
<v Speaker 2>he's a cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

695
00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.480
<v Speaker 2>The newscasters be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be right back with the weather.</v>

696
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.083
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even know what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just stay right there and you can </v>

697
00:33:35.631 --> 00:33:39.380
<v Speaker 2>even say the word cuckold Coquille.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves cuckold Erotica.</v>

698
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.470
<v Speaker 2>You could probably say that on regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>TV and they would not.</v>

699
00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 2>They would not be able to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

700
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.963
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be stuck and you've just painted </v>

701
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:48.470
<v Speaker 2>a ruthless image in their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some poor sobbing man.</v>

702
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Some fucking dude that looks like iron </v>
<v Speaker 2>head is laying pipe to the lady.</v>

703
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 2>They take you off to the green room </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

704
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.220
<v Speaker 2>We know you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you just not.</v>

705
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Those people need to stop all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that tell you we know you can,</v>

706
00:34:04.011 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Speaker 2>but you shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

707
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Don't say that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just junk you.</v>

708
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your magic words.</v>

709
00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 2>What do you have child?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain words you can't say.</v>

710
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:15.853
<v Speaker 2>That is another thing that has to go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's being more and more highlighted by </v>

711
00:34:18.861 --> 00:34:20.410
<v Speaker 2>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why you're seeing in,</v>

712
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.970
<v Speaker 2>in television shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you watched the walking dead,</v>

713
00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.910
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a lot of random use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>swears,</v>

714
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll hear a random use of swears </v>

715
00:34:28.071 --> 00:34:32.280
<v Speaker 2>on other shows on cable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say shit during their TV sets.</v>

716
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit is okay.</v>

717
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.990
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've changed it,</v>

718
00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:38.840
<v Speaker 2>but you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still can't say fuck if you,</v>

719
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.540
<v Speaker 2>if you watch walking dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

720
00:34:40.541 --> 00:34:43.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they ever say fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure if they do know,</v>

721
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure they just say shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

722
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.130
<v Speaker 2>And they could say tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And My last Cole Bear,</v>

723
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:50.980
<v Speaker 2>which I did in December,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ish,</v>

724
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.770
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

725
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.840
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't say fly open one ball out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

726
00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:02.380
<v Speaker 2>I could say fly open one testicle out or</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could say fly open everything out.</v>

727
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.820
<v Speaker 2>But couldn't say one ball duct Stan hope</v>
<v Speaker 2>came up with an idea.</v>

728
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.133
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were doing our version of the </v>

729
00:35:10.431 --> 00:35:15.431
<v Speaker 2>mantra that was a big fat failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a doug came up with this idea to do.</v>

730
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:22.511
<v Speaker 2>I'm a game show where a dude had a box </v>
<v Speaker 2>over his private areas and a light would</v>

731
00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:29.111
<v Speaker 2>go off whenever it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your direction.</v>

732
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 2>So the light was red light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We control the light obviously.</v>

733
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:36.980
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be like dwarves eating bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Light goes off,</v>

734
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:38.400
<v Speaker 2>like guys</v>

735
00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.253
<v Speaker 5>hairy as light goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they told us Doug's name for the </v>

736
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:49.041
<v Speaker 5>show was make me hard and they told us </v>
<v Speaker 5>we couldn't have it called make me hard.</v>

737
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 5>We had to change it to make me stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

738
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 5>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

739
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're like hard just too,</v>

740
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.770
<v Speaker 5>it's just not the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We think make me step.</v>

741
00:35:57.771 --> 00:35:58.604
<v Speaker 5>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these two ladies that were talking to </v>

742
00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:02.340
<v Speaker 5>her that had nothing to do with comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like literally nothing.</v>

743
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:05.550
<v Speaker 5>Like how is it stiff is actually more </v>
<v Speaker 5>offensive.</v>

744
00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.840
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like a really a dumb person.</v>

745
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:13.850
<v Speaker 5>He gets ready to take my fucking stiffy </v>
<v Speaker 5>and yet discussing.</v>

746
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.590
<v Speaker 5>So when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

747
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.170
<v Speaker 5>when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we're doing this,</v>

748
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.393
<v Speaker 5>this light obviously we controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we played this game show so we </v>

749
00:36:22.741 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 5>couldn't call it make me hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

750
00:36:24.061 --> 00:36:25.110
<v Speaker 5>how to change it to make me Steph.</v>

751
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.450
<v Speaker 5>We lost the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the stupidest fucking argument.</v>

752
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.670
<v Speaker 5>And it was so indicative of how </v>
<v Speaker 5>frustrating those shows can be.</v>

753
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.690
<v Speaker 5>We have all these fucking chefs in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>kitchen.</v>

754
00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:37.370
<v Speaker 5>I just think it'd be better if he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>wearing blue underwear better.</v>

755
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.410
<v Speaker 5>It would look better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

756
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.500
<v Speaker 5>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

757
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:41.663
<v Speaker 5>the guy's lying there and we have this </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman come out and she's got these big </v>

758
00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:46.674
<v Speaker 5>juicy tits and he's sucking on them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>she's climbing on him and everybody's </v>

759
00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:51.024
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>

760
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 5>And they put a whip cream on her tits </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's sucking the whipped cream,</v>

761
00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:57.030
<v Speaker 5>offer nipples and moves like heavy duty </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

762
00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.940
<v Speaker 5>Then she pulls her pants down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's got a Dick,</v>

763
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.560
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only does she have a Dick,</v>

764
00:37:01.561 --> 00:37:05.010
<v Speaker 5>she has a dick that looks like it had </v>
<v Speaker 5>been poisoned,</v>

765
00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:09.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because she's a transvestite transsexual</v>

766
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:15.020
<v Speaker 5>rather bubbly woman coming because like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the estrogen,</v>

767
00:37:16.381 --> 00:37:17.820
<v Speaker 5>it was like kid killed the deck.</v>

768
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.350
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like dark.</v>

769
00:37:19.351 --> 00:37:21.710
<v Speaker 5>And like it was like a crispy French </v>
<v Speaker 5>fries.</v>

770
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.810
<v Speaker 5>You get to Jerry's Deli like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

771
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:30.050
<v Speaker 5>but that was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was okay.</v>

772
00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:31.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we had a blur the deck,</v>

773
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.680
<v Speaker 5>but that was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just can't use the word hard.</v>

774
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.990
<v Speaker 5>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So stupid.</v>

775
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.100
<v Speaker 5>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hard to bad word is hard to bad word.</v>

776
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.890
<v Speaker 5>Fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Testicle sounded worse than ball to me.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Testicle sounds.</v>

<v Speaker 5>what about that?</v>

779
00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.410
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Half sack half's heck out.</v>

780
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:56.940
<v Speaker 5>Says Negus said fuck a few times in that</v>
<v Speaker 5>scene where he was a bad scene.</v>

781
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:57.774
<v Speaker 5>I guess that was censored version where </v>
<v Speaker 5>he says like 23 times and uncensored </v>

782
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:01.074
<v Speaker 5>version.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see the real workers and so </v>

783
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.680
<v Speaker 5>that was the scene that made me stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching that show.</v>

784
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.060
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm watching torture show.</v>

786
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.550
<v Speaker 5>This isn't a fun show anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't a show where people trying to</v>

787
00:38:11.551 --> 00:38:15.650
<v Speaker 5>get away from zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The zombies are inconsequential.</v>

788
00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.820
<v Speaker 5>You can like push them aside now used to</v>

<v Speaker 5>raw terror horse apart and right now you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can just kind of trip them and push </v>

<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Devops,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

795
00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.660
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't enough.</v>

796
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.150

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about the fact these </v>

801
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:46.300
<v Speaker 2>zombies are so fucking slow and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>never seem to starve to death.</v>

802
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Like explain to me how they're still </v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

00:42:57.201 --> 00:43:01.310
<v Speaker 5>required in order to make a craft that </v>

00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:49.400
<v Speaker 5>which is like this purported city of </v>
<v Speaker 5>gold.</v>

925
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 5>There was a legendary story in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Amazon.</v>

926
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there was something about him that I</v>

927
00:43:53.471 --> 00:43:56.750
<v Speaker 5>had tweeted earlier in a great car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Eldorado.</v>

928
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.711
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

929
00:43:57.711 --> 00:43:58.790
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

930
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.900
<v Speaker 5>in 1925 went to the Amazon and saw these</v>
<v Speaker 5>mounds,</v>

931
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.500
<v Speaker 5>these mounds in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know,</v>

932
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:05.960
<v Speaker 5>this is almost 100 years ago.</v>

933
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:08.060
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

934
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:08.894
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wanted to investigate these mounds </v>

935
00:44:09.891 --> 00:44:11.150
<v Speaker 5>because you've got on top of one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

936
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:14.240
<v Speaker 5>And he looked out and he saw another </v>
<v Speaker 5>mound there is named Percy Fawcett.</v>

937
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:16.820
<v Speaker 5>You saw another mound out in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>distance.</v>

938
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:20.740
<v Speaker 5>And then he realized that they were on a</v>
<v Speaker 5>grid and he realized that there's a city</v>

939
00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a city.</v>

940
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:22.610
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

941
00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:24.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these aren't dirt mountains.</v>

942
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 5>These are city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

943
00:44:26.001 --> 00:44:30.080
<v Speaker 5>these are stone structures that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>earth has sort of covered up because the</v>

944
00:44:30.081 --> 00:44:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just so tense.</v>

945
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 5>It just covers everything massive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So super recently,</v>

946
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:37.194
<v Speaker 5>like within the last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've got these satellite images of </v>

947
00:44:40.531 --> 00:44:44.490
<v Speaker 5>that area and they found these pictures </v>
<v Speaker 5>like what Jamie just pulled up that last</v>

948
00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:45.403
<v Speaker 5>article that see those images,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's all stuff that they found out </v>

949
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:52.800
<v Speaker 5>from the ceiling or from a satellite's </v>
<v Speaker 5>rather from the ceiling.</v>

950
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.460
<v Speaker 5>It looks like a snowman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were saying that they did these,</v>

951
00:44:56.461 --> 00:44:57.294
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well they're just,</v>

952
00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:58.163
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just paths and structures is a </v>

953
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:01.470
<v Speaker 5>bunch of them though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a ton of.</v>

954
00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:02.793
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when was this discovered really </v>

955
00:45:03.841 --> 00:45:05.550
<v Speaker 5>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really recently.</v>

956
00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

957
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:09.580
<v Speaker 5>so one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the show,</v>

958
00:45:09.581 --> 00:45:10.414
<v Speaker 5>they were saying that the carbon tested </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of these mounds and they were over </v>

959
00:45:13.591 --> 00:45:14.580
<v Speaker 5>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years old,</v>

960
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 5>so thousand years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the speculation.</v>

961
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:19.374
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this show might have been wrong what </v>

962
00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:21.684
<v Speaker 5>they were asserting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it could totally be true because </v>

963
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:25.320
<v Speaker 5>definitely some culture 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago,</v>

964
00:45:25.321 --> 00:45:27.630
<v Speaker 5>they're just finding out about that </v>
<v Speaker 5>6,000</v>

965
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:28.920
<v Speaker 5>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another,</v>

966
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:33.240
<v Speaker 5>these people had created irrigation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had created these,</v>

967
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.090
<v Speaker 5>these pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

968
00:45:35.091 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had made a grid,</v>

969
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:38.850
<v Speaker 5>like a system against what looked like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>city,</v>

970
00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:42.130
<v Speaker 5>but it didn't look like a settled,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like group of tents or something.</v>

971
00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:46.070
<v Speaker 5>Like how long have human beings on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>planet and enormous area to have.</v>

972
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.370
<v Speaker 5>It's bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger than Georgia.</v>

973
00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:50.220
<v Speaker 5>What does it say that it could have </v>
<v Speaker 5>maintained a population of 60,000</v>

974
00:45:50.221 --> 00:45:51.054
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more people than in many medieval </v>

975
00:45:52.591 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Speaker 5>European cities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

976
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:57.600
<v Speaker 5>The structures were created by a network</v>
<v Speaker 5>of trenches about 36 feet,</v>

977
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.823
<v Speaker 5>nearly 11 meters wide and several feet </v>
<v Speaker 5>deep line by banks up to three feet </v>

978
00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:04.164
<v Speaker 5>high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere ringed by low mounds </v>

979
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:08.130
<v Speaker 5>containing ceramics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>charcoal and stone tools.</v>

980
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.650
<v Speaker 5>It's thought that they were used for </v>
<v Speaker 5>fortifications,</v>

981
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:13.710
<v Speaker 5>homes and ceremonies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and could have maintained populations of</v>

982
00:46:13.711 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 5>$60,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's saying they sound fun.</v>

983
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:17.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great people,</v>

984
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.140
<v Speaker 5>they were cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

985
00:46:19.141 --> 00:46:20.910
<v Speaker 5>But that other than the ones that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>found.</v>

986
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:22.280
<v Speaker 5>But other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're fine.</v>

987
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:26.850
<v Speaker 5>So he had these guides and the guides,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're taking them to this mount.</v>

988
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.610
<v Speaker 5>Obviously this is again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Wonky TV show.</v>

989
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:31.290
<v Speaker 5>Might've been bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

990
00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:31.901
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

991
00:46:31.901 --> 00:46:35.940
<v Speaker 5>they go fast and loose with the facts or</v>
<v Speaker 5>tomato show seemed more fun and they got</v>

992
00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:36.774
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

993
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 5>They were saying that he was told by his</v>
<v Speaker 5>guidance to stay back.</v>

994
00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:41.874
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't go any further because </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's cannibals and he was never seen </v>

995
00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:48.960
<v Speaker 5>from again the last contact with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He ran into some other tribes.</v>

996
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:49.820
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

997
00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:50.653
<v Speaker 5>somebody probably jacked him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably knew even back then the </v>

998
00:46:52.261 --> 00:46:56.180
<v Speaker 5>white people coming over from England,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what can they just want it as north</v>

999
00:46:56.181 --> 00:46:57.014
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't have to throw everything back </v>

1000
00:46:59.581 --> 00:47:02.960
<v Speaker 5>then was probably super nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long were crap though?</v>

1001
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:06.530
<v Speaker 5>People,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in this forum and this forum,</v>

1002
00:47:06.531 --> 00:47:09.420
<v Speaker 5>I think it's been 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

1003
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:14.690
<v Speaker 5>One hundred 50 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what's the oldest town that we found</v>

1004
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.593
<v Speaker 5>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the oldest structures that they </v>

1005
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:23.511
<v Speaker 5>know of right now are somewhere around </v>
<v Speaker 5>14,000</v>

1006
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:28.020
<v Speaker 5>plus years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>14th as far as like stone structures.</v>

1007
00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 5>Like when they went to like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>very first</v>

1008
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.950
<v Speaker 2>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was in Beirut.</v>

1009
00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was this,</v>

1010
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.113
<v Speaker 2>I forget the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like one of the original </v>

1011
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:38.190
<v Speaker 2>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where they actually started to grid</v>

1012
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.890
<v Speaker 2>out and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1013
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.500
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know how long ago that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1014
00:47:41.501 --> 00:47:42.334
<v Speaker 2>let's find out what is the oldest known </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence of civilization and what do </v>

1015
00:47:46.481 --> 00:47:49.810
<v Speaker 2>they do determine a civilization like </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning?</v>

1016
00:47:49.811 --> 00:47:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1017
00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.630
<v Speaker 2>we were hunters gatherers first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1018
00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:54.070
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

1019
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:54.904
<v Speaker 2>where do you draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess when did you have girlfriends </v>

1020
00:47:56.921 --> 00:48:01.540
<v Speaker 2>and like have fun on a Saturday night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you guys have a drive through?</v>

1021
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:02.913
<v Speaker 2>That's when it all started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was at a food festival the </v>

1022
00:48:05.351 --> 00:48:07.420
<v Speaker 2>other day and the band pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Van,</v>

1023
00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:08.254
<v Speaker 2>like these young guys were playing Elton</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Saturday night and were like </v>

1024
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>

1025
00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking,</v>

1026
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:19.390
<v Speaker 2>is that as important to kids as it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were like,</v>

1027
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:22.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because school Saturday it important.</v>

1028
00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Is that still the way it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:26.953
<v Speaker 2>School makes it important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Earliest evidence of modern human </v>

1030
00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:30.910
<v Speaker 2>culture found 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1031
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty 4,000</v>

1032
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:34.540
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over 20,000</v>

1033
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:38.440
<v Speaker 2>years before other findings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Modern modern human behavior.</v>

1034
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.393
<v Speaker 2>So this is the earliest unambiguous </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence for modern human behavior has </v>

1035
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:45.730
<v Speaker 2>been discovered in an international team</v>
<v Speaker 2>of researchers in a South African cave.</v>

1036
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:46.713
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what's crazy that is saying that </v>

1037
00:48:48.461 --> 00:48:53.461
<v Speaker 2>the first evidence of civilization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern human behavior was all 44,000</v>

1038
00:48:56.561 --> 00:48:59.500
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy recent.</v>

1039
00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:04.390
<v Speaker 2>That's so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the earliest stone structures I</v>

1040
00:49:04.391 --> 00:49:06.880
<v Speaker 2>think is that the stuff they found in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey,</v>

1041
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.190
<v Speaker 2>the really big stone structures in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey at,</v>

1042
00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:10.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go becky,</v>

1043
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.140
<v Speaker 2>go Beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tepi.</v>

1044
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:13.023
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the oldest right now as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as like really complex because that </v>

1045
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:16.743
<v Speaker 2>before then they weren't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't really convinced that </v>

1046
00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 2>people could do that kind of stuff back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

1047
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.810
<v Speaker 2>So that means in 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years they figured out how to make that.</v>

1048
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.673
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be some older structures </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they just haven't found that are </v>

1049
00:49:26.351 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 2>way down or could see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:49:28.991 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I think they're guessing you definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're guessing with a lot of evidence.</v>

1051
00:49:32.231 --> 00:49:33.064
<v Speaker 2>That's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing with a complete supply of </v>

1052
00:49:35.561 --> 00:49:38.710
<v Speaker 2>evidence that be found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole other culture,</v>

1053
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:42.880
<v Speaker 2>will they find stuff aliens in it where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they find stuff is in the oceans because</v>

1054
00:49:42.881 --> 00:49:43.714
<v Speaker 2>the water levels prison since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they find like entire cities like </v>

1055
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:52.230
<v Speaker 2>underwater that that I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably some amazing evidence.</v>

1056
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.710
<v Speaker 2>They've never even discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1057
00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Ancient cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's got to be.</v>

1058
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:58.330
<v Speaker 2>But you got to think also that what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the city made out of?</v>

1059
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Because unless it was made out of solid </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone,</v>

1060
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:03.990
<v Speaker 2>the oceans just going to destroy the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean crept over.</v>

1061
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.833
<v Speaker 2>Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you would find anything in </v>

1062
00:50:07.031 --> 00:50:07.960
<v Speaker 2>3000 years?</v>

1063
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you find?</v>

1064
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Gary Busey is this thing on marina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll still be at the back.</v>

1065
00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.680
<v Speaker 2>What do I find a good time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this thing on the pills?</v>

1066
00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in Malibu,</v>

1067
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:29.030
<v Speaker 2>which is vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally vanished.</v>

1068
00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Salt Water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metal,</v>

1069
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:32.564
<v Speaker 2>and even if it was anything made of </v>
<v Speaker 2>metal would give out after a thousand </v>

1070
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:36.853
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about like any jobs and stuff that </v>

1071
00:50:37.821 --> 00:50:39.530
<v Speaker 2>are down under the ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that old.</v>

1072
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.590
<v Speaker 2>There's some hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that's like.</v>

1073
00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:43.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's.</v>

1074
00:50:43.421 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 2>There's probably some the remanence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it of like the Roman times,</v>

1075
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.190
<v Speaker 2>but think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

1076
00:50:49.191 --> 00:50:50.490
<v Speaker 2>A thousand years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1077
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.980
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand years.</v>

1078
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about 7,000?</v>

1079
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:56.290
<v Speaker 2>What about eight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing you're not going to find.</v>

1080
00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.810
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about more than 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

1081
00:50:59.811 --> 00:51:02.690
<v Speaker 2>If it was a city like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ain't gonna find shit,</v>

1082
00:51:02.691 --> 00:51:07.691
<v Speaker 2>but what if just hear me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it was covered with lava and you</v>

1083
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:09.440
<v Speaker 2>couldn't.</v>

1084
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.273
<v Speaker 2>And then get solidified it like Pompei </v>
<v Speaker 2>crack that bitch open and we're ranch </v>

1085
00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:15.843
<v Speaker 2>where divers discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discover ancient Roman treasure trove </v>

1086
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:22.190
<v Speaker 2>and shipwreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixteen hundred year old shipwreck.</v>

1087
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still some stuff,</v>

1088
00:51:24.231 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 2>but like the ship's gone and look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>anchor dude.</v>

1089
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:28.900
<v Speaker 2>They found the anchor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

1090
00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.120
<v Speaker 2>You go back to that anchor again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find a little coins.</v>

1091
00:51:32.121 --> 00:51:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the anchor?</v>

1092
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a long walk.</v>

1093
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.450
<v Speaker 2>That's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is cool.</v>

1094
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:40.183
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that they would throw a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunk of metal overboard yet it to snag </v>

1095
00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:50.280
<v Speaker 2>them over and then they would hope that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be able to pick it up within that</v>

1096
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:54.560
<v Speaker 2>role and look at the rare bronze statue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1097
00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:56.210
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been to Rome,</v>

1098
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:57.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1099
00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Just once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just last summer.</v>

1100
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Two summers ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last summer.</v>

1101
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.790
<v Speaker 2>And pretty mind blowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1102
00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life changing.</v>

1103
00:52:05.661 --> 00:52:07.580
<v Speaker 2>The images are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at all this stuff.</v>

1104
00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.710
<v Speaker 2>They're finding down there that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

1105
00:52:09.711 --> 00:52:12.410
<v Speaker 2>That was the statue of Liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Statue of Liberty.</v>

1106
00:52:12.411 --> 00:52:16.010
<v Speaker 2>And get back to the souvenir shop on </v>
<v Speaker 2>third street.</v>

1107
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Someone's fucking with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1108

<v Speaker 2>Goddamn liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Cow.</v>

1109
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:22.743
<v Speaker 2>Stole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about as close to the statue of </v>

1110
00:52:24.471 --> 00:52:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Liberty as you can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1111
00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:27.950
<v Speaker 2>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's just the same pose.</v>

1112
00:52:27.951 --> 00:52:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Just not holding the torch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at the bottom of it.</v>

1113
00:52:30.231 --> 00:52:31.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like a horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.633
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it like you drink out of that or </v>

1115
00:52:33.921 --> 00:52:35.030
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's poseidon.</v>

1116
00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:36.670
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1117
00:52:36.671 --> 00:52:37.700
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:40.010
<v Speaker 2>What is it at the bottom though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's got it.</v>

1119
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't Jamie like a horn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a buffalo?</v>

1120
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Some kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1121
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.770
<v Speaker 2>like maybe you drank out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1122
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:48.853
<v Speaker 2>That's probably a new handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you flip it upside down like </v>

1123
00:52:52.641 --> 00:52:56.510
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] could be to and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's the wrong way.</v>

1124
00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.890
<v Speaker 2>It looks like you would want to see her </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was on a handle on her face facing</v>

1125
00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:02.480
<v Speaker 2>the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hood ornament.</v>

<v Speaker 2>now that trump's in office trying to be </v>

1153
00:54:33.091 --> 00:54:33.924
<v Speaker 2>pretentious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smoked a pipe recently on the podcast </v>

1154
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:38.290
<v Speaker 2>a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good over there.</v>

1155
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.393
<v Speaker 2>I was going to bring a cigar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know if you could smoke a </v>

1156
00:54:40.801 --> 00:54:41.660
<v Speaker 2>cigar in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1157
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:42.920
<v Speaker 2>we could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1158
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:43.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just turn on that filter thing and we </v>

1159
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.940
<v Speaker 2>could smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we smoked cigars in here,</v>

1160
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:47.783
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do that next time.</v>

1162
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I have a big thing of Cuban cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you juggle or illegal?</v>

1163
00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Big shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big shots.</v>

1164
00:54:57.650 --> 00:55:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Big shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Illegal through a guy.</v>

1165
00:55:00.661 --> 00:55:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I know in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a big deal.</v>

1166
00:55:02.611 --> 00:55:07.310
<v Speaker 2>I know people a little to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for great.</v>

1167
00:55:07.311 --> 00:55:07.970
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1168
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:09.930
<v Speaker 2>it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fight was weird though.</v>

1169
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:12.960
<v Speaker 2>The main event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of controversy.</v>

1170
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.630
<v Speaker 2>People thought it was a boring fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1171
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:16.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1172
00:55:16.161 --> 00:55:16.994
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just not a lot of action </v>

1173
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:19.284
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very tactical fight for most of </v>

1174
00:55:20.881 --> 00:55:22.620
<v Speaker 2>the five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the fifth round,</v>

1175
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:27.870
<v Speaker 2>tyron woodley cracked them and almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>had them out cold but was losing most of</v>

1176
00:55:27.871 --> 00:55:30.030
<v Speaker 2>the round in a lot of people's eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>before then.</v>

1177
00:55:30.031 --> 00:55:32.880
<v Speaker 2>So the scoring was really oddly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1178
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:34.023
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really odd because a lot of </v>

1179
00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:36.810
<v Speaker 2>people disagree with the score.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The score was,</v>

1180
00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 2>it was for the champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the first fight they had was a draw.</v>

1181
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:42.570
<v Speaker 2>And then people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people like,</v>

1182
00:55:42.571 --> 00:55:43.404
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that first part was to draw this </v>

1183
00:55:43.891 --> 00:55:47.940
<v Speaker 2>fight was a draw to including the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was commentating with dominick Cruz,</v>

1184
00:55:47.941 --> 00:55:49.440
<v Speaker 2>a former,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bantamweight champion.</v>

1185
00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:50.843
<v Speaker 2>So it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people felt disappointed when </v>

1186
00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:56.530
<v Speaker 2>you're in that situation and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcasting it,</v>

1187
00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:00.390
<v Speaker 2>do you speak your mind like sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it's weird sometimes,</v>

1188
00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.380
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to.</v>

1189
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think in that case it was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

1190
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I don't.</v>

1191
00:56:06.471 --> 00:56:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I think the scoring system sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1192
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Do you know anything about scoring </v>
<v Speaker 2>system for MMA?</v>

1193
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:16.500
<v Speaker 2>We essentially took the boxing scoring </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and adapted it to mma.</v>

1194
00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:17.363
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a 10 point must system and it's </v>

1195
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:21.960
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to get around to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>scored 10,</v>

1196
00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:23.590
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The with that is,</v>

1197
00:56:23.591 --> 00:56:28.591
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it leaves enough room for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a accurately judging all the events that</v>

1198
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:31.984
<v Speaker 2>take place in a five minute period of </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat sports because there's so many </v>

1199
00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:36.064
<v Speaker 2>different interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those interactions should </v>

1200
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:42.640
<v Speaker 2>probably be judged on their own merit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like almost like,</v>

1201
00:56:42.641 --> 00:56:43.474
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be like there should be a way </v>

1202
00:56:45.461 --> 00:56:49.750
<v Speaker 2>to quantify how much damage was done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it was the right thing to</v>

1203
00:56:49.751 --> 00:56:50.584
<v Speaker 2>do and it should be like probably a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred point score system or something </v>

1204
00:56:52.661 --> 00:56:53.370
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1205
00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:54.203
<v Speaker 2>A lot more factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot more factors like the difference </v>

1206
00:56:56.261 --> 00:56:59.170
<v Speaker 2>between a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine and in one round at 10,</v>

1207
00:56:59.171 --> 00:57:01.270
<v Speaker 2>nine and another round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally different fight.</v>

1208
00:57:01.271 --> 00:57:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Like one guy's getting dominated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's clearly losing.</v>

1209
00:57:04.301 --> 00:57:07.600
<v Speaker 2>And the other one it's a toss up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still there both to 10,</v>

1210
00:57:07.601 --> 00:57:08.950
<v Speaker 2>nine rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>

1211
00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.990
<v Speaker 2>A does it work for boxing because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer and it's just one thing.</v>

1212
00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.233
<v Speaker 2>Just one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's three minutes instead of five </v>

1213
00:57:17.471 --> 00:57:18.304
<v Speaker 2>minutes you more rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's more variables because </v>

1214
00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:21.820
<v Speaker 2>there's 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine rounds boxing.</v>

1215
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:23.830
<v Speaker 2>The 10 point must system works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like it.</v>

1216
00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:26.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it can be improved upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it couldn't be,</v>

1217
00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:31.030
<v Speaker 2>but for MMA is woefully inadequate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've created an updated system,</v>

1218
00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 2>but Nevada hasn't adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adopted it yet.</v>

1219
00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:34.423
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you go to vegas and you're </v>

1220
00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.610
<v Speaker 2>gigging gigging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daddy,</v>

1221
00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.510
<v Speaker 2>you and you're gigging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

1222
00:57:40.511 --> 00:57:41.344
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you eat whatever you want today or </v>

1223
00:57:46.001 --> 00:57:46.450
<v Speaker 2>this weekend?</v>

1224
00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:47.283
<v Speaker 2>I had to it this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Spaghetti I had like linguine with </v>

1225
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:51.400
<v Speaker 2>clams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

1226
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:54.070
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need a Cuban sandwich?</v>

1227
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Grand Sunday night?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I shitty food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I felt it today.</v>

1229
00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:00.433
<v Speaker 2>So that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are so tired of hearing people </v>

1230
00:58:01.631 --> 00:58:05.230
<v Speaker 2>complain about what they eating bad food</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it does to your body.</v>

1231
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I think people have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've worn my welcome out with that stuff</v>

1232
00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.130
<v Speaker 2>because I've talked about it too much on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own.</v>

1233
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.510
<v Speaker 2>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1234
00:58:13.511 --> 00:58:16.030
<v Speaker 2>definitely indulge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had pizza on Sunday.</v>

1235
00:58:16.031 --> 00:58:17.500
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of shitty food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1236
00:58:17.501 --> 00:58:19.090
<v Speaker 2>No because it's hard when you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>

1237
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:20.380
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1238
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:21.843
<v Speaker 2>to not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you break the seal when you're </v>

1239
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:23.891
<v Speaker 2>on the road you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1240
00:58:23.891 --> 00:58:26.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll just clean it up when I get home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1241
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:27.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1242
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:29.023
<v Speaker 2>but I've been pretty consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like diet and pretty consistent </v>

1243
00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:32.470
<v Speaker 2>with working out.</v>

1244
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I was going to bring some bread today </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

1245
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:35.223
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1246
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I was experimenting with something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to make something different and it</v>

1247
00:58:38.561 --> 00:58:40.530
<v Speaker 2>was kind of a fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a total fail.</v>

1248
00:58:40.531 --> 00:58:43.210
<v Speaker 2>It's still tastes good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't look that great.</v>

1249
00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.370
<v Speaker 2>And it was like I was going to bring it </v>
<v Speaker 2>by and then I was like,</v>

1250
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:46.263
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're going to want to </v>

1251
00:58:47.351 --> 00:58:48.540
<v Speaker 2>eat bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>

1252
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:51.940
<v Speaker 2>I think they're dialed in right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be dialed in right now.</v>

1253
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:53.103
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1254
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get myself one day a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day a week to fuck off.</v>

1255
00:58:56.831 --> 00:58:59.980
<v Speaker 2>We're not always going to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not always going to take that day.</v>

1256
00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:00.903
<v Speaker 2>And that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need it and don't go batshit </v>

1257
00:59:02.531 --> 00:59:03.460
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1258
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:05.320
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Aubrey Marcus,</v>

1259
00:59:05.321 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 2>my good buddies described this the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1260
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:08.621
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1261
00:59:08.621 --> 00:59:13.621
<v Speaker 2>you're doing is you're just for a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments of mouth pleasure.</v>

1262
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:19.090
<v Speaker 2>You're totally hijacking your body for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day.</v>

1263
00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:19.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're eating like an ice cream </v>

1264
00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Sundae</v>

1265
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:23.893
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1297
01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.360
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't that great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the worst.</v>

1298
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:56.600
<v Speaker 4>You know what the best chicken isn't?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roscoe's chicken and waffles.</v>

1300
01:00:58.830 --> 01:00:59.663
<v Speaker 4>The just my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's just the combination </v>

1301
01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.673
<v Speaker 4>combination of the chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chicken and waffles and Syrup and </v>

1302
01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:08.900
<v Speaker 4>Collard Greens or something about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Collard Greens.</v>

1303
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:09.733

1306
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.030
<v Speaker 4>Alabama and the woods and he's just kick</v>

<v Speaker 4>because when someone does it really </v>

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.500
<v Speaker 4>It's a delicious vegetable and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a well used one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's not just theirs,</v>

1367
01:04:20.161 --> 01:04:20.994
<v Speaker 2>but there's people that think like </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's toilet humor and there was a </v>

1368
01:04:22.531 --> 01:04:25.230
<v Speaker 2>thing that like in the 19 sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>

1369
01:04:25.231 --> 01:04:26.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's doing it.</v>

1371
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Toilet humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1372
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:32.400
<v Speaker 3>If it's coming out of somebody and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have is that,</v>

1373
01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.220
<v Speaker 3>and there's nothing if it's coming from </v>
<v Speaker 3>ru,</v>

1374
01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:37.090
<v Speaker 3>like he's a funny comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:52.350
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1381
01:04:56.251 --> 01:04:57.084
<v Speaker 3>that in my act and it's just so fun to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about and the girls just get </v>

1382
01:05:00.091 --> 01:05:02.130
<v Speaker 3>hysterical in the audience because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1383
01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.600
<v Speaker 3>It's just too much fun to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1384
01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:07.830
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why else are we here to enjoy ourselves?</v>

1385
01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:09.210
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1389
01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:17.950
<v Speaker 3>it is a thing they put.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a thing that</v>

1390
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.950
<v Speaker 2>you should certainly use it sparingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1391
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to describe it and talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

1392
01:05:22.361 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 2>like what is this guy obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1409
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:19.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll read like mentioned like with fans </v>
<v Speaker 2>that want to talk about stuff,</v>

1410
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.870
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known through everybody else.</v>

1411
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.093
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1412
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1413
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:27.280
<v Speaker 2>it just got too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1414
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.273
<v Speaker 2>it was overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather just talk to people about </v>

1415
01:06:29.891 --> 01:06:30.724
<v Speaker 2>bread recipes and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's too much information and </v>

1416
01:06:33.881 --> 01:06:36.700
<v Speaker 2>for sure we're definitely suffering from</v>
<v Speaker 2>an overload of information.</v>

1417
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 2>I just feel better because it's just too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much to go through.</v>

1418
01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:40.563
<v Speaker 2>It's just instagram is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see a couple of pictures of your </v>

1419
01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:45.290
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if something really crazy is</v>

1420
01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:46.390
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone will text me.</v>

1421
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1422
01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Something really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Erin Foster,</v>

1423
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:54.760
<v Speaker 2>the guy who's coming tomorrow who thinks</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can kill a wolf with his hands.</v>

1424
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.520
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be on a podcast tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1425
01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Former NFL player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has he done it?</v>

1426
01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never has killed a man by the way.</v>

1427
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:03.450
<v Speaker 2>No one's killed wolf with their hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1428
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Giant super athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1429
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said if he gets a hold of its neck,</v>

1430
01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.240
<v Speaker 2>it'll be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what he said.</v>

1431
01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not entirely sure he understands how</v>

1432
01:07:14.741 --> 01:07:16.060
<v Speaker 2>big that NEC is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1433
01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he understands how fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things move.</v>

1434
01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.473
<v Speaker 2>How vicious they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a bite that's five times </v>

1435
01:07:21.341 --> 01:07:23.560
<v Speaker 2>harder than a pit bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1436
01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>

1437
01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.790
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I joined the wolf movement when I was in</v>

1438
01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:30.770
<v Speaker 2>college was around the time it was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>saving the wolves because the numbers of</v>

1439
01:07:30.771 --> 01:07:32.980
<v Speaker 2>guns so low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what year was this?</v>

1440
01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>This was a like a 89,</v>
<v Speaker 2>88.</v>

1441
01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:37.870
<v Speaker 2>So that was before the yellowstone </v>
<v Speaker 2>reintroduction?</v>

1442
01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all part of that.</v>

1443
01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1444
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.030
<v Speaker 2>everyone's just pouring money and effort</v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

1445
01:07:43.031 --> 01:07:44.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it and stuff.</v>

1446
01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:45.790
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

1447
01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:51.050
<v Speaker 2>me and my friends were so into wolves </v>
<v Speaker 2>were just like we'd watch wolf videos,</v>

1448
01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:52.323
<v Speaker 2>wolf packs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We loved like the packs and the healthy </v>

1449
01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.100
<v Speaker 2>would hunt and like go around different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1450
01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.360
<v Speaker 2>And then now the wolf is a dominant </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1451
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.270
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of exploded a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1452
01:08:04.271 --> 01:08:05.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some areas.</v>

1453
01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.730
<v Speaker 2>But most in most areas they think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's healthy.</v>

1454
01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:10.511
<v Speaker 2>It is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1455
01:08:10.511 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Like they think it's healthy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone.</v>

1456
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Like people are upset that live on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of it because they weren't given</v>

1457
01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:16.370
<v Speaker 2>a say</v>

1458
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:17.780
<v Speaker 5>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of wolves.</v>

1459
01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:19.820
<v Speaker 5>Now there's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a real thing.</v>

1460
01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.193
<v Speaker 5>And as long as the elk populations are </v>
<v Speaker 5>high and they manage the wolf </v>

1461
01:08:24.681 --> 01:08:26.600
<v Speaker 5>populations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where it gets squirrely.</v>

1462
01:08:26.601 --> 01:08:27.434
<v Speaker 5>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people don't want anyone to kill </v>

1463
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:30.110
<v Speaker 5>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you say,</v>

1464
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.850
<v Speaker 5>well why would you kill a wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man?</v>

1465
01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 5>The problem is if you get the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get over populated,</v>

1466
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:35.834
<v Speaker 5>you have a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I agree and beautiful and I think </v>

1467
01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:39.110
<v Speaker 5>they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll probably like,</v>

1468
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:44.120
<v Speaker 5>if I had like one animal that I would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>like most psyched to see in the wild,</v>

1469
01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:46.760
<v Speaker 5>it would be a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're incredible for sure.</v>

1470
01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:47.653
<v Speaker 5>I'm fascinated by them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm also really aware of what the </v>

1471
01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:53.030
<v Speaker 5>consequences are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there's too many of them,</v>

1472
01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.300
<v Speaker 5>they'll eat people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They definitely eat people they've eaten</v>

1473
01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:58.520
<v Speaker 5>at many times in the past eight dogs.</v>

1474
01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.320
<v Speaker 5>There's some pictures that someone sent </v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

1475
01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.573
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his buddies and Kazic Stan had three </v>

1476
01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:05.024
<v Speaker 5>dogs killed the night by wolves and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>ate the dogs and they have pictures of </v>

1477
01:09:09.321 --> 01:09:12.230
<v Speaker 5>the remains of these dogs were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're bitten in half,</v>

1478
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:13.243
<v Speaker 5>like the lower abdomen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you could see everything from the </v>

1479
01:09:15.801 --> 01:09:17.840
<v Speaker 5>shoulders up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the dog's head,</v>

1480
01:09:17.841 --> 01:09:20.570
<v Speaker 5>the dogs arms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then everything back there is gone.</v>

1481
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.930
<v Speaker 5>They cut it in half.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's there.</v>

1482
01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:26.300
<v Speaker 5>The amount of power they generate in </v>
<v Speaker 5>their jaws,</v>

1483
01:09:26.301 --> 01:09:28.970
<v Speaker 5>he's insane and they don't look at dogs </v>
<v Speaker 5>like their buddies.</v>

1484
01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.140
<v Speaker 5>They look at dogs like pray and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at people like prayed.</v>

1485
01:09:32.141 --> 01:09:32.974
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there's.</v>

1486
01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.670
<v Speaker 5>If they don't think that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous,</v>

1487
01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:35.930
<v Speaker 5>they'll get you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll get you.</v>

1488
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:39.080
<v Speaker 5>There's coyote is all around us and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll get you to.</v>

1489
01:09:39.081 --> 01:09:40.790
<v Speaker 5>If everything gets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it gets real bad.</v>

1490
01:09:40.791 --> 01:09:41.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know someone who would.</v>

1491
01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 5>The coyote went in the house and got the</v>
<v Speaker 5>dog.</v>

1492
01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:45.830
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1493
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.210
<v Speaker 5>Little dog winning got it off.</v>

1494
01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:49.893
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1495
01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.160
<v Speaker 5>they're scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1496
01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:54.010
<v Speaker 5>They're scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who has a stronger bite?</v>

1497
01:09:54.011 --> 01:09:55.840
<v Speaker 5>A Wolf or a bear?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grizzly bear.</v>

1498
01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.340
<v Speaker 5>A grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1499
01:09:57.341 --> 01:09:58.930
<v Speaker 5>Not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not even close.</v>

1500
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:59.803
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A real like if you're talking like a </v>

1501
01:10:02.261 --> 01:10:04.480
<v Speaker 5>Kodiak Island grizzly bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the biggest they get.</v>

1502
01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:07.930
<v Speaker 5>They're not really grizzly grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's two bears,</v>

1503
01:10:07.931 --> 01:10:08.764
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a brown bear and a grizzly bear </v>

1504
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:11.680
<v Speaker 5>and the grizzly bears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the interior bear.</v>

1505
01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:13.690
<v Speaker 5>That's the bear that you find in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rocky mountain.</v>

1506
01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.320
<v Speaker 5>That's a grizzly bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1507
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:16.850
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the burial.</v>

1508
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:17.703
<v Speaker 5>Find a Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the coastal bears are even bigger </v>

1509
01:10:20.141 --> 01:10:21.850
<v Speaker 5>and that's what they had to kill in </v>
<v Speaker 5>California.</v>

1510
01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:22.873
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our state flag has a brown bear on it </v>

1511
01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.660
<v Speaker 5>and that brown bear that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gene Brown and Grizzly st animal,</v>

1512
01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:32.200
<v Speaker 5>but one of them lives interior and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>much more aggressive.</v>

1513
01:10:32.201 --> 01:10:33.034
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Grizzly is much scarier than the </v>

1514
01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.810
<v Speaker 5>coastal bear because the coastal bear </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets plenty of food.</v>

1515
01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.540
<v Speaker 5>That's why they're so big and the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>one's hungry.</v>

1516
01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:43.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so coastal bears are enormous.</v>

1517
01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.373
<v Speaker 5>I mean enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the biggest ones on the planet that </v>

1518
01:10:47.231 --> 01:10:48.064
<v Speaker 5>are brown bears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the biggest bears in the planet right </v>

1519
01:10:49.481 --> 01:10:51.970
<v Speaker 5>now are polar bears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Polar bears,</v>

1520
01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:52.893
<v Speaker 5>but the brown bears on Kodiak Island,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they get too close to 2000 </v>

1521
01:10:57.611 --> 01:11:02.530
<v Speaker 5>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like find out what's the brown bear ever</v>

1522
01:11:02.531 --> 01:11:04.230
<v Speaker 5>shot on Kodiak Island?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1523
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:05.143
<v Speaker 5>I think it might be close to 12 feet </v>
<v Speaker 5>tall and I think it might be in the </v>

1524
01:11:08.981 --> 01:11:12.130
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood of 1800 to 2000 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>

1525
01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 5>I you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that time when I was hiking</v>

1526
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:18.060
<v Speaker 3>in Alaska and I was close to a bear who </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidentally.</v>

1527
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1528
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.320
<v Speaker 3>girl or a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1529
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Black or brown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a kind of Tan.</v>

1530
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Tan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1531
01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 3>probably it was in Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like probably a black bear.</v>

1532
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.790
<v Speaker 3>They have the color phase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black bears there.</v>

1533
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:34.530
<v Speaker 3>It was big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked like the size of a minivan.</v>

1534
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was probably a grizzly though.</v>

1535
01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:37.500
<v Speaker 3>It was big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1536
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:38.880
<v Speaker 3>So really big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1537
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:41.300
<v Speaker 3>And it was coming through the weeds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1538
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.340

<v Speaker 3>We were out there like miles and miles </v>
<v Speaker 3>in like overnight for like a week.</v>

1540
01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was reads like as tall as me,</v>

1541
01:11:53.671 --> 01:11:57.370
<v Speaker 3>like a whole field of those reads and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>just saw the,</v>

1542
01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:58.813
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reeds just partying like 50 feet </v>

<v Speaker 3>like oh my God.</v>

1544

<v Speaker 3>And I'm with like five other people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to run when they see</v>

1545
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:08.490
<v Speaker 3>a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to freeze.</v>

<v Speaker 3>running and we went to bat.</v>

1548
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:18.894
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of in between the instinct of what </v>

1549
01:12:20.221 --> 01:12:21.054
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bear was like where the corner of </v>

1550
01:12:22.681 --> 01:12:25.350
<v Speaker 3>that room is and just was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was late September.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was full.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1552
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.430
<v Speaker 3>It was going way down to get the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>berries,</v>

1553
01:12:29.431 --> 01:12:31.350
<v Speaker 3>like way down low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1555
01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:34.930

<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

1556
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:37.800
<v Speaker 3>but you realize it</v>

1557

<v Speaker 5>decides this is a whole different story,</v>

<v Speaker 5>so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1560
01:12:46.601 --> 01:12:50.650
<v Speaker 5>The biggest brown bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world record was bagged by Roy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>2:30</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 slash 16.</v>

1563
01:12:59.651 --> 01:13:01.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A score.</v>

1564
01:13:01.061 --> 01:13:03.790
<v Speaker 5>Largest scoring.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It doesn't say 30 feet long.</v>

1566
01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.260
<v Speaker 5>They're just scroll down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>scroll down.</v>

1567
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:10.090
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely not 30 feet long.</v>

1568
01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.080
<v Speaker 5>Twelve feet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1571
01:13:12.131 --> 01:13:15.910
<v Speaker 5>they're actually measuring the skull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think eight cups.</v>

1572
01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:19.150
<v Speaker 5>I think there may have measuring the </v>
<v Speaker 5>skull and then 16.</v>

1573
01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Who knows what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's the length.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to find out what that meant </v>

<v Speaker 2>Facteau horse that fucked a wolf.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like a bull horse wolf thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a tank of a face.</v>

1627
01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's imagine that thing running at your</v>

1628
01:15:35.741 --> 01:15:37.270
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

1629
01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.430
<v Speaker 2>He's closer to Hippos and Wales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Push,</v>

1630
01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.810
<v Speaker 2>you push the smallest one into it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>run to devolution.</v>

1631
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Scares the fuck out of me closest to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hippos and whale.</v>

1632
01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 2>We're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely a good time.</v>

1633
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:52.900
<v Speaker 2>A hippo whale thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was huge.</v>

1634
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:57.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were a hippo size too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think this was a thing,</v>

1635
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:59.290
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're this thing live.</v>

1636
01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:00.910
<v Speaker 2>He lived around people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1637
01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:02.613
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather live in a world where </v>

1638
01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.900
<v Speaker 2>2000 pounds with all of nature is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>decimated and we're.</v>

1639
01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:11.230
<v Speaker 2>And we're drilling in national parks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really bleak.</v>

1640
01:16:11.231 --> 01:16:12.064
<v Speaker 2>Like everything's concrete or would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to live in a time like this where </v>

1641
01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.440
<v Speaker 2>hell pigs are running around and you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight for your life the whole time?</v>

1642
01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:21.603
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had to live back then with the </v>

1643
01:16:23.411 --> 01:16:27.010
<v Speaker 2>weapons they had back then because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>year is this that this was going down?</v>

1644
01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 2>These were times when did this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists?</v>

1645
01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen to $16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Million years.</v>

1646
01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no people.</v>

1647
01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put them in modern day.</v>

1648
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:40.660
<v Speaker 2>So if there wasn't an animal back then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like us,</v>

1649
01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:42.570
<v Speaker 2>it's past the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1650
01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:48.020
<v Speaker 2>the big impact that you could on impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's 65 million years ago,</v>

1651
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:50.074
<v Speaker 2>so there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are probably like weird monkey </v>

1652
01:16:52.451 --> 01:16:54.670
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back then they didn't have.</v>

1653
01:16:54.671 --> 01:16:56.380
<v Speaker 2>They probably they were fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's update it.</v>

1654
01:16:56.381 --> 01:16:57.214
<v Speaker 2>Let's let's say the EPA is granted all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things I wanted to be able to do </v>

1655
01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:03.550
<v Speaker 2>and the place is just crazy with </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

1656
01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:06.220
<v Speaker 2>but we have held pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs in your garbage.</v>

1657
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 2>See that's where got guards and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1658
01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:12.500
<v Speaker 2>People are going to be happy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that know how to hunt</v>

1659
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:16.630
<v Speaker 5>because if there really are hell pigs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they really do become a problem,</v>

1660
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:17.703
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only thing that's keeping wolf </v>

1661
01:17:18.371 --> 01:17:20.890
<v Speaker 5>populations down as hunters and when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't have that,</v>

1662
01:17:20.891 --> 01:17:23.110
<v Speaker 5>you know what they do in Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get an airplanes,</v>

1663
01:17:23.111 --> 01:17:25.030
<v Speaker 5>they fly over him and they shoot them </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the sky.</v>

1664
01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.433
<v Speaker 5>They find the packs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they locate them and they swooped down </v>

1665
01:17:28.181 --> 01:17:29.014
<v Speaker 5>and shoot at them when they killed too </v>
<v Speaker 5>many Caribou or they killed too many </v>

1666
01:17:32.261 --> 01:17:33.094
<v Speaker 5>moose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would happen if they didn't do </v>

1667
01:17:33.761 --> 01:17:35.230
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would get overwhelmed.</v>

1668
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:38.050
<v Speaker 5>They have massive populations of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>they have in Siberia.</v>

1669
01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:39.673
<v Speaker 5>Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few years ago they were having these </v>

1670
01:17:40.811 --> 01:17:41.644
<v Speaker 5>super packs of wolves because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly horrible winter and it </v>

1671
01:17:44.101 --> 01:17:44.934
<v Speaker 5>would have like 100 wolf could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would get together so they could take </v>

1672
01:17:46.571 --> 01:17:47.404
<v Speaker 5>out horses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they would go into these barns and </v>

1673
01:17:50.081 --> 01:17:50.914
<v Speaker 5>then imagine you're hanging out in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>house and your barn is next door and </v>

1674
01:17:54.401 --> 01:17:58.210
<v Speaker 5>there's 100 wolves apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>100 walls,</v>

1675
01:17:58.230 --> 01:17:58.520
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1676
01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's okay if we kill a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1677
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:04.670
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's survival well if you don't,</v>

1678
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:05.710
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to get.</v>

1679
01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:06.803
<v Speaker 5>Or with the Russians in World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Russians and the Germans in World </v>

1680
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:11.460
<v Speaker 5>War One.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So many of them were killed by wolves,</v>

1681
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:15.730
<v Speaker 5>that they had a ceasefire and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>decided to kill wolves for real and they</v>

1682
01:18:15.731 --> 01:18:18.990
<v Speaker 5>went and they went back to killing each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other after they figured out how many.</v>

1683
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.510
<v Speaker 5>They sorted it out and killed a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 5>walls</v>

1684
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:25.120
<v Speaker 2>and this friend that's coming tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>says he can kill him with his hands.</v>

1685
01:18:25.121 --> 01:18:25.954
<v Speaker 2>He believes he seems incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this thing people have this </v>

1686
01:18:29.591 --> 01:18:32.770
<v Speaker 2>thing in their head and a wolf is like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog to kill a dog.</v>

1687
01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.840
<v Speaker 2>If he's a giant dude and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1688
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:38.050
<v Speaker 2>the dog doesn't bite him in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>spot and he can get ahold of it's neck.</v>

1689
01:18:38.051 --> 01:18:39.940
<v Speaker 2>He might be able to kill a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could kill a dog.</v>

1690
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I'd bet you might be able to kill some </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>

1691
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:44.230
<v Speaker 2>My lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1692
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Which puppy do you have a knife with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>when this is going down in Sirhan's?</v>

1693
01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Choke it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Easy.</v>

1694
01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.793
<v Speaker 2>Not Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Easy to kill an animal with your </v>

1695
01:18:51.821 --> 01:18:53.050
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You suffocate it.</v>

1696
01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Choker hold very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be very hard to do.</v>

1697
01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very hard dog.</v>

1698
01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard.</v>

1699
01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen my hands?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have giant hands,</v>

1700
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:03.730
<v Speaker 2>like a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive football player,</v>

1701
01:19:03.731 --> 01:19:04.710
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1702
01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.450
<v Speaker 2>if you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know Jujitsu and you get it back and you</v>

1703
01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:10.300
<v Speaker 2>can sync the choke in like a real proper</v>
<v Speaker 2>rear naked choke,</v>

1704
01:19:10.301 --> 01:19:11.134
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would think you would put it to </v>

1705
01:19:12.701 --> 01:19:14.670
<v Speaker 2>sleep and then stomp it's head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1706
01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.910
<v Speaker 2>It'd be the move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1707
01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.750
<v Speaker 2>You got to wear boots if you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog hunting.</v>

1708
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:18.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1709
01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like an animal that we've chosen.</v>

1710
01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1711
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.943
<v Speaker 2>this is an animal that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is our animal because they eat </v>

1712
01:19:27.911 --> 01:19:28.750
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1713
01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go to China,</v>

1714
01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.040
<v Speaker 2>they have a whole festival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1715
01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:36.760
<v Speaker 2>you can eat dogs just like pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1716
01:19:36.761 --> 01:19:37.594
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're supposed to be the </v>

1717
01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:40.060
<v Speaker 2>smartest pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1718
01:19:40.061 --> 01:19:40.894
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dog is definitely not as smart as a </v>

1719
01:19:43.151 --> 01:19:46.510
<v Speaker 2>pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogs and idiot.</v>

1720
01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:48.280
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's fun.</v>

1721
01:19:48.281 --> 01:19:49.720
<v Speaker 2>We just got her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's great,</v>

1722
01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:50.613
<v Speaker 2>but a not bright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when people were having </v>

1723
01:19:52.511 --> 01:19:53.860
<v Speaker 2>pigs for pets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1724
01:19:53.861 --> 01:19:55.210
<v Speaker 2>It was like a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1725
01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Everyone had pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not everyone,</v>

1726
01:19:56.801 --> 01:19:58.960
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pop belly pigs.</v>

1727
01:19:58.961 --> 01:19:59.920
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those pigs.</v>

1728
01:19:59.921 --> 01:20:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I bet they're not doing that great old </v>
<v Speaker 2>farting in the house.</v>

1729
01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a pig barely hanging on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

1730
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.873
<v Speaker 4>do they do with those pegs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're bring them outside and just let </v>

1731
01:20:10.591 --> 01:20:12.800
<v Speaker 4>them go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do with those pigs?</v>

1732
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:15.470
<v Speaker 4>My dog got picked up from Bakersfield.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1733
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:17.610
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people dump dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bakersfield.</v>

1734
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:19.103
<v Speaker 4>Bakersfield.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's open and you can just pull </v>

1735
01:20:20.851 --> 01:20:24.060
<v Speaker 4>off the highway and throw a tennis ball </v>
<v Speaker 4>and keep going.</v>

1736
01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:26.610
<v Speaker 4>It's that terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>

1737
01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:28.650
<v Speaker 4>People are assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They the worst.</v>

1738
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:31.170
<v Speaker 4>That's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really so sad.</v>

1739
01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:34.260
<v Speaker 4>I could not imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean sometimes I get mad at my dog,</v>

1740
01:20:34.261 --> 01:20:36.360
<v Speaker 4>but not to the point of driving it </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>

1741
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:37.383
<v Speaker 4>You hear those stories about someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>checking a bag of puppies out their car </v>

1742
01:20:39.781 --> 01:20:40.710
<v Speaker 4>window and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

1743
01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:41.573
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My dog was a puppy that might've </v>

1744
01:20:42.811 --> 01:20:44.850
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1745
01:20:44.851 --> 01:20:45.684
<v Speaker 4>Just a whole bag of puppies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't do something else that's </v>

1746
01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:48.744
<v Speaker 4>just dumb and lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't walk into a shelter and be </v>

1747
01:20:51.001 --> 01:20:52.320
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's some puppies for you.</v>

1748
01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:53.930
<v Speaker 4>What's worse and dumb and lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

1749
01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:58.170
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucking callous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.730
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you not feel?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get a puppy.</v>

1751
01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:00.690
<v Speaker 4>You don't get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1752
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:01.553
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's how they know you're a </v>

1753
01:21:03.241 --> 01:21:04.140
<v Speaker 4>psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1754
01:21:04.141 --> 01:21:06.120
<v Speaker 4>When you're a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was always the kid that would torture</v>

1755
01:21:06.121 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were concerned about that kid.</v>

1756
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.340
<v Speaker 4>There was a kid in my class who tied a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bird up once.</v>

1757
01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.750
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cat tight.</v>

1758
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:15.630
<v Speaker 4>A cat like spread eagle and went to town</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>

1759
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he went away for awhile that.</v>

1760
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.791
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was weird.</v>

1761
01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:23.110
<v Speaker 4>He was doing weird stuff all the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they.</v>

1762
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.070
<v Speaker 4>Then the cat story got around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

1763
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.420
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's got to.</v>

1764
01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:28.493
<v Speaker 4>Someone's got to do something with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's getting weird because that's </v>

1765
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:32.730
<v Speaker 4>a sign that you'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll hurt human beings.</v>

1766
01:21:32.731 --> 01:21:36.840
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're missing an empathy that makes you</v>

1767
01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:37.830
<v Speaker 4>able to kill things.</v>

1768
01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you were around back </v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

1769
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:42.990
<v Speaker 4>but there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone in life and men want to say like</v>

1770
01:21:42.991 --> 01:21:46.620
<v Speaker 4>the early two thousands maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe like even before that,</v>

1771
01:21:46.621 --> 01:21:50.160
<v Speaker 4>like maybe late nineties someone was </v>
<v Speaker 4>killing cats and Hollywood.</v>

1772
01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:52.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they ever caught the guy</v>

1773
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:53.760
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

1774
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:54.623
<v Speaker 4>no how I said guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm sexist and I know that most </v>

1775
01:21:57.601 --> 01:22:00.050
<v Speaker 4>people that kill cats are fucking guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:03.480
<v Speaker 4>But this guy was killing cats and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting them open and like,</v>

1777
01:22:03.481 --> 01:22:04.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1781
01:22:10.951 --> 01:22:13.890
<v Speaker 4>projects on like spreading them open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holding their guts out.</v>

1782
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.903
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people would come outside and they </v>

1783
01:22:15.391 --> 01:22:16.224
<v Speaker 4>would find their cat not just dead but </v>
<v Speaker 4>dead and surgically cut open and pulled </v>

1784
01:22:20.701 --> 01:22:22.350

01:22:23.461 --> 01:22:25.350
<v Speaker 4>That's a guy you want to feed into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolf.</v>

1787
01:22:25.450 --> 01:22:27.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people were speculating though that</v>

1788
01:22:27.661 --> 01:22:30.510
<v Speaker 4>they were wrong and that it was really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coyotes were getting these dogs.</v>

1789
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.111
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>raccoon that way and they don't eat it.</v>

1793
01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:43.470
<v Speaker 4>They just kill it and gutted it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will raccoons are predators.</v>

1794
01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:44.453
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Record was trying to get into my </v>

1795
01:22:45.091 --> 01:22:45.924
<v Speaker 4>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a raccoon on the other night </v>

1796
01:22:47.191 --> 01:22:48.750
<v Speaker 4>trying to get at my chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1797
01:22:48.751 --> 01:22:50.340
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't even fucking leave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1798
01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.070
<v Speaker 4>There was trying to scare him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1799
01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:53.880
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to scare him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1800
01:22:53.881 --> 01:22:55.650
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you better get the fuck away from here.</v>

1801
01:22:55.651 --> 01:22:56.484
<v Speaker 4>And he just looked at me and I got </v>
<v Speaker 4>closer to him and he got closer to me </v>

1802
01:22:59.870 --> 01:23:01.410
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1803
01:23:01.411 --> 01:23:05.130
<v Speaker 4>I will fucking get a bow and Arrow and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>will kill you if you kill my chickens.</v>

1804
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:05.973
<v Speaker 4>You can't</v>

1805
01:23:06.970 --> 01:23:11.080
<v Speaker 5>because this chickens are like their </v>
<v Speaker 5>pets and their pets that live outside.</v>

1806
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:12.103
<v Speaker 5>Just fucking guy was hanging around by </v>
<v Speaker 5>the cage looking right at the chickens </v>

1807
01:23:14.681 --> 01:23:17.830
<v Speaker 5>trying to figure out how to get at him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he'll figure it out to their smart.</v>

1808
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:20.170
<v Speaker 5>Will he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll come back.</v>

1809
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.650
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1810
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.830
<v Speaker 5>Probably take them out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Allowed to.</v>

1811
01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 5>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have to check what the laws are.</v>

1812
01:23:28.961 --> 01:23:31.420
<v Speaker 5>I think if it's on your property,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he allowed to kill raccoons.</v>

1813
01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:33.260
<v Speaker 5>I bet you're not just allowed to just </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill him.</v>

1814
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:34.160
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1815
01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.740
<v Speaker 5>you got to call someone to have them </v>
<v Speaker 5>trapped them.</v>

1816
01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:36.281
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1817
01:23:36.281 --> 01:23:37.114
<v Speaker 5>I have to make sure he's in a place </v>
<v Speaker 5>where I can actually hit them with an </v>

1818
01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:39.334
<v Speaker 5>Arrow ethically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I have to be able to actually make </v>

1819
01:23:42.761 --> 01:23:44.770
<v Speaker 5>sure there's nothing behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1820
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:45.743
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to miss and have an Arrow </v>
<v Speaker 5>go through my neighbor's window because </v>

1821
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm playing Robin Hood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my backyard with a fucking.</v>

1822
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:53.610
<v Speaker 5>You know what you're doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do,</v>

1823
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.453
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you want to make sure there's </v>

1824
01:23:55.601 --> 01:23:56.434
<v Speaker 5>nothing behind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he would have to be in an area of my </v>

1825
01:23:57.851 --> 01:24:01.600
<v Speaker 5>yard where I would shoot a target or </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's like a back wall,</v>

1826
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:02.463
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like I have to be somewhere where I </v>

1827
01:24:03.431 --> 01:24:04.264
<v Speaker 5>could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1828
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:08.800
<v Speaker 5>But the arrows you used to go after elk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would it go right through a raccoon?</v>

1829
01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:12.070
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1830
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.680
<v Speaker 5>An Lte.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So big.</v>

1831
01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:15.543
<v Speaker 5>It would go right through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The elks are a thousand pound animal </v>

1832
01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:19.780
<v Speaker 5>going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was that?</v>

1833
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:22.260
<v Speaker 5>Elk have these huge bones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1834
01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.370
<v Speaker 5>These arrows just plough right through </v>
<v Speaker 5>those bones.</v>

1835
01:24:24.371 --> 01:24:25.450
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1836
01:24:25.451 --> 01:24:28.420
<v Speaker 5>The only thing they have a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 5>going through is the really thick,</v>

1837
01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:32.380
<v Speaker 5>big ones like shoulder bones scapula </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes give your.</v>

1838
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:35.290
<v Speaker 5>Is Not that powerful like ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1839
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:37.990
<v Speaker 5>they all the time you get what's called </v>
<v Speaker 5>a pass through.</v>

1840
01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:38.973
<v Speaker 5>Where's the Arrow goes completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>through the animal before it even knows </v>

1841
01:24:40.961 --> 01:24:43.450
<v Speaker 5>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She says it happened so quick,</v>

1842
01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:46.120
<v Speaker 5>it's just like one second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have no,</v>

1843
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:46.983
<v Speaker 5>they don't even know what hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's for would rip a raccoon and half </v>

1844
01:24:51.650 --> 01:24:52.483
<v Speaker 5>today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or I'm developing some mechanical </v>

1845
01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:57.550
<v Speaker 5>advantage because the cams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're there on the compound,</v>

1846
01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:58.384
<v Speaker 5>bows around these programs that roll </v>
<v Speaker 5>over and they can generate way more </v>

1847
01:25:00.851 --> 01:25:03.670
<v Speaker 5>forced than just the amount you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>pulling back.</v>

1848
01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.350
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1849
01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:09.190
<v Speaker 5>like if you had like an old school Robin</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hood recurve bow,</v>

1850
01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.600
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those bose,</v>

1851
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.493
<v Speaker 5>the more you pull them back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the harder it is because it's like </v>

1852
01:25:13.930 --> 01:25:14.763
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're stretching and pulling out would </v>

1853
01:25:16.301 --> 01:25:18.580
<v Speaker 5>then let it go in the Arrow it takes </v>
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>

1854
01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.160
<v Speaker 5>But with a compound bow there on these </v>
<v Speaker 5>cams.</v>

1855
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:22.053
<v Speaker 5>So as you pull it back that's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have these thick carbon fiber or </v>

1856
01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:26.104
<v Speaker 5>fiberglass limbs that are pulling back </v>
<v Speaker 5>and holding tremendous amounts of </v>

1857
01:25:30.221 --> 01:25:30.550
<v Speaker 5>energy.</v>

1858
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:32.650
<v Speaker 5>And then you have these cams that </v>
<v Speaker 5>rollover,</v>

1859
01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:35.500
<v Speaker 5>that impart and mechanical advantage on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole system.</v>

1860
01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:36.633
<v Speaker 5>And then as you pull it back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cameras allow it to be light at the </v>

1861
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:40.833
<v Speaker 5>end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if my boat takes 84 pounds to pull </v>

1862
01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:46.330
<v Speaker 5>back at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's only like 10 or 20 percent of that.</v>

1863
01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:47.443
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm holding it with like 20 percent </v>

1864
01:25:49.001 --> 01:25:49.834
<v Speaker 5>of the amount of energy that it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull it back so it's not hard to hold </v>

1865
01:25:51.671 --> 01:25:53.710
<v Speaker 5>onto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when you let the Arrow go,</v>

1866
01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:57.700
<v Speaker 5>it's flying like 290 feet a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Cow.</v>

1867
01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's go get raccoons and the ways of</v>

1868
01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.840
<v Speaker 5>the arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

1869
01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 5>what's 500 grams?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much is 500</v>

1870
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:07.160
<v Speaker 2>grams in a pound?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many grams in an ounce?</v>

1871
01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Five hundred grams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or would that be [inaudible] you say 500</v>

1872
01:26:11.001 --> 01:26:12.350
<v Speaker 2>grams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to make sense.</v>

1873
01:26:12.351 --> 01:26:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Like what is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense to me.</v>

1874
01:26:13.911 --> 01:26:17.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a pound and a half pounds.</v>

1875
01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.610
<v Speaker 2>One point one pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the arrows a pound.</v>

1876
01:26:19.611 --> 01:26:24.611
<v Speaker 2>So one pound of Arrow is going 290 feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>second and it's got a razor blade at the</v>

1877
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:25.784
<v Speaker 2>front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully razorblades designed to </v>

1878
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:32.090
<v Speaker 2>penetrate rib bones with a chisel tip to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1879
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:33.223
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you just threw a hammer at the </v>

1880
01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:37.280
<v Speaker 2>raccoon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might kill it or you might just hurt</v>

1881
01:26:37.281 --> 01:26:39.740
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that's probably even worse.</v>

1882
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:42.920
<v Speaker 2>He wound him and he's walking around </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a broken leg or something.</v>

1883
01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:43.754
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to consider as you're sitting </v>

1884
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:48.260
<v Speaker 2>there talking to that raccoon and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like pretending to come up on you.</v>

1885
01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.360
<v Speaker 2>There's probably two raccoons flanked on</v>
<v Speaker 2>either side.</v>

1886
01:26:52.110 --> 01:26:53.380
<v Speaker 2>The like wolves?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Really you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet they feel confident.</v>

1888
01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:59.540
<v Speaker 2>They're crafty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling him,</v>

1889
01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:00.530
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck off.</v>

1890
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:02.090
<v Speaker 2>And he moved closer to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1891
01:27:02.091 --> 01:27:04.230
<v Speaker 2>don't you see my boys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just looking at me.</v>

1892
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's looking right at me and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1893
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:08.930
<v Speaker 2>he was circling like from my side and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1894
01:27:08.931 --> 01:27:10.670
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's getting closer to me.</v>

1895
01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Holy Cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1896
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Not afraid to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't afraid of me at all.</v>

1897
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean.</v>

1898
01:27:15.951 --> 01:27:16.784
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna I don't want anything bad </v>

1899
01:27:18.471 --> 01:27:20.450
<v Speaker 2>to happen to the raccoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want him to eat my chicken.</v>

1900
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.313
<v Speaker 2>Mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're rolling up the grass and eating </v>

1901
01:27:24.261 --> 01:27:26.120
<v Speaker 2>bugs underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come out my grass,</v>

1902
01:27:26.150 --> 01:27:28.810
<v Speaker 2>which just being rolled over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rolled clever,</v>

1903
01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:31.910
<v Speaker 2>they have little hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got a little busy hands,</v>

1904
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.883
<v Speaker 2>but if you raped me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a weird relationship that we </v>

1905
01:27:35.571 --> 01:27:37.910
<v Speaker 2>have with these things because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>raise him from the time their pets,</v>

1906
01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:40.070
<v Speaker 2>apparently they make these amazing pets.</v>

1907
01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:40.731
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1908
01:27:40.731 --> 01:27:42.170
<v Speaker 2>If you can catch a raccoon when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

1909
01:27:42.171 --> 01:27:44.350
<v Speaker 2>When he's really young and domesticate </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1910
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:45.870
<v Speaker 2>domesticate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1911
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:49.190
<v Speaker 2>the problem with animals becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>survival.</v>

1912
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:50.533
<v Speaker 2>Survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once food is scarce and once they have </v>

1913
01:27:52.371 --> 01:27:53.680
<v Speaker 2>to struggle for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1914
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:58.830
<v Speaker 2>they will adopt a wild feral mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are dangerous animals.</v>

1915
01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Their cats or dogs or they're not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

1916
01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.433
<v Speaker 2>So our ideas about animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for a lot of people that really </v>

1917
01:28:05.721 --> 01:28:06.554
<v Speaker 2>truly love animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about these domesticated </v>

1918
01:28:10.431 --> 01:28:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Weirdo animals that aren't even animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in any way to barely animal.</v>

1919
01:28:14.961 --> 01:28:19.961
<v Speaker 2>Like my friend who worked on a farm was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like grew up with pigs,</v>

1920
01:28:20.181 --> 01:28:21.320
<v Speaker 2>cows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>

1921
01:28:21.321 --> 01:28:23.820
<v Speaker 2>It was just like she had no sympathy for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1922
01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:25.003
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like we have to be kind to all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these animals because they're big and </v>

1923
01:28:28.131 --> 01:28:31.850
<v Speaker 2>dumb and smelly and like she just grew </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with them.</v>

1924
01:28:32.230 --> 01:28:33.410
<v Speaker 2>It was just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1925
01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's kind of fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1926
01:28:34.911 --> 01:28:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like when you're not related to</v>

1927
01:28:37.371 --> 01:28:38.120
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1928
01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:38.953
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is that there's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were held pigs just going crazy </v>

1929
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:46.310
<v Speaker 2>and we had to survive so we had to pave </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and put in Jamba juice,</v>

1930
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:47.203
<v Speaker 2>but I think you need those people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are like the crazy diehard animal </v>

1931
01:28:50.481 --> 01:28:52.130
<v Speaker 2>activist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise there would be nothing.</v>

1932
01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I just want to save the parks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just leave.</v>

1933
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Just leave Yosemite alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1934
01:28:56.511 --> 01:28:57.990
<v Speaker 2>They're going to leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Title,</v>

1935
01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.900
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing anything to the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1936
01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Zinc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>

1937
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he spoke.</v>

1938
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:03.540
<v Speaker 5>He seems pretty decent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1939
01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:07.710
<v Speaker 5>he's also a big supporter of keeping </v>
<v Speaker 5>public lands public and not selling them</v>

1940
01:29:07.711 --> 01:29:09.150
<v Speaker 5>to the states.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

1941
01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:10.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way it works,</v>

1942
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:14.640
<v Speaker 5>it's been explained to me by Steve </v>
<v Speaker 5>Rinella and some other people,</v>

1943
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:15.533
<v Speaker 5>but the way it works is that we have all</v>
<v Speaker 5>this land that's a federal land and you </v>

1944
01:29:18.661 --> 01:29:21.450
<v Speaker 5>can go on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would hunt fish,</v>

1945
01:29:21.451 --> 01:29:22.590
<v Speaker 5>you could camp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could go.</v>

1946
01:29:22.591 --> 01:29:27.390
<v Speaker 5>It's literally our land,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you sell it to the state,</v>

1947
01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:28.853
<v Speaker 5>if the state has a financial burden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll sell it off to private </v>

1948
01:29:31.321 --> 01:29:33.090
<v Speaker 5>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's the danger.</v>

1949
01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.120
<v Speaker 5>The danger is the state will come upon </v>
<v Speaker 5>dire times,</v>

1950
01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.270
<v Speaker 5>it will be forced to sell it off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the federal government,</v>

1951
01:29:39.650 --> 01:29:40.483
<v Speaker 5>they can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so as long as people don't vote to make </v>

1952
01:29:42.541 --> 01:29:44.520
<v Speaker 5>it the property of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're okay.</v>

1953
01:29:44.521 --> 01:29:45.960
<v Speaker 5>It stays in the federal trust.</v>

1954
01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:46.793
<v Speaker 5>If it's in the federal trust guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>manage the way it's been managed since </v>

1955
01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:51.810
<v Speaker 5>Teddy Roosevelt was around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we figured out a way to do it.</v>

1956
01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:52.913
<v Speaker 5>Where as of right now they get leasing </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights for minerals and for cattle and </v>

1957
01:29:58.321 --> 01:29:59.154
<v Speaker 5>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bundy ranch thing was about those </v>

1958
01:30:00.871 --> 01:30:01.810
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been Oregon,</v>

1959
01:30:01.811 --> 01:30:02.644
<v Speaker 5>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1960
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:03.743
<v Speaker 5>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what Pruitt is his big push is to </v>

1961
01:30:05.911 --> 01:30:06.744
<v Speaker 5>make things give all the power back to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the states and that's a gateway that </v>

1962
01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:13.090
<v Speaker 5>gateway to privatization of and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

1963
01:30:13.091 --> 01:30:15.630
<v Speaker 5>There's a hotly contested bill that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the house,</v>

1964
01:30:15.631 --> 01:30:16.464
<v Speaker 5>hr six slash 21 by this Guy Jason </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chaffetz and if you want to hear him </v>

1965
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:26.460
<v Speaker 5>talking to my friend Cameron Hanes on </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cameron's a most recent podcast,</v>

1966
01:30:26.461 --> 01:30:31.461
<v Speaker 5>he flew to dc to talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy with drew her six slash 21,</v>

1967
01:30:32.011 --> 01:30:35.940
<v Speaker 5>which is turning over 3 million acres of</v>
<v Speaker 5>land to the state,</v>

1968
01:30:36.210 --> 01:30:39.930
<v Speaker 5>which state could then do with whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>they want and the problem with that is a</v>

1969
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:43.890
<v Speaker 5>slippery slope and it eventually leads </v>
<v Speaker 5>to privatization of a lot of those lands</v>

1970
01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.980
<v Speaker 5>and especially the people were scared of</v>
<v Speaker 5>that with Republicans in power,</v>

1971
01:30:46.981 --> 01:30:47.814
<v Speaker 5>especially when you see that they lessen</v>
<v Speaker 5>the EPA and all the different things </v>

1972
01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:51.080
<v Speaker 5>they're doing.</v>

1973
01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.160
<v Speaker 5>Like you were just talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>environmental satellites,</v>

1974
01:30:53.161 --> 01:30:54.570
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff scares the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1975
01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:58.470
<v Speaker 5>So then the next one would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got her 6:22,</v>

1976
01:30:58.471 --> 01:30:59.304
<v Speaker 5>which people are also opposed to because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be about turning over the </v>

1977
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:09.300
<v Speaker 5>policing of those lands and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the law enforcement,</v>

1978
01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.273
<v Speaker 5>turning it over to state and taking out </v>
<v Speaker 5>a federal hands bureau of land </v>

1979
01:31:12.631 --> 01:31:16.230
<v Speaker 5>management and stuff like that part for </v>
<v Speaker 5>Park Rangers.</v>

1980
01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.590
<v Speaker 5>They wanted to do two local sheriffs </v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1981
01:31:19.591 --> 01:31:22.110
<v Speaker 5>and then they would allocate money </v>
<v Speaker 5>specifically for that,</v>

1982
01:31:22.111 --> 01:31:24.810
<v Speaker 5>but people think that's a slippery slope</v>
<v Speaker 5>too because they don't know what they're</v>

1983
01:31:24.811 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 5>doing and except it sets it up for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1984
01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:28.230
<v Speaker 5>these people don't know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing,</v>

1985
01:31:28.231 --> 01:31:30.360
<v Speaker 5>we need to go back and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1986
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:31.223
<v Speaker 5>sell this land because if we do that </v>
<v Speaker 5>then we won't be responsible for </v>

1987
01:31:33.361 --> 01:31:36.770
<v Speaker 5>maintaining it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then real private group in this is,</v>

1988
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:38.940
<v Speaker 5>this is what Rinella believes is going </v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

1989
01:31:38.941 --> 01:31:40.910
<v Speaker 5>And the Guy Jason Chaffetz a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1990
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.200
<v Speaker 5>he disagreed and he has his points of </v>
<v Speaker 5>view,</v>

1991
01:31:43.201 --> 01:31:44.400
<v Speaker 5>which I don't know if he's right or </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong,</v>

1992
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:47.090
<v Speaker 5>just leave them alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just just,</v>

1993
01:31:47.370 --> 01:31:48.870
<v Speaker 5>just the parks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just that.</v>

1994
01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:51.240
<v Speaker 5>Can you just leave that alone?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1995
01:31:51.241 --> 01:31:53.040
<v Speaker 5>it's a super rare thing we have and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>really cool.</v>

1996
01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:54.173
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It literally changed my life when I </v>

1997
01:31:56.161 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 5>started in college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going back country with my buddies.</v>

1998
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:00.933
<v Speaker 3>We would just get packs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know what we're doing in the </v>

1999
01:32:02.591 --> 01:32:03.424
<v Speaker 3>beginning we did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We literally were carrying gear like in </v>

2000
01:32:05.981 --> 01:32:06.814
<v Speaker 3>like army sacks and it was just go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the back of Yosemite for a week and a </v>

2001
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:11.703
<v Speaker 3>half and Denver in Montana and Wyoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>and those were life changing </v>

2002
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:18.783
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to sit behind the grand tetons in </v>

2003
01:32:21.131 --> 01:32:23.410
<v Speaker 3>this land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does something to you,</v>

2004
01:32:23.411 --> 01:32:24.244
<v Speaker 3>it changes you and to think that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna sit there and there's going to be </v>

2005
01:32:26.261 --> 01:32:31.261
<v Speaker 3>a back hoe digging something up to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>for some oil that might be under sulfur.</v>

2006
01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.473
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that when those oil things are </v>

2007
01:32:35.251 --> 01:32:40.251
<v Speaker 5>going to weird sounds,</v>

2008
01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:43.390
<v Speaker 3>it's a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sound like,</v>

2009
01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:45.100
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a nightmare.</v>

2010
01:32:45.630 --> 01:32:48.010
<v Speaker 3>He had just leave that alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2011
01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:51.970
<v Speaker 5>it's so crazy that we operate on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>blood of the earth.</v>

2012
01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's really what oil is.</v>

2013
01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:55.293
<v Speaker 5>Oil is like the blood of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the word like these giant mosquitoes </v>

2014
01:32:57.881 --> 01:32:58.714
<v Speaker 5>that are using machines to suck the </v>
<v Speaker 5>blood out of the earth and then what we </v>

2015
01:33:02.051 --> 01:33:02.884
<v Speaker 5>do with that blood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we take it and we pollute the air with </v>

2016
01:33:05.651 --> 01:33:06.580
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we do.</v>

2017
01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:07.414
<v Speaker 5>We burn it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we light it on fire and we have these </v>

2018
01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:14.100
<v Speaker 5>engines that are essentially controlled </v>
<v Speaker 5>explosions contained in steel and inside</v>

2019
01:33:14.771 --> 01:33:15.604
<v Speaker 5>the of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This blood that's boiling and burning </v>

2020
01:33:19.181 --> 01:33:22.450
<v Speaker 5>and fire and explosions are going off </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside the steel box.</v>

2021
01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:24.780
<v Speaker 5>There's iron box and then we're driving </v>
<v Speaker 5>around,</v>

2022
01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:29.510
<v Speaker 5>spitting out our poison gas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The worst thing.</v>

2023
01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:32.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally weird thing and we don't need it</v>

2024
01:33:32.261 --> 01:33:33.250
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2025
01:33:33.251 --> 01:33:36.280
<v Speaker 5>when you go buy a factory like a New </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jersey factory and you see those fucking</v>

2026
01:33:36.281 --> 01:33:40.540
<v Speaker 5>plumes of smoke blown up theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are you allowed to do that?</v>

2027
01:33:40.570 --> 01:33:42.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How are you allowed to do that?</v>

2028
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:44.630
<v Speaker 5>Would you be allowed to blow that right </v>
<v Speaker 5>on a baby's betty?</v>

2029
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:47.950
<v Speaker 3>I was driving down the New Jersey </v>
<v Speaker 3>turnpike in college.</v>

2030
01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I was working for like a fireplace </v>
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>

2031
01:33:50.621 --> 01:33:53.440
<v Speaker 3>We're on the turnpike in the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like August.</v>

2032
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:56.410
<v Speaker 3>No air conditioning in the truck sitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2033
01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:01.420
<v Speaker 3>The whole area air was orange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was</v>

2034
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:03.840
<v Speaker 5>orange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just coming out of those smokes.</v>

2035
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:05.810
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I ever get cancer,</v>

2036
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:10.160
<v Speaker 5>this is the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the day it happened.</v>

2037
01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:11.053
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember these places you would go by </v>

2038
01:34:12.261 --> 01:34:15.230
<v Speaker 5>where it just stunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing.</v>

2039
01:34:15.231 --> 01:34:17.780
<v Speaker 5>My parents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is not just factories,</v>

2040
01:34:17.781 --> 01:34:18.614
<v Speaker 5>it's also farms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say like one of the biggest </v>

2041
01:34:20.391 --> 01:34:23.710
<v Speaker 5>producers of methane pollution and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country is the,</v>

2042
01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:26.840
<v Speaker 5>the cattle industry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I used to,</v>

2043
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:29.550
<v Speaker 5>my parents used to live in Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to live.</v>

2044
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:33.100
<v Speaker 5>Where the fuck were they?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Outside of Wilksberry?</v>

2045
01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:36.350
<v Speaker 5>I forget the name of the town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was in nowhere.</v>

2046
01:34:36.351 --> 01:34:37.161
<v Speaker 5>Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2047
01:34:37.161 --> 01:34:39.730
<v Speaker 5>So you have to drive through what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you think of Pennsylvania,</v>

2048
01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:40.573
<v Speaker 5>think of Philadelphia or Pittsburgh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot between where you're </v>

2049
01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.500
<v Speaker 5>just going 30 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

2050
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:46.363
<v Speaker 5>slam into a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some method of deers darden onto the </v>

2051
01:34:49.281 --> 01:34:51.910
<v Speaker 5>highway and like what in the fuck kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of places this,</v>

2052
01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:53.053
<v Speaker 5>it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My parents had deer in the yard every </v>

2053
01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:56.450
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They hated deer.</v>

2054
01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 5>Deer like roses and like</v>

2055
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.560
<v Speaker 4>get those county fucking animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2056
01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:02.750
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

2057
01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:04.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you would drive down there,</v>

2058
01:35:04.161 --> 01:35:04.994
<v Speaker 4>you would go past these farms and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>smell was so bad you could not believe </v>

2059
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:13.460
<v Speaker 4>that people could live there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The smell,</v>

2060
01:35:13.461 --> 01:35:15.290
<v Speaker 4>because it was in the summer when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>visiting them.</v>

2061
01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.300
<v Speaker 4>It would smell like shit all the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

2062
01:35:17.301 --> 01:35:18.940
<v Speaker 4>But it was hot too.</v>

<v Speaker 4>funky shit smell.</v>

2064
01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.393

<v Speaker 4>was shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Particle air 100 percent.</v>

2066
01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.490
<v Speaker 4>I drove past a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Hormel factory in the summer ones.</v>

2067
01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.200

<v Speaker 4>You're behind these trucks on the way </v>

2069
01:35:36.621 --> 01:35:38.240
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And then you just see in the next giant </v>

2072
01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:48.890
<v Speaker 4>All.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we have so many faces to feed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We are the zombies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the zombies running around needing to </v>

<v Speaker 4>and that's the only way you can have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>city.</v>

2096
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.420
<v Speaker 4>You can't have a city where everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 4>growing things.</v>

2097
01:36:53.421 --> 01:36:54.780
<v Speaker 4>None of food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>

2098
01:36:54.810 --> 01:36:58.010
<v Speaker 4>How could you feel like if if people </v>
<v Speaker 4>were eating meat in particular candidate</v>

2099
01:36:58.460 --> 01:36:59.293
<v Speaker 4>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could you imagine if New York City had </v>

2100
01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:01.850
<v Speaker 4>to be self sustaining?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2102
01:37:03.671 --> 01:37:07.070
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a farm to table steakhouse in New York.</v>

<v Speaker 4>they don't have that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

2106
01:37:17.130 --> 01:37:21.350
<v Speaker 4>You can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn just one restaurant when you go</v>

2107
01:37:21.351 --> 01:37:22.184
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I only go there once or twice a </v>

2108
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:24.650
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but every time I go there and go,</v>

2109
01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:26.780
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot.</v>

2111
01:37:28.461 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 4>this doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at the map yesterday.</v>

2112
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:33.103
<v Speaker 4>It was looking at um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lyme disease centers as lyme disease is </v>

2113
01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:39.290
<v Speaker 4>God damn scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lyme disease map.</v>

2114
01:37:39.710 --> 01:37:40.543
<v Speaker 4>And the lyme disease map is fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's like a giant percentage of </v>

2115
01:37:43.701 --> 01:37:45.620
<v Speaker 4>it is like Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York,</v>

2116
01:37:45.621 --> 01:37:46.610
<v Speaker 4>the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>east coast,</v>

2117
01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:50.930
<v Speaker 4>just overwhelmed with wellmed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know so many people that got it.</v>

2118

<v Speaker 4>Another thing was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like shape of New York.</v>

2119
01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:56.020

2122
01:38:01.571 --> 01:38:03.270
<v Speaker 2>how come you guys don't have more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>one state?</v>

2123
01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:05.580
<v Speaker 2>This is a bunch of different states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta yeah.</v>

2124
01:38:05.581 --> 01:38:06.414
<v Speaker 2>You put a lot of stuff together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like New York State is definitely not </v>

2125
01:38:09.481 --> 01:38:10.550
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2126

<v Speaker 2>Kentucky.</v>

2127
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's some spots like when you drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>into buffalo or something like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>everybody wanted to go dancing?</v>

2291

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a little kid,</v>

2292
01:45:52.161 --> 01:45:57.161
<v Speaker 2>but I remember all of a sudden everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>was dressing like them.</v>

2293
01:45:58.340 --> 01:45:59.780

01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:02.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was 10 years ago and I remember </v>

2296
01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:08.300
<v Speaker 2>people just would go dancing all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2297
01:46:08.630 --> 01:46:09.463
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were wearing like old open </v>

2298
01:46:11.571 --> 01:46:12.404
<v Speaker 2>shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My aunts were living with us at the </v>

2299
01:46:13.341 --> 01:46:16.160
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved from New Jersey or Florida where</v>

2300
01:46:16.161 --> 01:46:18.020
<v Speaker 2>the fuck they were at the time.</v>

2302
01:46:18.810 --> 01:46:19.643

<v Speaker 2>hair like that.</v>

2308
01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:36.530
<v Speaker 2>What a great album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2309
01:46:36.531 --> 01:46:38.570
<v Speaker 2>The bgs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beaches were incredible.</v>

2310
01:46:38.571 --> 01:46:39.331
<v Speaker 2>Credible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should,</v>

2311
01:46:39.331 --> 01:46:42.310
<v Speaker 2>we could play some of it on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>who can sing like that.</v>

2312
01:46:42.850 --> 01:46:45.710
<v Speaker 2>You had to cigarettes on cigarette </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking.</v>

2313
01:46:45.711 --> 01:46:46.544
<v Speaker 2>They were playing records and it was all</v>
<v Speaker 2>about going out and everybody would go </v>

2314
01:46:49.891 --> 01:46:50.400
<v Speaker 2>dancing</v>

2315
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:55.400
<v Speaker 4>and occasionally knife fights and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl accidentally got their product in.</v>

2316
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:57.263
<v Speaker 4>She was cute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she wasn't as hot as the other girl </v>

2317
01:46:58.810 --> 01:47:00.750
<v Speaker 4>when she dropped the condoms and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2318
01:47:00.751 --> 01:47:02.400
<v Speaker 4>what were those?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2319
01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what happened and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at A.</v>

2320
01:47:04.710 --> 01:47:07.380
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe how good she is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to give me lessons.</v>

2321
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:11.670
<v Speaker 4>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're bang and she's not from his side</v>

2322
01:47:11.671 --> 01:47:14.790
<v Speaker 4>of the tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She shouldn't be with them and you know,</v>

2323
01:47:14.791 --> 01:47:15.624
<v Speaker 4>he's kind of flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's got this special something and </v>

2324
01:47:18.781 --> 01:47:21.690
<v Speaker 4>he could dance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could really dance.</v>

2325
01:47:21.691 --> 01:47:22.910
<v Speaker 4>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can really.</v>

2326
01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:24.270
<v Speaker 4>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2327
01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:28.950
<v Speaker 4>You could really dance time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just wanted to dance.</v>

2328
01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.560
<v Speaker 4>No one does that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2329
01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:34.920
<v Speaker 4>just hadn't love songs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were so many love songs.</v>

2330
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:37.410
<v Speaker 4>The Seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just life in general was different.</v>

2331
01:47:37.411 --> 01:47:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Came out of the Vietnam War and stuff.</v>

01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:42.510
<v Speaker 4>He just want it to just chill out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>love a little bit.</v>

2333
01:47:42.810 --> 01:47:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Whereas we're getting overwhelmed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>data and information.</v>

2334
01:47:46.591 --> 01:47:47.424
<v Speaker 4>This becomes more and more ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at like making a movie exactly </v>

2335
01:47:50.041 --> 01:47:54.360
<v Speaker 4>like this today and you could make one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of those like step on up dance movies,</v>

2336
01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.800
<v Speaker 4>but those movies are stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>La La land,</v>

2337
01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:58.673
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the one that almost won the </v>

2338
01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:01.674
<v Speaker 4>award.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a big hit this year and it was a </v>

2339
01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:07.110
<v Speaker 4>musical and there's a lot of dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2340
01:48:07.410 --> 01:48:08.940
<v Speaker 4>did you see it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

2341
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:14.270
<v Speaker 4>How dare you live with girls?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The theater queens.</v>

2342
01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:16.590
<v Speaker 4>We weren't in the theater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were watching it at home.</v>

2343
01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.680
<v Speaker 4>I've got the screener and my kids wanted</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see it.</v>

2344
01:48:19.681 --> 01:48:21.720
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will you listen?</v>

2345
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:22.583
<v Speaker 4>It's an anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was fighting a raccoon and while they </v>

2346
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:28.110
<v Speaker 4>were watching it I was fighting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>raccoon in the face.</v>

2347
01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a rough night.</v>

2348
01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:35.010
<v Speaker 4>But it was this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was kind of this.</v>

2349
01:48:35.011 --> 01:48:37.980
<v Speaker 4>It was kind of dancing and la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>la,</v>

2350
01:48:37.981 --> 01:48:38.814
<v Speaker 4>la.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is this is a dumb movie </v>

2351
01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:43.950
<v Speaker 4>and if you want to make this dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Louis today wouldn't be so interesting.</v>

2352
01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:45.510

<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>

2353
01:48:45.511 --> 01:48:46.344

<v Speaker 4>of stuff so things can't be so a shitty.</v>

01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

2400
01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:01.330
<v Speaker 2>The professor wasn't intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>

2401
01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:04.160
<v Speaker 2>It was like 70 science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2402
01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:05.830
<v Speaker 2>what did they know back then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now he's like,</v>

2403
01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.180
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found a bird.</v>

2404
01:51:07.181 --> 01:51:08.540
<v Speaker 2>You can tell by its wings.</v>

2405
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:14.383
<v Speaker 2>He's not concerned that stupid and bold </v>
<v Speaker 2>it like birds or pray like they get </v>

2406
01:51:19.490 --> 01:51:22.240
<v Speaker 2>eaten constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that burden have any instincts?</v>

2407
01:51:22.241 --> 01:51:23.620
<v Speaker 2>If you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably poisoned.</v>

2408
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:26.860
<v Speaker 2>This was a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hit.</v>

2409
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:29.410
<v Speaker 2>He's runaway hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's rehabbing this bird.</v>

2410
01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:31.053
<v Speaker 2>I think if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gilligan's island was on for far less </v>

2411
01:51:34.211 --> 01:51:36.430
<v Speaker 2>time than we think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2412
01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>

2413
01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it did a few seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many seasons if you.</v>

2414
01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved it when I was a child.</v>

2415
01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Where are we seeing it in reruns for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2416
01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:49.950
<v Speaker 2>60 seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 four slash 67.</v>

2417
01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:51.310
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only a three year.</v>

2418
01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:53.410
<v Speaker 2>A show for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many episodes?</v>

2419
01:51:53.411 --> 01:51:55.300
<v Speaker 2>30 episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2420
01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:58.840
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they did a full season for each year.</v>

2421
01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:01.450
<v Speaker 2>That is pretty short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2422
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:04.870
<v Speaker 2>How many episodes was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say I'm trying to find out.</v>

2423
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Might have been 30 per season.</v>

2424
01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>

2425
01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:11.310
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of storylines usual.</v>

2426
01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:13.403
<v Speaker 2>Usually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually it's 22 because you would get </v>

2427
01:52:15.491 --> 01:52:16.324
<v Speaker 2>13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be your big order and then </v>

2428
01:52:17.291 --> 01:52:19.810
<v Speaker 2>you would get the back nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was the olden times.</v>

2429
01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:21.063
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is real old and times where they </v>

2430
01:52:21.941 --> 01:52:24.670
<v Speaker 2>didn't get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Gilgamesh skipper and everybody,</v>

2431
01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:26.770
<v Speaker 2>they got fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>played these things.</v>

2432
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:29.740
<v Speaker 2>They're playing them somewhere now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so whoever owns them,</v>

2433
01:52:29.741 --> 01:52:32.920
<v Speaker 2>they own it forever and you don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get residuals.</v>

2434
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor Gilligan.</v>

2435
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:37.780
<v Speaker 2>They paved the way though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of shitty shows,</v>

2436
01:52:37.781 --> 01:52:40.510
<v Speaker 2>but they're still make like goofy shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2437
01:52:40.511 --> 01:52:41.344

<v Speaker 2>shows that the kids get raised on like </v>

<v Speaker 4>of giving you jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:31.450
<v Speaker 4>Well they don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only ones are the ones on a cbs like</v>

2459
01:53:31.461 --> 01:53:33.170
<v Speaker 4>big bang and they're the only ones who </v>
<v Speaker 4>still do it.</v>

2460
01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:34.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're the only ones that really </v>

2461
01:53:34.730 --> 01:53:35.563
<v Speaker 4>doesn't do it anymore.</v>

2462

2466
01:53:44.511 --> 01:53:45.344
<v Speaker 4>another season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean that's at least what they're </v>

2467
01:53:46.491 --> 01:53:47.330
<v Speaker 4>looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>

2468
01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.080
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2469
01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:51.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure some people still enjoy it if </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about it right now,</v>

2470
01:53:51.710 --> 01:53:55.040
<v Speaker 4>you know they do work if they're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's funny characters.</v>

2471
01:53:55.041 --> 01:53:58.250
<v Speaker 4>That's a pure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more jokes than the single cameras.</v>

2472
01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:59.600
<v Speaker 4>A lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have done one.</v>

2473
01:53:59.630 --> 01:54:01.110
<v Speaker 4>You did one right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ended up.</v>

2474
01:54:01.730 --> 01:54:04.850
<v Speaker 4>Well you didn't have a sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had six episodes.</v>

2475
01:54:05.190 --> 01:54:06.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

2476
01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.200
<v Speaker 4>It's called come to papa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come to papa.</v>

2477
01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:10.690
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just like a little song.</v>

2478
01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:12.520
<v Speaker 4>NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2479
01:54:12.570 --> 01:54:14.420
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they kill them.</v>

2480
01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:18.410
<v Speaker 4>It was really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad I did it,</v>

2481
01:54:18.411 --> 01:54:19.430
<v Speaker 4>but I would never do it again.</v>

2482
01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:22.310
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't know why work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2483
01:54:22.370 --> 01:54:23.203
<v Speaker 4>It's so much work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great thing to do if you want to </v>

2484
01:54:25.221 --> 01:54:27.770
<v Speaker 4>be an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to do standup as well,</v>

2485
01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:29.683
<v Speaker 4>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not especially not in the beginning </v>

2486
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:34.540
<v Speaker 4>because in the beginning it's ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like 12 hour days every day.</v>

2487
01:54:34.541 --> 01:54:37.010
<v Speaker 4>You're always tired and you're not even </v>
<v Speaker 4>writing on it.</v>

2488
01:54:37.011 --> 01:54:38.400
<v Speaker 4>You're just acting in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you.</v>

2489
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:41.030
<v Speaker 4>The only good thing is sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have time during the day,</v>

2490
01:54:41.031 --> 01:54:43.190
<v Speaker 4>like you might have a couple hours break</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the day.</v>

2491
01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:45.860
<v Speaker 4>You might even be able to go to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might be able to,</v>

2492
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:46.833
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you know you're not in like four </v>

2493
01:54:47.361 --> 01:54:49.550
<v Speaker 4>scenes in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll tell you like,</v>

2494
01:54:49.551 --> 01:54:50.121
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2495
01:54:50.121 --> 01:54:52.500
<v Speaker 4>we don't need you until noon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can bust out of that.</v>

2496
01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:54.410
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you can bust out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2497
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:57.500
<v Speaker 4>But that's not often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you'd be able to write a little bit.</v>

2498
01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:58.880
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2499
01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:00.233
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the guys who are in it and write on </v>

2500
01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:03.980
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then forget it,</v>

2501
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:06.170
<v Speaker 4>and then you're when all the actors go </v>
<v Speaker 4>home,</v>

2502
01:55:06.171 --> 01:55:08.720
<v Speaker 4>then you go start going to work in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>writer's room.</v>

2503
01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:09.613
<v Speaker 4>I never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had lunch with Ray Romano when ray </v>

2504
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:14.240
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was just starting to do.</v>

2505
01:55:14.241 --> 01:55:18.650
<v Speaker 4>Everybody loves Raymond and I was me and</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and Kevin James and we're at Jerry's</v>

2506
01:55:18.651 --> 01:55:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Deli and all Ray Romano.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's obsessed with his show.</v>

2507
01:55:21.941 --> 01:55:22.640
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2508
01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:25.440
<v Speaker 4>how about if I had the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He comes in here,</v>

2509
01:55:25.441 --> 01:55:28.990
<v Speaker 4>he walks in the door and that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how we set up the scene.</v>

2510
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.960
<v Speaker 4>Like he just feels like the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 4>that show had become that monster hit,</v>

2511
01:55:32.961 --> 01:55:33.794
<v Speaker 4>that it was like he was a great comic </v>
<v Speaker 4>who is obsessed with every fiber of his </v>

2512
01:55:38.871 --> 01:55:41.150
<v Speaker 4>being making this a really good show.</v>

01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I worked with him in Queens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York at Jimmy's comedy.</v>

2519
01:55:54.631 --> 01:55:56.700

2521
01:55:57.980 --> 01:55:58.813
<v Speaker 2>never there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an old bowling alley that they </v>

2522
01:55:59.971 --> 01:56:03.240
<v Speaker 2>converted to a comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great spot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a great spot.</v>

2524
01:56:05.070 --> 01:56:05.903
<v Speaker 2>It was a great spot and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the Middle Act and he was the </v>

2525
01:56:09.181 --> 01:56:10.014
<v Speaker 2>headliner x Ray Romano and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>like sitting back after the show was </v>

2526
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:16.860
<v Speaker 2>after I did my car wash and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

2527
01:56:16.861 --> 01:56:17.910
<v Speaker 2>this guy's a good joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2528
01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:22.650
<v Speaker 2>So smooth and it's timing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I ran into him at stand up New York,</v>

2529
01:56:22.651 --> 01:56:24.930
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I did well and then ray walked</v>

2530
01:56:24.931 --> 01:56:26.550
<v Speaker 2>in and went on and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh boy.</v>

2531
01:56:26.610 --> 01:56:29.190
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was freely so smooth.</v>

2532
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:31.223
<v Speaker 2>He was talking theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about somebody actually </v>

2533
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:36.420
<v Speaker 2>saw another guy steal his joke and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>so upset.</v>

2534
01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I just joke about a movie theaters as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go with your guy friends and there's</v>

2535
01:56:41.191 --> 01:56:42.024

<v Speaker 2>I'm not a homo seat going off about the </v>

2536
01:56:45.991 --> 01:56:46.824
<v Speaker 2>insecurity of men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to sit next to each </v>

2537
01:56:48.121 --> 01:56:52.140
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everyone's a hard schedule though.</v>

2538
01:56:52.170 --> 01:56:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long were you doing it?</v>

2539
01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:55.230
<v Speaker 2>That was five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five years?</v>

2540
01:56:55.290 --> 01:56:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it for five seasons.</v>

2541
01:56:57.690 --> 01:56:58.501
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

2542
01:56:58.501 --> 01:57:00.230
<v Speaker 2>That's a good run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2543
01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:01.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

2544
01:57:01.410 --> 01:57:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2545
01:57:02.730 --> 01:57:05.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an interesting thing to do.</v>

2546
01:57:05.281 --> 01:57:08.520
<v Speaker 2>We did 90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 98 or 99 episodes.</v>

2547
01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:10.320
<v Speaker 2>It was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2548
01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2549
01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

2550
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:17.380
<v Speaker 2>it was an awesome thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2551
01:57:17.670 --> 01:57:21.060
<v Speaker 2>But I think that today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as back then,</v>

2552
01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:22.170
<v Speaker 2>that's all there was.</v>

2553
01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:24.960
<v Speaker 2>There was no reality shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no anything else.</v>

2554
01:57:24.961 --> 01:57:26.970
<v Speaker 2>There was a few dramas like cop shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>

2555
01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:29.790
<v Speaker 2>There were multiple nights of all </v>

<v Speaker 2>getting caught murdering people?</v>

2593
01:59:01.871 --> 01:59:06.640
<v Speaker 5>watching autopsy shows on Hbo Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2594
01:59:06.730 --> 01:59:07.563

<v Speaker 5>Michael Baton would catch people in the </v>

2595
01:59:09.341 --> 01:59:10.280
<v Speaker 5>weirdest ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2596
01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:11.560
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird.</v>

2597
01:59:11.610 --> 01:59:13.620
<v Speaker 5>There was one guy who had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a.</v>

2598
01:59:13.630 --> 01:59:14.463
<v Speaker 5>He was a doctor and you have this woman </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he kept her body in his house and </v>

2599
01:59:18.671 --> 01:59:22.870
<v Speaker 5>you bring in crates and crates a perfume</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you had douse her decaying body with</v>

2600
01:59:22.871 --> 01:59:27.871
<v Speaker 5>perfume and he had fast and some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a hole near where her abdomen was.</v>

2601
01:59:28.511 --> 01:59:30.710
<v Speaker 5>When it rotted away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he put something.</v>

2602
01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:31.713
<v Speaker 5>He put something there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>said he manufacturer where he could </v>

2603
01:59:33.941 --> 01:59:35.200
<v Speaker 5>stick his dick into it.</v>

2604
01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:40.090
<v Speaker 5>It put a put a mask on her and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they.</v>

2605
01:59:40.210 --> 01:59:42.700
<v Speaker 5>They were trying to figure out where the</v>
<v Speaker 5>body had gone.</v>

2606
01:59:42.701 --> 01:59:46.030
<v Speaker 5>This guy had taken the body and brought </v>
<v Speaker 5>it to his house.</v>

2607
01:59:47.110 --> 01:59:49.630
<v Speaker 5>It was so intense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so intense.</v>

2608
01:59:49.650 --> 01:59:50.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2609
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:51.550
<v Speaker 5>because I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2610
01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:55.630
<v Speaker 5>this guy wanted this woman so bad that </v>
<v Speaker 5>once she died he couldn't help himself.</v>

2611
01:59:55.631 --> 01:59:58.400
<v Speaker 5>He had to like keep her body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I have her,</v>

2612
01:59:58.630 --> 02:00:00.400
<v Speaker 5>now she's with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what I've always needed.</v>

2613
02:00:00.401 --> 02:00:01.234
<v Speaker 5>Let me just keep covering her up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfume and he would get rock hard and </v>

2614
02:00:03.971 --> 02:00:08.840
<v Speaker 5>climb on top of her rotting bag of bones</v>
<v Speaker 5>and meat and stick his dick anywhere.</v>

2615
02:00:08.910 --> 02:00:09.743
<v Speaker 5>She's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's probably at like a surgical mask </v>

2616
02:00:11.111 --> 02:00:11.944
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like stinking of rotten meat and </v>

2617
02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:16.930
<v Speaker 5>perfume.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would much rather watch Bob's burgers.</v>

2618
02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:19.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a little graphic folks.</v>

2619
02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:22.030
<v Speaker 5>You got really into it and it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>disturbing.</v>

2620
02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:23.013
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just see this is why these shows are </v>

2621
02:00:24.311 --> 02:00:27.250
<v Speaker 5>popular because it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2622
02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:29.350
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even watch that anymore.</v>

2623
02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.233
<v Speaker 5>Me Describing that and putting that </v>
<v Speaker 5>visual image to everybody's mind is </v>

2624
02:00:33.761 --> 02:00:37.030
<v Speaker 5>nothing like watching and getting that </v>
<v Speaker 5>visual image.</v>

2625
02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:40.210
<v Speaker 5>It's so much more innocent and less </v>
<v Speaker 5>guilty.</v>

2626
02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:41.253
<v Speaker 5>It's worse because now you made us a </v>

<v Speaker 4>bring me to the resort.</v>

2741
02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:03.620
<v Speaker 4>It's always just on the outskirts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these places.</v>

2742
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:05.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that was going on.</v>

2743
02:06:05.730 --> 02:06:06.563
<v Speaker 4>Acapulco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember our member during the drug war </v>

2744
02:06:09.201 --> 02:06:10.430
<v Speaker 4>when it was at its worst.</v>

2745
02:06:10.570 --> 02:06:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexican drug war was going on down there</v>

2746
02:06:13.281 --> 02:06:16.100
<v Speaker 4>and Aco Poco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of people got shot like tourists</v>

2747
02:06:16.101 --> 02:06:18.050
<v Speaker 4>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's now.</v>

2748
02:06:18.051 --> 02:06:18.884
<v Speaker 4>It's serious stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My parents went to Mexico when I was a </v>

2749
02:06:20.661 --> 02:06:25.520
<v Speaker 4>boy and brought back a shirt that's was </v>
<v Speaker 4>a Mexican guy and his sombreros said Aco</v>

2750
02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Poco and his bow tie said gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2751
02:06:29.410 --> 02:06:31.460
<v Speaker 4>that was my cool shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tim.</v>

2752
02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:33.320
<v Speaker 4>Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Papa knows where the good weed.</v>

2753
02:06:34.230 --> 02:06:34.540
<v Speaker 4>My.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2754
02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:37.080
<v Speaker 4>They would grow weed and Aco Poco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're called Acapulco gold.</v>

2755
02:06:37.130 --> 02:06:38.780
<v Speaker 4>Acapulco gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the shit.</v>

2756
02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:39.673
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2757
02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:41.120
<v Speaker 4>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the shirt.</v>

2758
02:06:41.210 --> 02:06:43.850
<v Speaker 4>I never had any of that stuff mean I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't smoke weed.</v>

2759
02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:46.000
<v Speaker 4>I bet it wasn't that great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2760
02:06:46.050 --> 02:06:48.380
<v Speaker 4>compared to this science we had no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no way.</v>

2761
02:06:49.220 --> 02:06:51.080
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn Wizards.</v>

2762
02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:53.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get uncomfortable in those places.</v>

2763
02:06:53.630 --> 02:06:54.463
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always wanted to be like the cool </v>

2764
02:06:56.061 --> 02:06:56.894
<v Speaker 4>photo journalists who kind of hangs out </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the people and there's doesn't </v>

2765
02:06:59.601 --> 02:07:01.760
<v Speaker 4>worry and just goes to their house and </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a meal.</v>

2766
02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:06.080
<v Speaker 4>But I'm totally on guard and nervous </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm in places like that,</v>

2767
02:07:06.230 --> 02:07:08.690
<v Speaker 4>especially with my family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2768
02:07:08.691 --> 02:07:11.390
<v Speaker 4>if you're in a real poor area and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2769
02:07:11.391 --> 02:07:14.070
<v Speaker 4>you're a bunch of wealthy white people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are fucking vacation.</v>

2770
02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:14.953
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird because the area needs it </v>

2771
02:07:16.730 --> 02:07:18.500
<v Speaker 4>because it provides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2772
02:07:18.501 --> 02:07:21.770
<v Speaker 4>like your revenue comes in and it helps </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and it gives people that live their</v>

2773
02:07:21.771 --> 02:07:23.990
<v Speaker 4>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's again,</v>

2774
02:07:23.991 --> 02:07:27.390
<v Speaker 4>like we were talking about going outside</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Albany,</v>

2775
02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:29.000
<v Speaker 4>you just drive two hours outside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Albany,</v>

2776
02:07:29.001 --> 02:07:31.220
<v Speaker 4>like where the fuck am I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

2777
02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:33.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But probably more extreme.</v>

2778
02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:34.431
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2779
02:07:34.431 --> 02:07:36.460
<v Speaker 4>Because there's not as many cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2780
02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:37.353
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2781
02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:39.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And being a cop is a different thing.</v>

2782
02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:43.520
<v Speaker 4>If everybody's corrupt right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Narcos.</v>

2783
02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:46.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woo Hoo.</v>

2784
02:07:46.150 --> 02:07:49.000
<v Speaker 4>God down 10 sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good show.</v>

2785
02:07:49.810 --> 02:07:50.643
<v Speaker 4>Narcos is scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pablo Escobar lived a fucking crazy </v>

2786
02:07:53.591 --> 02:07:54.130
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2787
02:07:54.130 --> 02:07:58.480
<v Speaker 4>Crazy late with his pot belly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did he do that?</v>

2788
02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:02.680
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how far some people get </v>
<v Speaker 4>with insane behavior.</v>

2789
02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:04.360
<v Speaker 4>It really is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

2790
02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:06.960
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy was just completely like,</v>

2791
02:08:06.970 --> 02:08:08.170
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make this work.</v>

2792
02:08:08.290 --> 02:08:10.100
<v Speaker 4>This is how my head works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2793
02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:13.420
<v Speaker 4>He was blown up government buildings and</v>
<v Speaker 4>airplanes.</v>

2794
02:08:14.110 --> 02:08:15.760
<v Speaker 4>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Built his own jail,</v>

2795
02:08:16.090 --> 02:08:16.923
<v Speaker 4>put himself in a jail and partying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're bringing them bitches and </v>

2796
02:08:19.441 --> 02:08:22.600
<v Speaker 4>playing pool and handing out cash to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2797
02:08:22.601 --> 02:08:24.280
<v Speaker 4>He was a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then afterwards he's like,</v>

2798
02:08:24.281 --> 02:08:25.690
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm tired of being this fucking place.</v>

2799
02:08:25.870 --> 02:08:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Murdered a guy in the jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lead them to hit in the head with a bat.</v>

2800
02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he's like,</v>

2801
02:08:30.421 --> 02:08:32.350
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this place it just getting out.</v>

<v Speaker 4>crazy running down the path,</v>

2803
02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:38.673
<v Speaker 4>but this is all real things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane when you think how far that </v>

2804
02:08:43.811 --> 02:08:45.280
<v Speaker 4>is from how you live your life.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Was there ever an article about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like was there ever like an interview </v>

2813
02:09:07.481 --> 02:09:09.430
<v Speaker 4>with him and he wrote it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sean Penn wrote it.</v>

2814
02:09:09.431 --> 02:09:10.780
<v Speaker 4>I never read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read it.</v>

2815
02:09:10.781 --> 02:09:12.940
<v Speaker 4>I remember the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the thing going down,</v>

2816
02:09:12.941 --> 02:09:14.620
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just my weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was weird.</v>

2817
02:09:14.770 --> 02:09:15.603
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand like what he was </v>

2818
02:09:16.631 --> 02:09:19.060
<v Speaker 4>trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like why he decided to do that.</v>

2819
02:09:19.061 --> 02:09:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Look at that fucking picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That picture is insane.</v>

2820
02:09:21.881 --> 02:09:23.330
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did he do it?</v>

2821
02:09:23.331 --> 02:09:24.820
<v Speaker 4>Because he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So wild man.</v>

2822
02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:28.690
<v Speaker 4>Sean Penn is a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he really is.</v>

2823
02:09:28.690 --> 02:09:29.523
<v Speaker 4>You have to be to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had one opinion of him before that I </v>

2824
02:09:32.291 --> 02:09:33.850
<v Speaker 4>had a different opinion of him after </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

2825
02:09:34.150 --> 02:09:36.250
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he actually did that.</v>

2826
02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:39.250
<v Speaker 4>He actually went there into the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2827
02:09:39.251 --> 02:09:40.084
<v Speaker 4>Then they put a hood over him or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>blindfold and remember how it all </v>

2828
02:09:42.461 --> 02:09:43.294
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there was some girl who was friends </v>

2829
02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:45.573
<v Speaker 4>with El Chapo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>El Chapo was probably Dick Dicker way </v>

2830
02:09:48.191 --> 02:09:50.710
<v Speaker 4>the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same Way.</v>

2831
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:51.783
<v Speaker 4>Pablo Escobar quarter shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So El Chapo was probably stuff in that </v>

2832
02:09:56.081 --> 02:09:58.600
<v Speaker 4>girl too and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to give me Sean Penn.</v>

2833
02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:00.010
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're exactly right.</v>

2834
02:10:00.011 --> 02:10:02.740
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2835
02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:04.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll do it.</v>

2836
02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:06.090
<v Speaker 4>He'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll do it.</v>

2837

02:14:02.580 --> 02:14:05.700
<v Speaker 5>I left her and her friends there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just bolted as soon as I got off stage</v>

2932

2933
02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:11.340
<v Speaker 5>And back then when you drove,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were gone?</v>

2934
02:14:11.850 --> 02:14:13.650
<v Speaker 5>Nobody had a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

02:14:13.651 --> 02:14:16.210
<v Speaker 5>You could escape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can literally get escape.</v>

2936
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:17.143
<v Speaker 5>I actually had a cell phone before that </v>
<v Speaker 5>but I couldn't afford it anymore so I </v>

2937
02:14:19.681 --> 02:14:20.190
<v Speaker 5>didn't have a.</v>

2938
02:14:20.190 --> 02:14:24.360
<v Speaker 5>So I had a car phone for awhile in like </v>
<v Speaker 5>1989 nights.</v>

2939
02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:27.210
<v Speaker 5>This was like a year or two after that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like 90 or 91,</v>

2940
02:14:27.211 --> 02:14:28.880
<v Speaker 5>so I don't even think anybody could get </v>
<v Speaker 5>ahold of me.</v>

2941
02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:31.080
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could just get in the car and go.</v>

2942
02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:32.410
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one could find you.</v>

2945
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:36.103
<v Speaker 5>like one of the things I really like </v>
<v Speaker 5>about these yellow legal pads is that </v>

2946
02:14:39.241 --> 02:14:40.074
<v Speaker 5>these yellow legal pads to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have like this different feel to </v>

2947
02:14:44.371 --> 02:14:45.204
<v Speaker 5>them because that's what I would write </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the directions to places that I </v>

2948
02:14:48.871 --> 02:14:51.360
<v Speaker 5>would go to because there was no </v>
<v Speaker 5>internet back then.</v>

2949
02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:54.450
<v Speaker 5>So you would get lIke a gig from like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the comedy connection,</v>

2950
02:14:54.451 --> 02:14:56.010
<v Speaker 5>like Billy Downs would be booking a </v>
<v Speaker 5>room.</v>

2951
02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:58.560
<v Speaker 5>You call him up and he would give you </v>
<v Speaker 5>the directions,</v>

2952
02:14:58.561 --> 02:14:58.800
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2953
02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:00.870

2955
02:15:02.290 --> 02:15:04.550

<v Speaker 5>I would write it all on these legal,</v>

2956
02:15:04.620 --> 02:15:05.453
<v Speaker 5>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a yellow legal pads and then I would </v>

2957
02:15:07.321 --> 02:15:10.590
<v Speaker 5>write down the address and directions </v>
<v Speaker 5>how to get there,</v>

2958
02:15:10.591 --> 02:15:11.424
<v Speaker 5>what to look for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a third bar and that's the one </v>

2959

2969
02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:42.320
<v Speaker 5>I met this pretty girl once in Maine.</v>

2970
02:15:42.580 --> 02:15:46.840
<v Speaker 5>She was really pretty and she had a nose</v>
<v Speaker 5>rings should,</v>

2971
02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:47.693
<v Speaker 5>I think she had two nose rings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Had a ring in each nostril and like </v>

2972
02:15:50.581 --> 02:15:51.650
<v Speaker 5>she's still pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2973
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.823
<v Speaker 5>pretty that word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was what it was and we were </v>

2974
02:15:54.391 --> 02:15:56.850
<v Speaker 5>hanging out and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just too heavy.</v>

2975
02:15:57.050 --> 02:15:57.883
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sHe was so trapped in this weird main </v>

2976
02:16:00.001 --> 02:16:00.930
<v Speaker 5>town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2977
02:16:00.931 --> 02:16:02.110
<v Speaker 5>And I was only,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2978
02:16:02.250 --> 02:16:05.520
<v Speaker 5>21 and I was seeing like where her path </v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

2979
02:16:05.710 --> 02:16:09.840
<v Speaker 5>where my path was and like I didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to have sex with her because of it.</v>

2980
02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:11.373
<v Speaker 5>It was so heavy because you knew that </v>
<v Speaker 5>she was trapped in this like weird land </v>

2981
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:16.570
<v Speaker 5>and if you had sex with her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2982
02:16:16.590 --> 02:16:18.600
<v Speaker 5>some turnaround with her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>RigHt?</v>

2983
02:16:18.670 --> 02:16:20.660
<v Speaker 5>Or I would get her out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just like,</v>

2984
02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:23.580
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing to me was like so </v>
<v Speaker 5>bonkers.</v>

2985
02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:24.883
<v Speaker 5>So like she was describing her life and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the different winter or family that </v>

2986
02:16:28.471 --> 02:16:29.830
<v Speaker 5>were abusive and</v>

2987
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:31.780
<v Speaker 2>all this craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2988
02:16:31.810 --> 02:16:33.820
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so heavy.</v>

2989
02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:37.780
<v Speaker 2>And I realized if you just buy an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate roll,</v>

2990
02:16:37.781 --> 02:16:38.614
<v Speaker 2>the dice were literally shat out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom's vagina in the forest and there's </v>

2991
02:16:44.051 --> 02:16:48.670
<v Speaker 2>some weird bar that everybody in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>forest town gravitates to.</v>

2992
02:16:48.671 --> 02:16:51.640
<v Speaker 2>And then some industrious person from </v>
<v Speaker 2>boston decides,</v>

2993
02:16:51.641 --> 02:16:52.474
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to book that bar and we </v>

2994
02:16:53.681 --> 02:16:54.514
<v Speaker 2>would drive up to those places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet these poor poor people that were </v>

2995
02:16:57.630 --> 02:16:59.590
<v Speaker 2>trapped there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are cool as fuck.</v>

2996
02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them have Great family.</v>

2997
02:17:02.691 --> 02:17:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Some of them love it up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2998
02:17:04.330 --> 02:17:06.810
<v Speaker 2>but not this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This girl was.</v>

2999
02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget like her just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3000
02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:09.873
<v Speaker 2>especially at that age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine like being a girl in that </v>

3001
02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:14.220
<v Speaker 2>situation where it's just like these </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

3002
02:17:14.290 --> 02:17:19.290
<v Speaker 2>one of these guys in this pack is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the one or some new dude just came</v>

3003
02:17:22.121 --> 02:17:26.260
<v Speaker 2>out of town from out of town and tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes at least now with social media,</v>

3004
02:17:26.261 --> 02:17:27.094
<v Speaker 2>you see that there's options out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you see other people living lives </v>

3005
02:17:30.311 --> 02:17:34.810
<v Speaker 2>in different places so you can at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're aware that there's another.</v>

3006
02:17:35.010 --> 02:17:35.843
<v Speaker 2>There's somewhere I could go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well also you are also aware that </v>

3007
02:17:38.381 --> 02:17:39.214
<v Speaker 2>there's other communities where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could probably thrive and you can make </v>

3008
02:17:41.741 --> 02:17:45.610
<v Speaker 2>friends online and you can get really </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out where's a good place to live.</v>

3009
02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:48.760
<v Speaker 2>You can get a job online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could save up your money.</v>

3010
02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:50.680
<v Speaker 2>You can go somewhere and you can get out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of there.</v>

3011
02:17:51.460 --> 02:17:52.293
<v Speaker 2>This is what I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you remember that there were kids </v>

3012
02:17:55.391 --> 02:17:59.020
<v Speaker 2>like working places all the time when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were growing up?</v>

3013
02:17:59.140 --> 02:17:59.973
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From the time I was like 14 kids were </v>

3014
02:18:01.390 --> 02:18:02.590
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would like you.</v>

3015
02:18:02.650 --> 02:18:06.040
<v Speaker 2>There'd be kids working at the diner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're big kids work at the pizza place</v>

3016
02:18:06.041 --> 02:18:08.140
<v Speaker 2>at the ice cream shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the gas station,</v>

3017
02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:11.680
<v Speaker 2>you don't see kids working anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

3018
02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:15.610
<v Speaker 2>What happened is are the jobs just taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>by adults who need them?</v>

3019
02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:16.593
<v Speaker 2>God damn man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come over here and steal our children's </v>

3020
02:18:18.650 --> 02:18:19.360
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

3021
02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:20.193
<v Speaker 2>I used to be a good job for children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that just where we grow up that </v>

3022
02:18:22.571 --> 02:18:24.250
<v Speaker 2>there's no kids working?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like are they doing it?</v>

3023

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in California is always white </v>

3024
02:18:25.841 --> 02:18:29.170
<v Speaker 2>people out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I grew up in New Jersey and we were,</v>

3025
02:18:29.171 --> 02:18:31.480
<v Speaker 2>we weren't that far from the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See again,</v>

<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3027
02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:34.173
<v Speaker 2>These kids today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what we're talking about </v>

<v Speaker 2>We're not judging them.</v>

3030
02:18:41.051 --> 02:18:42.640
<v Speaker 2>It's in their forties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking about high school,</v>

3031
02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:43.493
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there used to be kids working </v>

3032
02:18:45.161 --> 02:18:46.570
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're speculating now.</v>

3033
02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:47.583
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get upset if you're speculating </v>

3034
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:51.663
<v Speaker 2>such that somebody did on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>some comic dude got mad at me because I </v>

3035

<v Speaker 2>not even gay.</v>

3038
02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:05.020
<v Speaker 2>People were talking about specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>incidences that have been in the news,</v>

3039
02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:06.273
<v Speaker 2>like milo yiannopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having that a thing fall out from under </v>

3040
02:19:09.671 --> 02:19:12.760
<v Speaker 2>him because he said like it's acceptable</v>
<v Speaker 2>for older man who was essentially saying</v>

3041
02:19:12.761 --> 02:19:16.090
<v Speaker 2>it's acceptable for older men to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex with her 13 year old boy,</v>

3042
02:19:16.091 --> 02:19:19.270
<v Speaker 2>and they were talking about george to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kai who talked about that as well.</v>

3043
02:19:19.271 --> 02:19:20.104
<v Speaker 2>It Happened to him at a summer camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some older dude had sort of busted </v>

3044
02:19:24.221 --> 02:19:27.770
<v Speaker 2>moves on him and ran him off and shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was pleasurable and he enjoyed it</v>

3045
02:19:27.771 --> 02:19:29.570
<v Speaker 2>and we were talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3046
02:19:29.571 --> 02:19:31.340
<v Speaker 2>it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an intense,</v>

3047
02:19:31.341 --> 02:19:32.530
<v Speaker 2>intense subject.</v>

<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

3049
02:19:33.921 --> 02:19:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Without a gay perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to speak about it.</v>

3050
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:39.283
<v Speaker 2>Figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was attention whoring and </v>

3051
02:19:40.611 --> 02:19:44.090
<v Speaker 2>maybe he just saw the green light to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset and so he went for it.</v>

3052
02:19:44.170 --> 02:19:46.190
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't rash comic.</v>

3055
02:19:51.621 --> 02:19:54.800

<v Speaker 2>apologized and I apologized.</v>

3057
02:19:55.701 --> 02:19:56.534
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those things where it's </v>

3058
02:19:56.871 --> 02:20:00.230
<v Speaker 2>like people do get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to feel like they're allowed to get</v>

3059
02:20:00.231 --> 02:20:01.064
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about something that you </v>

3060
02:20:02.091 --> 02:20:03.890
<v Speaker 2>don't have experienced death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Even if it's something to discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous,</v>

3062
02:20:06.261 --> 02:20:07.094
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to try and figure it </v>

3063
02:20:08.151 --> 02:20:08.541
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

02:20:08.541 --> 02:20:09.374
<v Speaker 2>that's what learning is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what learning is coming from </v>

3065
02:20:11.181 --> 02:20:12.014
<v Speaker 2>something that you don't know anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and asking questions and having a </v>

3066
02:20:15.381 --> 02:20:16.214
<v Speaker 2>discussion about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>THat's when you know something's </v>

3067
02:20:17.241 --> 02:20:18.074
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're not allowed to talk about </v>

3068
02:20:19.071 --> 02:20:19.904
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even allowed to talk about </v>

3069
02:20:20.721 --> 02:20:22.700
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't discuss even politely,</v>

3070
02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:26.090
<v Speaker 2>respectfully talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then your thing is bullshit.</v>

3071
02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:28.070
<v Speaker 2>You know you have no argument.</v>

3072
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:29.660
<v Speaker 2>You have no side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3073
02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:31.010
<v Speaker 2>there's always this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3074
02:20:31.011 --> 02:20:31.844
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a big thing in certain circles </v>

3075
02:20:33.711 --> 02:20:36.540
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to disenfranchise people </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you,</v>

3076
02:20:36.610 --> 02:20:39.050
<v Speaker 2>you hear it when it comes to gender and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

<v Speaker 2>things that male feminists love to say.</v>

3079
02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just shut up and listen to the women.</v>

3080
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:49.430
<v Speaker 2>You need to shut up and listen to women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3081
02:20:49.431 --> 02:20:51.920
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never shut up because even if you're</v>

3082
02:20:51.921 --> 02:20:52.754
<v Speaker 2>being respectful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone says something and you would </v>

3083
02:20:54.260 --> 02:20:56.300
<v Speaker 2>like them to clarify or are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>confused?</v>

3084
02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:57.313
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you have some information that </v>
<v Speaker 2>may they might not be aware of that </v>

3085
02:20:59.451 --> 02:21:00.284
<v Speaker 2>might change their thoughts on things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like being engaged in the conversation </v>

3086
02:21:03.591 --> 02:21:06.920
<v Speaker 2>with someone is not necessarily a </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative thing,</v>

3087
02:21:06.921 --> 02:21:09.740
<v Speaker 2>but everyone is assuming that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a girl,</v>

3088
02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't talk about girl issues.</v>

3089
02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:13.660
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't hAve any perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3090
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:15.470
<v Speaker 2>If you're not a part of the world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

3091
02:21:15.471 --> 02:21:17.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're not a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're gay,</v>

3092
02:21:17.361 --> 02:21:18.690
<v Speaker 2>if you're not straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not,</v>

3093
02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:21.260
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying when you're asking</v>

3094
02:21:21.261 --> 02:21:23.440
<v Speaker 2>people not to talk about is you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying it.</v>

3095
02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:25.340
<v Speaker 2>It'd be better if this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole,</v>

3096
02:21:25.370 --> 02:21:26.203
<v Speaker 2>your whole part of the population stays </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorant of what's going on and we just </v>

3097
02:21:29.241 --> 02:21:31.130
<v Speaker 2>listened and we just stay where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

3098
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3099
02:21:32.330 --> 02:21:33.920
<v Speaker 2>You just listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>

3100
02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:36.590
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's completely insaNe.</v>

3101
02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:37.453
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a power thing is what it is and </v>

3102
02:21:38.811 --> 02:21:41.330
<v Speaker 2>when certain things developed too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>social clout,</v>

3103
02:21:41.390 --> 02:21:44.840
<v Speaker 2>when subjects hit hit this critical mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>of social clout,</v>

3104
02:21:44.970 --> 02:21:47.450
<v Speaker 2>but like when the whole bruce jenner </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing was going on,</v>

3105
02:21:47.451 --> 02:21:48.284
<v Speaker 2>when you had to say that she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and you had to say that you </v>

3106
02:21:49.671 --> 02:21:51.250
<v Speaker 2>accepted it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to say it was amazing.</v>

3107
02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a fucking kardashians.</v>

3108
02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Just a little while ago is a ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane family.</v>

02:21:56.890 --> 02:21:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't this guy like the dumbest one on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show?</v>

<v Speaker 2>attention to kill her.</v>

3113
02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:06.433
<v Speaker 2>If we don't Pay attention to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we pay attention to this whole </v>

3114
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:10.910
<v Speaker 2>gender change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to give.</v>

3115
02:22:10.930 --> 02:22:11.763
<v Speaker 2>It's going to make you give a pass to </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that other behavior and it'll make </v>

<v Speaker 4>We go one way and we go the other way.</v>

3174
02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:28.973
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like we got tired of people </v>

3175
02:24:30.571 --> 02:24:32.250
<v Speaker 4>going so hard politically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct,</v>

3176
02:24:32.251 --> 02:24:35.850
<v Speaker 4>but you see how there's progress now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we were talking about school.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean that's good.</v>

3179
02:24:39.061 --> 02:24:39.894
<v Speaker 4>People would walk into our schools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids will walk up to other kids that </v>

3180
02:24:43.111 --> 02:24:43.944

<v Speaker 4>it still exists.</v>

3184
02:24:51.931 --> 02:24:55.560
<v Speaker 4>It just exists less and not when your </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids go to school in comparison to where</v>

3185

<v Speaker 4>you go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a bit of a unified and you're </v>

02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:01.380
<v Speaker 4>hanging out in compton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you see some bad shit in school.</v>

3187
02:25:02.850 --> 02:25:03.683
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is probably some bad shit's still </v>

3188
02:25:04.981 --> 02:25:05.814
<v Speaker 4>going on in a lot of schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of kids are getting bullied and </v>

3189
02:25:08.161 --> 02:25:10.080
<v Speaker 4>people understand the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that now.</v>

3190
02:25:10.081 --> 02:25:12.830
<v Speaker 4>like you're scared to go to class cause </v>

<v Speaker 4>Someone's beat new.</v>

3192

<v Speaker 4>wasn't bullying,</v>

3193
02:25:17.551 --> 02:25:18.384
<v Speaker 4>it was just life back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't bullying and it did ruin </v>

3194
02:25:20.371 --> 02:25:22.290
<v Speaker 4>people's lives did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nobody called it out.</v>

3195
02:25:22.291 --> 02:25:24.170
<v Speaker 4>No adult would you out with it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3196
02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:25.093
<v Speaker 3>it's just the way it went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to learn how to take care of </v>

3197
02:25:26.471 --> 02:25:29.290
<v Speaker 3>shit and everyone was being bullied by </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody else.</v>

3198
02:25:29.291 --> 02:25:30.880
<v Speaker 3>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was dog eat dog.</v>

3199
02:25:30.910 --> 02:25:33.110
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3200
02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:35.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that you're right.</v>

3201
02:25:35.771 --> 02:25:36.604
<v Speaker 3>I mean the politically correct thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's swings that way and you're left </v>

3202
02:25:40.151 --> 02:25:40.984
<v Speaker 3>with some good stuff and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjusted and then it goes too far and </v>

3203
02:25:43.331 --> 02:25:44.164
<v Speaker 3>you start to go after things that don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>affect a lot of people and then people </v>

3204
02:25:47.321 --> 02:25:48.730
<v Speaker 3>get fed up by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well those.</v>

3205
02:25:48.731 --> 02:25:49.564
<v Speaker 3>The thing is those people that goes too </v>
<v Speaker 3>far that go too far with all that </v>

3206
02:25:52.361 --> 02:25:53.380
<v Speaker 3>politically correct stuff,</v>

3207
02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:54.233
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're almost always emotionally </v>

3208
02:25:55.581 --> 02:25:56.414
<v Speaker 5>unbalanced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so given enough time they will reveal </v>

3209
02:25:59.691 --> 02:26:04.691
<v Speaker 5>themselves to be either crazy or power </v>
<v Speaker 5>hungry or like really like a big part of</v>

3210
02:26:08.241 --> 02:26:12.350
<v Speaker 5>that whole social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 5>movement is really about shaming people,</v>

3211
02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:15.560
<v Speaker 5>like expressing anger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>attacking people,</v>

3212
02:26:15.770 --> 02:26:18.800
<v Speaker 5>gaining power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>punching people that disagree with you,</v>

3213
02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:20.630
<v Speaker 5>like punch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fascist punch,</v>

3214
02:26:20.690 --> 02:26:24.330
<v Speaker 5>punch nazis like being aggressive about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and that somehow or another,</v>

3215
02:26:24.331 --> 02:26:25.164
<v Speaker 5>this is a good thing as if because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're so delusional and so detached </v>

3216
02:26:27.891 --> 02:26:31.260
<v Speaker 5>from real physical violence that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have this idea that you just going to go</v>

3217
02:26:31.261 --> 02:26:32.990
<v Speaker 5>out there and push these people and take</v>
<v Speaker 5>it back.</v>

3218
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:34.490
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna show up with guns.</v>

3219
02:26:34.491 --> 02:26:37.970
<v Speaker 5>You fuck like this is how wars get </v>
<v Speaker 5>started to escalate.</v>

3220
02:26:37.971 --> 02:26:39.620
<v Speaker 5>You try to control people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You pushed too far.</v>

3221
02:26:39.621 --> 02:26:42.440
<v Speaker 5>You're not kind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead you're shaming people.</v>

3222
02:26:42.441 --> 02:26:44.780
<v Speaker 5>You're creating bad feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggression,</v>

3223
02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:48.560
<v Speaker 5>like they've got this juvenile idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>about confrontation,</v>

3224
02:26:48.890 --> 02:26:51.260
<v Speaker 5>that it just goes out there and it never</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes back to you.</v>

3225
02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:52.730
<v Speaker 5>It always comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good luck.</v>

3226
02:26:52.820 --> 02:26:54.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it comes back.</v>

3227
02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:55.250
<v Speaker 5>It comes back.</v>

3228
02:26:55.250 --> 02:26:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's.</v>

3229
02:26:57.100 --> 02:26:57.933
<v Speaker 3>It's people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think striving for kindness is a good </v>

3230
02:27:02.661 --> 02:27:06.140
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think that trying to be nice to</v>

3231
02:27:06.170 --> 02:27:08.390
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

3232
02:27:08.450 --> 02:27:09.283
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then if you're trying to be so nice </v>

3233
02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:16.070
<v Speaker 3>that now you're the aggressor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've gone over the side of the cliff</v>

3234
02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:19.080
<v Speaker 5>100 percent and that's what happens when</v>
<v Speaker 5>people do that.</v>

3235
02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:20.053
<v Speaker 5>So far left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go around the fucking equator and </v>

3236
02:27:22.350 --> 02:27:24.510
<v Speaker 5>they wind up on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3237
02:27:24.530 --> 02:27:25.830
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just happens.</v>

3238
02:27:25.860 --> 02:27:28.380
<v Speaker 5>You become a fascist to fight off the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fascists,</v>

3239
02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:29.853
<v Speaker 5>so it happens round and round.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go and the people that are </v>

3240
02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:33.893
<v Speaker 5>effective with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that's happening is </v>

3241
02:27:36.211 --> 02:27:38.880
<v Speaker 5>they outdo each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They feed off of each other,</v>

3242
02:27:38.881 --> 02:27:39.714
<v Speaker 5>they play to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're playing to the room and they </v>

3243
02:27:42.451 --> 02:27:43.284
<v Speaker 5>ramp it up so they know that there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people that agree with them and </v>

3244
02:27:45.321 --> 02:27:47.970
<v Speaker 5>then they see how far they can take it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the further you could tell you like,</v>

3245
02:27:47.971 --> 02:27:49.920
<v Speaker 5>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mike is so hardcore.</v>

3246
02:27:50.130 --> 02:27:53.310
<v Speaker 5>Holly's not as hardcore as paul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paul's out there struggling.</v>

3247
02:27:53.311 --> 02:27:55.950
<v Speaker 5>He's in Guatemala right noW.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3248
02:27:55.951 --> 02:27:56.784
<v Speaker 5>It's like they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They Pushed so hard like this social </v>

3249
02:27:59.551 --> 02:28:03.000
<v Speaker 5>justice front that they're doing it for </v>
<v Speaker 5>each other and imPressing each Other and</v>

3250
02:28:03.001 --> 02:28:03.834
<v Speaker 5>impressing these communities of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that get together and then somewhere </v>

3251
02:28:05.881 --> 02:28:09.060
<v Speaker 5>along the line they forget how cruel </v>
<v Speaker 5>there being two people who disagree with</v>

3252
02:28:09.061 --> 02:28:09.720
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3253
02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:10.553
<v Speaker 5>they're being vicious and nasty and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to shame people and write blogs </v>

3254
02:28:13.081 --> 02:28:13.914
<v Speaker 5>about them and attack them and videos </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they do not realize that while </v>

3255
02:28:16.411 --> 02:28:19.950
<v Speaker 5>they're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just setting a process in motion</v>

3256
02:28:19.951 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 5>that is unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You putting out</v>

3257
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.340
<v Speaker 2>negative and it'S going to come back and</v>

3258
02:28:25.341 --> 02:28:28.100
<v Speaker 2>you're going to feel personally the </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects of all that stuff.</v>

3259
02:28:28.450 --> 02:28:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're shitting on people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ruined someone's life with some hate</v>

3260
02:28:31.221 --> 02:28:32.054
<v Speaker 2>blog or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And tHen that person attacks you and </v>

3261
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:34.880
<v Speaker 2>toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3262
02:28:34.881 --> 02:28:36.500
<v Speaker 2>And people are gonna know that you did </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3263
02:28:36.501 --> 02:28:38.330
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to want to come back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3264
02:28:38.850 --> 02:28:39.683
<v Speaker 2>They're going to feel that you put </v>
<v Speaker 2>something out there so they're going to </v>

3265
02:28:41.121 --> 02:28:43.230
<v Speaker 2>root for something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come back your way or oh,</v>

3266
02:28:43.370 --> 02:28:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how people survive that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

3267
02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:46.313
<v Speaker 2>I really game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's their game because they don't </v>

3268
02:28:47.601 --> 02:28:50.440
<v Speaker 2>have a real physical conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conflict comes.</v>

3269
02:28:50.450 --> 02:28:51.283
<v Speaker 2>Then they probably came from families </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they like to fight a lot and it </v>

3270
02:28:54.201 --> 02:28:55.034
<v Speaker 2>was like they're kind of built for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no sensitivity to get </v>

3271
02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:01.920
<v Speaker 2>programmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3272
02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:04.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a strange existence.</v>

3273
02:29:04.310 --> 02:29:05.143
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've all been in arguments before and </v>

3274
02:29:06.141 --> 02:29:06.974
<v Speaker 2>we've all had that feeling after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's over that gross feeling of the </v>

3275
02:29:09.141 --> 02:29:10.190
<v Speaker 2>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling like,</v>

3276
02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:12.410
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate this.</v>

3277
02:29:12.411 --> 02:29:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Like how did I get sucked into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>

3278
02:29:14.061 --> 02:29:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Like what did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why did I react like that?</v>

3279
02:29:15.981 --> 02:29:16.814
<v Speaker 2>Like why am I here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's people that have that </v>

3280
02:29:19.101 --> 02:29:22.310
<v Speaker 2>feeling and they're constantly trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>avoid those situations,</v>

3281
02:29:22.311 --> 02:29:25.190
<v Speaker 2>but they still come up occasionally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they feel even woRse when they come</v>

3282
02:29:25.191 --> 02:29:26.270
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

3283
02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:31.540
<v Speaker 2>conflict today feels so much worse than </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict felt like 10 or 15 or 20 years.</v>

3284
02:29:32.331 --> 02:29:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Have you personally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3285
02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:37.220
<v Speaker 2>When I'm involved in conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so much more sensitive to how people</v>

3286
02:29:37.221 --> 02:29:39.950
<v Speaker 2>feel than I used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty years ago.</v>

3287
02:29:40.250 --> 02:29:45.090
<v Speaker 2>If I was in an altercation with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to go fuck yourself by.</v>

3288
02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd walk away like it was nothing really</v>

3289
02:29:47.241 --> 02:29:49.820
<v Speaker 2>think twice and then as I got older I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>always think like,</v>

3290
02:29:49.821 --> 02:29:51.410
<v Speaker 2>how am I coming off to that person?</v>

3291
02:29:51.410 --> 02:29:52.243
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe I could've handled it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe tHe communication if I was </v>

3292
02:29:55.341 --> 02:29:57.380
<v Speaker 2>just more calm initially they would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been more calm.</v>

3293
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:58.880
<v Speaker 2>We could have laughed it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3294
02:29:58.940 --> 02:29:59.773
<v Speaker 2>like a kid in the pool hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the kid in the pool hall was not a </v>

3295
02:30:02.511 --> 02:30:04.790
<v Speaker 2>threat and he was a young kid and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

3296
02:30:04.791 --> 02:30:07.100
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get hurt.</v>

3297
02:30:07.130 --> 02:30:07.963
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

3298
02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:09.740
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3299
02:30:09.741 --> 02:30:11.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I get older,</v>

3300
02:30:11.131 --> 02:30:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is revelation that a lot of what we</v>

3301
02:30:14.721 --> 02:30:15.554
<v Speaker 2>get into a lot of these confrontations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and arguments and disputes and a lot of </v>

3302
02:30:18.621 --> 02:30:23.300
<v Speaker 2>negativity is avoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not worth,</v>

3303
02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:25.700
<v Speaker 2>it's not worth the attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3304
02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:26.740
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

3305
02:30:27.500 --> 02:30:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I always felt that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a little more zen.</v>

3306
02:30:30.291 --> 02:30:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Like to let it go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3307
02:30:34.250 --> 02:30:35.083
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3308
02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:36.770
<v Speaker 2>my buddy was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3309
02:30:36.771 --> 02:30:38.210
<v Speaker 2>you're more like codependent.</v>

3310
02:30:38.770 --> 02:30:42.390
<v Speaker 2>You are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are a,</v>

3311
02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:43.753
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to make other people happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a point where it's a negative for </v>

3312
02:30:47.661 --> 02:30:48.494
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3313
02:30:49.150 --> 02:30:49.983
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3314
02:30:50.010 --> 02:30:50.843
<v Speaker 2>Know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you were talking about you </v>

3315
02:30:51.711 --> 02:30:54.500
<v Speaker 2>being 20 and just being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fuck yourself.</v>

3316
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:59.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like I never had that and I always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always a little envious of that.</v>

3317
02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:00.433
<v Speaker 2>I had too much of it like being on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road and somebody cuts you off and it's </v>

3318
02:31:02.871 --> 02:31:04.640
<v Speaker 2>just like you feel so bad and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3319
02:31:04.641 --> 02:31:08.630
<v Speaker 2>if someone gives you the finger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I carry that with me all day.</v>

3320
02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:12.260
<v Speaker 2>It's such an upsetting integrate set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would still get me wrong.</v>

3321
02:31:12.261 --> 02:31:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I was totally upset all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3322
02:31:14.330 --> 02:31:16.180
<v Speaker 2>But I wouldn't feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3323
02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like that fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what I would that.</v>

3324
02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3325
02:31:20.590 --> 02:31:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't feel bad that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

3326
02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:23.610
<v Speaker 2>I could avoid that confrontation.</v>

3327
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:24.503
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't feel that I'd have a stupid </v>

3328
02:31:25.771 --> 02:31:26.604
<v Speaker 2>way of looking at it where instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like being philosophical about my own </v>

3329
02:31:29.551 --> 02:31:30.384
<v Speaker 2>role in having this take place in my own</v>
<v Speaker 2>inability to manage the communication </v>

3330
02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:37.171
<v Speaker 2>header.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3331
02:31:37.171 --> 02:31:39.930
<v Speaker 2>How To handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything else,</v>

3332
02:31:39.931 --> 02:31:42.000
<v Speaker 2>like you get better at catching balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3333
02:31:42.001 --> 02:31:44.310
<v Speaker 2>like some dudes are way better at </v>
<v Speaker 2>catching a baseball than you.</v>

3334
02:31:44.400 --> 02:31:45.233
<v Speaker 2>RigHt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you go out and try to catch that </v>

3335
02:31:46.531 --> 02:31:48.030
<v Speaker 2>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't be caught.</v>

3336
02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:48.893
<v Speaker 2>it was out of my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile someone who's way better </v>

3337
02:31:50.971 --> 02:31:53.300
<v Speaker 2>at it but just snatch it out of the sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>

3338
02:31:53.301 --> 02:31:54.840
<v Speaker 2>I got this easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy out.</v>

3339
02:31:55.200 --> 02:31:55.980
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3340
02:31:55.980 --> 02:31:59.400
<v Speaker 2>It's essentially the same thing when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're communicating with people.</v>

3341
02:31:59.401 --> 02:32:01.890
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not good at communicating,</v>

3342
02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:05.700
<v Speaker 2>you have these awkward moments and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are as much responsible for someone else</v>

3343
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:08.280
<v Speaker 2>getting paid even if they did something </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

3344
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:13.440
<v Speaker 2>like you're as much as responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it going bad as they are in a way.</v>

3345
02:32:13.470 --> 02:32:14.303
<v Speaker 2>IT's a difficult thing because you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes be very aware of it and very </v>

3346
02:32:18.181 --> 02:32:21.570
<v Speaker 2>sensitive to people and try and make </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything cool.</v>

3347
02:32:21.571 --> 02:32:24.280
<v Speaker 2>And then somebody says something or does</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and you're,</v>

3348
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:26.760
<v Speaker 2>there's something inside us that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>flares.</v>

3349
02:32:27.330 --> 02:32:29.690
<v Speaker 2>It just like specially with booze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3350
02:32:29.691 --> 02:32:31.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

3351
02:32:31.111 --> 02:32:33.640
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3352
02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:36.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it catches you by surprise.</v>

3353
02:32:36.511 --> 02:32:37.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3354
02:32:37.561 --> 02:32:39.420
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is when it catches me by</v>

3355
02:32:39.421 --> 02:32:40.470
<v Speaker 2>surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always like,</v>

3356
02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:41.333
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mouth is moving faster than my brain </v>

3357
02:32:42.511 --> 02:32:43.344
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying aggressive things and I </v>

3358
02:32:44.821 --> 02:32:45.430
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

3359
02:32:45.430 --> 02:32:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Haven't thought this through like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do do that and then you're like,</v>

3360
02:32:49.081 --> 02:32:50.640
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better be poised for violence.</v>

3361
02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:51.593
<v Speaker 2>So you're look like your brain's on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the communication skills are even </v>

3362
02:32:54.541 --> 02:32:56.700
<v Speaker 2>worse because I'm not really thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about communicating.</v>

3363
02:32:56.701 --> 02:33:00.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking if I feel like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving in my direction too quickly,</v>

3364
02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:02.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to act right now.</v>

3365
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:04.440
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in this stage.</v>

3366
02:33:04.470 --> 02:33:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was.</v>

3367
02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:07.973
<v Speaker 2>Do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know violence or you know </v>

3368
02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:13.710
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have been trained in it.</v>

3369
02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:16.380
<v Speaker 2>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've lived aspect of it.</v>

3370
02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Does it put you more on alert physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're out in the world?</v>

3371
02:33:21.780 --> 02:33:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people get punched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people geT punched with.</v>

3372
02:33:24.271 --> 02:33:25.104
<v Speaker 2>I didn't expect to get punched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people get sucker punched and </v>

3373
02:33:26.641 --> 02:33:28.410
<v Speaker 2>knocked unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking terrifying,</v>

3374
02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:30.870
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying people do do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the consequences of it.</v>

3375
02:33:30.990 --> 02:33:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so do you.</v>

3376
02:33:31.950 --> 02:33:34.260
<v Speaker 2>When you walk around the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you more,</v>

3377
02:33:34.290 --> 02:33:35.123
<v Speaker 2>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you looking for violence more than </v>

3378
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:39.350
<v Speaker 2>someone that wasn't trained?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to,</v>

3379
02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:41.220
<v Speaker 2>not to engage in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>

3380
02:33:41.610 --> 02:33:42.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3381
02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:43.950
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you aware of it happening?</v>

3382
02:33:44.010 --> 02:33:44.843
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely try to be aware when </v>

3383
02:33:46.561 --> 02:33:47.394
<v Speaker 2>there's men and they're drinking when </v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever there's men and they're </v>

3384
02:33:49.681 --> 02:33:52.740
<v Speaker 2>drinking or if you're in a poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood like we were talking about,</v>

3385
02:33:52.741 --> 02:33:53.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being outside of a resort in Mexico and </v>

3386
02:33:54.811 --> 02:33:56.640
<v Speaker 2>you see the military and you realize why</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>

3387
02:33:57.900 --> 02:33:58.733
<v Speaker 2>I jusT think that for the most part </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're safe like almost everywhere and </v>

3388
02:34:02.050 --> 02:34:04.410
<v Speaker 2>it's being a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a woman,</v>

3389
02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:07.310
<v Speaker 2>be a very different thing because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have two things going on yet.</v>

3390
02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:08.153
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of the People around you </v>

3391
02:34:09.151 --> 02:34:09.984
<v Speaker 2>that are men can overpower you and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people that are men </v>

3392
02:34:13.650 --> 02:34:15.330
<v Speaker 2>might fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3393
02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're already active woman in</v>

3394
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:20.590
<v Speaker 4>particular and you're walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a nice body,</v>

3395
02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:22.940
<v Speaker 4>like you're juSt a god damn asshole </v>
<v Speaker 4>target.</v>

3396
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:23.823
<v Speaker 4>It's everywhere you go click.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He put those yoga pants on those </v>

3397
02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:28.040
<v Speaker 4>lululemon's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3398
02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:30.830
<v Speaker 4>it was a fuchsia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>

3399
02:34:30.890 --> 02:34:31.723
<v Speaker 4>pants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you got that big juicy ass and </v>

3400
02:34:32.741 --> 02:34:36.040
<v Speaker 4>you're walking down the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get bombed on.</v>

3401
02:34:36.041 --> 02:34:38.890
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you saying when I'd wear it?</v>

3402
02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:40.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>juicy guy.</v>

3403
02:34:40.700 --> 02:34:41.550
<v Speaker 4>But when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3404
02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:43.380
<v Speaker 4>when you're not in those heightened </v>
<v Speaker 4>situations,</v>

3405
02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:45.400
<v Speaker 4>you're not thinking no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3406
02:34:45.430 --> 02:34:49.330
<v Speaker 4>But when people get inflamed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get super nervous because it's similar</v>

3407
02:34:49.331 --> 02:34:51.190
<v Speaker 4>to the gun thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's similar to like,</v>

3408
02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:51.970
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a gun.</v>

3409
02:34:51.970 --> 02:34:52.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a gun,</v>

3410
02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:55.990
<v Speaker 4>you're living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your reaLity is different.</v>

3411
02:34:56.010 --> 02:34:56.860
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3412
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:58.023
<v Speaker 4>Well there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's also like when people get </v>

3413
02:35:00.071 --> 02:35:03.310
<v Speaker 4>upset and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about things ramping up,</v>

3414
02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:04.333
<v Speaker 4>like the momentum of them gets away from</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and then you're saying things you </v>

3415
02:35:06.921 --> 02:35:07.780
<v Speaker 4>haven't thought out yet.</v>

3416
02:35:08.170 --> 02:35:09.003
<v Speaker 4>People make actions that they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought out yet and you're a reasonable </v>

3417
02:35:11.051 --> 02:35:11.680
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

3418
02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:15.930
<v Speaker 4>I tried to be pretty reasonable and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying this and I'm admitting to the</v>

3419
02:35:15.931 --> 02:35:18.460
<v Speaker 4>emotions can get carried away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when there's danger involved,</v>

3420
02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:21.250
<v Speaker 4>I can get to saying things that I should</v>
<v Speaker 4>have probably never said.</v>

3421
02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:23.370
<v Speaker 4>It just got away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about an idiot,</v>

3422
02:35:23.890 --> 02:35:26.710
<v Speaker 4>what an idiot who had been abused as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>child would have been an idiot,</v>

3423
02:35:26.711 --> 02:35:30.850
<v Speaker 4>has been beaten and abused as a child </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it is almost like feels like they're</v>

3424
02:35:30.860 --> 02:35:31.693
<v Speaker 4>at such a deficit of love and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>owed so much violence that they're very </v>

3425
02:35:35.231 --> 02:35:38.530
<v Speaker 4>caPable of inflicting violence on random</v>
<v Speaker 4>people for no reason.</v>

3426
02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:41.050
<v Speaker 4>It's just how they're programmed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3427
02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:44.680
<v Speaker 4>and that goes back to what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about earlier about real leaders.</v>

3428
02:35:44.681 --> 02:35:47.320
<v Speaker 4>If we had a real leaders in real </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction in this country,</v>

3429
02:35:47.350 --> 02:35:47.890
<v Speaker 4>we would.</v>

3430
02:35:47.890 --> 02:35:48.723
<v Speaker 4>We would fix the educational system in </v>
<v Speaker 4>these Bad neighborhoods and spent a ton </v>

3431
02:35:51.581 --> 02:35:52.414
<v Speaker 4>of money to try to rejuvenate these </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods or have some sort of a </v>

3432
02:35:54.371 --> 02:35:55.204
<v Speaker 4>plan to eliminate crime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to reduce crime rather to to make it </v>

3433
02:35:59.930 --> 02:36:00.763
<v Speaker 4>safer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you got to start with kids when </v>

3434
02:36:01.871 --> 02:36:03.040
<v Speaker 4>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really young.</v>

3435
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:04.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait until they're 16,</v>

3436
02:36:04.940 --> 02:36:07.870
<v Speaker 4>17 and go in and just throw some money </v>
<v Speaker 4>at it and expect it to.</v>

3437
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.823
<v Speaker 4>You've got to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to just dump tons of money </v>

3438
02:36:10.601 --> 02:36:11.081
<v Speaker 4>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3439
02:36:11.081 --> 02:36:13.480
<v Speaker 4>the private sector is the thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>

3440
02:36:13.481 --> 02:36:17.510
<v Speaker 4>does that more than more than a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what they,</v>

3483
02:38:08.061 --> 02:38:08.894
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the question of whether you should </v>

3484
02:38:09.621 --> 02:38:11.310
<v Speaker 3>give or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

02:38:13.950 --> 02:38:17.480
<v Speaker 3>what is he going to use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The money on him is just for drugs or is</v>

3487
02:38:17.481 --> 02:38:18.230
<v Speaker 3>it a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

3488
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:20.030

<v Speaker 3>better?</v>

3489
02:38:20.031 --> 02:38:20.864
<v Speaker 3>All these kinds of questions come up </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you pass someone who's asking you </v>

3490
02:38:23.031 --> 02:38:23.864
<v Speaker 3>for money and he said there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never anything wrong with </v>

3491
02:38:26.301 --> 02:38:28.350
<v Speaker 3>giving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

3492
02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:32.270
<v Speaker 3>there's never anything wrong with giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>to someone who's asking.</v>

3493
02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:35.060
<v Speaker 3>They're asking for some reason as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human being,</v>

3494
02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:39.470
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought that's great,</v>

3495
02:38:40.250 --> 02:38:41.083
<v Speaker 3>and then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when he's not taking into </v>

3496
02:38:42.061 --> 02:38:44.480
<v Speaker 3>consideration is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then what about the guy?</v>

3497
02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Then you walk a block and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>another guy and another guy,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you still have to go through all </v>

3502
02:38:58.671 --> 02:38:59.540
<v Speaker 3>that stuff in your head.</v>

<v Speaker 5>One after the other.</v>

3510
02:39:09.990 --> 02:39:12.050
<v Speaker 5>Those homeless dudes backpacks.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like you are not winning anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You fuck?</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's totally shitty,</v>

3515
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:24.650
<v Speaker 5>but it's also broken people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3516

<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who raised that guy will a guaranteed.</v>

3517
02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:27.833
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't some really awesome dad like </v>
<v Speaker 5>tom papa and some really nice </v>

3518
02:39:30.861 --> 02:39:31.694
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood and everybody loved them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's a lot of family and friends </v>

3519
02:39:34.221 --> 02:39:37.400
<v Speaker 5>around and know our times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hard tImes.</v>

02:39:37.401 --> 02:39:39.380
<v Speaker 5>My heart fucked up times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3521
02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:42.470
<v Speaker 5>it's hard being a person even if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just normal,</v>

3522
02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:45.320
<v Speaker 5>if you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to keep it together.</v>

3523
02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:46.220
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3524
02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:48.200
<v Speaker 5>It's hard fOr everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For all of us,</v>

3525
02:39:48.201 --> 02:39:49.034
<v Speaker 5>and it's hard for a bunch of reasons and</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the biggest reasons is that the </v>

3526
02:39:51.621 --> 02:39:55.190
<v Speaker 5>reality of being a human being does not </v>
<v Speaker 5>make sense.</v>

3527
02:39:55.550 --> 02:39:56.960
<v Speaker 5>It just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3528
02:39:57.620 --> 02:39:58.850
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need a job to do.</v>

3529
02:39:58.851 --> 02:40:01.400
<v Speaker 5>You gotta keep yourself busy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the only way.</v>

3530
02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:04.190
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

02:40:04.191 --> 02:40:07.670
<v Speaker 5>here I am clinging to this balls.</v>

02:40:11.811 --> 02:40:14.490
<v Speaker 5>first show up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of first things toys</v>

3535
02:40:14.940 --> 02:40:15.773
<v Speaker 4>are like kitchen sets and and work </v>
<v Speaker 4>benches and [inaudible] and they just </v>

3536
02:40:19.801 --> 02:40:20.634
<v Speaker 4>gravitate to it and want to do a project</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they make together fake breakfast </v>

3537
02:40:23.971 --> 02:40:26.880
<v Speaker 4>and bring it over to you and give it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

3538
02:40:27.090 --> 02:40:29.850
<v Speaker 4>They want to be busy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want your head to do something.</v>

3539
02:40:29.851 --> 02:40:33.360
<v Speaker 4>You have to feed your brain some </v>
<v Speaker 4>activity.</v>

3540
02:40:34.350 --> 02:40:36.840
<v Speaker 4>You really do tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no dangerous.</v>

3541
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:38.520
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to be something big </v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

3542
02:40:38.580 --> 02:40:42.810
<v Speaker 4>It could be something small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just be into something and that's why tv</v>

3543
02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:43.653
<v Speaker 4>so dangerous because you can live your </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole life without ever developing any </v>

3544
02:40:45.631 --> 02:40:46.464
<v Speaker 4>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3545
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:49.380
<v Speaker 4>Going from show to show to show and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>mind is now occupiEd,</v>

3546
02:40:49.890 --> 02:40:53.190
<v Speaker 4>occupied on some other actions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>extraneous actions.</v>

3547
02:40:53.191 --> 02:40:55.200
<v Speaker 4>They're not even in your immediate </v>
<v Speaker 4>vicinity.</v>

3548
02:40:55.230 --> 02:40:56.063
<v Speaker 4>It's a positive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When people ask me if I've seen this </v>

3549
02:40:59.581 --> 02:41:03.090
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>

<v Speaker 4>my life and then it'll be like.</v>

3607
02:43:37.930 --> 02:43:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Remember when chuck woolery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not chuck woolery,</v>

3608
02:43:40.181 --> 02:43:41.014
<v Speaker 4>chuck barris barris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did a whole movie about him being </v>

3609
02:43:42.881 --> 02:43:44.720
<v Speaker 4>an assassin for the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was part of the guy.</v>

3610
02:43:44.770 --> 02:43:47.950
<v Speaker 4>He was the host of the gong show and </v>
<v Speaker 4>killing people for the cia.</v>

3611
02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:49.173
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to like have most of real </v>

3612
02:43:51.311 --> 02:43:52.144
<v Speaker 4>stories of like my childhood intertwined</v>
<v Speaker 4>with like murderers and werewolves and </v>

3613
02:43:55.451 --> 02:43:59.350
<v Speaker 4>fucking that's a great call it truth or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

3614
02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:00.890
<v Speaker 4>You see this fucking latest shit.</v>

3615
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:05.950
<v Speaker 5>A wiki leaks saying that the cia has </v>
<v Speaker 5>access to all of our phones vault.</v>

3616
02:44:06.191 --> 02:44:08.080
<v Speaker 5>Seven leaks today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3617
02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:11.180
<v Speaker 5>What is looked through it yet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pull up a full.</v>

3618
02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:12.053
<v Speaker 5>Because edward snowden was saying that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not whether or not they can access </v>

3619
02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:19.240
<v Speaker 5>where they have access to your ink </v>
<v Speaker 5>encrypted shit.</v>

3620
02:44:19.241 --> 02:44:22.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like they've hacked android and </v>
<v Speaker 5>ios,</v>

3621
02:44:22.470 --> 02:44:25.570
<v Speaker 5>like they get into android and ios.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're some.</v>

3622
02:44:25.930 --> 02:44:26.763
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're saying they use it for </v>

3623
02:44:27.521 --> 02:44:28.430
<v Speaker 5>espionage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3624
02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:29.793
<v Speaker 5>So like if the russians are here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want to find out what they're up </v>

3625
02:44:31.410 --> 02:44:32.243
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could hack into their phone and get </v>

3626
02:44:32.741 --> 02:44:34.690
<v Speaker 5>their data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are doing it too.</v>

3627
02:44:34.830 --> 02:44:37.660
<v Speaker 5>So like if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if somehow or another we stopped the cia</v>

3628
02:44:37.661 --> 02:44:38.650
<v Speaker 5>from doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3629
02:44:38.710 --> 02:44:41.170
<v Speaker 5>Here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you want.</v>

3630
02:44:41.171 --> 02:44:44.260
<v Speaker 5>If Russia is doing it in china's doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and North Korea and then all of a sudden</v>

3631
02:44:44.261 --> 02:44:48.250
<v Speaker 5>the cia can't do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't they at a disadvantage?</v>

3632
02:44:48.370 --> 02:44:49.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3633
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.823
<v Speaker 5>That seems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems like we don't know what the </v>

3634
02:44:52.451 --> 02:44:53.284
<v Speaker 5>fuck we're doing psa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This incorrectly implies the cia hack </v>

3635
02:44:56.201 --> 02:44:57.670
<v Speaker 5>those apps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these apps,</v>

3636
02:44:57.880 --> 02:44:58.713
<v Speaker 5>ford slash encryption,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the doc show ils ford slash android </v>

3637
02:45:01.601 --> 02:45:04.120
<v Speaker 5>or what got hacked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a much bigger problem,</v>

3638
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:06.790
<v Speaker 5>so still working through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>publications,</v>

3639
02:45:06.791 --> 02:45:11.380
<v Speaker 5>but what wikileaks has here is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>genuinely is genuinely a big deal,</v>

3640
02:45:11.410 --> 02:45:13.330
<v Speaker 5>looks authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>

3641
02:45:13.331 --> 02:45:14.164
<v Speaker 5>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like we have to be very careful </v>

3642
02:45:18.700 --> 02:45:19.533
<v Speaker 5>if other people are doing things right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like if you talk to people in the </v>

3643
02:45:23.411 --> 02:45:25.780
<v Speaker 5>intelligence community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't talk to a lot of them,</v>

3644
02:45:25.781 --> 02:45:26.614
<v Speaker 5>but I have talked to a few,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well they will tell you is you have to </v>

3645
02:45:29.051 --> 02:45:29.884
<v Speaker 5>understand that what the majority of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>american public thinks is going on in </v>

3646
02:45:33.101 --> 02:45:37.900
<v Speaker 5>the world and what their motives are and</v>
<v Speaker 5>what kind of espionage and fucking dirty</v>

3647
02:45:37.901 --> 02:45:42.180
<v Speaker 5>tricks take place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's way worse than you think it is your</v>

3648
02:45:42.190 --> 02:45:43.023
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lucky that you're sheltered from all </v>

3649
02:45:43.781 --> 02:45:47.800
<v Speaker 5>this stuff and they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some bad fucking things that are</v>

3650
02:45:47.801 --> 02:45:48.634
<v Speaker 5>going on in the world and one of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>things is what you're looking at in </v>

3651
02:45:52.781 --> 02:45:57.190
<v Speaker 5>Russia right now is like an emerging </v>
<v Speaker 5>superpower run by a dictator.</v>

3652
02:45:57.250 --> 02:45:58.083
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And anybody who opposes him winds up </v>

3653
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:00.910
<v Speaker 5>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3654
02:46:00.970 --> 02:46:04.350
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen all those fucking russians</v>
<v Speaker 5>that have wound up dead recently?</v>

3655
02:46:04.351 --> 02:46:06.470
<v Speaker 5>They're attached to these leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There.</v>

3656
02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:08.080
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what's the latest count?</v>

3657
02:46:08.110 --> 02:46:10.070
<v Speaker 5>Six yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it.</v>

3658
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:12.800
<v Speaker 4>I think there was a shepherd one </v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday that died.</v>

3659
02:46:12.830 --> 02:46:13.663
<v Speaker 4>Just taking people out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People would just mysteriously getting </v>

3660
02:46:15.771 --> 02:46:17.270
<v Speaker 4>whacked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're billionaires.</v>

3661
02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:18.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3662
02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:20.210
<v Speaker 4>They're whack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And billionaires.</v>

3663
02:46:20.230 --> 02:46:21.980
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just whacking people,</v>

3664
02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:23.840
<v Speaker 4>you know too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3665
02:46:24.050 --> 02:46:26.210
<v Speaker 4>Come fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go fishing.</v>

3666
02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.810
<v Speaker 4>These guys are disappearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not fucking around.</v>

3667
02:46:29.811 --> 02:46:30.550
<v Speaker 4>Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Papa,</v>

3668
02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:32.450
<v Speaker 4>do you think that control?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that they,</v>

3669
02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:35.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did they look at that?</v>

3670
02:46:35.090 --> 02:46:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Russian diplomats keep dying </v>
<v Speaker 4>unexpectedly.</v>

3671
02:46:36.981 --> 02:46:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Look at his face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy shit.</v>

3672
02:46:38.451 --> 02:46:42.320
<v Speaker 4>He just terrifying to me is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like one of those help pigs.</v>

3673
02:46:43.010 --> 02:46:43.843
<v Speaker 4>We want to think that the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world has learned from hitler and </v>

3674
02:46:46.491 --> 02:46:48.620
<v Speaker 4>stalin and mussolini.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world's learn.</v>

3675
02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:51.470
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy that.</v>

3676
02:46:51.530 --> 02:46:52.570
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The number.</v>

3677
02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:54.140
<v Speaker 4>what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The number one it says on here,</v>

3678
02:46:54.141 --> 02:46:56.450
<v Speaker 4>six have died since november.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was.</v>

3679
02:46:56.451 --> 02:47:01.451
<v Speaker 4>So does it make you more frightened that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were interfering in our election?</v>

3680
02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:02.840
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3681
02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:03.673
<v Speaker 5>they certainly were aware of what was </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on and they certainly had access </v>

3682
02:47:08.210 --> 02:47:12.580
<v Speaker 5>to some documents about the dnc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The what?</v>

3683
02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:16.250
<v Speaker 5>What concerns me is people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>ignoring.</v>

3684
02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:18.110
<v Speaker 5>Although that is an issue for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3685
02:47:18.470 --> 02:47:23.150
<v Speaker 5>But they're ignoring that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they did was they let us know about</v>

3686
02:47:23.151 --> 02:47:23.984
<v Speaker 5>some horrible shit that the democrats </v>
<v Speaker 5>were up to where they were rigging the </v>

3687
02:47:26.721 --> 02:47:27.554
<v Speaker 5>primaries and fucking over bernie </v>
<v Speaker 5>sanders because he was too powerful and </v>

3688
02:47:30.351 --> 02:47:33.080
<v Speaker 5>too dangerous to hillary clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they concluded,</v>

3689
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:34.510
<v Speaker 5>they all used,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3690
02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:36.230
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they conspired rather,</v>

3691
02:47:36.260 --> 02:47:40.910
<v Speaker 5>and they all use their influence to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>over bernie sanders and then saying that</v>

3692
02:47:40.911 --> 02:47:41.744
<v Speaker 5>the russians hacked the election because</v>
<v Speaker 5>they exposed that the democrats are a </v>

3693
02:47:44.121 --> 02:47:47.810
<v Speaker 5>bunch of cheat and creeps is kinda </v>
<v Speaker 5>disingenuous because yes,</v>

3694
02:47:47.811 --> 02:47:48.644
<v Speaker 5>they did hack the election because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>did release some of that information so </v>

3695
02:47:50.871 --> 02:47:51.704
<v Speaker 5>they did have an impact on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that impact was essentially the </v>

3696
02:47:53.691 --> 02:47:57.020
<v Speaker 5>truth and something that we really </v>
<v Speaker 5>deserve to know in the first place.</v>

3697
02:47:57.260 --> 02:47:59.510
<v Speaker 5>We deserve to know the inner workings of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dnc.</v>

3698
02:47:59.511 --> 02:48:00.344
<v Speaker 5>We deserved to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they are getting in the way of </v>

3699
02:48:03.651 --> 02:48:04.484
<v Speaker 5>democracy.</v>

3700
02:48:04.710 --> 02:48:06.660
<v Speaker 4>They're rigging it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3701
02:48:06.661 --> 02:48:08.320
<v Speaker 4>Well there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

3702
02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:09.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're rigging it.</v>

3703
02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:12.170
<v Speaker 4>Politics is always dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no politics.</v>

3704
02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:14.630
<v Speaker 5>It's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they were doing was wrong.</v>

3705
02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:18.470
<v Speaker 5>Like what they were doing was they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>interfering with the democratic process.</v>

3706
02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:19.393
<v Speaker 5>Whether or not it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be argued in court and maybe </v>

3707
02:48:20.691 --> 02:48:23.270
<v Speaker 5>should be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's most certainly not what anybody</v>

3708
02:48:23.271 --> 02:48:26.970
<v Speaker 5>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We want the dnc to dictate who we are.</v>

3709
02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:28.070
<v Speaker 5>What are the primary is</v>

3710
02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:30.310
<v Speaker 4>we want people to dictate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all sit in one,</v>

3711
02:48:30.311 --> 02:48:31.144
<v Speaker 4>Joe Kennedy putting people didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Kennedy putting his bing in and </v>

3712
02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:39.970
<v Speaker 4>stealing votes for his son to be sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this stuff is always go on,</v>

3713
02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.290
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't excuse it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now with the sidling up to that guy,</v>

3714
02:48:45.190 --> 02:48:47.410
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that guy,</v>

3715
02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:51.010
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wants to defeat us.</v>

3716
02:48:51.011 --> 02:48:52.780
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So any kind of,</v>

3717
02:48:52.810 --> 02:48:53.643
<v Speaker 4>any kind of influence in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people within that campaign are now </v>

3718
02:48:57.160 --> 02:48:57.993
<v Speaker 4>having to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're getting caught talking to them </v>

3719
02:49:00.850 --> 02:49:01.683
<v Speaker 4>and then they lied about it for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason they didn't want people to know </v>

3720
02:49:05.530 --> 02:49:06.363
<v Speaker 4>whatever that was about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now you have this foreign enemy who </v>

3721
02:49:13.831 --> 02:49:14.664
<v Speaker 4>is now sidled up with a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are now running our </v>

3722
02:49:19.261 --> 02:49:20.850
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A government,</v>

3723
02:49:20.851 --> 02:49:22.440
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't.</v>

3724
02:49:22.770 --> 02:49:25.980
<v Speaker 4>That is hell bent on tearing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff down.</v>

3725
02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:28.380
<v Speaker 4>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what they.</v>

3726
02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:29.273
<v Speaker 4>The only reason why it worked at all was</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the democrats were involved in </v>

3727
02:49:32.701 --> 02:49:36.030
<v Speaker 4>shady shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they made up some stuff,</v>

3728
02:49:36.270 --> 02:49:37.440
<v Speaker 4>so she's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what I'm saying?</v>

3729
02:49:37.441 --> 02:49:38.430
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's dirty.</v>

3730
02:49:38.431 --> 02:49:40.530
<v Speaker 4>They were dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dnc was dirty,</v>

3731
02:49:40.531 --> 02:49:42.540
<v Speaker 4>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you the results.</v>

3732
02:49:42.541 --> 02:49:44.310
<v Speaker 4>Not good results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not good.</v>

3733
02:49:44.460 --> 02:49:45.293
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Having Donald Trump win in this fashion </v>

3734
02:49:46.981 --> 02:49:47.814
<v Speaker 4>and having the russians interfered and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then also having some sort of an </v>

3735
02:49:49.561 --> 02:49:52.350
<v Speaker 4>influence on him financially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things are not good.</v>

3736
02:49:52.351 --> 02:49:53.184
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a little disingenuous to the </v>

3737
02:49:55.230 --> 02:49:56.063
<v Speaker 4>store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that hillary was a terrible </v>

3738
02:49:57.181 --> 02:49:58.290
<v Speaker 4>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3739
02:49:58.380 --> 02:50:01.140
<v Speaker 4>She was so compromised from so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>different angles.</v>

3740
02:50:01.141 --> 02:50:01.974
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she didn't support gay marriage until </v>

3741
02:50:02.731 --> 02:50:04.860
<v Speaker 4>2013,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was.</v>

3742
02:50:05.190 --> 02:50:06.200
<v Speaker 4>She didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3743
02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:08.340
<v Speaker 4>she not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

3744
02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:12.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean like the clinton foundation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just a disaster,</v>

3745
02:50:12.061 --> 02:50:16.230
<v Speaker 4>like the whole thing and even filled </v>
<v Speaker 4>with an scary shit and look,</v>

3746
02:50:16.470 --> 02:50:17.303
<v Speaker 4>she was definitely disliked by a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people from being there for a lot of </v>

3747
02:50:22.531 --> 02:50:25.890
<v Speaker 4>time doing stuff that made a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people very nauseous.</v>

3748
02:50:26.100 --> 02:50:27.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was got all of that,</v>

3749
02:50:27.810 --> 02:50:28.643
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to go back and redo the </v>

3750
02:50:30.991 --> 02:50:32.120
<v Speaker 4>election,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just that,</v>

3751
02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:37.880
<v Speaker 4>just does it concern you that if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say let's be conspiracy theories.</v>

3752
02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:39.833
<v Speaker 4>Let's say that the russians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the russians have so much more </v>

3753
02:50:42.631 --> 02:50:45.180
<v Speaker 4>influence over this president by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

3754
02:50:45.181 --> 02:50:46.014
<v Speaker 4>putting his America first is using </v>
<v Speaker 4>russian steel for that pipeline that's </v>

3755
02:50:49.381 --> 02:50:51.270
<v Speaker 4>going through the indians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3756
02:50:51.330 --> 02:50:56.330
<v Speaker 4>if he's that tied to them and their.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Russia is an enemy of ours.</v>

3757
02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:57.833
<v Speaker 4>They want us to fail and now they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>an administration that wants to tear </v>

3758
02:51:00.661 --> 02:51:02.100
<v Speaker 4>stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>

3759
02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:05.550
<v Speaker 4>Could that be a conspiracy theory on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that side?</v>

3760
02:51:05.551 --> 02:51:07.110
<v Speaker 4>Certainly could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's the problem,</v>

3761
02:51:07.140 --> 02:51:09.600
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they like the russians.</v>

3762
02:51:09.630 --> 02:51:10.463
<v Speaker 4>They want to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to do that when we're buying </v>

3763
02:51:12.331 --> 02:51:15.090
<v Speaker 4>their steel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't operate as an individual.</v>

3764
02:51:15.330 --> 02:51:16.163
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a bunch of people that are </v>

3765
02:51:16.980 --> 02:51:20.440
<v Speaker 4>trapped in this dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

3766
02:51:20.460 --> 02:51:25.050
<v Speaker 4>Well the pooting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's when you are buying things,</v>

3767
02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:25.913
<v Speaker 4>if you're buying things from Russia and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so are there individuals over there is </v>

3768
02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:32.640
<v Speaker 4>everything Russia and entity and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>entity wants us dead once it's doomed,</v>

3769
02:51:32.940 --> 02:51:35.430
<v Speaker 4>isn't it possible the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3770
02:51:35.431 --> 02:51:36.264
<v Speaker 4>isn't it possible that their government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their government can evolve like and </v>

3771
02:51:39.571 --> 02:51:42.420
<v Speaker 4>they can eventually not have that guy in</v>
<v Speaker 4>place that there's some thumped,</v>

3772
02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:43.313
<v Speaker 4>something can take place and they could </v>
<v Speaker 4>also prosper from this age of </v>

3773
02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:48.700
<v Speaker 4>information and that 100 percent right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People,</v>

3774
02:51:48.710 --> 02:51:50.490
<v Speaker 4>the people 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3775
02:51:50.870 --> 02:51:54.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean this guy is doing this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he's doing.</v>

3776
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.983
<v Speaker 4>Art guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say this conspiracy to </v>

3777
02:51:57.351 --> 02:51:58.184
<v Speaker 4>just to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to take the fantasy of are these </v>

3778
02:52:00.541 --> 02:52:01.980
<v Speaker 4>guys right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because like you're saying,</v>

3779
02:52:03.090 --> 02:52:04.860
<v Speaker 4>the wiki leaks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>expose that to the dnc.</v>

3780
02:52:04.861 --> 02:52:07.690
<v Speaker 4>There's also a lot of dirty stuff we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even know right now.</v>

3781
02:52:07.691 --> 02:52:11.350
<v Speaker 4>It's going on for sure on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just take this fantasy of,</v>

3782
02:52:11.710 --> 02:52:12.543
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so putin is really aggressively wanted </v>

3783
02:52:14.980 --> 02:52:18.460
<v Speaker 4>this administration and they wanted a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bannon who wants to tear stuff down.</v>

3784
02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:22.330
<v Speaker 4>This is an advantage for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can expose that.</v>

3785
02:52:22.331 --> 02:52:24.790
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big deal.</v>

3786
02:52:24.850 --> 02:52:26.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's scary,</v>

3787
02:52:26.470 --> 02:52:27.303
<v Speaker 5>but here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're making a bunch of stuff up in </v>

3788
02:52:28.571 --> 02:52:30.850
<v Speaker 5>order because it is a fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3789
02:52:30.851 --> 02:52:32.110
<v Speaker 5>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3790
02:52:32.500 --> 02:52:34.450
<v Speaker 5>I get what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>

3791
02:52:34.451 --> 02:52:35.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>

3792
02:52:36.100 --> 02:52:38.140
<v Speaker 5>Of course you could and it's something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that should be considered,</v>

3793
02:52:38.141 --> 02:52:43.141
<v Speaker 5>but it's a weird thing when you start </v>
<v Speaker 5>making up motives and potential outcomes</v>

3794
02:52:44.441 --> 02:52:46.500
<v Speaker 5>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not good now.</v>

3795
02:52:47.020 --> 02:52:47.853
<v Speaker 4>That's why they're investigating because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they try and find the answers of what </v>

3796
02:52:49.811 --> 02:52:50.940
<v Speaker 4>this stuff really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3797
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:52.270
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of shit that's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

3798
02:52:52.330 --> 02:52:54.220
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of shit that's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>good about this.</v>

3799
02:52:54.260 --> 02:52:55.540
<v Speaker 5>This whole situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3800
02:52:55.710 --> 02:52:56.543
<v Speaker 5>There's like there's way too much power </v>
<v Speaker 5>and influence by one person and that </v>

3801
02:53:02.050 --> 02:53:06.100
<v Speaker 5>person's that person's cabinet in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>person's choices.</v>

3802
02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:08.320
<v Speaker 5>What choices they make on the rest of us</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we're,</v>

3803
02:53:08.321 --> 02:53:10.690
<v Speaker 5>we're seeing that now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wayne gets way too much,</v>

3804
02:53:10.750 --> 02:53:11.583
<v Speaker 5>way too much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's more than we've ever seen </v>

3805
02:53:12.581 --> 02:53:13.414
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've never seen someone come in with a </v>

3806
02:53:14.350 --> 02:53:18.070
<v Speaker 5>sweeping brush of change and just </v>
<v Speaker 5>decide,</v>

<v Speaker 4>60 days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't it seem a lot of.</v>

<v Speaker 4>they're dumping coal waste?</v>

3818
02:53:41.300 --> 02:53:44.270

<v Speaker 4>Virginia and so that you couldn't,</v>

<v Speaker 4>home and put a ball gag on punch </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves in the dick and just there </v>

3833
02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:32.390
<v Speaker 4>are so tied down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so not how a man thinks or talks.</v>

3834
02:54:32.650 --> 02:54:33.483
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny for tuning into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Its very interesting fresh air with </v>

3835
02:54:37.251 --> 02:54:38.690
<v Speaker 4>terry.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would you do if a terrorist attack </v>

3838
02:54:44.721 --> 02:54:45.554
<v Speaker 4>is happening right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would you do if a man came in with </v>

3839
02:54:47.751 --> 02:54:49.910
<v Speaker 4>his dick in his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fuck your mouth.</v>

3840
02:54:50.740 --> 02:54:51.573
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's probably a reason he </v>

3841
02:54:53.331 --> 02:54:54.620
<v Speaker 4>wants to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3842
02:54:55.760 --> 02:54:56.593
<v Speaker 4>We have to understand that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>consenting it sending to you doing this </v>

3843
02:54:59.091 --> 02:55:01.100
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is probably a very good reason.</v>

3844
02:55:01.101 --> 02:55:04.070
<v Speaker 4>It was his father probably did it to him</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just</v>

3845
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:05.420
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3846
02:55:05.450 --> 02:55:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like,</v>

3847
02:55:07.870 --> 02:55:10.010
<v Speaker 3>like can we come from a place of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

3848
02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:11.900
<v Speaker 3>of kindness rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3849
02:55:11.901 --> 02:55:12.380
<v Speaker 3>he's</v>

3850
02:55:12.380 --> 02:55:13.680
<v Speaker 5>prosperity right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

3851
02:55:13.700 --> 02:55:16.100
<v Speaker 5>he's ramping up the prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what he wants to do.</v>

3852
02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:21.380
<v Speaker 5>I think he feels like he can get people </v>
<v Speaker 5>to love him again and yet the country on</v>

3853
02:55:21.381 --> 02:55:23.420
<v Speaker 5>track,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he creates all these jobs.</v>

3854
02:55:23.421 --> 02:55:24.860
<v Speaker 5>That's why I had this big video </v>
<v Speaker 5>announcement,</v>

3855
02:55:24.861 --> 02:55:25.694
<v Speaker 5>your story where he was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>exxon investing in the gulf coast and </v>

3856
02:55:28.611 --> 02:55:31.880
<v Speaker 5>they're going to get all these jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be like 45,000</v>

3857
02:55:31.881 --> 02:55:34.850
<v Speaker 5>jobs and the jobs are going to be paying</v>
<v Speaker 5>$100,000</v>

3858
02:55:34.851 --> 02:55:35.684
<v Speaker 5>on the average,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so all these great jobs and he's very </v>

3859
02:55:37.611 --> 02:55:38.900
<v Speaker 5>excited about announcing that.</v>

3860
02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:43.280
<v Speaker 3>Most likely it's all tied to oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all tied to oil.</v>

3861
02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:45.140
<v Speaker 3>That's where the money is in resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3862
02:55:46.050 --> 02:55:48.260
<v Speaker 3>In that model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that old model,</v>

3863
02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:50.480
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be that model,</v>

3864
02:55:50.660 --> 02:55:53.990
<v Speaker 3>but he wants to get America putting tons</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people to work.</v>

3865
02:55:54.020 --> 02:55:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are thousands of people.</v>

3866
02:55:56.801 --> 02:56:01.070
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking driving cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're killing people.</v>

02:56:01.250 --> 02:56:04.500
<v Speaker 3>I love people like brought up two people</v>
<v Speaker 3>have died too.</v>

3868
02:56:05.050 --> 02:56:08.020

<v Speaker 3>who were like,</v>

3869

02:58:16.470 --> 02:58:18.090
<v Speaker 3>It was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3923
02:58:24.021 --> 02:58:26.390
<v Speaker 5>and these are like the leaders that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably the best.</v>

3924
02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:27.553
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you go.</v>

3926
02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:31.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're out there doing drugs,</v>

3927
02:58:31.251 --> 02:58:34.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm shooting you shoot and drug dealers </v>
<v Speaker 5>killing everybody.</v>

3928
02:58:34.520 --> 02:58:37.400
<v Speaker 5>You got to do what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's how I roll.</v>

3929
02:58:37.401 --> 02:58:40.350
<v Speaker 5>So I clean the streets up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bullets tired,</v>

3930
02:58:40.960 --> 02:58:42.590
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Want to have a sandwich,</v>

3931
02:58:42.591 --> 02:58:46.430
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I hit that tesla and it just like,</v>

3932
02:58:46.431 --> 02:58:49.130
<v Speaker 5>especially when I drive to school in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>morning and drop the kids off.</v>

3933
02:58:49.880 --> 02:58:51.730
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm,</v>

3934
02:58:51.740 --> 02:58:54.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm always trying to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This glass is half full guy.</v>

3935
02:58:54.170 --> 02:58:55.003
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think that the reaction that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people were having to all these new </v>

3936
02:58:57.651 --> 02:58:58.484
<v Speaker 5>policies is going to invigorate our </v>
<v Speaker 5>political system because it's going to </v>

3937
02:59:01.661 --> 02:59:02.494
<v Speaker 5>inspire people to act and to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and to make some positive </v>

3938
02:59:05.271 --> 02:59:05.690
<v Speaker 5>change.</v>

3939
02:59:05.690 --> 02:59:09.440
<v Speaker 5>And the people are going to realize how </v>
<v Speaker 5>important it is to get involved and what</v>

3940
02:59:09.441 --> 02:59:12.530
<v Speaker 5>the consequences are to the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the world,</v>

3941
02:59:12.531 --> 02:59:13.364
<v Speaker 5>to the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we let someone come in and just </v>

3942
02:59:15.321 --> 02:59:19.760
<v Speaker 5>solely concentrate on profits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is where what you're assuming that</v>

3943
02:59:19.761 --> 02:59:20.594
<v Speaker 5>they're going to do and they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>lean towards that and they're going to </v>

3944
02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:23.623
<v Speaker 5>lower the environmental protection </v>
<v Speaker 5>agency's regulations and lower the </v>

3945
02:59:26.691 --> 02:59:27.524
<v Speaker 5>standards for emissions and more </v>
<v Speaker 5>pollution in the fucking coal mine shit </v>

3946
02:59:31.191 --> 02:59:33.380
<v Speaker 5>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's running it like a business.</v>

3947
02:59:33.381 --> 02:59:34.730
<v Speaker 5>People are going to have to react to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3948
02:59:34.760 --> 02:59:35.593
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there was a swing the other </v>

3949
02:59:36.201 --> 02:59:36.500
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

3950
02:59:36.500 --> 02:59:37.333
<v Speaker 3>There's actually an editorial of the guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the head of the epa during </v>

3951
02:59:39.801 --> 02:59:44.801
<v Speaker 3>reagan and he was warning pruitt that </v>
<v Speaker 3>americans have a breaking point.</v>

3952
02:59:47.930 --> 02:59:51.590
<v Speaker 3>They do not like it when they think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

3953
02:59:51.710 --> 02:59:55.550
<v Speaker 3>That the environment and their health is</v>
<v Speaker 3>in danger because that's our families.</v>

3954
02:59:55.551 --> 02:59:57.140
<v Speaker 3>That's our children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's our lives.</v>

3955
02:59:57.680 --> 02:59:58.513
<v Speaker 3>And reagan came in and he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do some big sweeping things that we're </v>

3956
03:00:01.941 --> 03:00:04.340
<v Speaker 3>going to be more profitable and give us </v>
<v Speaker 3>more jobs.</v>

3957
03:00:04.760 --> 03:00:09.170
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fierce fight back from the americans</v>

3958
03:00:09.740 --> 03:00:12.050
<v Speaker 3>had to make them change course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

3959
03:00:12.051 --> 03:00:14.810
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think especially with that issue,</v>

3960
03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:18.690
<v Speaker 5>I think it's entirely possible that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could deal with eco terrorism as well.</v>

3961
03:00:18.870 --> 03:00:23.700
<v Speaker 5>Whereas someone could decide that this </v>
<v Speaker 5>path is wrong and evil and that the best</v>

3962
03:00:23.701 --> 03:00:24.534
<v Speaker 5>way to subvert it would be to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>something below something up or </v>

3963
03:00:28.171 --> 03:00:29.070
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3964
03:00:29.100 --> 03:00:33.240
<v Speaker 5>have some sort of reaction where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>damaged the company or damage the public</v>

3965
03:00:33.241 --> 03:00:38.241
<v Speaker 5>image or mean all this is really tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five dimensional chess that these people</v>

3966
03:00:38.431 --> 03:00:39.360
<v Speaker 5>are playing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3967
03:00:39.380 --> 03:00:40.213
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when you're dealing with </v>

3968
03:00:40.531 --> 03:00:41.364
<v Speaker 5>foreign entities now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>north korea's is tested nuclear or </v>

3969
03:00:43.980 --> 03:00:45.570
<v Speaker 5>ballistic missiles rather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3970
03:00:45.630 --> 03:00:48.180
<v Speaker 5>And Russia is mean the whole thing.</v>

3971
03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what obama told Donald Trump when</v>

3972
03:00:51.421 --> 03:00:54.690
<v Speaker 3>he was coming in that his greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>concern is North Korea.</v>

3973
03:00:54.780 --> 03:00:55.613
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

3974
03:00:55.700 --> 03:00:58.170
<v Speaker 5>that guy is a fucking psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3975
03:00:58.580 --> 03:01:00.160
<v Speaker 5>He just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His half brother</v>

3976
03:01:00.660 --> 03:01:03.130
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had someone spraying for airport.</v>

3977
03:01:03.340 --> 03:01:04.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the people that were doing it.</v>

3978
03:01:04.991 --> 03:01:06.040
<v Speaker 4>Thought it was a prank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3979
03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:08.830
<v Speaker 4>They were dressed like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they were doing a prank,</v>

3980
03:01:09.400 --> 03:01:10.570
<v Speaker 4>didn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think they were doing a prank.</v>

3981
03:01:10.610 --> 03:01:11.990
<v Speaker 4>They didn't realize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that the heat,</v>

3982
03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:14.520
<v Speaker 4>they didn't even realize that they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it all really?</v>

3983
03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:15.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I made that up.</v>

3984
03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:16.593
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

3985
03:01:16.630 --> 03:01:18.510
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
