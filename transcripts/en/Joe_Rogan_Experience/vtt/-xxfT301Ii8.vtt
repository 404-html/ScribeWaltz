9
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask you,</v>

10
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>do you mind the nickname the golden snitch?</v>

11
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>So first thing I was gonna bring up</v>

12
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>this golden snitch bullshit.</v>

13
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.701
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say,</v>

14
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not my nickname.</v>

15
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>It's Brennan jobs.</v>

16
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>He came up with it 100% on his own.</v>

17
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.313
<v Speaker 1>He was going to ask you.</v>

18
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.443
<v Speaker 1>It's all good though.</v>

19
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.201
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

20
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:29.034
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

21
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of funny stories about that.</v>

22
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>So when did he come up with this?</v>

23
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>About a year ago at least.</v>

24
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

25
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>so people in the office started coming up to me saying,</v>

26
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:37.891
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

27
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:38.724
<v Speaker 1>golden snitch,</v>

28
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>what the hell's that?</v>

29
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Do a little research as she,</v>

30
00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>something about Harry Potter or some character named there.</v>

31
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:45.721
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

32
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>what the hell does this have to do with me?</v>

33
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>So about a month ago,</v>

34
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.000

<v Speaker 1>So she's over there.</v>

70
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

71
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

72
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you know about kind of her history.</v>

73
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>She was more of the five original ploys of the UFC was Dana as assistant to</v>

74
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:47.964
<v Speaker 1>start out with,</v>

75
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.721
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>went on to become VP of event operations.</v>

77
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>So basically,</v>

78
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>she got everybody to the event set up hotel at the event,</v>

80
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.713
<v Speaker 1>ran the crew,</v>

81
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>the blue shirts backstage that run the event.</v>

83
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I think after doing it for many years,</v>

86
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>she got a little burnt out on it.</v>

87
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>So when to Dana,</v>

88
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>mid summer and says,</v>

90
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:08.851
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

91
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I want to do this anymore,</v>

92
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>but I'd really love to do something else and I've seen kind of what Jeff's doing</v>

93
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:16.051
<v Speaker 1>in his program.</v>

94
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I really like to go over there and work with him and kind of learn,</v>

95
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing.</v>

97
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>And so Dana pulled me into the office and said,</v>

98
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

99
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about this idea?</v>

100
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:29.070
<v Speaker 1>And it took me literally a half second to say 100% on board.</v>

101
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.391
<v Speaker 1>This woman,</v>

102
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:30.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

103
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know,</v>

104
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>is about as attention to detail and passionate about her work as anybody.</v>

105
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>And really my positioning,</v>

106
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>unlike the name,</v>

107
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>the Golden Snitch,</v>

108
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>is an advocate to our athletes to make sure our athletes are successful under</v>

109
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:45.991
<v Speaker 1>the program.</v>

110
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Not that they fail under the program.</v>

111
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely the wrong nickname.</v>

112
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just catchy.</v>

113
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>It is just unfortunately catchy.</v>

114
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.751
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

115
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:52.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm all,</v>

116
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm all good with it.</v>

117
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.213
<v Speaker 1>I back.</v>

118
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.661
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

119
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

120
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>the real golden snitches,</v>

121
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Victor Conti,</v>

122
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>he's the Golden Snitch,</v>

123
00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

124
00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:02:59.461 --> 00:02:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

126
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.593
<v Speaker 1>I was actually,</v>

127
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I can see that because he was a guy who was giving guys steroids.</v>

128
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>You were a guy that was always catching people.</v>

129
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.401
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

130
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 2>So it's the wrong moniker.</v>

131
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

132
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Giving them steroids and then talking about it after,</v>

133
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

134
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 2>That's a snitch.</v>

136
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the golden stitch.</v>

137
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.973
<v Speaker 2>Not you man,</v>

138
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.671
<v Speaker 2>but it's all good.</v>

139
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:16.640
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping shop with him,</v>

140
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.063
<v Speaker 2>call him.</v>

141
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm up later in this show what I could do anything to them,</v>

142
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 2>but it'd be interesting to look at him in the face.</v>

143
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.501
<v Speaker 2>He would say,</v>

144
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry Bro.</v>

145
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:25.594
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

146
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Well anyway,</v>

148
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 2>back to Donna.</v>

149
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 2>She's awesome.</v>

150
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.631
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

151
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 2>so I'm super psyched that she's with you.</v>

152
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 2>So what exactly does she do for you guys?</v>

153
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Again her,</v>

154
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 2>when I sat her down in the summer I said,</v>

156
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:35.681
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

157
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 2>your role here is going to make sure that the athletes are successful under the</v>

158
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

159
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.510
<v Speaker 2>And in a program like this,</v>

160
00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 2>there are so many landmines,</v>

161
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 2>whether it be making sure your whereabouts filing is that Tom is on time,</v>

163
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 2>making sure you sought a,</v>

164
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 2>knows where you're at so they can come do a collection from you at any time.</v>

165
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

166
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 2>making sure you make safe supplement choices,</v>

167
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 2>making sure the medications you're taking are correct.</v>

168
00:03:59.171 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 2>So she,</v>

169
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

170
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:01.310
<v Speaker 2>works hard for all those things.</v>

171
00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I give you the prime example of what she brings to this program.</v>

172
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 2>So every three months,</v>

173
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:07.984
<v Speaker 2>every quarter,</v>

174
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 2>every single athlete on the roster is required to file what's called quarterly.</v>

175
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Whereabouts.</v>

176
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Can I pause right here?</v>

177
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.251
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

178
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Just so this can be a standalone if people don't know exactly what you do.</v>

179
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.683
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

180
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Jeff is in charge of making sure that all the UFC athletes are clean and free of</v>

181
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing substances.</v>

182
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 2>And it was a huge issue before you came along.</v>

183
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 2>A huge issue in the sport.</v>

184
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:35.371
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

185
00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 2>and continues to be in other organizations,</v>

186
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 2>particularly overseas.</v>

187
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's just ramping speculation about companies that literally encourage</v>

188
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 2>people to take steroids.</v>

189
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 2>It was always the case with pride in Japan.</v>

190
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the big things about pride ensin anyway,</v>

191
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 2>who fought for them many times came on the podcast and literally was saying in</v>

192
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 2>the contract and like capital letters,</v>

193
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 2>it says we will not test you for steroids.</v>

194
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Like they wanted everybody to take steroids.</v>

195
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

196
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 2>I had friends who went to fight over there.</v>

197
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>They told him to take steroids and move up a weight class.</v>

198
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 2>So it was always an issue in the sport that this was a dirty sport air quotes.</v>

199
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

200
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

201
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

202
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 2>but since you've come along and since you guys started instituting this</v>

203
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 2>incredibly strict testing,</v>

204
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 2>we've seen some pretty radical changes.</v>

205
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 2>We've seen some amazing fights and amazing performances and I don't think the</v>

206
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 2>performance levels dropped.</v>

207
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:26.591
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

208
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it escalated and elevated rather,</v>

209
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 2>which is something that people were really concerned about.</v>

210
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 2>But one thing that we did see is some people that you suspected of doing stuff,</v>

211
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 2>their bodies radically changed.</v>

212
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>It was really mean.</v>

213
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 2>That became a meme pre Usada and post Usada I mean,</v>

214
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 2>and there's some comedy memes out there because of it,</v>

215
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 2>because people's bodies change so radically.</v>

216
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

217
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:48.821
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

218
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

219
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 2>the last time I was on,</v>

220
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:52.320
<v Speaker 2>we talked about kind of the smell test,</v>

221
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 2>looking at somebody and you know,</v>

222
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to say definitively whether or not,</v>

223
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 2>changes</v>

225
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 1>in bodies are due to that or not,</v>

226
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:00.081
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

227
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:03.640
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but look at some of these pictures before and after you saw it.</v>

228
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the case.</v>

229
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>That's something I always struggle with.</v>

230
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>How do you judge the success of a program?</v>

231
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

232
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

233
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>do you judge it on numbers of positive tests?</v>

234
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's necessarily the case.</v>

235
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:15.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

236
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:16.604
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

237
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not catching everybody.</v>

238
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's no one to catch.</v>

239
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

240
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.120
<v Speaker 1>do you judge it on before and after pictures?</v>

241
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

242
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

243
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>that could be one factor.</v>

244
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I like to judge it a lot anecdotally.</v>

245
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

246
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>a big part of my job is getting out and building relationships with our</v>

247
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:34.544
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>

248
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 1>with managers,</v>

249
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>with coaches,</v>

250
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>

251
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>chewing on their ear and figuring out what they're seeing and what they're</v>

253
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:42.561
<v Speaker 1>hearing.</v>

254
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>And almost universally,</v>

255
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.690
<v Speaker 1>the feedback I get from,</v>

256
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>from them is this is making a big difference.</v>

257
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

258
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

259
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 1>one thing I brought with me today,</v>

260
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>and really the coolest piece of data I think I've seen in any anti-doping</v>

261
00:06:55.521 --> 00:07:00.521
<v Speaker 1>program are some really objective measurable statistics and the UFC anti-doping</v>

262
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>program Usada so you saw it as the United States antidoping agency.</v>

263
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>They're the official antidoping agency of the United States by an act of</v>

264
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:10.904
<v Speaker 1>Congress.</v>

265
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 1>They're in charge of all drug testing for us Olympic sports.</v>

266
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

267
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.620
<v Speaker 1>back in 2015 we made the decision to outsource the administration of our program</v>

268
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>to Usada.</v>

269
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.180
<v Speaker 1>The primary reason being the independence factor.</v>

270
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.751
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

271
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:26.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>when you look at all these other professional sports league,</v>

273
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:29.950
<v Speaker 1>some have,</v>

274
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 1>better programs and other none really have any independence in the</v>

276
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>

277
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:35.331
<v Speaker 1>That program.</v>

278
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 1>And with that means is there's no way of telling whether or not,</v>

279
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

280
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 1>when an athlete is sanctioned,</v>

282
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 1>it's done for business reasons or done for favoritism.</v>

283
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>So in our program,</v>

284
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

285
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>no one can say that that any of the administration of our program has done for</v>

286
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:50.631
<v Speaker 1>that reason.</v>

287
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a truly independent authority.</v>

288
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>So what you saw it did recently as they went back and they'd been in existence</v>

289
00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 1>since I think about 2001 on the US Olympic level.</v>

290
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 1>They went back and took a look at every single doper I think for steroids.</v>

291
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was caught for steroids in the existence of the Usada program and took</v>

292
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 1>a look at each of those athletes,</v>

293
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:16.841
<v Speaker 1>biological passports and biological markers and they looked at what was the most</v>

294
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:20.820
<v Speaker 1>common factor for the doper versus you know,</v>

295
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>the non doper.</v>

296
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.280
<v Speaker 1>And what they determined was what stood out the most was large variance in</v>

297
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>testosterone excretion in the urine.</v>

298
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>And we think about it,</v>

299
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.410
<v Speaker 1>common sense point of view that kind of makes sense and that someone who's using</v>

300
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Speaker 1>steroids at that time presents a sample.</v>

301
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Their testosterone excretion is probably going to be on the higher end.</v>

302
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 1>And if they were to catch a doper on and off cycle,</v>

303
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you get off steroids is your body suppresses production of</v>

304
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:51.771
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

305
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>So in that case you're going to see a very low excretion of testosterone.</v>

306
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>So they looked at that and plotted it out and saw hey,</v>

307
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 2>every dope or has a very large variance and testosterone excretion.</v>

308
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Then what they did is they took all the UFC samples and they plotted amount by</v>

309
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.410
<v Speaker 2>quarter and actually brought a graph along with me.</v>

310
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 2>And it's some really drastic,</v>

311
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

312
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 2>visual evidence of the success and the impact of this program.</v>

313
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you can throw it up mom to take a look at it.</v>

314
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.663
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

315
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 2>so when,</v>

316
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.410
<v Speaker 2>what year exactly did,</v>

317
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

318
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 2>you saw a takeover?</v>

319
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:27.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

320
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:27.811
<v Speaker 2>So we can't,</v>

321
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:28.141
<v Speaker 2>you saw it,</v>

322
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 2>it came into play July of 2015 so if you saw it has been in existence for two</v>

323
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:33.421
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

324
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 2>So you see here,</v>

325
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.873
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

326
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 2>that first quarter,</v>

327
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 2>quarter three of 2015,</v>

328
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 2>a pretty decent variants there.</v>

329
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:41.491
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

330
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 2>which means in any given test and athlete,</v>

331
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:43.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

332
00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 2>I was up on an average,</v>

333
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 2>a little bit 30,</v>

334
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little,</v>

335
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:47.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

336
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 2>in the mid twenties.</v>

337
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 2>And then look at,</v>

338
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 2>as you plot out that graph,</v>

339
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

340
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Speaker 2>that variance becomes smaller and smaller and smaller and more in the medium</v>

341
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:58.140
<v Speaker 2>range as it gets out to,</v>

342
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

343
00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:00.120
<v Speaker 2>quarter three of 2017.</v>

344
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.080
<v Speaker 2>That's very interesting.</v>

345
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:01.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

346
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.040
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

347
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

348
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 2>you don't usually see statistics.</v>

349
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:09.651
<v Speaker 2>This is the first I've been involved in anti-doping world since 2002 and I can</v>

350
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 2>unequivocally say that this is the strongest visual,</v>

351
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.511
<v Speaker 2>objective,</v>

352
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:18.270
<v Speaker 2>measurable evidence of success of a program that I've ever seen.</v>

353
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:18.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

354
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's so fascinating about this,</v>

355
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.760
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

356
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.351
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

357
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:23.580
<v Speaker 2>this goes to this,</v>

358
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:27.630
<v Speaker 2>goes to credit to the UFC 100% is that they decided to do something about this.</v>

359
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.643
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have to,</v>

360
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like someone coming after them because,</v>

361
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:33.391
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

362
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:33.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

363
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 2>so many people had been caught and someone said,</v>

364
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:36.421
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

365
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put a program on you guys to make sure you're not doping.</v>

366
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Or the UFC said,</v>

367
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.740
<v Speaker 2>we've got to clean this up and there's,</v>

368
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.770
<v Speaker 2>there's only one way.</v>

369
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 2>The one way is to go with the very best testing possible and the most rigorous,</v>

370
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 2>the most,</v>

371
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean checkin everywhere you go,</v>

372
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.500
<v Speaker 2>we're going to give you random tests,</v>

373
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 2>six o'clock in the morning,</v>

374
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:54.384
<v Speaker 2>knock on your door,</v>

375
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.680
<v Speaker 2>like the whole,</v>

376
00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 2>the whole full gamut of tests and the results have been pretty amazing.</v>

377
00:11:00.241 --> 00:11:05.241
<v Speaker 2>And that alones that speaks volumes when you see this size of the variance</v>

378
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 2>between the,</v>

379
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:06.751
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

380
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 2>the test when you guys first started versus now definitely,</v>

381
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:10.250
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

382
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a credit to two people,</v>

383
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>the Renzo for Tita and Dana white that made that decision and that's a hell of a</v>

384
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 2>risky decision but done for all the right reasons.</v>

385
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:19.621
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

386
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:24.030
<v Speaker 2>anybody that contends that Dana doesn't care about his athletes need look no</v>

387
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:25.290
<v Speaker 2>further than this program.</v>

388
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.340
<v Speaker 2>This program is of tremendous risk to the company and to the bottom line.</v>

389
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:34.730
<v Speaker 2>When you're test athletes 365 days a year on announced no predictability of when</v>

390
00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 2>the test is coming,</v>

391
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 2>there can be some very severe consequences to have been there.</v>

392
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Several main events there has been,</v>

393
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:43.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

394
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.580
<v Speaker 2>UFC 200,</v>

395
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

396
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 2>the land,</v>

397
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 2>arguably the landmark event in the history of the UFC.</v>

398
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.110
<v Speaker 2>We lose our main event,</v>

399
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 2>the before</v>

400
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.760
<v Speaker 1>UFC 200 millions if not tens of millions into the marketing of that.</v>

401
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

402
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

403
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 1>the success of the paper view probably hinges on that great main event between</v>

404
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 1>John and Daniel and we lost it three or four days before.</v>

405
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 1>And that could happen.</v>

406
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.433
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you know,</v>

407
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 1>at any given moment.</v>

408
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Now we talked about this before the podcast,</v>

409
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

410
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.200
<v Speaker 1>what you could or could not talk about what the current state of John Jones</v>

411
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:20.891
<v Speaker 1>investigation.</v>

412
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 1>So where's it at right now?</v>

413
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

414
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

415
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 1>generally we don't talk about,</v>

417
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:25.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

418
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:26.471
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>

419
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:26.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

420
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.180
<v Speaker 1>so how the process works.</v>

421
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:31.960
<v Speaker 1>When an athlete test positive you sought it will notify me.</v>

422
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:32.891
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

423
00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I usually pick the phone up right away and call Dana and let him know and the</v>

424
00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 1>UFC puts out an announcement.</v>

425
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:38.880
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

426
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

427
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 1>in the case of John John tested positive,</v>

428
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

429
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 1>then in an in competition test on this date,</v>

430
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

431
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

432
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.520
<v Speaker 1>more information will be provided.</v>

433
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 1>At the appropriate time.</v>

434
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:51.250
<v Speaker 1>That's generally all we'll talk about.</v>

435
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:52.084
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

436
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.100
<v Speaker 1>If the athlete chooses to talk about,</v>

437
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:54.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

438
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.760
<v Speaker 1>scenarios of,</v>

439
00:12:55.761 --> 00:12:56.650
<v Speaker 1>of what happened,</v>

440
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 1>then they're free to do that.</v>

441
00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

442
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.180
<v Speaker 1>at that point you saw it in the UFC can comment on it.</v>

443
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>So there's been some things talked about in the John Case,</v>

444
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

445
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.233
<v Speaker 1>by John.</v>

446
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.393
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

447
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.430
<v Speaker 1>particularly he had to clean tests on July 7th and July 8th before his positive</v>

448
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:14.980
<v Speaker 1>test on I think July 30th,</v>

449
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:16.210
<v Speaker 1>which was way in day.</v>

450
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And the positive test was for to hydro chloral methyl testosterone or oral</v>

451
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.443
<v Speaker 1>Terenna ball.</v>

452
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:23.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

453
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 1>this is a substance that was used by the East Germans.</v>

454
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm regularly in the late sixties,</v>

455
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 1>and then came into the fold a little bit more,</v>

456
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.531
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

457
00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 1>of what's come out recently a matter of Russia.</v>

458
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:35.141
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

459
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

460
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.770
<v Speaker 1>I know you had a Bryan Fogel on for,</v>

461
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.900
<v Speaker 1>for the ICARUS moving.</v>

462
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I think you talked about a little bit about this.</v>

463
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

464
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:42.311
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

465
00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:42.881
<v Speaker 1>Gregory,</v>

466
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:44.410
<v Speaker 1>the head of the Moscow,</v>

467
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.190
<v Speaker 1>a laboratory that this drug became kind of part of his protocol,</v>

468
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.091
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

469
00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:50.200
<v Speaker 1>with his athletes.</v>

470
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 1>He then ironically enough developed a test for the longterm metabolites of the</v>

471
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:56.074
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>

472
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.580
<v Speaker 1>So previous to that,</v>

473
00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:00.940
<v Speaker 1>the detection window of this drug was a couple of days.</v>

474
00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:02.890
<v Speaker 1>So it was a drug that you know,</v>

475
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 1>even if you run a strict program,</v>

476
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 1>an athlete may gamble with taking because it had a quick clearance time after he</v>

477
00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:13.490
<v Speaker 1>discovered the longterm metabolite test that changed and went from a detect and</v>

478
00:14:13.491 --> 00:14:17.890
<v Speaker 1>when detection window of a couple of days to a detection window of several</v>

479
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:18.370
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

480
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 1>And this was widely known,</v>

481
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

482
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.460
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a secret.</v>

483
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Initially they kept it quiet and they went back and retested some samples and</v>

484
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:30.571
<v Speaker 1>there was a whole bunch of positives and then it got out 2013 around that there</v>

485
00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:31.821
<v Speaker 1>was this new test.</v>

486
00:14:31.821 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 1>So right up front,</v>

487
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

488
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:34.251
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

489
00:14:34.251 --> 00:14:35.740
<v Speaker 1>I've said this a while now is,</v>

490
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.320
<v Speaker 1>would not make a lot of sense for an individual,</v>

491
00:14:39.321 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 1>a UFC athlete that new,</v>

492
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

493
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.123
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

494
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:42.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 1>a champion contender like Jon Jones at new and I'm tested quite regularly in</v>

496
00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:47.771
<v Speaker 1>this program,</v>

497
00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 1>would not make a lot of sense that that would be your drug of choice.</v>

498
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 1>If you were intentionally trying to cheat,</v>

499
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.213
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

500
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's come out after the fact that,</v>

501
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

502
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.930
<v Speaker 1>you saw the,</v>

503
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 1>did another test on John a month or two or a couple months after his positive</v>

504
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:06.530
<v Speaker 1>tests and he was negative during that test.</v>

505
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 1>So that would be indicative that,</v>

506
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.850
<v Speaker 1>the prohibited system entered his system or the prohibited substance entered his</v>

508
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:14.684
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

509
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

510
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 1>sometime after July 7th or eighth and was likely,</v>

511
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:19.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

512
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 1>a pretty small amount in that it cleared his system pretty quickly.</v>

513
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

514
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

515
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:24.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

516
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 1>who knows where it plays out,</v>

517
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:28.430
<v Speaker 1>but certainly on the surface of things I have said,</v>

518
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:32.150
<v Speaker 1>at this point in the game with that type of information out there,</v>

520
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

521
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.170
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't indicate the intentional use.</v>

522
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Now that could be wrong.</v>

523
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that definitively.</v>

524
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:39.340
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

525
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 1>and we'll see how this plays out.</v>

526
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

527
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.740
<v Speaker 1>right now where the process is as John and you saw that are working closely,</v>

528
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:46.341
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

529
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware that there was a meeting a week or two ago,</v>

530
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:49.490
<v Speaker 1>pretty lengthy meeting,</v>

531
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.631
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

532
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:50.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

533
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I was told was productive.</v>

534
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't given details of what productive meant.</v>

535
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

536
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's an important thing right now.</v>

537
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:01.880
<v Speaker 1>And that John's falling through with his to retrace all of his steps between</v>

538
00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:02.170
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

539
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:02.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

540
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 1>last July 8th positive tests and our negative tests and the positive test on</v>

541
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 1>July 29th of July 30th.</v>

542
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It certainly seems like,</v>

543
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>based on what you just said,</v>

544
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.590
<v Speaker 1>that this is something that was accidentally taken,</v>

545
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.010
<v Speaker 1>but if you can't prove that something was accidentally taken,</v>

546
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.540
<v Speaker 1>like if you can't nail it down,</v>

547
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:21.920
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

548
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 1>what happens there?</v>

549
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

550
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:23.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

551
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.200
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult and that's,</v>

552
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

553
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:26.450
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of the nightmare scenario that a lot of,</v>

554
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:26.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

555
00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:30.740
<v Speaker 1>that an athlete can face in a big roll of what Donna and I do to prevent that</v>

556
00:16:30.741 --> 00:16:31.341
<v Speaker 1>from happening,</v>

557
00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:36.341
<v Speaker 1>to show them what type of care and consideration is needed to make sure you</v>

558
00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Speaker 1>don't get into a scenario like that.</v>

559
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

560
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:40.280
<v Speaker 1>under a program like this,</v>

561
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you have to be careful about everything that's put into your body and</v>

562
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.093
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

563
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.941
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

564
00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:47.181
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

565
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:47.841
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>

566
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:48.670
<v Speaker 1>there can be,</v>

567
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

568
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.330
<v Speaker 1>severe consequences.</v>

569
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

570
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:52.281
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

571
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:52.550
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

572
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll see where this plays out.</v>

573
00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:54.081
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>

574
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:54.831
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that I,</v>

575
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>that I can say about this is,</v>

576
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

577
00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:01.660
<v Speaker 1>this is obviously John's second time I'm in the program with testing positive.</v>

578
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:05.480
<v Speaker 1>And in the first time he went through a pretty lengthy,</v>

579
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:05.931
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

580
00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:10.760
<v Speaker 1>appeal process and there was a publicly issued a decision,</v>

581
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:11.211
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

582
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:13.820
<v Speaker 1>60 pages that went through all the evidence that,</v>

583
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:15.440
<v Speaker 1>that the independent,</v>

584
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

585
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.481
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

586
00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:20.360
<v Speaker 1>arbitrators heard and decided on.</v>

587
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 1>And what they said definitively in that case was John,</v>

588
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.960
<v Speaker 1>there was no evidence of John intentionally cheated,</v>

589
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.820
<v Speaker 1>however he operated with careless,</v>

590
00:17:28.821 --> 00:17:30.020
<v Speaker 1>reckless disregard.</v>

591
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:30.981
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

592
00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:32.990
<v Speaker 1>so we ended up getting the maximum for that,</v>

593
00:17:32.991 --> 00:17:35.450
<v Speaker 1>for those substances you tested positive for a year.</v>

594
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.710
<v Speaker 1>And that was for some gas station Viagara type shit,</v>

595
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 1>not well,</v>

596
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.660
<v Speaker 1>it was actually a couple of anti estrogen drugs.</v>

597
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:46.661
<v Speaker 1>But what was shown and what the evidence pointed to was that he took a pill that</v>

598
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:51.420
<v Speaker 1>was manufactured from a website by the name of all American peptide.</v>

599
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.201
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

600
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:55.740
<v Speaker 1>the pill was reported to be a Cialis pill.</v>

601
00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 1>So when erectile dysfunction pill that was tainted with these two drugs.</v>

602
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:00.961
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

603
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:04.500
<v Speaker 1>the problem with the arbitrator said is if he would have gone to that website</v>

604
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 1>and the arbitrators did and I did,</v>

605
00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>you would have seen that that same website offered,</v>

606
00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:09.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

607
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.180
<v Speaker 1>tons of performance enhanced,</v>

608
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 1>prohibited performance enhancing drugs.</v>

609
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 1>And the website said,</v>

610
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

611
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.100
<v Speaker 1>not for human consumption,</v>

612
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:18.840
<v Speaker 1>for research purposes only.</v>

613
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 1>So it really was careless disregard that being said.</v>

614
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:23.370
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

615
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:23.941
<v Speaker 1>John's,</v>

616
00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:24.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

617
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:29.010
<v Speaker 1>second time through the program now the second sanction this time for,</v>

618
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

619
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.370
<v Speaker 1>an anabolic type steroid would have,</v>

620
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:32.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:18:32.581 --> 00:18:35.520
<v Speaker 1>a starting point potentially have a four year suspension.</v>

622
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a starting point that that could be a starting point,</v>

623
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:38.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

624
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Unless there are mitigating factors.</v>

625
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't,</v>

626
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

627
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

628
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 1>the beauty of this program is it's not the UFC or not me deciding what the</v>

629
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 1>sanctions going to be.</v>

630
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 1>No one can accuse us of,</v>

631
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:49.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

632
00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 1>operating for business purposes or favoritism or whatever.</v>

633
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

634
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.200
<v Speaker 1>but that being said,</v>

635
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:55.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

636
00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:58.320
<v Speaker 1>when we put this program together and figure it out,</v>

637
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

638
00:18:58.591 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 1>what sanctioning would look like.</v>

639
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think that we put up a four year sanction,</v>

640
00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:04.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

641
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.890
<v Speaker 1>for a second term offense when the first term of fence was shown that that</v>

642
00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:08.940
<v Speaker 1>person didn't cheat,</v>

643
00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:09.631
<v Speaker 1>intentionally,</v>

644
00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:11.580
<v Speaker 1>just operated with careless disregard.</v>

645
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:13.470
<v Speaker 1>So who makes that distinction then?</v>

646
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:14.380
<v Speaker 1>You saw the shotgun,</v>

647
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:15.240
<v Speaker 1>makes that distinction.</v>

648
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:15.810
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

649
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:16.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

650
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 1>they have a whole team looking at it.</v>

651
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 1>They compare it to other cases under the Wada,</v>

652
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.871
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

653
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Olympic type umbrella,</v>

654
00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 1>similar cases.</v>

655
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.493
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

656
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I will say this,</v>

657
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:26.700
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

658
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:26.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

659
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I think we've had a few over 60,</v>

660
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

661
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 1>positive adverse events in this case and those that have been adjudicated.</v>

662
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I've been comfortable every time that they've made a fair and balanced and</v>

663
00:19:38.401 --> 00:19:39.420
<v Speaker 1>reasonable decision.</v>

664
00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:43.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of my job is to be the eyes and ears for athletes to make sure</v>

665
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:47.550
<v Speaker 1>not only is the program being administered properly and has strength,</v>

666
00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:51.270
<v Speaker 1>but also that they're being treated fairly and that they have due process.</v>

667
00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:53.550
<v Speaker 1>So I have all the confidence in the world.</v>

668
00:19:53.551 --> 00:19:53.881
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

669
00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:56.280
<v Speaker 1>this does come out that it will be the right decision.</v>

670
00:19:56.281 --> 00:20:00.240
<v Speaker 1>The other really cool thing about the program is the transparency the program.</v>

671
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

672
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:01.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

673
00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>it won't just be me saying this,</v>

674
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.350
<v Speaker 1>however it does come out,</v>

675
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 1>whether it goes to arbitration or whether John and you sought or reach a</v>

676
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:08.574
<v Speaker 1>settlement,</v>

677
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.390
<v Speaker 1>it'll be well spelled out about why that sanction,</v>

678
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:12.811
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

679
00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:13.500
<v Speaker 1>was determined.</v>

680
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Now you say starting point,</v>

681
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:18.090
<v Speaker 1>meaning that it could potentially be more,</v>

682
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:18.721
<v Speaker 1>it could.</v>

683
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

684
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:19.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

685
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 1>when there's something called aggravating circumstances,</v>

686
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:24.960
<v Speaker 1>so more than just knowingly taking the drug,</v>

687
00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.000
<v Speaker 1>taking the drug and lying,</v>

688
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 1>trying to cover it up,</v>

689
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 1>taking multiple drugs,</v>

690
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:31.410
<v Speaker 1>one trying to hide the other.</v>

691
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

692
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:32.431
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

693
00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you could get double,</v>

694
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.523
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

695
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:34.771
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

696
00:20:34.771 --> 00:20:35.640
<v Speaker 1>the sanction amount.</v>

697
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

698
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

699
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:36.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

700
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:37.591
<v Speaker 1>on a second time,</v>

701
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:40.650
<v Speaker 1>anabolic steroid for years is kind of the starting point.</v>

702
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:42.630
<v Speaker 1>You can go lower for mitigating factors.</v>

703
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.990
<v Speaker 1>You can go higher for aggravating factors up to eight years.</v>

704
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

705
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.311
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

706
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would have to require something,</v>

707
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

708
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.580
<v Speaker 1>really severe degree just to get to get up that bad high.</v>

709
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Has anybody ever gotten that hit?</v>

710
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Not In the UFC program.</v>

711
00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

712
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.440
<v Speaker 1>what is the biggest hit that anyone's ever gotten in the Yoh side?</v>

713
00:21:00.441 --> 00:21:01.960
<v Speaker 1>I think thus far it's two years.</v>

714
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And it was that,</v>

715
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

716
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I think a few people,</v>

717
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

718
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Chad Mendez comes to mind.</v>

719
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Chad Mendez,</v>

720
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.880
<v Speaker 1>his was some sort of psoriasis cream or something.</v>

721
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.280
<v Speaker 1>His was an insulin growth factor one.</v>

722
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:16.114
<v Speaker 1>So IGF one.</v>

723
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.410
<v Speaker 1>And did he say that it came from a psoriasis Korean?</v>

724
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I think he may have said that.</v>

725
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

726
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.650
<v Speaker 1>That was never proven or no,</v>

727
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was nothing and you saw it as reasoning or their announcement of</v>

728
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>why it was two years about you know,</v>

729
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.890
<v Speaker 1>any type of mitigating factor coming from,</v>

730
00:21:29.891 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Speaker 1>cause I know he your sunrises and someone had said or had red,</v>

731
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really investigate very deeply into this,</v>

732
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:40.120
<v Speaker 1>but I remember reading that he had put some sort of cream on and then that creem</v>

733
00:21:40.121 --> 00:21:41.920
<v Speaker 1>was responsible for him testing positive.</v>

734
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Was that?</v>

735
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:42.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

736
00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:44.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that's the case.</v>

737
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I do recall him saying that.</v>

738
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:45.971
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

739
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.670
<v Speaker 1>hey an athlete can say anything they wanted about why it happened.</v>

740
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Speaker 1>If there was something mitigating,</v>

741
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.410
<v Speaker 1>they are afforded that right to share with Usada that,</v>

742
00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:55.000
<v Speaker 1>look I didn't do this on purpose.</v>

743
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't on the label,</v>

744
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:56.831
<v Speaker 1>the cream.</v>

745
00:21:56.831 --> 00:22:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Usually in those instances where the evidence does show that you will see,</v>

746
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

747
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.240
<v Speaker 1>a mitigating factor come into play and a reduction in a sanction.</v>

748
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:04.841
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't any,</v>

749
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:08.440
<v Speaker 1>in that case it was the two years and there have been some guys that have gotten</v>

750
00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:09.760
<v Speaker 1>pretty low sentences.</v>

751
00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Like Tim means is a good example,</v>

752
00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:11.531
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

753
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:16.531
<v Speaker 1>Tim Means did take something that was tainted and you guys or you sought a,</v>

754
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 1>got some of those samples from independent stores found out those were also</v>

755
00:22:21.221 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 1>tainted.</v>

756
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:21.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

757
00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Tim means took a supplement.</v>

758
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.383
<v Speaker 1>It was a Kreatin.</v>

759
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

760
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.980
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

761
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.240
<v Speaker 1>after he tested positive,</v>

762
00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:28.601
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

763
00:22:28.601 --> 00:22:31.930
<v Speaker 1>this is where Donna and I come into play quite a bit,</v>

764
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

765
00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:33.820
<v Speaker 1>when athletes test positive,</v>

766
00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:35.530
<v Speaker 1>we reach out to them right away saying,</v>

767
00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:36.364
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

768
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.660
<v Speaker 1>we're here to help you here.</v>

769
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.800
<v Speaker 1>If there's help to be had,</v>

770
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:39.521
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

771
00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 1>will believe you tell you,</v>

772
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Speaker 1>give us a reason not to.</v>

773
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

774
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I did that with Tim.</v>

775
00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Tim said I'd never heard of this substance.</v>

776
00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:46.211
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>

777
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

778
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:47.441
<v Speaker 1>you got to believe me.</v>

779
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:48.274
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take it.</v>

780
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

781
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.061
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

782
00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:50.710
<v Speaker 1>well let's start doing retracing steps.</v>

783
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:51.970
<v Speaker 1>What have you been taken?</v>

784
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

785
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.040
<v Speaker 1>he sent me,</v>

786
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:54.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

787
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe a half dozen supplements,</v>

788
00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.300
<v Speaker 1>did some research on them,</v>

789
00:22:58.301 --> 00:22:58.750
<v Speaker 1>worked,</v>

790
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:59.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

791
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.780
<v Speaker 1>reached out to kind of contacts I still have in the,</v>

792
00:23:01.781 --> 00:23:04.210
<v Speaker 1>in the industry from my law enforcement days and said,</v>

793
00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:04.450
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

794
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 1>any of these kind of raise suspicions.</v>

795
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:10.420
<v Speaker 1>And there was one that did buy a company that made some other kind of sketchy</v>

796
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:11.254
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>

797
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

798
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.730
<v Speaker 1>we narrowed in on that one pretty quickly Senate to Usada too.</v>

799
00:23:15.731 --> 00:23:17.410
<v Speaker 1>A lot of laboratory tested it.</v>

800
00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough it had the substance in it.</v>

801
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

802
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:25.000
<v Speaker 1>then what happens is you saw it a will independently procure some themselves.</v>

803
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.960
<v Speaker 1>So outside of the kind of touch of the athlete to make sure the athletes not</v>

804
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:31.390
<v Speaker 1>contaminating with it for Brighton excuse,</v>

805
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 1>they were able to get some that was sealed and not opened.</v>

806
00:23:34.721 --> 00:23:35.620
<v Speaker 1>And sure enough it,</v>

807
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.490
<v Speaker 1>it had that substance in it and it had the same amount of the substance in it</v>

808
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.730
<v Speaker 1>that kind of matched up with how much was in Tim system.</v>

809
00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:44.510
<v Speaker 1>And when he said he had taken it last.</v>

810
00:23:44.511 --> 00:23:47.660
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of detective work that comes into it and I get,</v>

811
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.760
<v Speaker 1>I get this question a lot from fighters saying,</v>

812
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:50.594
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

813
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.930
<v Speaker 1>the supplement excuse is a bullshit excuse that,</v>

814
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

815
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:58.310
<v Speaker 1>there's athletes use and stuff and they have supplements in their closet that</v>

816
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 1>they know are tainted and then boom,</v>

817
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:01.880
<v Speaker 1>if they test positive,</v>

818
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 1>they just have that built in excuse.</v>

819
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And what I tell them is it,</v>

820
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

821
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.710
<v Speaker 1>it goes deeper than that.</v>

822
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:10.610
<v Speaker 1>There's literally detect scientific detective work that's going on from the</v>

823
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Usada side,</v>

824
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.760
<v Speaker 1>making sure everything matches,</v>

825
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.580
<v Speaker 1>making sure they independently procure the product,</v>

826
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 1>making sure what turns up in the Athlete's system based on when they say they</v>

827
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 1>were taking it matches exactly the level that's in the product based on,</v>

828
00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:25.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

829
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.080
<v Speaker 1>metabolism timings.</v>

830
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's much more than that.</v>

831
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

832
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I do have a lot of confidence when you saw it,</v>

833
00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:31.581
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

834
00:24:31.581 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

835
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.560
<v Speaker 1>it does match that this is,</v>

836
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

837
00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:38.831
<v Speaker 1>came from an unknowingly or unintentional ingestion that it really is that now</v>

838
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 1>in a case like Tim means,</v>

839
00:24:40.551 --> 00:24:42.230
<v Speaker 1>why is he suspended,</v>

840
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:47.440
<v Speaker 1>is if someone does give him a tainted supplement and he takes it in good faith</v>

841
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.940
<v Speaker 1>thinking that it's just creating,</v>

842
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.371
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

843
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

844
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.030
<v Speaker 1>so there are strict liability in the program and you know,</v>

845
00:24:53.031 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 1>they look at all the factors.</v>

846
00:24:54.291 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

847
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

848
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.680
<v Speaker 1>creatine is a relatively low risk product.</v>

849
00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.513
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

850
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.840
<v Speaker 1>the Kreatin Tim took was not third party certified and that,</v>

851
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:03.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

852
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.910
<v Speaker 1>get a lot of questions about,</v>

853
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:05.181
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

854
00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:06.950
<v Speaker 1>the supplement industry is dangerous.</v>

855
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:07.581
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

856
00:25:07.581 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 1>this sucks for,</v>

857
00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.231
<v Speaker 1>for athletes.</v>

858
00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:10.490
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing they can do.</v>

859
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.270
<v Speaker 1>There is something that you can do and it's actually pretty simple to do.</v>

860
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.111
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

861
00:25:15.111 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 1>we were talking earlier about,</v>

862
00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.363
<v Speaker 1>about on it,</v>

863
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

864
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.070
<v Speaker 1>a company you're,</v>

865
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you're involved with and,</v>

866
00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.910
<v Speaker 1>and you guys third party certify a lot of your product.</v>

867
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:27.911
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is you outsource random testing of the product and sampling</v>

868
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:29.294
<v Speaker 1>of the product,</v>

869
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

870
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.770
<v Speaker 1>from these independent companies to make sure they contain no prohibited</v>

871
00:25:33.771 --> 00:25:34.604
<v Speaker 1>substances.</v>

872
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.060
<v Speaker 1>And you know what don and I educate our athletes too,</v>

873
00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:41.570
<v Speaker 1>is you can go to these third party certification companies.</v>

874
00:25:41.571 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I think you guys use Catlins group banned substance control group.</v>

875
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.183
<v Speaker 1>There's that group.</v>

876
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

877
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.170
<v Speaker 1>there's informed choice.</v>

878
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

879
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:54.320
<v Speaker 1>there's NSF for sport and you can go to their websites and they have lists of</v>

880
00:25:54.321 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 1>all certified products and there's hundreds of them.</v>

881
00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:57.990
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

882
00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no excuse that you can't find as,</v>

883
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:01.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

884
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:06.320
<v Speaker 1>UFC athlete products that are tested in an independently certified as banned</v>

885
00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:07.100
<v Speaker 1>substance free.</v>

886
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.750
<v Speaker 1>And if it were the case,</v>

887
00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:11.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's not saying that it couldn't happen because those companies aren't</v>

888
00:26:11.421 --> 00:26:13.970
<v Speaker 1>testing every single bottle of product.</v>

889
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.100
<v Speaker 1>But if you're an athlete,</v>

890
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.140
<v Speaker 1>you take a third party certified product,</v>

891
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.160
<v Speaker 1>you record it,</v>

892
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.053
<v Speaker 1>you log it,</v>

893
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.160
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out to be from that product.</v>

894
00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I think then you're reaching a level where the mitigating factors maybe do get</v>

895
00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 1>you down to no sanction,</v>

896
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:28.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

897
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:30.140
<v Speaker 1>a public warning or something.</v>

898
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

899
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe you shouldn't use supplements at all type of thing.</v>

901
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.141
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

902
00:26:33.141 --> 00:26:36.140
<v Speaker 1>So his error was just taking something that was not third party section and just</v>

903
00:26:36.141 --> 00:26:36.951
<v Speaker 1>not doing his homework.</v>

904
00:26:36.951 --> 00:26:39.770
<v Speaker 1>When a company there's a responsibility for something like that,</v>

905
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.590
<v Speaker 1>six months,</v>

906
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a lot.</v>

907
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 1>But in reality most it's a really,</v>

908
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:46.580
<v Speaker 1>he's really only got about three months off because most fighters after a fight</v>

909
00:26:46.581 --> 00:26:47.810
<v Speaker 1>are going to take a few months off anyway.</v>

910
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems harsh but there is,</v>

911
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:54.390
<v Speaker 1>there is an obligation that fighters need to do their homework and you need to</v>

912
00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:56.790
<v Speaker 1>have a bit of a deterrent there to make sure they do it.</v>

913
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

914
00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.530
<v Speaker 1>and that's that deterrent.</v>

915
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

916
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.340
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I thought was really cool about the EOC performance</v>

917
00:27:02.341 --> 00:27:02.880
<v Speaker 1>institute,</v>

918
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>

919
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.913
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

920
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.900
<v Speaker 1>there's so much cool about that place,</v>

921
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.990
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that was really cool is that you guys have a station where</v>

922
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 1>an athlete can go in and check any sort of substance,</v>

923
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:15.030
<v Speaker 1>any cold medication,</v>

924
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:17.070
<v Speaker 1>they're taking anything type in the name of it.</v>

925
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.130
<v Speaker 1>And it'll tell you on this like giant tablet,</v>

926
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.640
<v Speaker 1>whether or not what you're taking is band.</v>

927
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:22.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

928
00:27:22.991 --> 00:27:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

929
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

930
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.421
<v Speaker 1>it's a kiosk.</v>

931
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 1>So as you sought a kiosk and we have like a little iPad in there and it's</v>

932
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 1>between the locker rooms and the recovery room.</v>

933
00:27:30.721 --> 00:27:33.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's United got your hot cool and your pole cold pool,</v>

934
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

935
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.710
<v Speaker 1>and your sauna and your cryo and all that stuff.</v>

936
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's a constant reminder as our athletes are in that flow between that area.</v>

937
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Cause they all walked through there every day that you saw it as a part of this</v>

938
00:27:45.331 --> 00:27:45.840
<v Speaker 1>sport,</v>

939
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.280
<v Speaker 1>that we're a clean sport,</v>

940
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.470
<v Speaker 1>that you have an obligation to check on medications,</v>

941
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.280
<v Speaker 1>supplements and you have an obligation to file your whereabouts.</v>

942
00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:55.980
<v Speaker 1>They can also file whereabouts at that kiosk.</v>

943
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:58.560
<v Speaker 1>And we get athletes all the time walking down that corridor or saying,</v>

944
00:27:58.561 --> 00:27:59.394
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

945
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to tell you sod.</v>

946
00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I flew out to Las Vegas at the Pi.</v>

947
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

948
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.690
<v Speaker 1>They can get on in a minute or two and update where they're at.</v>

949
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.680
<v Speaker 1>So I have an APP,</v>

950
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:08.520
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

951
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

952
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.481
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

953
00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:10.760
<v Speaker 1>so they can update by APP.</v>

954
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's on your phone as well.</v>

955
00:28:12.031 --> 00:28:13.410
<v Speaker 1>So every quarter,</v>

956
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.950
<v Speaker 1>athletes are required to get on a through a web browser,</v>

957
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 1>what's called the quarterly you saw to whereabouts filing.</v>

958
00:28:19.411 --> 00:28:23.250
<v Speaker 1>They usually have to watch an instructional video most of the time reminders</v>

959
00:28:23.251 --> 00:28:25.020
<v Speaker 1>about smart supplement choices,</v>

960
00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:25.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

961
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:26.671
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

962
00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And then they tell you saw to where they're going to be for the next three</v>

963
00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:30.354
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

964
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.800
<v Speaker 1>And most of the time,</v>

965
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:32.041
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

966
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do Donna and I do the whereabouts filing as well and we both say,</v>

967
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

968
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.250
<v Speaker 1>who knows where I'm going to be next week,</v>

969
00:28:38.251 --> 00:28:40.020
<v Speaker 1>let alone two or three months from now.</v>

970
00:28:40.021 --> 00:28:41.610
<v Speaker 1>But you make your best guess at it.</v>

971
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And then all that information you put,</v>

972
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:44.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

973
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.550
<v Speaker 1>through the web browser is downloaded to your mobile phone app.</v>

974
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.211
<v Speaker 1>So to,</v>

975
00:28:48.211 --> 00:28:51.000
<v Speaker 1>as your plans change over the next couple of weeks,</v>

976
00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:51.834
<v Speaker 1>couple of months,</v>

977
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you can do 45 second to one minute updates through your mobile app.</v>

978
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

979
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.110
<v Speaker 1>so the convenience is there.</v>

980
00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 1>There's really no excuse and not letting you saw to know,</v>

981
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:02.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

982
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.443
<v Speaker 1>where you're at.</v>

983
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.450
<v Speaker 1>There are repercussions if you don't let them know where you're at.</v>

984
00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

985
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.520
<v Speaker 1>because you want to avoid somebody,</v>

986
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:08.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

987
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.350
<v Speaker 1>ducking and dodging a test.</v>

988
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:15.390
<v Speaker 1>But no cowboy had a situation where he was actually in Vegas at the fights and</v>

989
00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:18.720
<v Speaker 1>they were mad at him cause he didn't say that he was going to be in Vegas.</v>

990
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:19.081
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

991
00:29:19.081 --> 00:29:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the fucking fights,</v>

992
00:29:20.581 --> 00:29:21.211
<v Speaker 1>I'm right here.</v>

993
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:22.044
<v Speaker 1>I'm on TV.</v>

994
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Don and I do everything we can to try to let you saw to know that when we know</v>

995
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.980
<v Speaker 1>that a fighter has a UFC obligation,</v>

996
00:29:28.981 --> 00:29:30.990
<v Speaker 1>so whether they're our guests fight or on the road,</v>

997
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:31.853
<v Speaker 1>whether they're,</v>

998
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

999
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 1>add a competition,</v>

1000
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.910
<v Speaker 1>we're always passing that information along to you saw that.</v>

1001
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:40.080
<v Speaker 1>But we also tell them that ultimately it's your responsibility as an athlete</v>

1002
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.141
<v Speaker 1>will try to,</v>

1003
00:29:41.141 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1004
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 1>we can't guarantee it ultimately was going to fall on you if you don't update.</v>

1005
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Now the good thing about this,</v>

1006
00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 1>as you're afforded a couple of mistakes under the whereabouts program,</v>

1007
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.610
<v Speaker 1>so it's not until three whereabouts,</v>

1008
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:55.000
<v Speaker 1>failures in any rolling 12 month period that there can be sanctions.</v>

1009
00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Because honestly,</v>

1010
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1011
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 1>things happen in your life.</v>

1012
00:29:58.811 --> 00:29:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's human.</v>

1013
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you forget.</v>

1014
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you the perfect example.</v>

1015
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:03.341
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

1016
00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 1>getting back to Donna,</v>

1017
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.493
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

1018
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:06.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1019
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.670
<v Speaker 1>attention to detail person that I've ever worked with him at working career,</v>

1020
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:11.560
<v Speaker 1>she comes over joints,</v>

1021
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.060
<v Speaker 1>kind of our program here.</v>

1022
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 1>We get her signed up for whereabouts.</v>

1023
00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.371
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1024
00:30:15.371 --> 00:30:16.030
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

1025
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I can talk knowledgeably about how to do this.</v>

1026
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.820
<v Speaker 1>We went out to Anaheim for UFC,</v>

1027
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I forget what number that was.</v>

1028
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1029
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.550
<v Speaker 1>we take a trip down from Anaheim to San Diego.</v>

1030
00:30:27.551 --> 00:30:30.490
<v Speaker 1>We went down to this clinic that we were checking out for brain therapy.</v>

1031
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.550
<v Speaker 1>She forgot to update that she was going to San Diego.</v>

1032
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:36.670
<v Speaker 1>She was more than two hours outside of where she was supposed to be,</v>

1033
00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 1>where you sought a new shoe was going to be,</v>

1034
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.690
<v Speaker 1>she would've gotten a whereabouts failure again.</v>

1035
00:30:40.691 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 1>One of the mills responsible people that I've ever been around goes to show that</v>

1036
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.210
<v Speaker 1>it's challenging and in,</v>

1037
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Speaker 1>so she has to notify where she's going to be.</v>

1038
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.870
<v Speaker 1>We do it voluntarily just so we can talk knowledgeably to our athletes.</v>

1039
00:30:52.871 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 1>So when they say,</v>

1040
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.251
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1041
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:55.750
<v Speaker 1>this is too hard,</v>

1042
00:30:55.751 --> 00:30:56.081
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

1043
00:30:56.081 --> 00:30:56.441
<v Speaker 1>we say,</v>

1044
00:30:56.441 --> 00:30:57.191
<v Speaker 1>well we do,</v>

1045
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:58.090
<v Speaker 1>we do it right?</v>

1046
00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:58.781
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

1048
00:30:58.781 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 1>here's a little trick that I had to remind myself,</v>

1049
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:01.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.820
<v Speaker 1>each day where I said I'm going to be at things like that.</v>

1051
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Now when you have a fighter like a Holly Holm I think said she was tested nine</v>

1052
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:11.200
<v Speaker 1>times in preparation for this fight against Cyborg.</v>

1053
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.220
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

1054
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.510
<v Speaker 1>when that happens,</v>

1055
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.373
<v Speaker 1>is there a,</v>

1056
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't say when the test is going to happen because it won't be</v>

1057
00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:19.774
<v Speaker 1>random,</v>

1058
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 1>but is there any consideration about the sleep cycle of the fighters?</v>

1059
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:23.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1060
00:31:23.561 --> 00:31:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

1061
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you saw it.</v>

1063
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.550
<v Speaker 1>It never lets me know when a test is coming.</v>

1064
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I have zero input in terms of who's being tested and that is the reality.</v>

1065
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:36.050
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times they show up five 36 in the morning show up,</v>

1066
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>really suck if fighters,</v>

1067
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.190
<v Speaker 1>there is no doubt about it.</v>

1068
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:39.941
<v Speaker 1>The bird and this,</v>

1069
00:31:39.941 --> 00:31:40.510
<v Speaker 1>the urine,</v>

1070
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:40.711
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

1071
00:31:40.711 --> 00:31:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Just a urine test can be blood as well.</v>

1072
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:42.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1073
00:31:42.881 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're dead asleep.</v>

1074
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Six in the morning,</v>

1075
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.010
<v Speaker 1>someone's knocking at your front door.</v>

1076
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.420
<v Speaker 1>That's scary shit to begin with,</v>

1077
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:49.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1078
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.040
<v Speaker 1>You go downstairs,</v>

1079
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:51.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1080
00:31:51.671 --> 00:31:53.170
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to get ready for a fight,</v>

1081
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.430
<v Speaker 1>prepare yourself,</v>

1082
00:31:54.431 --> 00:31:55.750
<v Speaker 1>sleep wise mentally,</v>

1083
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.340
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to have a needle stuck in.</v>

1084
00:31:57.341 --> 00:31:58.510
<v Speaker 1>You had to get to draw blood,</v>

1085
00:31:58.690 --> 00:31:59.920
<v Speaker 1>wait until you got to take a pee.</v>

1086
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Could be,</v>

1087
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1088
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.200
<v Speaker 1>some fighters wait hours.</v>

1089
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1090
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1091
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't think enough attention is being paid to the burden that's on the</v>

1092
00:32:08.471 --> 00:32:09.460
<v Speaker 1>athletes and the credit.</v>

1093
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:11.080
<v Speaker 1>They should be getting a Holly Holm.</v>

1094
00:32:11.081 --> 00:32:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw,</v>

1095
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just a statistic that she's the most tested athlete since the inception of</v>

1096
00:32:15.941 --> 00:32:16.774
<v Speaker 1>the program.</v>

1097
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.560
<v Speaker 1>I think she's around 32 or 33 samples that she's provided.</v>

1098
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1099
00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:22.114
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1100
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:23.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1101
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:27.070
<v Speaker 1>but that I think she should not enough credit is given to her.</v>

1102
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>

1103
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.340
<v Speaker 1>they test her so many times because she know,</v>

1104
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard any suspicions of her being no,</v>

1105
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.693
<v Speaker 1>neither have I.</v>

1106
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.630
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1107
00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I think as you look at the testing statistics,</v>

1108
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:39.470
<v Speaker 1>and that's another cool thing about program.</v>

1109
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:40.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know that,</v>

1110
00:32:40.371 --> 00:32:41.660
<v Speaker 1>but all these tests,</v>

1111
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:43.160
<v Speaker 1>numbers are publicly available.</v>

1112
00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 1>So the transparency and this program is unprecedented,</v>

1113
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 1>unparalleled as it comes to professional sports.</v>

1114
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:53.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no other professional sport on the planet where you or I as a fan of the</v>

1115
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:55.010
<v Speaker 1>UFC could say,</v>

1116
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.200
<v Speaker 1>let me see how many times Holly's been tested,</v>

1117
00:32:57.201 --> 00:32:59.120
<v Speaker 1>how many times Cyborg's been tested.</v>

1118
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 1>That's unparalleled.</v>

1119
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1120
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.950
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at those numbers and allocation,</v>

1121
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:04.730
<v Speaker 1>we look at them.</v>

1122
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I think those athletes with staying power,</v>

1123
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.720
<v Speaker 1>those athletes that are at the tops of their division have more tests directed</v>

1124
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:12.560
<v Speaker 1>to them versus,</v>

1125
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:12.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1126
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:14.720
<v Speaker 1>athletes at the bottom that are jumping in and out.</v>

1127
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:15.321
<v Speaker 1>They want to make,</v>

1128
00:33:15.321 --> 00:33:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I think you sought a good use of their resources to make sure that they're</v>

1129
00:33:18.801 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 1>directing most of those tests.</v>

1130
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Those athletes are going to be around for awhile.</v>

1131
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

1132
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 1>we saw what a bad ass Holly is on,</v>

1133
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.370
<v Speaker 1>on Saturday night.</v>

1134
00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Speaker 1>That woman's incredible.</v>

1135
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.573
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1136
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1137
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I think Sida probably realizes that too.</v>

1138
00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:32.720
<v Speaker 1>And she's going to be around for a while and wants to set,</v>

1139
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:33.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1140
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:34.401
<v Speaker 1>an example,</v>

1141
00:33:34.401 --> 00:33:36.050
<v Speaker 1>and I tell athletes a lot,</v>

1142
00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:36.351
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

1143
00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:36.531
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1144
00:33:36.531 --> 00:33:36.771
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1145
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:38.180
<v Speaker 1>this is a badge of honor.</v>

1146
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:39.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1147
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a burden,</v>

1148
00:33:40.191 --> 00:33:43.910
<v Speaker 1>but man that makes you even more special of an athlete that you,</v>

1149
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.390
<v Speaker 1>take that burden on and embrace it and,</v>

1151
00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.890
<v Speaker 1>and show the world that you're,</v>

1152
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:49.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1153
00:33:49.161 --> 00:33:51.470
<v Speaker 1>not only a bad ass athlete but you're doing this clean.</v>

1154
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I thought was really fascinating about the UFC</v>

1155
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 1>performance institute is that machine will,</v>

1156
00:33:56.421 --> 00:34:01.421
<v Speaker 1>you lie down and it scans your entire body and it shows where your muscle</v>

1157
00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:02.730
<v Speaker 1>imbalances are and like what,</v>

1158
00:34:02.731 --> 00:34:02.991
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

1159
00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:05.540
<v Speaker 1>what are all the different details I think focuses on.</v>

1160
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:05.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean we talked about this when he toured it,</v>

1162
00:34:07.701 --> 00:34:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to get,</v>

1163
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:11.210
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get some of the personnel from the Pii in there that can really</v>

1164
00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:13.040
<v Speaker 1>talk knowledgeably and have,</v>

1165
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1166
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:14.420
<v Speaker 1>that education,</v>

1167
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bring those guys in.</v>

1168
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.813
<v Speaker 1>They're going to come on.</v>

1169
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Not only is that,</v>

1170
00:34:18.921 --> 00:34:21.230
<v Speaker 1>as you saw at that facility world class,</v>

1171
00:34:21.231 --> 00:34:25.100
<v Speaker 1>but they staffed it with the perfect worldclass personnel.</v>

1172
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.830
<v Speaker 1>So that machines called a Dexa scan and you know,</v>

1173
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't give it the justice that the personnel can there,</v>

1174
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.560
<v Speaker 1>but it yet measures body composition.</v>

1175
00:34:33.561 --> 00:34:34.490
<v Speaker 1>So it will measure,</v>

1176
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:34.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1177
00:34:34.851 --> 00:34:35.470
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

1178
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1179
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.920
<v Speaker 1>hydration levels,</v>

1180
00:34:36.921 --> 00:34:37.850
<v Speaker 1>bone density,</v>

1181
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:38.923
<v Speaker 1>bone density,</v>

1182
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:40.340
<v Speaker 1>and as it is it,</v>

1183
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Speaker 1>how's it doing that some type of low level x-ray.</v>

1184
00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:44.751
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1185
00:34:44.751 --> 00:34:47.360
<v Speaker 1>you got to get those guys in there to describe it specifically.</v>

1186
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:48.670
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1187
00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure as a topic we'll cover today the whole weight issue being in the proper</v>

1188
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:56.150
<v Speaker 1>weight class and weight cutting the both the,</v>

1189
00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.140
<v Speaker 1>the equipment and now the personnel in place of the performance institute that</v>

1190
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.560
<v Speaker 1>there's no excuse for an athlete to not a fine their way,</v>

1191
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.300
<v Speaker 1>right way class and B,</v>

1192
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:06.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1193
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:06.770
<v Speaker 1>safely,</v>

1194
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:07.670
<v Speaker 1>efficiently,</v>

1195
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:08.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1196
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.410
<v Speaker 1>meet that weight goal.</v>

1197
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1198
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.211
<v Speaker 1>when they're fighting,</v>

1199
00:35:11.211 --> 00:35:12.920
<v Speaker 1>everything is in place now there for that.</v>

1200
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Now when a fighter comes to you guys and,</v>

1201
00:35:16.631 --> 00:35:18.890
<v Speaker 1>and lies down in that machine and,</v>

1202
00:35:18.891 --> 00:35:19.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1203
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you read their hydration levels and say they're slightly dehydrated and yet</v>

1204
00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:26.420
<v Speaker 1>there's still 10 pounds above the weight class,</v>

1205
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.530
<v Speaker 1>how do you handle that?</v>

1206
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.400
<v Speaker 1>So we have a director of sports nutrition guy by name of Clint Wattenberg and</v>

1207
00:35:32.401 --> 00:35:32.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1208
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Clint was a division one all American at Cornell,</v>

1209
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Ivy League educated,</v>

1210
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.630
<v Speaker 2>smart as hell.</v>

1211
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:40.231
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1212
00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 2>went on to wrestle with team USA.</v>

1213
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 2>It's actually wrestled with a lot of our fighters have had several conversations</v>

1214
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:48.340
<v Speaker 2>about with guys that,</v>

1215
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.370
<v Speaker 2>that wrestled him before Clinton came here.</v>

1216
00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:51.140
<v Speaker 2>So he's got,</v>

1217
00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:51.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1218
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.250
<v Speaker 2>a ton of pure respect for that.</v>

1219
00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm Super Smart Guy,</v>

1220
00:35:55.531 --> 00:35:56.580
<v Speaker 2>but yet he works,</v>

1221
00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:56.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1222
00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.170
<v Speaker 2>he'd be the guy to ask.</v>

1223
00:35:58.171 --> 00:35:58.620
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1224
00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1225
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Ivy League educated,</v>

1226
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1227
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 2>in sports nutrition and in a situation like that,</v>

1228
00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.200
<v Speaker 2>that he's,</v>

1229
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:06.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1230
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.650
<v Speaker 2>given advice to the fighters about how the importance of hydration and trying to</v>

1231
00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:12.990
<v Speaker 2>change that around so that they can meet those goals.</v>

1232
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:13.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1233
00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:14.220
<v Speaker 2>there's the machine right there.</v>

1234
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1235
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 2>what is it called?</v>

1236
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Dual energy x-ray absorbed appsource beyond tree.</v>

1237
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:22.763
<v Speaker 2>How do you say that?</v>

1238
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.180
<v Speaker 2>We call it Dexa scan,</v>

1239
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.510
<v Speaker 2>sore geometry.</v>

1240
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.650
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like something that like someone would say in a cartoon,</v>

1241
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.850
<v Speaker 2>like a fake word.</v>

1242
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 2>It measures body composition including lean mass,</v>

1243
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:33.301
<v Speaker 2>muscle tissue,</v>

1244
00:36:33.301 --> 00:36:34.650
<v Speaker 2>fat mass and bone density.</v>

1245
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Measuring and tracking all three of these components is important for weight</v>

1246
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.100
<v Speaker 2>class sport athletes and helps guide nutrition recommendations.</v>

1247
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating stuff.</v>

1248
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.170
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1249
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:43.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1250
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.050
<v Speaker 2>it just sort of scans over.</v>

1251
00:36:45.051 --> 00:36:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.170
<v Speaker 2>How long has that test take?</v>

1253
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:46.780
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1254
00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:46.971
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

1255
00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:49.020
<v Speaker 2>I've never gone through it or actually never seen it.</v>

1256
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I've got to get over there and check it out.</v>

1257
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.063
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

1258
00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.660
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting with Forrest was t doing,</v>

1259
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Forrest Griffin was telling me that uh,</v>

1260
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.680
<v Speaker 2>when he had it done,</v>

1261
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.980
<v Speaker 2>he found out that one of his legs has two pounds more muscle than the other leg</v>

1262
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.500
<v Speaker 2>because he had had some knee injuries and you really had no idea.</v>

1263
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:01.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1264
00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:02.634
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1265
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1266
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:03.500
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1267
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.950
<v Speaker 2>so forest is a big part of that.</v>

1268
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Performance Institute was a big part of,</v>

1269
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1270
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.710
<v Speaker 2>touring other facilities around the world.</v>

1271
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.720
<v Speaker 2>I think him and James Campbell,</v>

1272
00:37:12.721 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 2>who's our VP of operations at the Pii,</v>

1273
00:37:14.641 --> 00:37:19.350
<v Speaker 2>went to 61 or 62 facilities throughout the world and took would they believe</v>

1274
00:37:19.351 --> 00:37:23.250
<v Speaker 2>were the best parts of these facilities and put them all to one and forces role</v>

1275
00:37:23.251 --> 00:37:23.880
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1276

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1279
00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:29.160
<v Speaker 2>kind of similar to my role in the anti-doping program and advocate for our</v>

1280
00:37:29.161 --> 00:37:29.994
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>

1281
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:34.710

1282
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:35.390
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

1283

<v Speaker 2>your body composition.</v>

1299
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.530
<v Speaker 2>You then have a meeting with Clint,</v>

1300
00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:03.900
<v Speaker 2>talk about nutrition and goals.</v>

1301
00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Maybe go see the physical therapist,</v>

1302
00:38:06.021 --> 00:38:09.840
<v Speaker 2>talk about any issues you have and therapy you need.</v>

1303
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Go work out with our strength and conditioning coach both Sandovall it puts you</v>

1304
00:38:13.621 --> 00:38:14.280
<v Speaker 2>through the,</v>

1305
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.680
<v Speaker 2>the ringers and the equipment there and then do a little recovery after that</v>

1306
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.340
<v Speaker 2>that really gave you the full experience.</v>

1307
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1308
00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:23.340
<v Speaker 2>that place is amazing how you guys get it set up and it's,</v>

1309
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.040
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

1310
00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1311
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1312
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.220
<v Speaker 2>a massive resource for fighters that if,</v>

1313
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.350
<v Speaker 2>because there's a lot of great Jim's out there,</v>

1314
00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:35.230
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think I've ever seen one that's that well equipped that you guys</v>

1315
00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 2>have everything.</v>

1316
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.790
<v Speaker 2>You have a complete strength and conditioning system,</v>

1317
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:40.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1318
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

1319
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 2>And then you have a complete area for,</v>

1320
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 2>with heavy bags,</v>

1321
00:38:44.741 --> 00:38:46.960
<v Speaker 2>a cage boxing ring,</v>

1322
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:49.240
<v Speaker 2>and then you have a complete recovery area.</v>

1323
00:38:49.241 --> 00:38:50.920
<v Speaker 2>You have cryo machines,</v>

1324
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:51.690
<v Speaker 2>you have that,</v>

1325
00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.020
<v Speaker 2>what does that light machine?</v>

1326
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1327
00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:58.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like low level laser light therapy that looks like a giant tanning bed that</v>

1328
00:38:58.361 --> 00:38:58.871
<v Speaker 2>you get in.</v>

1329
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:00.490
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen that thing before.</v>

1330
00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 2>And what does that supposed to do?</v>

1331
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:05.670
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to somehow or another stimulate that work on your recovery and in</v>

1332
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 2>at the cellular level.</v>

1333
00:39:06.701 --> 00:39:07.001
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1334
00:39:07.001 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 2>you need to get these,</v>

1335
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.840
<v Speaker 2>these Pi personnel in here to,</v>

1336
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 2>to explain it in detail,</v>

1337
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.730
<v Speaker 2>you guys even have sleep pods,</v>

1338
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.380
<v Speaker 2>which I thought it was the craziest thing ever.</v>

1339
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 2>It was so like if a fighter just has like an hour to chill,</v>

1340
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.570
<v Speaker 2>they can just get in there and recover and relax.</v>

1341
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1342
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea is you come to the performance institute.</v>

1343
00:39:22.541 --> 00:39:22.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1344
00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:26.530
<v Speaker 2>They're there and don't get dope and I hear this all the time.</v>

1345
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:26.750
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1346
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:27.700
<v Speaker 2>they see the,</v>

1347
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:28.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1348
00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 2>the equipment,</v>

1349
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.120
<v Speaker 2>the personnel that's available to them.</v>

1350
00:39:31.121 --> 00:39:34.730
<v Speaker 2>They see when it's time to unwind that they have a room like this to relax in.</v>

1351
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:35.231
<v Speaker 2>They see you.</v>

1352
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:39.640
<v Speaker 2>They have free use of the cafeteria and custom cook meals.</v>

1353
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.900
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to leave the place.</v>

1354
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.130
<v Speaker 2>They're there all day long.</v>

1355
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Frances and Ghana,</v>

1356
00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.773
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1357
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Lives has lived there the last six months.</v>

1358
00:39:47.081 --> 00:39:51.070
<v Speaker 2>There's a running joke in the office at Francis has constantly walking around</v>

1359
00:39:51.071 --> 00:39:52.480
<v Speaker 2>the office in between workouts.</v>

1360
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:52.691
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1361
00:39:52.691 --> 00:39:53.051
<v Speaker 2>Francis,</v>

1362
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:54.510
<v Speaker 2>we got to get you an office here or something like that.</v>

1363
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:55.893
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

1364
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1365
00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.190
<v Speaker 2>that's the guy you saw.</v>

1366
00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean the dude move to la,</v>

1367
00:39:59.921 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 2>he saw the place and he moved up and moved everything he had.</v>

1368
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he knew anybody in Las Vegas or not any friends there.</v>

1369
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Cause he's,</v>

1370
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.900
<v Speaker 2>he's just walking around the office all day long when he's not at the Pi from</v>

1371
00:40:10.901 --> 00:40:11.470
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>

1372
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:12.303
<v Speaker 2>from France,</v>

1373
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:13.300
<v Speaker 2>from another country.</v>

1374
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:14.650
<v Speaker 2>He said exactly.</v>

1375
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.910
<v Speaker 2>But you know the perfect example of seeing what that place could do for him and</v>

1376
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.250
<v Speaker 2>that's available to every single fight or on the roster.</v>

1377
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:21.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1378
00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's nothing like it.</v>

1379
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:27.820
<v Speaker 2>And my prediction is that the UFC is going to be the hub where most people live.</v>

1380
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's wrong there is the altitude.</v>

1381
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing that's wrong.</v>

1382
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:36.780
<v Speaker 2>And I know you guys have a hypoxic room where you can stimulate or simulate a</v>

1383
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:37.660
<v Speaker 2>high altitude.</v>

1384
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1385
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 2>I think 22,000 feet,</v>

1386
00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:40.990
<v Speaker 2>but isn't the way you're supposed to do it?</v>

1387
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.180
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to work at sea level,</v>

1388
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.830
<v Speaker 2>but sleep at high altitude.</v>

1389
00:40:44.831 --> 00:40:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that how it's supposed to be?</v>

1390
00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:46.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it is.</v>

1391
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:47.750
<v Speaker 2>You know what Does Bay,</v>

1392
00:40:47.751 --> 00:40:50.080
<v Speaker 2>so 2,500 3000 feet,</v>

1393
00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:51.510
<v Speaker 2>so it even isn't really,</v>

1394
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:52.180
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

1395
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know it was that high.</v>

1396
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

1397
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.713
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1398
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a little low.</v>

1399
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was like c level cause it's like desert.</v>

1400
00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:58.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1401
00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:58.750
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1402
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.931
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1403
00:40:58.931 --> 00:40:59.764
<v Speaker 2>It's got a little bit out.</v>

1404
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I know Nevada has some good mountain areas though.</v>

1405
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Just outside were guys can run and do things like that.</v>

1406
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1407
00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Does,</v>

1408
00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.540
<v Speaker 2>does the performance institute take people on any tracks or anything like that?</v>

1409
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we've gotten to that level yet.</v>

1410
00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:13.390
<v Speaker 2>I got to be a good thing to do.</v>

1411
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1412
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Could make to red rocks for runs.</v>

1413
00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:15.680
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

1414
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.513
<v Speaker 2>It's a good idea.</v>

1415
00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just think that if really high level coaches start moving there and</v>

1416
00:41:20.441 --> 00:41:22.610
<v Speaker 2>obviously we just lost one of the best Robert Follis,</v>

1417
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.800
<v Speaker 2>which is a huge,</v>

1418
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.061
<v Speaker 2>huge loss.</v>

1419
00:41:25.061 --> 00:41:27.490
<v Speaker 2>And what a great guy and say,</v>

1420
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean universally nicest guy ever and it was a great deal.</v>

1421
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:31.384
<v Speaker 2>Universally loved,</v>

1422
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 2>very few people that are fight coaches that are universally</v>

1423
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.670
<v Speaker 1>loved.</v>

1424
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:35.660
<v Speaker 1>And Robert Really was.</v>

1425
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:36.590
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1426
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:36.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1427
00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Vegas has some good coaches,</v>

1428
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:41.810
<v Speaker 1>but I anticipate more and more gyms moving and relocating there and bring</v>

1429
00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 1>fighters there because I just think high level fighters going to see that place</v>

1430
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:45.110
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

1431
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:49.430
<v Speaker 1>how can I recreate this anywhere without fucking millions and millions of</v>

1432
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 1>dollars?</v>

1433
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.181
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1434
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:50.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1435
00:41:50.421 --> 00:41:51.500
<v Speaker 1>we love to see that happen.</v>

1436
00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:51.711
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1437
00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:51.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1438
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:52.790
<v Speaker 1>a good low cost,</v>

1439
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 1>relatively low cost of living area.</v>

1440
00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1441
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.250
<v Speaker 1>so it's a place that's affordable and uh,</v>

1442
00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:58.641
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1443
00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I think he spent a little bit of time with the Pii and see what you can do,</v>

1444
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 1>what it can do for you as a UFC athlete.</v>

1445
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:04.161
<v Speaker 1>And just when I was,</v>

1446
00:42:04.161 --> 00:42:04.311
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1447
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:04.790
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

1448
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:05.780
<v Speaker 1>I think the other cool thing,</v>

1449
00:42:05.781 --> 00:42:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and I know Dunkin French,</v>

1450
00:42:07.341 --> 00:42:08.600
<v Speaker 1>he's doctor Dunkin France.</v>

1451
00:42:08.601 --> 00:42:10.580
<v Speaker 1>She's our VP of performance,</v>

1452
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:11.443
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1453
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.770
<v Speaker 1>there and a,</v>

1454
00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:17.120
<v Speaker 1>which he explained it a little bit to you about is that not only are we looking</v>

1455
00:42:17.121 --> 00:42:22.121
<v Speaker 1>to influence the UFC athlete but also influenced positively and I may the whole</v>

1456
00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 1>the entire sport and what you're seeing is UFC athletes can come in there and</v>

1457
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:27.801
<v Speaker 1>use it,</v>

1458
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 1>but they can also bring along with them training partners,</v>

1459
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:31.850
<v Speaker 1>coaches,</v>

1460
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.081
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1461
00:42:33.081 --> 00:42:35.030
<v Speaker 1>we're only seven or eight months into this,</v>

1462
00:42:35.031 --> 00:42:36.620
<v Speaker 1>but what we've already seen as,</v>

1463
00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:36.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1464
00:42:36.861 --> 00:42:38.150
<v Speaker 1>training ideas,</v>

1465
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.830
<v Speaker 1>proper nutrition,</v>

1466
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.110
<v Speaker 1>going back out to these gyms,</v>

1467
00:42:42.111 --> 00:42:44.510
<v Speaker 1>not only across the u s but across the world.</v>

1468
00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:49.540
<v Speaker 1>So we definitely hope to be a positive influence throughout all of them and May</v>

1469
00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:50.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1470
00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:50.943
<v Speaker 1>and really,</v>

1471
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.070
<v Speaker 1>really grow the sport.</v>

1472
00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1473
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I saw that with Bobby Green,</v>

1474
00:42:53.541 --> 00:42:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Green who was there,</v>

1475
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I brought a couple of his training partners and just on a random day,</v>

1476
00:42:57.591 --> 00:42:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Wilson Hayes was there,</v>

1477
00:42:58.851 --> 00:43:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Angela Hill was there.</v>

1478
00:43:00.111 --> 00:43:01.790
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a few cycles thing ever.</v>

1479
00:43:01.791 --> 00:43:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

1480
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll go over there when I'm in the office multiple times a day just to see who's</v>

1481
00:43:06.261 --> 00:43:08.420
<v Speaker 1>in there that day and have,</v>

1482
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:08.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1483
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.381
<v Speaker 1>that five,</v>

1484
00:43:09.381 --> 00:43:14.330
<v Speaker 1>10 minute conversation with a Wilson Hayes that he knows me going forward in the</v>

1485
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:18.110
<v Speaker 1>future and that Jeff's a cool guy and when that medication or supplement</v>

1486
00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:19.190
<v Speaker 1>question comes up,</v>

1487
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:20.930
<v Speaker 1>he's talked to me before,</v>

1488
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 1>he knows who I am is not afraid to pick up the phone and asked me that question</v>

1489
00:43:24.141 --> 00:43:24.974
<v Speaker 1>versus hey,</v>

1490
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.150
<v Speaker 1>this golden snitch character,</v>

1491
00:43:26.151 --> 00:43:26.984
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1492
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who this guy is not going to call him or trust him.</v>

1493
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a big part of what I do is try to develop those pet trusts.</v>

1494
00:43:32.721 --> 00:43:36.830
<v Speaker 1>So thanks to shop or send me back about two and a half years were developed in</v>

1495
00:43:36.831 --> 00:43:39.080
<v Speaker 1>that trust and a nickname that doesn't even make sense.</v>

1496
00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.640
<v Speaker 1>It literally doesn't make sense.</v>

1497
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.660
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny.</v>

1498
00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1499
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.970
<v Speaker 1>is there any other plans to expand or do more things with the institute?</v>

1500
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.481
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>

1501
00:43:47.481 --> 00:43:48.740
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't show you this,</v>

1502
00:43:48.741 --> 00:43:52.010
<v Speaker 1>but there are other areas upstairs for that very reason.</v>

1503
00:43:52.011 --> 00:43:56.030
<v Speaker 1>They thought about hey technology and a couple of years or maybe new machines or</v>

1504
00:43:56.031 --> 00:43:58.370
<v Speaker 1>devices that come onto line that we may want.</v>

1505
00:43:58.371 --> 00:44:00.770
<v Speaker 1>So there is additional room for expansion there.</v>

1506
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I talked to you guys and I talked to Duncan about a tank,</v>

1507
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.840
<v Speaker 1>about you guys getting tanks in there.</v>

1508
00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1509
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.850
<v Speaker 1>s sensory deprivation tanks.</v>

1510
00:44:07.851 --> 00:44:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be massive.</v>

1511
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of football teams are using them now and it's starting to spread,</v>

1512
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1513
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 1>excellent source of magnesium because you're absorbing it through the skin.</v>

1514
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:18.260
<v Speaker 1>But just for relaxation recuperation.</v>

1515
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I would be fascinated to see if you guys had those.</v>

1516
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of results you'd yeah,</v>

1517
00:44:23.431 --> 00:44:24.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sounded to me,</v>

1518
00:44:24.231 --> 00:44:25.640
<v Speaker 1>and I was there when you're talking about it,</v>

1519
00:44:25.641 --> 00:44:28.360
<v Speaker 1>that Dunkin was open to it and it was talking about some research,</v>

1520
00:44:28.361 --> 00:44:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I think you said Ohio State University is conducting some research on the</v>

1521
00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:32.131
<v Speaker 1>benefits of that.</v>

1522
00:44:32.131 --> 00:44:34.290
<v Speaker 1>So I know there's tanks in Vegas now.</v>

1523
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a place in Vegas,</v>

1524
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:38.970
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sure whoever runs that tank thing going to reach out to me.</v>

1525
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:40.740
<v Speaker 1>So I want to get you in touch with them.</v>

1526
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:42.060
<v Speaker 1>And how just have you try it.</v>

1527
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Just see if,</v>

1528
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:43.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1529
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:44.281
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1530
00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:45.170
<v Speaker 1>just to get a beat on his,</v>

1531
00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:48.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a freaky experience and it's really good for your body.</v>

1532
00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Just everything like in your back.</v>

1533
00:44:50.341 --> 00:44:53.700
<v Speaker 1>We'll just sort of just loosen up because you're essentially zero gravity.</v>

1534
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.533
<v Speaker 1>You're floating.</v>

1535
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:54.871
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1536
00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:57.750
<v Speaker 1>everything's sort of pops and loosens up and it's amazing.</v>

1537
00:44:57.751 --> 00:44:58.021
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>

1538
00:44:58.021 --> 00:44:58.491
<v Speaker 1>I want to try it.</v>

1539
00:44:58.491 --> 00:44:59.590
<v Speaker 1>I saw yours a little bit ago.</v>

1540
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.180
<v Speaker 1>It's little,</v>

1541
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.250
<v Speaker 1>little intimidating or scary and looking weird person.</v>

1542
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.620
<v Speaker 1>My wife made me move it out of the basement.</v>

1543
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I had one in the basement.</v>

1544
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:06.571
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1545
00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:07.261
<v Speaker 1>people come over,</v>

1546
00:45:07.261 --> 00:45:08.094
<v Speaker 1>they think you're afraid.</v>

1547
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm a freak.</v>

1548
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:11.100
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1549
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind it I think is pretty sound and I think,</v>

1550
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:14.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1551
00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:16.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of benefits for it,</v>

1552
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1553
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:19.740
<v Speaker 1>for fighters as far as concentrating on technique as well.</v>

1554
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an amazing place to focus on strategy and game plans and movement</v>

1555
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:25.740
<v Speaker 1>and things along those lines.</v>

1556
00:45:25.741 --> 00:45:29.580
<v Speaker 1>We can visualize one of the most amazing things with the sport and I,</v>

1557
00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:29.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1558
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.020
<v Speaker 1>coming over to the UFC,</v>

1559
00:45:31.021 --> 00:45:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I call myself a fringe fan.</v>

1560
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm Alec follow it a little bit,</v>

1561
00:45:34.591 --> 00:45:35.310
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

1562
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:35.941
<v Speaker 1>I'm hook,</v>

1563
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:37.470
<v Speaker 1>line and sinker into the sport now.</v>

1564
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And the most remarkable thing I find about the sport is the mental game.</v>

1565
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:47.960
<v Speaker 1>It is the most incredible mental game of any athlete in any sport in the world.</v>

1566
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:55.010
<v Speaker 1>When you're walking out into an octagon and facing one of the baddest mixed</v>

1567
00:45:55.021 --> 00:45:56.940
<v Speaker 1>martial artists and the planet.</v>

1568
00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.530
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1569
00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I know you've seen a ton of fights over your career,</v>

1570
00:46:01.441 --> 00:46:02.800
<v Speaker 1>but I think one thing that,</v>

1571
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.190
<v Speaker 1>that I've seen the two and a half years and you may not,</v>

1572
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.960
<v Speaker 1>is that progression through fight week.</v>

1573
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>So when I go out to these events or events or in Vegas,</v>

1574
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:15.050
<v Speaker 1>some there checking day Monday or Tuesday at five week and typically we're,</v>

1575
00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:19.470
<v Speaker 1>we're on the road on there every day in the same hotel and watching these guys</v>

1576
00:46:19.471 --> 00:46:20.520
<v Speaker 1>and girls eat breakfast.</v>

1577
00:46:20.521 --> 00:46:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching them at the gym prepare,</v>

1578
00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:23.580
<v Speaker 1>try to make weight on Friday.</v>

1579
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching them Saturday morning with the prospect of the fight ahead of them.</v>

1580
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.960
<v Speaker 1>What an incredible mental journey it is to know that you're about to get into,</v>

1581
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1582
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 1>a cage with one of the baddest fighters on the planet.</v>

1583
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Then even if you win,</v>

1584
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:39.120
<v Speaker 1>probably come out,</v>

1585
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1586
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:40.770
<v Speaker 1>with a little bit of damage,</v>

1587
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything to,</v>

1588
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:43.003
<v Speaker 1>to fight night,</v>

1589
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.333
<v Speaker 1>fight night.</v>

1590
00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:45.060
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

1591
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.860
<v Speaker 1>these athletes are in a locker room,</v>

1592
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.290
<v Speaker 1>typically with three or four other athletes.</v>

1593
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:52.830
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you're one of the last athletes on that card and one by one</v>

1594
00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 1>your locker mates are walking out and then coming back in and you see,</v>

1595
00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1596
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.090
<v Speaker 1>damage on even the ones that win.</v>

1597
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.260
<v Speaker 1>And unlike other sports where you get out on the field and you warm up and you</v>

1598
00:47:04.261 --> 00:47:06.780
<v Speaker 1>get a little sense of what the atmosphere is like,</v>

1599
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.820
<v Speaker 1>these athletes are walking out,</v>

1600
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:09.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1601
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.620
<v Speaker 1>into the lion's den,</v>

1602
00:47:10.621 --> 00:47:15.621
<v Speaker 1>seeing it for the first time and the sensory overwhelming sensory,</v>

1603
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1604
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:20.370
<v Speaker 1>things that are going on when doing that and to be able to control your emotions</v>

1605
00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:20.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1606
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:21.600
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1607
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1608
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.680
<v Speaker 1>compete against somebody is just absolutely the most incredible thing that,</v>

1609
00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:26.640
<v Speaker 1>that I've ever seen.</v>

1610
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm so amazed at,</v>

1611
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.173
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1612
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 1>very few of these fighters and I talked to a lot of them had,</v>

1613
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:34.300
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get to them in some way or form.</v>

1614
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1615
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:35.831
<v Speaker 1>that is uh,</v>

1616
00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:36.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1617
00:47:36.041 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 1>talk to forest often about that enforce.</v>

1618
00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:42.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like it says he equates it to if you'd never jumped out of an airplane the</v>

1619
00:47:42.011 --> 00:47:43.690
<v Speaker 1>whole time you're on the way up saying,</v>

1620
00:47:43.691 --> 00:47:44.980
<v Speaker 1>what the hell am I doing?</v>

1621
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

1622
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1623
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:48.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1624
00:47:48.101 --> 00:47:50.250
<v Speaker 1>when the bell rings and you start fighting,</v>

1625
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.190
<v Speaker 1>then it kind of calms down your back in your,</v>

1626
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.080
<v Speaker 1>your kind of zone.</v>

1627
00:47:53.081 --> 00:47:57.190
<v Speaker 1>But just what an incredible mental game this is.</v>

1628
00:47:57.191 --> 00:48:00.460
<v Speaker 1>And I just have so much respect for our athletes because of what they have to go</v>

1629
00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:03.160
<v Speaker 1>through and they're able to do it time and time again and control those</v>

1630
00:48:03.161 --> 00:48:03.994
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

1631
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.140
<v Speaker 1>You bring up an important point and um,</v>

1632
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:10.270
<v Speaker 1>mental training is something that a lot of athletes have really concentrated on</v>

1633
00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:14.380
<v Speaker 1>more over the last few years than I think ever that I could recall.</v>

1634
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:17.380
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of them bringing hypnotists and a lot of bringing in sports</v>

1635
00:48:17.381 --> 00:48:18.214
<v Speaker 1>psychologists.</v>

1636
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Is there ever been any talk of bringing that to the performance institute?</v>

1637
00:48:21.811 --> 00:48:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1638
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.181
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1639
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:22.601
<v Speaker 1>I've talked,</v>

1640
00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I talked briefly with Dunkin about it who has it,</v>

1641
00:48:24.371 --> 00:48:24.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1642
00:48:24.671 --> 00:48:28.720
<v Speaker 1>a ton of resources in the athletic performance field.</v>

1643
00:48:28.721 --> 00:48:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1644
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.060
<v Speaker 1>so we've talked briefly about that.</v>

1645
00:48:31.061 --> 00:48:31.780
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1646
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:32.830
<v Speaker 1>nobody on the staff,</v>

1647
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:33.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1648
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:34.360
<v Speaker 1>currently it's,</v>

1649
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:35.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1650
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.983
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1651
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.780
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a give and take.</v>

1652
00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:38.021
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1653
00:48:38.021 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 1>we want to provide all these resources to our athletes,</v>

1654
00:48:40.721 --> 00:48:43.840
<v Speaker 1>but we also want them to retain their independence.</v>

1655
00:48:43.841 --> 00:48:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1656
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:45.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

1657
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.320
<v Speaker 1>if you notice in the performance institute,</v>

1658
00:48:47.321 --> 00:48:48.930
<v Speaker 1>there is no MMA coaches there.</v>

1659
00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.670
<v Speaker 1>There was no striking wrestling coaches,</v>

1660
00:48:51.671 --> 00:48:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu coaches,</v>

1661
00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:53.494
<v Speaker 1>none of that.</v>

1662
00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.860
<v Speaker 1>That's for the athlete to bring in because there needs to be some level of</v>

1663
00:48:56.861 --> 00:48:57.461
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

1664
00:48:57.461 --> 00:48:59.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to train the entire roster,</v>

1665
00:48:59.320 --> 00:48:59.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1666
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:01.030
<v Speaker 1>the same way itself.</v>

1667
00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:01.661
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1668
00:49:01.661 --> 00:49:02.510
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly,</v>

1669
00:49:02.511 --> 00:49:03.344
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like it was.</v>

1670
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I saw early on in my tenure here with the UFC,</v>

1671
00:49:07.661 --> 00:49:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I saw one of the most incredible things that,</v>

1672
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.420
<v Speaker 1>that I've ever seen.</v>

1673
00:49:10.421 --> 00:49:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen it once,</v>

1674
00:49:11.441 --> 00:49:13.900
<v Speaker 1>but I saw a fighter show up,</v>

1675
00:49:13.901 --> 00:49:18.100
<v Speaker 1>fight night outside the locker room and basically said,</v>

1676
00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go in.</v>

1677
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this at the arena.</v>

1678
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1679
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:23.740
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

1680
00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I was just blown away.</v>

1681
00:49:25.241 --> 00:49:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1682
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:28.750
<v Speaker 1>actually Sean Shelby went up and thought it was awesome.</v>

1683
00:49:28.751 --> 00:49:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Had a great conversation with the fighter.</v>

1684
00:49:31.421 --> 00:49:31.631
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

1685
00:49:31.631 --> 00:49:32.464
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1686
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 1>you're not feeling anything that everybody doesn't feel every single fight or on</v>

1687
00:49:37.421 --> 00:49:38.231
<v Speaker 1>the roster fields,</v>

1688
00:49:38.231 --> 00:49:39.340
<v Speaker 1>which you're feeling right now.</v>

1689
00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:41.170
<v Speaker 1>You're just letting it get the best you.</v>

1690
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:42.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1691
00:49:42.161 --> 00:49:43.390
<v Speaker 1>you're a Badass fighter.</v>

1692
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:44.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1693
00:49:44.201 --> 00:49:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you've kicked ass before,</v>

1694
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:46.930
<v Speaker 1>you've gotten beat before.</v>

1695
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:47.711
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1696
00:49:47.711 --> 00:49:47.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1697
00:49:47.981 --> 00:49:49.090
<v Speaker 1>what's the worst going to happen?</v>

1698
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:49.391
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>

1699
00:49:49.391 --> 00:49:50.081
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get beat.</v>

1700
00:49:50.081 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 1>You're going to live through this thing.</v>

1701
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.810
<v Speaker 1>You're just letting it surface.</v>

1702
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Everybody feels what you're feeling.</v>

1703
00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:55.750
<v Speaker 1>And for a second,</v>

1704
00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1705
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.110
<v Speaker 1>the fighter came back a little bit and then boom,</v>

1706
00:49:59.111 --> 00:49:59.944
<v Speaker 1>left the arena.</v>

1707
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1708
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.413
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1709
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:06.190
<v Speaker 1>But I think that must enter into the head or the prospect of that,</v>

1710
00:50:06.191 --> 00:50:07.630
<v Speaker 1>of every single person,</v>

1711
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:09.100
<v Speaker 1>every single fighter that comes here being,</v>

1712
00:50:09.101 --> 00:50:11.790
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure there's just a little bit of that and the back of the head.</v>

1713
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:15.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just an incredible journey to see them mentally overcome.</v>

1714
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1715
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.040
<v Speaker 1>that amount of stress.</v>

1716
00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.630
<v Speaker 1>The pre fight is incredible.</v>

1717
00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Why it's so interesting to see a guy like Conor who silver laxed in there.</v>

1718
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.490
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird,</v>

1719
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:24.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1720
00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 1>like when he does that rubber arms strut loose walking</v>

1721
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.641
<v Speaker 2>around the cage,</v>

1722
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:33.050
<v Speaker 2>he's Kinda like letting you know how he is dealing with this better than you</v>

1723
00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:33.650
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

1724
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:33.831
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1725
00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:34.790
<v Speaker 2>the one fighter that,</v>

1726
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:35.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1727
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 2>cause I paid really close attention after having seen that early pay really</v>

1728
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:41.540
<v Speaker 2>close attention just to see that fight or on the walkout,</v>

1729
00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 2>like to sit in a pretty close to the cage and just look at that fighter's eyes.</v>

1730
00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:46.214
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1731
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I tend to see a little bit of nervousness and fear and,</v>

1732
00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:49.700
<v Speaker 2>and everyone,</v>

1733
00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably healthy.</v>

1734
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 2>One person that sticks out that I looked at and I saw nothing in this dude's</v>

1735
00:50:56.361 --> 00:50:56.631
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

1736
00:50:56.631 --> 00:50:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I saw like a little smirk,</v>

1737
00:50:57.921 --> 00:51:01.250
<v Speaker 2>like he was so happy to be in there and it's the first time I've seen this guy</v>

1738
00:51:01.251 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 2>fight and that's just engaging.</v>

1739
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.600
<v Speaker 2>When he fought Michael Johnson,</v>

1740
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:06.351
<v Speaker 2>I remember look,</v>

1741
00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:09.980
<v Speaker 2>and he walked in first and I was sitting on one side and he's on the other side</v>

1742
00:51:09.981 --> 00:51:14.270
<v Speaker 2>of the cage and looking in his eyes and I had never seen him fight before.</v>

1743
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:15.653
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1744
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:16.850
<v Speaker 2>who is this guy?</v>

1745
00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.430
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's happy to be in there like this is,</v>

1746
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:19.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1747
00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 2>some parties at.</v>

1748
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:22.610
<v Speaker 2>And that fight was incredible.</v>

1749
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:22.881
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1750
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:23.391
<v Speaker 2>he's crazy,</v>

1751
00:51:23.391 --> 00:51:23.930
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

1752
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:25.130
<v Speaker 2>He's legitimately crazy.</v>

1753
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.200
<v Speaker 2>He said that getting knocked out by Eddie Alvarez,</v>

1754
00:51:27.201 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 2>the greatest thing that ever happened to him in his life,</v>

1755
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.230
<v Speaker 2>he's a different breed.</v>

1756
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1757
00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:33.980
<v Speaker 2>well he's got a mindset and that mindset is,</v>

1758
00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:34.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1759
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.170
<v Speaker 2>coming to go to war.</v>

1760
00:51:36.171 --> 00:51:37.550
<v Speaker 2>And he said it when he got signed,</v>

1761
00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:37.820
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1762
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1763
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:39.350
<v Speaker 2>over the next couple of years,</v>

1764
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get knocked out.</v>

1765
00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to knock me out.</v>

1766
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.231
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1767
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:45.260
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to knock a lot of people out and I'm going to break people,</v>

1768
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.371
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1769
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 2>And the only way to stop me to shut me off.</v>

1770
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.921
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

1771
00:51:48.921 --> 00:51:49.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm human.</v>

1772
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.353
<v Speaker 2>I can be shut off.</v>

1773
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I want to watch that guy fight every time.</v>

1774
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.313
<v Speaker 2>Every time.</v>

1775
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1776
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's an incredible mindset.</v>

1777
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:59.660
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if you can teach that.</v>

1778
00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people say you can't teach mental strength.</v>

1779
00:52:02.691 --> 00:52:03.201
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>

1780
00:52:03.201 --> 00:52:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that's horseshit.</v>

1781
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.690
<v Speaker 2>I think you could teach everything.</v>

1782
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.170
<v Speaker 2>I think the mind can be,</v>

1783
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.340
<v Speaker 2>can be trained.</v>

1784
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what they do in bootcamp,</v>

1785
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:12.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1786
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:12.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1787
00:52:12.351 --> 00:52:14.090
<v Speaker 2>and it works to varying degrees of success.</v>

1788
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I think the mind can be trained.</v>

1789
00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.380
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of what's your baseline?</v>

1790
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Where are you coming in at?</v>

1791
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Are you a total scaredy cat or are you a pretty stoic,</v>

1792
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:24.260
<v Speaker 2>rugged dude to begin with?</v>

1793
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.150
<v Speaker 2>And what can they do?</v>

1794
00:52:26.151 --> 00:52:26.870
<v Speaker 2>And maybe,</v>

1795
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:27.920
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're too stuck.</v>

1796
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.671
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're,</v>

1797
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:32.450
<v Speaker 2>you're too nonemotional and you're to non vulnerable and you,</v>

1798
00:52:32.451 --> 00:52:34.040
<v Speaker 2>you're delusional and your perceptions.</v>

1799
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.160
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing seeing the different ways that different athletes deal with it.</v>

1800
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.240
<v Speaker 2>So Saturday night,</v>

1801
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I give you a perfect example.</v>

1802
00:52:39.471 --> 00:52:41.060
<v Speaker 2>So fight night,</v>

1803
00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:41.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1804
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:42.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1805
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:44.330
<v Speaker 2>you saw it as the one doing the testing.</v>

1806
00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.320
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times fight night.</v>

1807
00:52:45.321 --> 00:52:49.040
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot going on in my world on there to put out fires in case</v>

1808
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:50.180
<v Speaker 2>something does go on.</v>

1809
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I like to watch the fights close.</v>

1810
00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1811
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.130
<v Speaker 2>just to see those things we're talking about here.</v>

1812
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:55.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1813
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:56.540
<v Speaker 2>but occasionally I'll,</v>

1814
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll pop in backstage just to make sure everything's going good.</v>

1815
00:52:59.211 --> 00:53:04.211
<v Speaker 2>So I walked back there before the Holly Cyborg fight and so Holly was out in the</v>

1816
00:53:06.111 --> 00:53:06.944
<v Speaker 2>Hallway,</v>

1817
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:07.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1818
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:12.500
<v Speaker 2>getting ready to do that long walk for the championship bout and she was there</v>

1819
00:53:12.501 --> 00:53:14.060
<v Speaker 2>for probably about 10 minutes.</v>

1820
00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Camera's getting ready and she was doing that.</v>

1821
00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Holly pacing back and forth and her hands together firing herself up when she</v>

1822
00:53:22.131 --> 00:53:23.810
<v Speaker 2>did it for a good 10 minutes back there.</v>

1823
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.501
<v Speaker 2>And then you see,</v>

1824
00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>once she gets in the cage,</v>

1825
00:53:26.011 --> 00:53:29.970
<v Speaker 2>she was the first one in their pacing back and forth for 10 minutes.</v>

1826
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1827
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Hitting the hands together every between,</v>

1828
00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:35.340
<v Speaker 2>every single round she'd get off that stool back and forth,</v>

1829
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:35.791
<v Speaker 2>pacing,</v>

1830
00:53:35.791 --> 00:53:36.900
<v Speaker 2>hitting the hands together.</v>

1831
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:39.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the way she fired herself up.</v>

1832
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:40.780
<v Speaker 2>She Carlos bars,</v>

1833
00:53:40.781 --> 00:53:41.614
<v Speaker 2>we'll walk out.</v>

1834
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 2>She walks out with like zero emotion on her face.</v>

1835
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:45.451
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1836
00:53:45.451 --> 00:53:46.740
<v Speaker 2>is this girl ready to go?</v>

1837
00:53:46.741 --> 00:53:47.790
<v Speaker 2>She gets in the cage,</v>

1838
00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:52.290
<v Speaker 2>walks over one side and just stands there and doesn't bounce around at all that</v>

1839
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:52.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1840
00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:52.791
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1841
00:53:52.791 --> 00:53:53.550
<v Speaker 2>you see both,</v>

1842
00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:54.320
<v Speaker 2>both of them,</v>

1843
00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1844
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.010
<v Speaker 2>can have success doing that way.</v>

1845
00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Dealing with,</v>

1846
00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1847
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:59.400
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing to see it.</v>

1848
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 2>There's a groove that they get into,</v>

1849
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:01.350
<v Speaker 2>they get,</v>

1850
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:02.700
<v Speaker 2>they get in the comfort zone.</v>

1851
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.361
<v Speaker 2>They just like,</v>

1852
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:04.051
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do.</v>

1853
00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Every time I've compete and everybody's is different.</v>

1854
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.591
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1855
00:54:07.591 --> 00:54:09.360
<v Speaker 2>some people don't like to bounce around.</v>

1856
00:54:09.361 --> 00:54:12.600
<v Speaker 2>But I remember when Holly did that during the Ronda Rousey fight.</v>

1857
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I remember how I was looking at her.</v>

1858
00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1859
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.860
<v Speaker 2>this girl's got some legs.</v>

1860
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:17.731
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1861
00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:20.700
<v Speaker 2>I'd seen her fight before and I knew that she was and some stamina.</v>

1862
00:54:20.701 --> 00:54:20.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1863
00:54:20.941 --> 00:54:25.590
<v Speaker 2>between the 10 minutes backstage before she walked out the five minutes after</v>

1864
00:54:25.591 --> 00:54:30.591
<v Speaker 2>she was in the cage and Cyborg is walking out the 10 or 15 seconds between every</v>

1865
00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:30.871
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>

1866
00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:31.704
<v Speaker 2>She probably,</v>

1867
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1868
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 2>ran a couple of miles.</v>

1869
00:54:33.211 --> 00:54:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1870
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.400
<v Speaker 2>The equivalent of a couple extra rounds and she was,</v>

1871
00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:35.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1872
00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:36.800
<v Speaker 2>she was as fresh at the end of,</v>

1873
00:54:36.801 --> 00:54:38.400
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't beginning tremendous cardio.</v>

1874
00:54:38.401 --> 00:54:38.880
<v Speaker 2>And that girl,</v>

1875
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.241
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1876
00:54:39.241 --> 00:54:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Jackson's camp,</v>

1877
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:41.740
<v Speaker 2>you know that Michael,</v>

1878
00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:42.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1879
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:43.241
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

1880
00:54:43.241 --> 00:54:43.950
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

1881
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Greg Jackson and Mike Winkeljohn camp,</v>

1882
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:46.760
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1883
00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.770
<v Speaker 2>they spend a lot of time working on endurance training,</v>

1884
00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.840
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning and they do a lot of hill running.</v>

1885
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:52.471
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1886
00:54:52.471 --> 00:54:55.350
<v Speaker 2>they have this famous mountain that they run that they all do.</v>

1887
00:54:55.351 --> 00:54:58.950
<v Speaker 2>And just Holly's been known for not just her cardio,</v>

1888
00:54:58.951 --> 00:55:00.840
<v Speaker 2>but like I said in the Rhonda fight,</v>

1889
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:01.831
<v Speaker 2>her legs,</v>

1890
00:55:01.831 --> 00:55:02.880
<v Speaker 2>the way she can move.</v>

1891
00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1892
00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:03.490
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1893
00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:05.700
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that I thought was going to be a big problem with her.</v>

1894
00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:06.211
<v Speaker 2>With Rhonda.</v>

1895
00:55:06.211 --> 00:55:07.890
<v Speaker 2>It was like Ron has got to catch her,</v>

1896
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.410
<v Speaker 2>like the way she's bouncing and moving.</v>

1897
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Rhonda can move like that.</v>

1898
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:16.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm like watching her bouncing move and that crazy kickboxing style that she'd</v>

1899
00:55:16.791 --> 00:55:19.590
<v Speaker 2>had for all those years or ability to do back flips and stuff.</v>

1900
00:55:19.591 --> 00:55:20.460
<v Speaker 2>She's really athletic.</v>

1901
00:55:20.461 --> 00:55:22.680
<v Speaker 2>She's a different different level of athlete.</v>

1902
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:23.573
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1903
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1904
00:55:24.361 --> 00:55:26.190
<v Speaker 2>But cyberark is just too big,</v>

1905
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:27.031
<v Speaker 2>too big,</v>

1906
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:29.160
<v Speaker 2>too skillful to tough show.</v>

1907
00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:29.910
<v Speaker 2>She showed a lot.</v>

1908
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:31.350
<v Speaker 2>She showed a lot of skill in that fight.</v>

1909
00:55:31.351 --> 00:55:31.501
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1910
00:55:31.501 --> 00:55:32.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1911
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.420
<v Speaker 2>her previous UFC fights,</v>

1912
00:55:33.421 --> 00:55:35.390
<v Speaker 2>she was just kind of coming at people and mall.</v>

1913
00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I thought she was really skillfulness five very,</v>

1914
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:39.000
<v Speaker 2>very patient too.</v>

1915
00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:39.630
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1916
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:42.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of people want to say that she's just a brute,</v>

1917
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.330
<v Speaker 2>but she's not like she's,</v>

1918
00:55:45.331 --> 00:55:45.780
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

1919
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.760
<v Speaker 2>she knows what her skills arm,</v>

1920
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:51.130
<v Speaker 2>which is big power and excellent Moy Tai.</v>

1921
00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:53.850
<v Speaker 2>But she also administered that power.</v>

1922
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:56.370
<v Speaker 2>The way she delivered it was very skillful,</v>

1923
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:56.970
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1924
00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:58.140
<v Speaker 2>very methodical,</v>

1925
00:55:58.170 --> 00:55:59.250
<v Speaker 2>very professional.</v>

1926
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:01.810
<v Speaker 2>And that was a workman like really was.</v>

1927
00:56:01.811 --> 00:56:04.560
<v Speaker 2>It was initially I talked to somebody in our camp and they wanted to see a</v>

1928
00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:06.790
<v Speaker 2>little bit more of that brute power come right out.</v>

1929
00:56:06.791 --> 00:56:09.200
<v Speaker 2>And they thought she was holding back a little bit.</v>

1930
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a little too skillful,</v>

1931
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:12.900
<v Speaker 2>but I thought it was great.</v>

1932
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.580
<v Speaker 2>While they want her to stop,</v>

1933
00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:15.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1934
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.051
<v Speaker 2>a Holly,</v>

1935
00:56:16.051 --> 00:56:17.880
<v Speaker 2>but you running the risky,</v>

1936
00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.753
<v Speaker 2>getting head kicked.</v>

1937
00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1938
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.441
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1939
00:56:19.441 --> 00:56:22.500
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be real careful with Holly Holly pull stuff out of our ass.</v>

1940
00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:22.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1941
00:56:22.801 --> 00:56:25.290
<v Speaker 2>like he sat in the drain and Germane to random he phi,</v>

1942
00:56:25.291 --> 00:56:27.100
<v Speaker 2>he saw it and obviously the Rhonda fight,</v>

1943
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:28.810
<v Speaker 2>she needs very sneaky.</v>

1944
00:56:28.811 --> 00:56:29.411
<v Speaker 2>She knows how to,</v>

1945
00:56:29.411 --> 00:56:30.850
<v Speaker 2>especially that left high kick man.</v>

1946
00:56:30.851 --> 00:56:32.180
<v Speaker 2>She knows how to sneak down such a great,</v>

1947
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:33.340
<v Speaker 2>that was a great fight.</v>

1948
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Love watching that fight.</v>

1949
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1950
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1951
00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:40.260
<v Speaker 2>The women's MMA talent level has risen and risen and it,</v>

1952
00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:40.900
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

1953
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:41.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1954
00:56:41.171 --> 00:56:45.370
<v Speaker 2>I remember when it first came on the scene and Rhonda was the champ and she was</v>

1955
00:56:45.371 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 2>just kind of roll in these girls who really didn't belong in the ring with her.</v>

1956
00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:51.670
<v Speaker 2>It how it has and you know,</v>

1957
00:56:51.671 --> 00:56:52.330
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

1958
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Bringing back to the performance institute,</v>

1959
00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:54.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1960
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 2>talk with guys a lot over there that what they're finding out is you need to</v>

1961
00:56:58.091 --> 00:57:02.920
<v Speaker 2>train a female athlete in a much different manner than you train a male athlete.</v>

1962
00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1963
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:04.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1964
00:57:04.331 --> 00:57:07.270
<v Speaker 2>you see a lot of times when female athletes cut weight,</v>

1965
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:08.860
<v Speaker 2>difficult difficulties,</v>

1966
00:57:08.861 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 2>they have cutting that way because of,</v>

1967
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1968
00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.400
<v Speaker 2>menstrual cycles potentially.</v>

1969
00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 2>And you also see in a lot of cases,</v>

1970
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:18.070
<v Speaker 2>a rebound effect where a female will fight,</v>

1971
00:57:18.071 --> 00:57:18.761
<v Speaker 2>get down to weight,</v>

1972
00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:19.091
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

1973
00:57:19.091 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 2>and then bounce way back up and just lose the ability,</v>

1974
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:26.140
<v Speaker 2>the body's ability to regulate where there'll be cutting down on calories</v>

1975
00:57:26.141 --> 00:57:28.540
<v Speaker 2>working out like crazy and they're still putting on weight.</v>

1976
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1977
00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:30.270
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

1978
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I think that's something that you'll see the performance institute doing is try</v>

1979
00:57:33.461 --> 00:57:33.800
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1980
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:34.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1981
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:38.740
<v Speaker 2>figure out and then knowledgeability disseminate information about how to train</v>

1982
00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 2>the female athlete that they may need a little bit more time off and recovery</v>

1983
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.890
<v Speaker 2>between fights than a male athlete will.</v>

1984
00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:46.600
<v Speaker 2>But one thing I say,</v>

1985
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:50.830
<v Speaker 2>time and time again is every time we have a female fight,</v>

1986
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:52.090
<v Speaker 2>they come to fight.</v>

1987
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.950
<v Speaker 2>And you often see cards that are,</v>

1988
00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:54.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1989
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:56.910
<v Speaker 2>kind of lagging a little bit and you look down on the list,</v>

1990
00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:57.530
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1991
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:58.640
<v Speaker 2>there comes a female fight,</v>

1992
00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.140
<v Speaker 2>boom turns the car and ride around because you know,</v>

1993
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.460
<v Speaker 2>inevitably they,</v>

1994
00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.370
<v Speaker 2>they give ultimate maximum effort in there.</v>

1995
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:07.330
<v Speaker 2>That's at least what I see.</v>

1996
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that.</v>

1997
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:08.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1998
00:58:08.531 --> 00:58:09.060
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>

1999
00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:09.893
<v Speaker 2>the t,</v>

2000
00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:10.301
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

2001
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:13.390
<v Speaker 2>the talent level is rising.</v>

2002
00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:14.790
<v Speaker 2>They're very hungry and they're,</v>

2003
00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:16.960
<v Speaker 2>they're looking to be that next person.</v>

2004
00:58:16.961 --> 00:58:17.794
<v Speaker 2>They realize like,</v>

2005
00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:18.221
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2006
00:58:18.221 --> 00:58:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Ronda Rousey is gone.</v>

2007
00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 2>No one has really filled her place.</v>

2008
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some very popular fighters,</v>

2009
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:23.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2010
00:58:23.981 --> 00:58:27.400
<v Speaker 2>like a rose Nama units obviously now is going to be one of the most popular</v>

2011
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:30.280
<v Speaker 2>fighters after the knock out of you on e and j check cyborgs,</v>

2012
00:58:30.281 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 2>obviously very popular,</v>

2013
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:33.650
<v Speaker 2>but there's plenty of room for more and they realize that,</v>

2014
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.061
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2015
00:58:34.061 --> 00:58:35.230
<v Speaker 2>this is the time to go for it.</v>

2016
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:36.580
<v Speaker 2>And I just think that,</v>

2017
00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:37.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2018
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:40.000
<v Speaker 2>the women that get involved in fighting in the first place,</v>

2019
00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.020
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

2020
00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:42.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of men that get involved in fighting.</v>

2021
00:58:42.821 --> 00:58:44.290
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to fight after awhile.</v>

2022
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:46.150
<v Speaker 2>But women that get involved in fighting,</v>

2023
00:58:46.151 --> 00:58:47.410
<v Speaker 2>they tend to be crazy,</v>

2024
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:48.401
<v Speaker 2>like in,</v>

2025
00:58:48.401 --> 00:58:49.270
<v Speaker 2>in a good way.</v>

2026
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:49.631
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2027
00:58:49.631 --> 00:58:51.160
<v Speaker 2>like these are wild women,</v>

2028
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:51.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2029
00:58:51.391 --> 00:58:53.260
<v Speaker 2>like cats in Ghana type characters.</v>

2030
00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:53.891
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2031
00:58:53.891 --> 00:58:54.970
<v Speaker 2>they're just wild.</v>

2032
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:56.500
<v Speaker 2>And like when you watch them fight,</v>

2033
00:58:56.501 --> 00:58:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2034
00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:56.841
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2035
00:58:56.841 --> 00:58:58.060
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see some chaos.</v>

2036
00:58:58.090 --> 00:58:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2037
00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:58.551
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2038
00:58:58.551 --> 00:58:59.890
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be playing it safe.</v>

2039
00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:01.150
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be going for it.</v>

2040
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2041
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:02.283
<v Speaker 2>I love that about him.</v>

2042
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2043
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:06.730
<v Speaker 2>cat is an interesting example because she was telling me the exact same thing</v>

2044
00:59:06.731 --> 00:59:08.500
<v Speaker 2>that you were saying that with a lot of women,</v>

2045
00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.850
<v Speaker 2>their body responds very poorly to the weight cut and then immediately wants to</v>

2046
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:13.720
<v Speaker 2>gain weight afterwards.</v>

2047
00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2048
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that's a,</v>

2049
00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:16.700
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a,</v>

2050
00:59:16.701 --> 00:59:16.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2051
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:18.870
<v Speaker 2>like an evolutionary feature because of their,</v>

2052
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:22.940
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they carry babies and Mckinney they need fat so thereby freaks</v>

2053
00:59:22.941 --> 00:59:23.250
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>

2054
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely thought that.</v>

2055
00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2056
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Or some sort of a response.</v>

2057
00:59:26.181 --> 00:59:26.781
<v Speaker 2>Like your body's like,</v>

2058
00:59:26.781 --> 00:59:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2059
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what this crazy person is doing but we've got to put some fat on.</v>

2060
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:30.681
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2061
00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:31.101
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2062
00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:31.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2063
00:59:31.311 --> 00:59:33.890
<v Speaker 2>that's something we're again going back to the performance institute that</v>

2064
00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:34.953
<v Speaker 2>they're their,</v>

2065
00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:39.020
<v Speaker 2>their dive in deep into and Clinton Wattenberg especially on the nutrition side</v>

2066
00:59:39.021 --> 00:59:39.590
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2067
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:39.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2068
00:59:39.861 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 2>seeing those endocrine profiles after a fight,</v>

2069
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:42.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2070
00:59:42.891 --> 00:59:45.870
<v Speaker 2>what can you do both and cutting back and training and you know,</v>

2071
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 2>through your,</v>

2072
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.550
<v Speaker 2>through your diet to help control and regulate that.</v>

2073
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.540
<v Speaker 2>And Kat was telling me about a program that you guys were just,</v>

2074
00:59:53.541 --> 00:59:58.070
<v Speaker 2>you were just mentioning briefly in San Diego where they're using some sort of</v>

2075
00:59:58.071 --> 01:00:01.760
<v Speaker 2>magnetic frequencies on fighters that have had brain injuries.</v>

2076
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

2077
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.013
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

2078
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:03.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2079
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:07.130
<v Speaker 2>what was something that the doctor Dunkin French kind of brought into the mix</v>

2080
01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:07.550
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

2081
01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:07.911
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2082
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:10.100
<v Speaker 2>so previous come into UFC,</v>

2083
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.910
<v Speaker 2>he was director of sports performance at University of Notre Dame in south bend,</v>

2084
01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:14.744
<v Speaker 2>Indiana.</v>

2085
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:16.940
<v Speaker 2>And they were looking into,</v>

2086
01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2087
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:18.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2088
01:00:18.111 --> 01:00:21.740
<v Speaker 2>traumatic brain injury and football and possible therapy.</v>

2089
01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2090
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:26.270
<v Speaker 2>and they came across a clinic in San Diego that was using this therapy and FDA</v>

2091
01:00:26.271 --> 01:00:27.081
<v Speaker 2>approved device.</v>

2092
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:30.290
<v Speaker 2>It's basically low level magnet therapy,</v>

2093
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:31.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2094
01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:32.480
<v Speaker 2>in conjunction with that,</v>

2095
01:00:32.481 --> 01:00:36.470
<v Speaker 2>they do some EKG or reading of the electrical waves in the brain.</v>

2096
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:38.180
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2097
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:38.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2098
01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:42.410
<v Speaker 2>initially we're finding that this therapy was bringing some of those readings</v>

2099
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.540
<v Speaker 2>back together and,</v>

2100
01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:44.721
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2101
01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:45.950
<v Speaker 2>I think very early,</v>

2102
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.963
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2103
01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:47.500
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2104
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.690
<v Speaker 2>in the process of figuring out whether this can really work or not.</v>

2105
01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.381
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2106
01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:55.460
<v Speaker 2>certainly with the UFC wants to be as ahead of the curve in terms of potential</v>

2107
01:00:55.461 --> 01:00:56.870
<v Speaker 2>therapies out there for,</v>

2108
01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:57.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2109
01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:57.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2110
01:00:57.981 --> 01:00:59.000
<v Speaker 2>for treating the brain.</v>

2111
01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2112
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:00.980
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

2113
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:01.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2114
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.581
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2115
01:01:01.581 --> 01:01:03.980
<v Speaker 2>cat's been going there for a while and um,</v>

2116
01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:04.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2117
01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:05.510
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

2118
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.640
<v Speaker 2>she says she's experienced some positive results.</v>

2119
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:08.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:01:08.211 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

2121
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.400
<v Speaker 2>she told me she got some outstanding results.</v>

2122
01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:15.401
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting is there's been a ton of research and studies done on</v>

2123
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:16.880
<v Speaker 2>transdermal stimulation,</v>

2124
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:17.780
<v Speaker 2>all these different,</v>

2125
01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:17.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2126
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:19.210
<v Speaker 2>ways to increase the,</v>

2127
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:20.780
<v Speaker 2>the brain's ability to learn.</v>

2128
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:22.400
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2129
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.890
<v Speaker 2>there was a radio lab podcast on this,</v>

2130
01:01:24.891 --> 01:01:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called something nine volts,</v>

2131
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:29.030
<v Speaker 2>if you could find at nine volts something or another.</v>

2132
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:34.010
<v Speaker 2>But it basically detailed how they use this for a sniper simulation.</v>

2133
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.340
<v Speaker 2>And what they did is they took this woman who was a reporter,</v>

2134
01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:38.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2135
01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.780
<v Speaker 2>they put her through this sniper simulation games,</v>

2136
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:42.650
<v Speaker 2>like a video game.</v>

2137
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 2>She scored poorly and then,</v>

2138
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:45.111
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2139
01:01:45.111 --> 01:01:46.130
<v Speaker 2>nine volt Nirvana.</v>

2140
01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:46.993
<v Speaker 2>Thank you Jamie.</v>

2141
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:52.150
<v Speaker 2>And so then they attach these electrodes to various areas of her head and</v>

2142
01:01:53.271 --> 01:01:56.510
<v Speaker 2>stimulated her brain with a small charge.</v>

2143
01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:01.280
<v Speaker 2>And she went through the exact same thing and she said it felt like the 20</v>

2144
01:02:01.281 --> 01:02:03.860
<v Speaker 2>minutes went by in two minutes and her,</v>

2145
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.150
<v Speaker 2>her score was perfect.</v>

2146
01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.720
<v Speaker 2>And this is being echoed throughout like many different people that have done</v>

2147
01:02:11.421 --> 01:02:13.220
<v Speaker 2>tests on these very,</v>

2148
01:02:13.221 --> 01:02:16.730
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of like home hacking where people are literally going to radio</v>

2149
01:02:16.731 --> 01:02:18.320
<v Speaker 2>lab and making their own setups.</v>

2150
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 2>But I'm curious to</v>

2151
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>see if the UFC has looked into some of these things.</v>

2152
01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:27.531
<v Speaker 1>Like some like maybe perhaps there's a way you could stimulate the body's</v>

2153
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:32.721
<v Speaker 1>ability to learn certain techniques or like carve pathways by stimulating areas</v>

2154
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:33.980
<v Speaker 1>of the brain.</v>

2155
01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:34.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2156
01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2157
01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Another great reason for you to get Duncan in here because he can talk real</v>

2158
01:02:37.681 --> 01:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>knowledge to be about this therapy.</v>

2159
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>He told me when at the University of Notre Dame,</v>

2160
01:02:41.101 --> 01:02:41.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2161
01:02:41.311 --> 01:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>they'd have,</v>

2162
01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>they've had football players,</v>

2163
01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

2164
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:43.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2165
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>have migraine headaches for long periods of time than under what this therapy in</v>

2166
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>a matter of weeks they were,</v>

2167
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:50.603
<v Speaker 1>they went away.</v>

2168
01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2169
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>when Donna and I visited the facility down in San Diego,</v>

2170
01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>they talked about,</v>

2171
01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:55.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2172
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>employees of the facility,</v>

2173
01:02:57.331 --> 01:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>bringing in their kids,</v>

2174
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:04.370
<v Speaker 1>a kids that had some levels of autism that after this therapy were more engaging</v>

2175
01:03:04.561 --> 01:03:05.394
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>

2176
01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:10.580
<v Speaker 1>They also talked about kids that had tests or finals coming up the day after</v>

2177
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 1>where they go in for this therapy the night before and get their test scores</v>

2178
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:16.350
<v Speaker 1>were improving as a result.</v>

2179
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2180
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:17.851
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of,</v>

2181
01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.450
<v Speaker 1>they deal with a lot of special forces soldiers down in the San Diego area that</v>

2182
01:03:21.451 --> 01:03:23.640
<v Speaker 1>have had traumatic brain injuries because of,</v>

2183
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2184
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.090
<v Speaker 1>ids and a,</v>

2185
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some success there.</v>

2186
01:03:27.331 --> 01:03:27.961
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

2187
01:03:27.961 --> 01:03:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I think some real exciting potential there that again,</v>

2188
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:31.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2189
01:03:31.861 --> 01:03:35.100
<v Speaker 1>the UFC wants to be at the forefront of and you know,</v>

2190
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.210
<v Speaker 1>be the first to,</v>

2191
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:36.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2192
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:40.170
<v Speaker 1>to suggest some of these things for our athletes and you know,</v>

2193
01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:41.210
<v Speaker 1>potentially even looking,</v>

2194
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:43.260
<v Speaker 1>getting some of these devices at the Pi,</v>

2195
01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.453
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2196
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.410
<v Speaker 1>and be able to treat some of our athletes there.</v>

2197
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2198
01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:48.090
<v Speaker 1>that would be amazing.</v>

2199
01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:51.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think that we're in an interesting time now where,</v>

2200
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.680
<v Speaker 1>because so much research is being put on CTE and traumatic brain injuries that</v>

2201
01:03:55.681 --> 01:03:56.071
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

2202
01:03:56.071 --> 01:04:01.071
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at potential ways to mitigate those problems and maybe even rehab</v>

2203
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.530
<v Speaker 1>some of the issues that fighters of having.</v>

2204
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:04.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2205
01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:05.371
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2206
01:04:05.371 --> 01:04:05.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2207
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.790
<v Speaker 1>one thing we didn't show you and your tour is a,</v>

2208
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:11.310
<v Speaker 1>we now make part of the onboarding process at the Pi,</v>

2209
01:04:11.311 --> 01:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>the c three logic testing,</v>

2210
01:04:12.931 --> 01:04:13.830
<v Speaker 1>which is this,</v>

2211
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2212
01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.030
<v Speaker 1>25,</v>

2213
01:04:15.031 --> 01:04:19.260
<v Speaker 1>30 minute neurocognitive tests that came out of the Cleveland Clinic brain study</v>

2214
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's an iPad based tests.</v>

2215
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2216
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:24.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a mix of memory,</v>

2217
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.051
<v Speaker 1>shape,</v>

2218
01:04:25.051 --> 01:04:25.920
<v Speaker 1>recognition,</v>

2219
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.521
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>

2220
01:04:26.521 --> 01:04:27.290
<v Speaker 1>You actually,</v>

2221
01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:27.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2222
01:04:27.511 --> 01:04:28.710
<v Speaker 1>put the pad on your,</v>

2223
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:29.740
<v Speaker 1>onto a belt,</v>

2224
01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:34.050
<v Speaker 1>you stand on this unstable surface and close your eyes and it basically gives</v>

2225
01:04:34.051 --> 01:04:36.990
<v Speaker 1>you measurements or readings after 25 or 30 minutes.</v>

2226
01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2227
01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:38.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2228
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.320
<v Speaker 1>over time you can compare those readings.</v>

2229
01:04:40.321 --> 01:04:41.190
<v Speaker 1>If they're declining,</v>

2230
01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:43.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's time to take a little bit of time off from,</v>

2231
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:44.460
<v Speaker 1>from training and fighting.</v>

2232
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:45.241
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2233
01:04:45.241 --> 01:04:46.260
<v Speaker 1>if they're staying stable,</v>

2234
01:04:46.261 --> 01:04:46.950
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

2235
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:47.371
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>

2236
01:04:47.371 --> 01:04:48.204
<v Speaker 1>you're doing all right.</v>

2237
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>The California Athletic Commission requires that for all fights.</v>

2238
01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.840
<v Speaker 1>So all fighters in any card in California,</v>

2239
01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.410
<v Speaker 1>the Wednesday or Thursday before the fight goes through the c three logic</v>

2240
01:04:58.411 --> 01:04:59.244
<v Speaker 1>testing,</v>

2241
01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:00.900
<v Speaker 1>all of it's uploaded to a cloud.</v>

2242
01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>So you don't,</v>

2243
01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>after a period of a couple of years,</v>

2244
01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2245
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:08.400
<v Speaker 1>a fighter can have access to some real objective data on,</v>

2246
01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:08.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2247
01:05:08.701 --> 01:05:13.290
<v Speaker 1>with the neuro cognitive capabilities are looking like that would be a great way</v>

2248
01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:14.101
<v Speaker 1>to find out.</v>

2249
01:05:14.101 --> 01:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe one of the only ways to find out without fighter to declaw</v>

2250
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>disclosing</v>

2251
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:18.191
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2252
01:05:18.191 --> 01:05:21.910
<v Speaker 2>whether or not a fighter has been knocked out in camp because that,</v>

2253
01:05:21.911 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 2>that's a common occurrence that fighters get knocked out in camp and hard</v>

2254
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 2>sparring and then a week,</v>

2255
01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:32.560
<v Speaker 2>two weeks later have to fight and their ability to take a shot is gone.</v>

2256
01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:33.483
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2257
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:33.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:34.331
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting,</v>

2259
01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:34.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2260
01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:37.990
<v Speaker 2>often asked about that and comparing it to other sports leagues.</v>

2261
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:39.310
<v Speaker 2>And the one thing I will say,</v>

2262
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:39.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2263
01:05:39.851 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 2>with Nma now this is excluding things are going on in the gym,</v>

2264
01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:45.790
<v Speaker 2>but in a fight that's regulated by the Athletic Commission,</v>

2265
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:46.624
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2266
01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.190
<v Speaker 2>And then may have some of the most conservative return to play policy.</v>

2267
01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I know it does have any sport we're in.</v>

2268
01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:56.080
<v Speaker 2>If you're an NFL quarterback and you get knocked out on a Sunday,</v>

2269
01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:56.981
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2270
01:05:56.981 --> 01:05:58.420
<v Speaker 2>you're in a concussion protocol,</v>

2271
01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:01.810
<v Speaker 2>but they're trying to get you back plan probably the next Sunday or the Sunday</v>

2272
01:06:01.811 --> 01:06:02.440
<v Speaker 2>thereafter,</v>

2273
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.130
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy.</v>

2274
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:05.110
<v Speaker 2>The big concussion and MMA as you know,</v>

2275
01:06:05.111 --> 01:06:08.560
<v Speaker 2>there's like a 45 60 mandatory 45 days,</v>

2276
01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:09.331
<v Speaker 2>no activities,</v>

2277
01:06:09.331 --> 01:06:10.690
<v Speaker 2>60 days before you fight.</v>

2278
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:10.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2279
01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:12.970
<v Speaker 2>we've seen suspensions out to six months,</v>

2280
01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:14.560
<v Speaker 2>mandatory medical suspension.</v>

2281
01:06:14.561 --> 01:06:15.010
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2282
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:16.840
<v Speaker 2>and some of them I think are very warranted.</v>

2283
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:20.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some brutal brutal knockouts where like Alistair Overeem and</v>

2284
01:06:20.321 --> 01:06:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Francis and [inaudible] like,</v>

2285
01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see Alistair fight next month.</v>

2286
01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:24.131
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2287
01:06:24.131 --> 01:06:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2288
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.310
<v Speaker 2>and here's a question about a guy like Allister,</v>

2289
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.081
<v Speaker 2>Allister,</v>

2290
01:06:29.081 --> 01:06:34.081
<v Speaker 2>we looked it up one day on a podcast has been stopped or knocked out somewhere</v>

2291
01:06:35.111 --> 01:06:39.580
<v Speaker 2>in the neighborhood of 13 times in MMA and then three times more in kickboxing.</v>

2292
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.133
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

2293
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:43.000
<v Speaker 2>what's the number where you like,</v>

2294
01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:43.830
<v Speaker 2>that's enough.</v>

2295
01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2296
01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:45.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer to that.</v>

2297
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2298
01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I know you talked with Allister and Scott and his wits about him.</v>

2299
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:50.140
<v Speaker 2>That's what's crazy.</v>

2300
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Allister doesn't even seem remotely punching.</v>

2301
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:52.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2302
01:06:52.481 --> 01:06:54.280
<v Speaker 2>he is not only that,</v>

2303
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:55.960
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't seem deterred,</v>

2304
01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.580
<v Speaker 2>like it's crazy.</v>

2305
01:06:57.581 --> 01:06:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Like he gets knocked out and he's like,</v>

2306
01:06:58.930 --> 01:06:59.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2307
01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:01.230
<v Speaker 2>we go back to the drawing board and uh,</v>

2308
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:02.140
<v Speaker 2>we'll be better next time.</v>

2309
01:07:02.141 --> 01:07:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2310
01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an unknown now.</v>

2311
01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:04.631
<v Speaker 2>But you also look at,</v>

2312
01:07:04.631 --> 01:07:04.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2313
01:07:04.811 --> 01:07:08.320
<v Speaker 2>the UFC has been the largest contributor to the Cleveland Clinic fight or brain</v>

2314
01:07:08.321 --> 01:07:09.100
<v Speaker 2>health study.</v>

2315
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:09.850
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

2316
01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:10.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2317
01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.850
<v Speaker 2>made I think multimillion dollar commitment.</v>

2318
01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2319
01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:14.530
<v Speaker 2>we've upped it once.</v>

2320
01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2321
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.881
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

2322
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:19.360
<v Speaker 2>we're looking to invest resources into finding out what those answers are</v>

2323
01:07:19.361 --> 01:07:19.901
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

2324
01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:23.590
<v Speaker 2>And be at the forefront of any innovative therapies that are out there.</v>

2325
01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Innovative,</v>

2326
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:24.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2327
01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:24.851
<v Speaker 2>testing.</v>

2328
01:07:24.851 --> 01:07:25.684
<v Speaker 2>It's out there.</v>

2329
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.823
<v Speaker 2>We want to be at the front.</v>

2330
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:27.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2331
01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:27.381
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2332
01:07:27.381 --> 01:07:32.381
<v Speaker 2>the issue with CTE is that you really can't test for it until after a fighters</v>

2333
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.041
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

2334
01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:33.461
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2335
01:07:33.461 --> 01:07:38.080
<v Speaker 2>But haven't they recently figured out a way to test people while they're alive?</v>

2336
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:38.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2337
01:07:38.381 --> 01:07:38.521
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2338
01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:39.311
<v Speaker 2>I've read some of that.</v>

2339
01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I've also read that scientists arguing that,</v>

2340
01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:41.650
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2341
01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:42.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2342
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:43.600
<v Speaker 2>that's fine and that's not right.</v>

2343
01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:45.130
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know where we're at on that.</v>

2344
01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2345
01:07:46.241 --> 01:07:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Because boy,</v>

2346
01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:48.460
<v Speaker 2>it just seems like</v>

2347
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to end.</v>

2348
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.990
<v Speaker 2>It also affects people differently,</v>

2349
01:07:52.991 --> 01:07:53.351
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2350
01:07:53.351 --> 01:07:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Depending upon what genes they have,</v>

2351
01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.360
<v Speaker 2>some people are more predisposed to CTE.</v>

2352
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:59.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:07:59.291 --> 01:07:59.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2354
01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:00.880
<v Speaker 2>that's my understanding of it.</v>

2355
01:08:00.881 --> 01:08:01.211
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2356
01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:02.290
<v Speaker 2>a lot of unknowns.</v>

2357
01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:03.190
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2358
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:03.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2359
01:08:03.491 --> 01:08:07.330
<v Speaker 2>I think that the UFC has shown a dedication to,</v>

2360
01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:07.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2361
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:10.090
<v Speaker 2>contributing to areas where we can find out some of those answers.</v>

2362
01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2363
01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:12.243
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2364
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:17.670
<v Speaker 2>like I know that you guys recently had mark come to Vegas because Mark Han had</v>

2365
01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 2>talked about suffering damage from fights in the UFC.</v>

2366
01:08:21.690 --> 01:08:21.921
<v Speaker 2>Said,</v>

2367
01:08:21.921 --> 01:08:22.270
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2368
01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 2>We can just hear him say that we're going to pull them off this card.</v>

2369
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:26.960
<v Speaker 2>And he was furious and they said,</v>

2370
01:08:26.961 --> 01:08:28.400
<v Speaker 2>look like we love you,</v>

2371
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:29.300
<v Speaker 2>don't get it wrong,</v>

2372
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:30.590
<v Speaker 2>but we want you,</v>

2373
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:31.500
<v Speaker 2>we want you to be safe.</v>

2374
01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.980
<v Speaker 2>And you say that you're slurring your words.</v>

2375
01:08:33.981 --> 01:08:35.240
<v Speaker 2>And then he changed it and said,</v>

2376
01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:35.511
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2377
01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.580
<v Speaker 2>it's after a few drinks and then then went,</v>

2378
01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:37.821
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2379
01:08:37.821 --> 01:08:42.821
<v Speaker 2>well come by and let's give you the full gamut of tests as exact what happened.</v>

2380
01:08:43.521 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 2>And we're always going to act out of an abundance of caution.</v>

2381
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Speaker 2>And in a scenario like that.</v>

2382
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.900
<v Speaker 2>And so now he's back on the roster and back with a fight scheduled.</v>

2383
01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting in Perth and in February.</v>

2384
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 2>So when a guy says something like that,</v>

2385
01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.500
<v Speaker 2>you just Kinda have to,</v>

2386
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:58.340
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

2387
01:08:58.340 --> 01:08:58.881
<v Speaker 2>when a guy says,</v>

2388
01:08:58.881 --> 01:08:59.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm slurring my words,</v>

2389
01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

2390
01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.520
<v Speaker 2>I've taken too much punishment.</v>

2391
01:09:01.521 --> 01:09:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2392
01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.390
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2393
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:03.500
<v Speaker 2>we've got a red flag here.</v>

2394
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:04.423
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

2395
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:04.641
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2396
01:09:04.641 --> 01:09:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2397
01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:05.571
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2398
01:09:05.571 --> 01:09:05.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2399
01:09:05.931 --> 01:09:06.471
<v Speaker 2>that happened.</v>

2400
01:09:06.471 --> 01:09:09.720
<v Speaker 2>I looked back to on a few member when Kane was gonna fight a,</v>

2401
01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.220
<v Speaker 2>at the end of last year asking,</v>

2402
01:09:11.230 --> 01:09:13.610
<v Speaker 2>you came out a week or two previous saying,</v>

2403
01:09:13.611 --> 01:09:13.851
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2404
01:09:13.851 --> 01:09:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm in so much pain from this back issue.</v>

2405
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:20.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm having to use medical marijuana CBD leading up to this fight.</v>

2406
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.200
<v Speaker 2>The only way I can train,</v>

2407
01:09:21.201 --> 01:09:23.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have this surgery directly after the fight.</v>

2408
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2409
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:27.410
<v Speaker 2>it was actually a Nevada commission that saw this and said,</v>

2410
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:28.221
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

2411
01:09:28.221 --> 01:09:30.080
<v Speaker 2>if you're really in that much pain,</v>

2412
01:09:30.081 --> 01:09:33.140
<v Speaker 2>like we can't with good conscience,</v>

2413
01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:34.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm license you to fight.</v>

2414
01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:39.520
<v Speaker 2>And sure enough they didn't do that and ended up having the surgery and uh,</v>

2415
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.850
<v Speaker 2>hopefully as back pretty soon.</v>

2416
01:09:40.851 --> 01:09:41.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's been like a year now.</v>

2417
01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2418
01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:47.380
<v Speaker 2>He's a guy that is almost too tough for his body or maybe is to tougher his</v>

2419
01:09:47.871 --> 01:09:48.201
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

2420
01:09:48.201 --> 01:09:49.490
<v Speaker 2>If you watch cane fight,</v>

2421
01:09:49.491 --> 01:09:51.620
<v Speaker 2>particularly early in his career when he's in his prime,</v>

2422
01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:57.280
<v Speaker 2>you just couldn't believe the amount of endurance that a 240 pound man can have.</v>

2423
01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:58.090
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2424
01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:02.690
<v Speaker 2>the just the pace that he would put on guys and you'd see them just drowning in</v>

2425
01:10:02.691 --> 01:10:03.524
<v Speaker 2>that pace.</v>

2426
01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.480
<v Speaker 2>But the only way you get,</v>

2427
01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:10.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to have some physical gifts cardiovascularly and I think Kane</v>

2428
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.960
<v Speaker 2>will admit that he has some,</v>

2429
01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:12.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2430
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.730
<v Speaker 2>some natural cardio,</v>

2431
01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:17.600
<v Speaker 2>but unbelievable work ethic and mental toughness.</v>

2432
01:10:17.601 --> 01:10:21.620
<v Speaker 2>And that mental toughness also makes you push through injuries and pushing</v>

2433
01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:23.780
<v Speaker 2>through injuries is how injuries become chronic.</v>

2434
01:10:23.781 --> 01:10:27.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's how injuries become unmanageable and require surgery.</v>

2435
01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean you would know I,</v>

2436
01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:28.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2437
01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I was an athlete and went through my share of injuries,</v>

2438
01:10:31.281 --> 01:10:31.671
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2439
01:10:31.671 --> 01:10:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I played basketball and ran track and in those sports,</v>

2440
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:35.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2441
01:10:35.091 --> 01:10:37.190
<v Speaker 2>depending on your injury you can control,</v>

2442
01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:39.170
<v Speaker 2>I think your exposure and protect your body.</v>

2443
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:40.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2444
01:10:40.251 --> 01:10:41.480
<v Speaker 2>how do you do that in fighting?</v>

2445
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:42.030
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

2446
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.630
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

2447
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:43.463
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

2448
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.340
<v Speaker 2>you can't prevent certain positions that your lot you're going to be in.</v>

2449
01:10:46.341 --> 01:10:48.050
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not completely healthy,</v>

2450
01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:51.680
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be probably exposed from the only thing you could drill.</v>

2451
01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:52.311
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2452
01:10:52.311 --> 01:10:56.270
<v Speaker 2>if you really injured and you have a good opponent or a good training partner,</v>

2453
01:10:56.271 --> 01:10:58.070
<v Speaker 2>you can drill on certain things and say,</v>

2454
01:10:58.071 --> 01:10:58.401
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2455
01:10:58.401 --> 01:11:01.010
<v Speaker 2>you just can't touch my shoulder but there's no way you can spar.</v>

2456
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:06.230
<v Speaker 2>And there's no way you could really prepare for a fight without really hard</v>

2457
01:11:06.231 --> 01:11:08.520
<v Speaker 2>training and hard training with,</v>

2458
01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.580
<v Speaker 2>with injuries is virtually impossible.</v>

2459
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2460
01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:11.680
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2461
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.590
<v Speaker 2>with some injuries,</v>

2462
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:13.441
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean of them,</v>

2463
01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 2>you can work around.</v>

2464
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:16.110
<v Speaker 2>This is ways to figure a way around things.</v>

2465
01:11:16.111 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that I've found was really interesting also about</v>

2466
01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:19.790
<v Speaker 2>the UFC performances too,</v>

2467
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.330
<v Speaker 2>does there's a lot of different things that you guys have devised or have,</v>

2468
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2469
01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:28.170
<v Speaker 2>you've guys are brought in and implemented that other people have devised to</v>

2470
01:11:28.171 --> 01:11:31.530
<v Speaker 2>help people with injuries that are trying to still train hard.</v>

2471
01:11:31.531 --> 01:11:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Like that gravity treadmill thing that's in our,</v>

2472
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.540
<v Speaker 2>in our altitude chamber.</v>

2473
01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.900
<v Speaker 2>So you strap that around you and you're getting not,</v>

2474
01:11:38.901 --> 01:11:39.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2475
01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the ratio is too.</v>

2476
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:41.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2477
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.580
<v Speaker 2>if you're true weight to what type of stress you're putting on your body,</v>

2478
01:11:44.581 --> 01:11:47.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's much less and going out and run it on a regular treadmill or on the</v>

2479
01:11:47.311 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 2>street now outside the underwater treadmill,</v>

2480
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:50.460
<v Speaker 2>which you saw.</v>

2481
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.510
<v Speaker 2>So that was weird.</v>

2482
01:11:51.511 --> 01:11:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Angela Hill was on that and I was like,</v>

2483
01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:54.240
<v Speaker 2>what's that like?</v>

2484
01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:54.541
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

2485
01:11:54.541 --> 01:11:55.190
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

2486
01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2487
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2488
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:57.270
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2489
01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:59.100
<v Speaker 2>it just seems like the floor is moving.</v>

2490
01:11:59.101 --> 01:11:59.620
<v Speaker 2>You've got to check,</v>

2491
01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.453
<v Speaker 2>keep up with it.</v>

2492
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Basically it's a rising floor.</v>

2493
01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:03.870
<v Speaker 2>So you rise up to the top,</v>

2494
01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:04.531
<v Speaker 2>you step on it,</v>

2495
01:12:04.531 --> 01:12:07.860
<v Speaker 2>and then it drops down and it works like a regular treadmill because you're,</v>

2496
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.470
<v Speaker 2>but because you're under water,</v>

2497
01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.140
<v Speaker 2>you're putting less stress on obviously your lower extremities.</v>

2498
01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:17.700
<v Speaker 2>And if you notice also there's cameras underwater with a TV screen right in</v>

2499
01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:18.380
<v Speaker 2>front of,</v>

2500
01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:18.901
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

2501
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:19.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2502
01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.270
<v Speaker 2>the person using them.</v>

2503
01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:24.000
<v Speaker 2>The idea there is if you have an ankle injury or a knee injury,</v>

2504
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 2>you could take a look at how your foot's coming down and are you favor in it and</v>

2505
01:12:27.421 --> 01:12:27.930
<v Speaker 2>what's your,</v>

2506
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:28.890
<v Speaker 2>your gate looking like?</v>

2507
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.040
<v Speaker 2>So cool piece of equipment.</v>

2508
01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Connor was using that quite a bit and in the run up to,</v>

2509
01:12:33.661 --> 01:12:33.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2510
01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:34.351
<v Speaker 2>to Floyd,</v>

2511
01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.450
<v Speaker 2>he put a lot of stuff out there on social media on that thing.</v>

2512
01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I think you liked it.</v>

2513
01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:37.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2514
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Well he's got a bum knee,</v>

2515
01:12:38.491 --> 01:12:38.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2516
01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:40.260
<v Speaker 2>He's got a niece that has had a,</v>

2517
01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.880
<v Speaker 2>he's had some issues with in the past.</v>

2518
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:43.163
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

2519
01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:44.373
<v Speaker 2>That's done.</v>

2520
01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a Dunkin French off there to the right,</v>

2521
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:46.951
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2522
01:12:46.951 --> 01:12:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Just drops you down and then you run in that thing.</v>

2523
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:50.363
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2524
01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2525
01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.621
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man,</v>

2526
01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not 100% sold on that to be honest with it.</v>

2527
01:12:54.651 --> 01:12:55.800
<v Speaker 2>That's why I should come out and get it.</v>

2528
01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:56.191
<v Speaker 2>Get on it.</v>

2529
01:12:56.191 --> 01:12:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2530
01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:57.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm sure it's difficult,</v>

2531
01:12:57.631 --> 01:13:02.631
<v Speaker 2>but I think that like actually carrying your weight and running on hills is a</v>

2532
01:13:03.391 --> 01:13:04.950
<v Speaker 2>way to go probably now look,</v>

2533
01:13:04.951 --> 01:13:06.840
<v Speaker 2>if you're coming off an ACL surgery,</v>

2534
01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:07.290
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2535
01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:10.650
<v Speaker 2>and you know you're taking baby steps to get back to running,</v>

2536
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.761
<v Speaker 2>it's probably there.</v>

2537
01:13:11.761 --> 01:13:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

2538
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.430
<v Speaker 2>if you're healthy and you know,</v>

2539
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.560
<v Speaker 2>training for a fight coming up in a couple of weeks,</v>

2540
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's necessarily,</v>

2541
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:19.680
<v Speaker 2>that's he's good equipment for you.</v>

2542
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.420
<v Speaker 2>He's a guy that I'm puzzled by.</v>

2543
01:13:21.421 --> 01:13:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Conor.</v>

2544
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I'm a gigantic fan,</v>

2545
01:13:23.281 --> 01:13:24.061
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

2546
01:13:24.061 --> 01:13:24.930
<v Speaker 2>his cardio,</v>

2547
01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.120
<v Speaker 2>it seems like there's a thing there.</v>

2548
01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:28.110
<v Speaker 2>There's something there.</v>

2549
01:13:28.111 --> 01:13:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's the style that he fights,</v>

2550
01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:32.220
<v Speaker 2>the explosive sprinting style that he fights,</v>

2551
01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:33.300
<v Speaker 2>it's unsustainable,</v>

2552
01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2553
01:13:34.021 --> 01:13:38.340
<v Speaker 2>or whether or not there seems to be some sort of an issue that that needs to be</v>

2554
01:13:38.341 --> 01:13:39.174
<v Speaker 2>addressed.</v>

2555
01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Some much more radical approach to a strength and conditioning.</v>

2556
01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.500
<v Speaker 2>And I would love to see the guys that performance institute try to tackle that</v>

2557
01:13:46.501 --> 01:13:47.400
<v Speaker 2>and try to figure out,</v>

2558
01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:47.821
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2559
01:13:47.821 --> 01:13:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they've run vo two Max is on them and,</v>

2560
01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 2>but he gets it.</v>

2561
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.620
<v Speaker 2>He did most of his camp there,</v>

2562
01:13:52.621 --> 01:13:53.161
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2563
01:13:53.161 --> 01:13:56.160
<v Speaker 2>he had his own team around him that was kind of directing him.</v>

2564
01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2565
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:57.870
<v Speaker 2>but in his defense,</v>

2566
01:13:57.871 --> 01:13:59.190
<v Speaker 2>this was a very quick camp.</v>

2567
01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:02.220
<v Speaker 2>You're getting ready for a 12 round fight with the greatest fighter of all time</v>

2568
01:14:02.221 --> 01:14:03.054
<v Speaker 2>in boxing.</v>

2569
01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2570
01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:05.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like six or seven weeks.</v>

2571
01:14:05.101 --> 01:14:06.690
<v Speaker 2>I think Floyd knew what he was doing.</v>

2572
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.810
<v Speaker 2>I tell you one of the incredible things about that and there wasn't a lot said</v>

2573
01:14:09.811 --> 01:14:12.490
<v Speaker 2>about it going back to kind my world anti-doping world.</v>

2574
01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:14.770
<v Speaker 2>So Floyd does this for all his fights.</v>

2575
01:14:14.771 --> 01:14:18.100
<v Speaker 2>He basically hires you sought to do testing.</v>

2576
01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2577
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:20.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

2578
01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2579
01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:24.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same as the UFC program where you're subject to testing year round</v>

2580
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.540
<v Speaker 2>in boxing.</v>

2581
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Once the fight has made you saw to then comes in and does collecting.</v>

2582
01:14:29.171 --> 01:14:31.900
<v Speaker 2>So it depends on how far out the fight was made.</v>

2583
01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:34.540
<v Speaker 2>But Conor and Floyd sign that contract,</v>

2584
01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:35.830
<v Speaker 2>was it seven weeks out?</v>

2585
01:14:35.831 --> 01:14:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they were each tested 16 times and that seven weeks.</v>

2586
01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:45.280
<v Speaker 2>And I guarantee you they are the two most tested athletes and that pure short</v>

2587
01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:48.070
<v Speaker 2>period of time ever in the history of anti-doping.</v>

2588
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:51.040
<v Speaker 2>So not only was it a incredibly cool event,</v>

2589
01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:52.660
<v Speaker 2>but I think incredibly clean,</v>

2590
01:14:52.661 --> 01:14:57.160
<v Speaker 2>cool and clean for the fans and know that you know how out of the way those two</v>

2591
01:14:57.161 --> 01:15:00.160
<v Speaker 2>guys went to ensure that that fight was fair and clean.</v>

2592
01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:02.020
<v Speaker 2>That is amazing enough credit for that.</v>

2593
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:03.191
<v Speaker 2>It's too bad.</v>

2594
01:15:03.191 --> 01:15:06.160
<v Speaker 2>There's not too performance institutes or you could have one right next to each</v>

2595
01:15:06.161 --> 01:15:06.341
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

2596
01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:08.170
<v Speaker 2>We're opponents could train at very,</v>

2597
01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:08.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2598
01:15:08.321 --> 01:15:12.400
<v Speaker 2>like you could film things at the performance institute in a,</v>

2599
01:15:12.401 --> 01:15:13.240
<v Speaker 2>at a level.</v>

2600
01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2601
01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Forrest Griffin was showing me how the octagon is set up with 360 degree cameras</v>

2602
01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:24.570
<v Speaker 2>and you could literally film and then rotate angles up down.</v>

2603
01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:25.750
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

2604
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:28.030
<v Speaker 2>you can move around and show,</v>

2605
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.661
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2606
01:15:28.661 --> 01:15:29.890
<v Speaker 2>when you're throwing this punch,</v>

2607
01:15:29.891 --> 01:15:31.330
<v Speaker 2>your back foot is coming off the ground.</v>

2608
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.980
<v Speaker 2>When you're leaning to your left,</v>

2609
01:15:32.981 --> 01:15:34.150
<v Speaker 2>you're dropping your hand.</v>

2610
01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:39.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like the John Madden telestrator do stop action and draw on that huge big</v>

2611
01:15:39.011 --> 01:15:42.400
<v Speaker 2>screen next to the octagon around exactly what Floyd was shown.</v>

2612
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:42.971
<v Speaker 2>Or excuse me,</v>

2613
01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:43.301
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2614
01:15:43.301 --> 01:15:43.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2615
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:44.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2616
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:46.320
<v Speaker 2>forest was showing me how you can move it around.</v>

2617
01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:46.631
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2618
01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:47.650
<v Speaker 2>this is insane.</v>

2619
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:48.011
<v Speaker 2>Like this.</v>

2620
01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:50.740
<v Speaker 2>What a tool this is for technique development.</v>

2621
01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:51.101
<v Speaker 2>It really,</v>

2622
01:15:51.101 --> 01:15:52.580
<v Speaker 2>and I think we're at the infancy of,</v>

2623
01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.390
<v Speaker 2>of these coaches coming in and figuring out how they can use these things he had</v>

2624
01:15:56.391 --> 01:15:58.120
<v Speaker 2>sent that they can benefit their funders.</v>

2625
01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

2626
01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.100
<v Speaker 2>there it is right there.</v>

2627
01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2628
01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:01.420
<v Speaker 2>This thing,</v>

2629
01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:01.720
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2630
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:02.440
<v Speaker 2>there's my tour.</v>

2631
01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:02.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2632
01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:05.910
<v Speaker 2>did somebody put that up on these fucking on already?</v>

2633
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.753
<v Speaker 2>They put it up.</v>

2634
01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2635
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:08.703
<v Speaker 2>I didn't put this,</v>

2636
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2637
01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Put It on my Instagram stories,</v>

2638
01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:11.800
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't put it on Youtube.</v>

2639
01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Somebody put it on youtube here.</v>

2640
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:18.090
<v Speaker 2>So what what force was showing me was how they can pause it and slow mo and back</v>

2641
01:16:18.761 --> 01:16:23.761
<v Speaker 2>it up and then change angles and that all the fighters sparring sessions or</v>

2642
01:16:23.771 --> 01:16:25.450
<v Speaker 2>filmed their film from an overhead,</v>

2643
01:16:25.451 --> 01:16:26.800
<v Speaker 2>their film from the sides.</v>

2644
01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 2>And there's cameras all around the octagon.</v>

2645
01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just what a facility man.</v>

2646
01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:33.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2647
01:16:33.581 --> 01:16:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean I really think we talked about this.</v>

2648
01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.750
<v Speaker 2>This is bringing the sport to a whole new level.</v>

2649
01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:38.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2650
01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Well Frances is going to be your first test tube sorta child.</v>

2651
01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2652
01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.750
<v Speaker 2>You know you talked about,</v>

2653
01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:49.650
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be nice to have two opponents working side by side?</v>

2654
01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.250
<v Speaker 2>The Pi has that capability.</v>

2655
01:16:51.251 --> 01:16:52.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean as you saw it,</v>

2656
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:53.650
<v Speaker 2>it's set up specifically.</v>

2657
01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:57.310
<v Speaker 2>So you have certain things downstairs and certain things upstairs so you'd have</v>

2658
01:16:57.311 --> 01:16:57.861
<v Speaker 2>to schedule it.</v>

2659
01:16:57.861 --> 01:16:58.990
<v Speaker 2>So Steve Bay says,</v>

2660
01:16:58.991 --> 01:16:59.321
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>

2661
01:16:59.321 --> 01:17:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I want to come out and use this.</v>

2662
01:17:00.281 --> 01:17:00.580
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

2663
01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 2>it is open to Steve Bay.</v>

2664
01:17:01.721 --> 01:17:02.690
<v Speaker 2>We could schedule it.</v>

2665
01:17:02.691 --> 01:17:05.740
<v Speaker 2>So Steve Bay's downstairs doing a strength and conditioning and while Francis</v>

2666
01:17:05.741 --> 01:17:06.580
<v Speaker 2>was upstairs,</v>

2667
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:09.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of what forest does force,</v>

2668
01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:09.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2669
01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.800
<v Speaker 2>it could be the intermediary to make sure Francis goes out one door,</v>

2670
01:17:12.801 --> 01:17:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Steepbank comes in another never run into themselves.</v>

2671
01:17:15.081 --> 01:17:17.030
<v Speaker 2>But that definitely has taken them and they are there.</v>

2672
01:17:17.031 --> 01:17:17.600
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2673
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.310
<v Speaker 2>but what I would,</v>

2674
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:19.010
<v Speaker 2>if I was tpa,</v>

2675
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I would not want to be doing strength conditioning and then in between sets,</v>

2676
01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.970
<v Speaker 2>just like have your ear and you hear Coppola.</v>

2677
01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Francis is hitting the heavy bag and scaring everybody.</v>

2678
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:32.263
<v Speaker 2>You your style.</v>

2679
01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:33.610
<v Speaker 2>You tried that,</v>

2680
01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:34.640
<v Speaker 2>that punch machine.</v>

2681
01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:35.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2682
01:17:35.061 --> 01:17:37.430
<v Speaker 2>he's got the world record punch on that.</v>

2683
01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:38.150
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

2684
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:39.830
<v Speaker 2>what it is is like a for folks,</v>

2685
01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:40.551
<v Speaker 2>it's a pad.</v>

2686
01:17:40.551 --> 01:17:41.181
<v Speaker 2>It's adjustable,</v>

2687
01:17:41.181 --> 01:17:43.640
<v Speaker 2>it moves up and down and you punch it.</v>

2688
01:17:43.641 --> 01:17:45.950
<v Speaker 2>And not only did he break the world record,</v>

2689
01:17:45.951 --> 01:17:49.790
<v Speaker 2>he broke it by several thousand pounds per square inch.</v>

2690
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2691
01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I think his reading,</v>

2692
01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:53.510
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know what the reading is,</v>

2693
01:17:53.511 --> 01:17:57.500
<v Speaker 2>was 129,000 something and yeah,</v>

2694
01:17:57.501 --> 01:17:58.190
<v Speaker 2>he's terrified.</v>

2695
01:17:58.190 --> 01:17:59.023
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2696
01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:00.260
<v Speaker 2>You hit it a couple times,</v>

2697
01:18:00.261 --> 01:18:00.411
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2698
01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:01.520
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were hitting pretty hard.</v>

2699
01:18:01.521 --> 01:18:01.641
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2700
01:18:01.641 --> 01:18:02.301
<v Speaker 2>what did you register?</v>

2701
01:18:02.301 --> 01:18:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Like a 35 or 40,000?</v>

2702
01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.270
<v Speaker 2>I got 46 is my hardest one to,</v>

2703
01:18:06.271 --> 01:18:07.104
<v Speaker 2>I hurt my hand.</v>

2704
01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:10.670
<v Speaker 2>He kind of put gloves on to do that too.</v>

2705
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:14.870
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that being wrapped up and that's an argument that I've had many</v>

2706
01:18:14.871 --> 01:18:17.060
<v Speaker 2>times when it comes to MMA in general.</v>

2707
01:18:17.061 --> 01:18:19.970
<v Speaker 2>I like how you can angle it so you can throw an uppercut as well.</v>

2708
01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2709
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:22.250
<v Speaker 2>that's an argument that I've had.</v>

2710
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2711
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:24.320
<v Speaker 2>for MMA in general,</v>

2712
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's weird that we,</v>

2713
01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2714
01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:32.260
<v Speaker 2>are allowed to elbow with no pad knee with no pad kick with no pad on the Shin,</v>

2715
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:35.420
<v Speaker 2>but the knuckles are protected.</v>

2716
01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:40.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think that it really probably allows people to deliver more damage with</v>

2717
01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:42.950
<v Speaker 2>the knuckles padded.</v>

2718
01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think padded knuckles helps your opponent as much as it helps you.</v>

2719
01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:49.070
<v Speaker 2>And especially risk protection.</v>

2720
01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was trying to punch that thing with just my bare hands,</v>

2721
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:53.743
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2722
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.943
<v Speaker 2>which is stupid,</v>

2723
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:56.330
<v Speaker 2>especially when you haven't warmed up.</v>

2724
01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2725
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:57.640
<v Speaker 2>But you're,</v>

2726
01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.580
<v Speaker 2>you realize like your,</v>

2727
01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.810
<v Speaker 2>your wrist moves around,</v>

2728
01:18:59.811 --> 01:19:02.270
<v Speaker 2>he's slamming of that thing and if you're hitting it hard,</v>

2729
01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:03.140
<v Speaker 2>your wrist moves around.</v>

2730
01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:03.981
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the case.</v>

2731
01:19:03.981 --> 01:19:05.480
<v Speaker 2>When you're punching a person to like,</v>

2732
01:19:05.481 --> 01:19:09.680
<v Speaker 2>you have to be much more precise with where you're targeting and what you're</v>

2733
01:19:09.681 --> 01:19:10.430
<v Speaker 2>hitting.</v>

2734
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 2>You can't hit foreheads and elbows,</v>

2735
01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:14.210
<v Speaker 2>you'll break your hand like very easily.</v>

2736
01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 2>And I wonder,</v>

2737
01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.160
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2738
01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.400
<v Speaker 2>it seems barbaric to people to,</v>

2739
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:19.820
<v Speaker 2>to fight bare knuckle,</v>

2740
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.070
<v Speaker 2>which to me is kind of crazy cause you're kicking,</v>

2741
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:22.761
<v Speaker 2>like you're,</v>

2742
01:19:22.761 --> 01:19:26.150
<v Speaker 2>you're shinning people in the head like I don't understand.</v>

2743
01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Like we have this weird sort of childish view of like what should and shouldn't</v>

2744
01:19:30.621 --> 01:19:30.771
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

2745
01:19:30.771 --> 01:19:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Legal elbows are some of the hardest.</v>

2746
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:34.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2747
01:19:34.071 --> 01:19:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you can just do that with an owl and it doesn't hurt at all.</v>

2748
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:37.551
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2749
01:19:37.551 --> 01:19:38.450
<v Speaker 2>your knees,</v>

2750
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:39.410
<v Speaker 2>your shins,</v>

2751
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:40.400
<v Speaker 2>those guys that,</v>

2752
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2753
01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:43.160
<v Speaker 2>spar Muay Thai for a years and years,</v>

2754
01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.840
<v Speaker 2>their shins develop calcification all over the top where they can kick baseball</v>

2755
01:19:47.841 --> 01:19:48.171
<v Speaker 2>bats.</v>

2756
01:19:48.171 --> 01:19:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Like there's trees.</v>

2757
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2758
01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2759
01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:51.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a great one.</v>

2760
01:19:51.051 --> 01:19:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Have a bull cow,</v>

2761
01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:52.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2762
01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:55.310
<v Speaker 2>kicking a banana tree just going cray.</v>

2763
01:19:55.311 --> 01:19:57.440
<v Speaker 2>And he's one of the greatest tie fighters of all time,</v>

2764
01:19:57.441 --> 01:19:58.010
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

2765
01:19:58.010 --> 01:20:00.890
<v Speaker 2>he's chopping at this banana tree and cuts it in half and you're like,</v>

2766
01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.753
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

2767
01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:05.270
<v Speaker 2>like how is it okay that that guy can kick someone in the face with that?</v>

2768
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:07.290
<v Speaker 2>But you have to have pads here.</v>

2769
01:20:07.291 --> 01:20:08.124
<v Speaker 2>He was right here.</v>

2770
01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2771
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:09.900
<v Speaker 2>give me some volume on this.</v>

2772
01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:12.163
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2773
01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.490
<v Speaker 4>Waken a fucking tree.</v>

2774
01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:21.493
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

2775
01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:25.570
<v Speaker 4>is not doing that with his bare knuckle will tell you that.</v>

2776
01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:27.213
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

2777
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Fucking hit in the face with that.</v>

2778
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:36.960
<v Speaker 2>But see the difference like that's hard bone.</v>

2779
01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2780
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 2>no padding.</v>

2781
01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Why do you have to have padding on your knuckles but you don't have to have it</v>

2782
01:20:41.641 --> 01:20:45.180
<v Speaker 2>on your shins and your knees and your elbows.</v>

2783
01:20:45.181 --> 01:20:49.350
<v Speaker 2>That seems to me to be a silly way of approaching everything.</v>

2784
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2785
01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe we could pat up everything,</v>

2786
01:20:52.501 --> 01:20:53.430
<v Speaker 2>but then people get mad.</v>

2787
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2788
01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Like we're posing for the sport.</v>

2789
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I think you go the other way.</v>

2790
01:20:56.761 --> 01:20:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I think you don't pat up anything.</v>

2791
01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:00.350
<v Speaker 2>I think you pat up your Dick and that's it.</v>

2792
01:21:00.930 --> 01:21:01.621
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>

2793
01:21:01.621 --> 01:21:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Pat Up your teeth pad up your Dick.</v>

2794
01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.313
<v Speaker 2>Let her rip.</v>

2795
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I really think they should fight bare knuckle.</v>

2796
01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it makes any sense whatsoever.</v>

2797
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Especially considering the fact that I poke.</v>

2798
01:21:10.721 --> 01:21:12.060
<v Speaker 2>So one of the major considerations,</v>

2799
01:21:12.061 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2800
01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.250
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to mitigate that with those gloves.</v>

2801
01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.040
<v Speaker 2>You're just,</v>

2802
01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:15.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2803
01:21:15.331 --> 01:21:19.380
<v Speaker 2>unless they develop some sort of a new designed where the gloves are much more</v>

2804
01:21:19.381 --> 01:21:20.280
<v Speaker 2>curled in.</v>

2805
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2806
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2807
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:21.721
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2808
01:21:21.721 --> 01:21:22.250
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>

2809
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:23.850
<v Speaker 2>the I pokes or it was going to be an issue.</v>

2810
01:21:23.851 --> 01:21:26.970
<v Speaker 2>It would be the exact same issue if you had bare knuckle.</v>

2811
01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:27.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2812
01:21:27.241 --> 01:21:27.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2813
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:29.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean now you can take away with a new unified rules,</v>

2814
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:30.300
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2815
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:30.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2816
01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:32.490
<v Speaker 2>ironically enough aren't unified.</v>

2817
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2818
01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm so we go from commission to commission and you know,</v>

2819
01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:39.090
<v Speaker 2>flight or what have to inform them.</v>

2820
01:21:39.091 --> 01:21:39.541
<v Speaker 2>Fight week,</v>

2821
01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:39.661
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2822
01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:44.280
<v Speaker 2>what are the rules here that's so unfair to these fighters that in our training</v>

2823
01:21:44.281 --> 01:21:46.680
<v Speaker 2>and developing that instinct to some of these rules.</v>

2824
01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:47.851
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

2825
01:21:47.851 --> 01:21:49.890
<v Speaker 2>the new unified rules which aren't unified,</v>

2826
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:50.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2827
01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.030
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's extending the fingers at the referee has to warn them first.</v>

2828
01:21:54.031 --> 01:21:55.230
<v Speaker 2>But they continue to do that.</v>

2829
01:21:55.231 --> 01:21:56.280
<v Speaker 2>A point can be taken away.</v>

2830
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I think they should take a point.</v>

2831
01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Every time I got gets poked in the eye and my,</v>

2832
01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:02.910
<v Speaker 2>my thought process is even if it's unintentional,</v>

2833
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:04.080
<v Speaker 2>the damage has been done.</v>

2834
01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:04.540
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>

2835
01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:05.373
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2836
01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.570
<v Speaker 2>if you could see it on the replay,</v>

2837
01:22:06.571 --> 01:22:07.260
<v Speaker 2>legitimate,</v>

2838
01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I poke and you see the guy and wincing,</v>

2839
01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:09.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2840
01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:10.201
<v Speaker 2>which we've seen many,</v>

2841
01:22:10.201 --> 01:22:14.850
<v Speaker 2>many times that guys compromised and I think that it's only fair that a point be</v>

2842
01:22:14.851 --> 01:22:16.560
<v Speaker 2>taken away even if it was unintentional.</v>

2843
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:17.191
<v Speaker 2>What's like,</v>

2844
01:22:17.191 --> 01:22:17.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2845
01:22:17.431 --> 01:22:19.320
<v Speaker 2>kicking or needing a down fighter too,</v>

2846
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.741
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

2847
01:22:19.741 --> 01:22:22.230
<v Speaker 2>you have to show intent to take a point away.</v>

2848
01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2849
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 2>How is the referee going to get in the head of a fighter to say whether or not</v>

2850
01:22:26.551 --> 01:22:27.430
<v Speaker 2>that was intentional?</v>

2851
01:22:27.431 --> 01:22:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Ride it,</v>

2852
01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.390
<v Speaker 2>it should almost be I think that if it's done,</v>

2853
01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:30.511
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2854
01:22:30.511 --> 01:22:31.410
<v Speaker 2>points taken away,</v>

2855
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:31.861
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2856
01:22:31.861 --> 01:22:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Remove the intent from it because the damage is already done at that point.</v>

2857
01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2858
01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:37.320
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter whether or not this intentional,</v>

2859
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.561
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2860
01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:39.120
<v Speaker 2>we're not putting the blame on the fighter.</v>

2861
01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:39.511
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

2862
01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:40.141
<v Speaker 2>it happened.</v>

2863
01:22:40.141 --> 01:22:41.430
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the unfortunate things,</v>

2864
01:22:41.431 --> 01:22:45.170
<v Speaker 2>but the fighter that got hit is the one who suffers the consequences of it.</v>

2865
01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:47.880
<v Speaker 2>There's no way it should be an even exchange like,</v>

2866
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:48.031
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2867
01:22:48.031 --> 01:22:48.511
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

2868
01:22:48.511 --> 01:22:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I accidentally need your eye socket it.</v>

2869
01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2870
01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:51.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2871
01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:51.541
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2872
01:22:51.541 --> 01:22:52.530
<v Speaker 2>no point taken.</v>

2873
01:22:52.531 --> 01:22:53.930
<v Speaker 2>And now you can't go on that.</v>

2874
01:22:53.931 --> 01:22:54.900
<v Speaker 2>That to me sounds,</v>

2875
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I think there's room to,</v>

2876
01:22:57.691 --> 01:22:57.960
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2877
01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.990
<v Speaker 2>to alter the rules and I mean I,</v>

2878
01:22:59.991 --> 01:23:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2879
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm beating a dead horse with my bare knuckle thing because I've been talking</v>

2880
01:23:03.721 --> 01:23:05.750
<v Speaker 2>about that for years because I just think people have a</v>

2881
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:10.660
<v Speaker 1>greatly exaggerated perception of the effectiveness of punching people in the</v>

2882
01:23:10.661 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

2883
01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:14.140
<v Speaker 1>And I think that greatly exaggerated perception is due to the fact that they</v>

2884
01:23:14.141 --> 01:23:15.010
<v Speaker 1>wrap their hands,</v>

2885
01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:17.560
<v Speaker 1>you wrap up your wrists and your,</v>

2886
01:23:17.561 --> 01:23:21.140
<v Speaker 1>your wrist and your hand becomes a cast where it's not bending at all.</v>

2887
01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean you get deep in there with athletic tape and Gauze and they cover the</v>

2888
01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:28.120
<v Speaker 1>knuckles and everything gets good at it and you could just fucking blast</v>

2889
01:23:28.121 --> 01:23:28.954
<v Speaker 1>something with that.</v>

2890
01:23:29.290 --> 01:23:31.360
<v Speaker 1>But when you just have just your hands,</v>

2891
01:23:31.361 --> 01:23:32.710
<v Speaker 1>it feels very delicate.</v>

2892
01:23:32.711 --> 01:23:37.270
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people you should punch the bag occasionally at least bare</v>

2893
01:23:37.271 --> 01:23:37.870
<v Speaker 1>knuckle,</v>

2894
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:42.220
<v Speaker 1>just go and punch the bag and you realize you can't really hit nearly as hard.</v>

2895
01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.593
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2896
01:23:44.230 --> 01:23:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I just think that we have like you can't take the shit out of your ankles.</v>

2897
01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2898
01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2899
01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've stopped fighters from walking into the octagon with fully tie,</v>

2900
01:23:54.101 --> 01:23:55.090
<v Speaker 1>taped up ankles,</v>

2901
01:23:55.091 --> 01:23:55.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2902
01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.440
<v Speaker 1>pull some commissions,</v>

2903
01:23:56.441 --> 01:23:59.200
<v Speaker 1>allow light tape and then a neoprene sleeve over it.</v>

2904
01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Others say no,</v>

2905
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:01.120
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2906
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:01.541
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2907
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:03.040
<v Speaker 1>the uniformity is again,</v>

2908
01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.700
<v Speaker 1>you know what to talk about uniform,</v>

2909
01:24:04.701 --> 01:24:06.850
<v Speaker 1>but he kind of bringing it back to the anti-doping world.</v>

2910
01:24:06.851 --> 01:24:11.280
<v Speaker 1>This is a big point of contention I have with athletic commissions.</v>

2911
01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:11.681
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2912
01:24:11.681 --> 01:24:12.520
<v Speaker 1>really frustrated.</v>

2913
01:24:12.521 --> 01:24:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's the marijuana rules.</v>

2914
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:16.300
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking my language is,</v>

2915
01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:17.051
<v Speaker 1>you have to see,</v>

2916
01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:17.471
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>

2917
01:24:17.471 --> 01:24:22.471
<v Speaker 1>So the UFC follows the water rules world antidoping agency kind of sets the</v>

2918
01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.011
<v Speaker 1>world standard.</v>

2919
01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:28.360
<v Speaker 1>They have scientists that study these drugs and determine a is something</v>

2920
01:24:28.361 --> 01:24:30.550
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing B,</v>

2921
01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:32.110
<v Speaker 1>is it a health and safety issue?</v>

2922
01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:35.320
<v Speaker 1>And over the last couple of years they rise.</v>

2923
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:38.860
<v Speaker 1>They raised the marijuana threshold used to be 15 nanograms per milliliter.</v>

2924
01:24:38.861 --> 01:24:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Now must succeed 150 nanograms per milliliter,</v>

2925
01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.100
<v Speaker 1>which everybody metabolizes differently.</v>

2926
01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:47.830
<v Speaker 1>But you know from scientists that I've talked about,</v>

2927
01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.470
<v Speaker 1>the ingestion of marijuana or THC,</v>

2928
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:54.970
<v Speaker 1>the psychoactive ingredient has to be pretty damn close to that collection in</v>

2929
01:24:54.971 --> 01:24:57.580
<v Speaker 1>order to exceed 150 nanograms per milliliter,</v>

2930
01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:00.910
<v Speaker 1>which means you literally almost have to be high the day pretty much.</v>

2931
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So if an athlete just takes a day or two off,</v>

2932
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:07.690
<v Speaker 1>their most light suggests longer than that,</v>

2933
01:25:07.691 --> 01:25:11.380
<v Speaker 1>just because you never know how different people metabolize things differently</v>

2934
01:25:11.381 --> 01:25:12.400
<v Speaker 1>as you're cutting weight,</v>

2935
01:25:12.401 --> 01:25:14.560
<v Speaker 1>whether you're releasing some from your fat cells.</v>

2936
01:25:14.561 --> 01:25:15.011
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2937
01:25:15.011 --> 01:25:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I would suggest you know,</v>

2938
01:25:16.061 --> 01:25:16.841
<v Speaker 1>several weeks,</v>

2939
01:25:16.841 --> 01:25:19.840
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is it could be a lot closer than that.</v>

2940
01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:22.600
<v Speaker 1>What we're running into several athletic commissions,</v>

2941
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Texas being one New York being another,</v>

2942
01:25:26.110 --> 01:25:30.550
<v Speaker 1>we had probably the most extreme one last month in Michigan that have lower</v>

2943
01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:31.660
<v Speaker 1>thresholds.</v>

2944
01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2945
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Texas and New York have 35 or 50 Michigan where we just came from has a no</v>

2946
01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:43.480
<v Speaker 1>tolerance policy for marijuana.</v>

2947
01:25:43.481 --> 01:25:48.430
<v Speaker 1>So any measurable amount of THC would cause a positive test.</v>

2948
01:25:48.431 --> 01:25:51.580
<v Speaker 1>And we lobbied them hard in anticipation of our event.</v>

2949
01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:52.414
<v Speaker 1>They're saying,</v>

2950
01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:54.010
<v Speaker 1>do you realize what this means?</v>

2951
01:25:54.011 --> 01:25:54.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2952
01:25:54.251 --> 01:25:57.880
<v Speaker 1>a fighter could walk through a cloud of secondhand smoke,</v>

2953
01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:58.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2954
01:25:58.511 --> 01:26:02.980
<v Speaker 1>on the way to weigh in or a fight and it's going to show up a measurable amount</v>

2955
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:06.620
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to fight or could win a championship on that and you're going</v>

2956
01:26:06.621 --> 01:26:08.720
<v Speaker 1>to take that championship away and overturn the,</v>

2957
01:26:08.721 --> 01:26:09.710
<v Speaker 1>when we hadn't,</v>

2958
01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Texas a couple wins overturned for a threshold,</v>

2959
01:26:13.821 --> 01:26:14.740
<v Speaker 1>which I think we're a little bit of,</v>

2960
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I think 35,</v>

2961
01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:17.300
<v Speaker 1>it's your 35 or 50 was there,</v>

2962
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:18.590
<v Speaker 1>but there were slightly over that.</v>

2963
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Well under the,</v>

2964
01:26:19.630 --> 01:26:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2965
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:22.340
<v Speaker 1>established world standard and man,</v>

2966
01:26:22.341 --> 01:26:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I think these athletic commissions got to take a serious look at bringing those</v>

2967
01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:27.260
<v Speaker 1>into uniformity.</v>

2968
01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:28.633
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

2969
01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:29.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2970
01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:32.750
<v Speaker 1>in the u s should have certain states now where it's legal medically and</v>

2971
01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:33.501
<v Speaker 1>recreationally,</v>

2972
01:26:33.501 --> 01:26:33.980
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2973
01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:35.060
<v Speaker 1>arguably federally,</v>

2974
01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:35.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2975
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:36.561
<v Speaker 1>still illegal.</v>

2976
01:26:36.561 --> 01:26:40.700
<v Speaker 1>But you have some countries where it's completely legal and you have doctors</v>

2977
01:26:40.701 --> 01:26:42.920
<v Speaker 1>prescribing this for,</v>

2978
01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:43.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2979
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:47.120
<v Speaker 1>pain control or stress or anxiety and you know,</v>

2980
01:26:47.170 --> 01:26:47.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2981
01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:47.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2982
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:49.130
<v Speaker 1>commission like Michigan,</v>

2983
01:26:49.131 --> 01:26:53.270
<v Speaker 1>one of those fighters from one of those countries that is completely legally</v>

2984
01:26:53.271 --> 01:26:55.160
<v Speaker 1>doing it under the care of a doctor.</v>

2985
01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:59.450
<v Speaker 1>And in lieu of doing a synthetic drug,</v>

2986
01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:03.560
<v Speaker 1>like an opioid or a Xanax or something like that,</v>

2987
01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:07.040
<v Speaker 1>common sense would tell you it's much healthier and safer to do that.</v>

2988
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2989
01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:08.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2990
01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:10.340
<v Speaker 1>you're setting up this barrier that,</v>

2991
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:10.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2992
01:27:10.611 --> 01:27:14.900
<v Speaker 1>could negatively affect a fighter's career if they have any discernible amount</v>

2993
01:27:14.901 --> 01:27:15.734
<v Speaker 1>in their system.</v>

2994
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.641
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2995
01:27:16.641 --> 01:27:17.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2996
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:17.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2997
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.550
<v Speaker 1>not only from the unified rules but from,</v>

2998
01:27:19.551 --> 01:27:22.620
<v Speaker 1>from an anti-doping marijuana's perspective to these commissions have got to</v>

2999
01:27:22.621 --> 01:27:25.150
<v Speaker 1>come together and you know,</v>

3000
01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.410
<v Speaker 1>realize what the right thing to do is and stop,</v>

3001
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:27.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3002
01:27:27.861 --> 01:27:31.520
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of instances stop governing or policing just because you can.</v>

3003
01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3004
01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:36.170
<v Speaker 1>we ran into that with the whole Cortney Casey thing and in Texas,</v>

3005
01:27:36.171 --> 01:27:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you familiar with that.</v>

3006
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3007
01:27:37.671 --> 01:27:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Just explain what happened.</v>

3008
01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So Courtney fought in Texas,</v>

3009
01:27:42.411 --> 01:27:45.170
<v Speaker 1>had a great win against Jessica Aguilar.</v>

3010
01:27:45.171 --> 01:27:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it was probably the defining moment of her career.</v>

3011
01:27:48.531 --> 01:27:49.161
<v Speaker 1>She looked really,</v>

3012
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:49.994
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

3013
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:51.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3014
01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:52.310
<v Speaker 1>a couple of weeks later,</v>

3015
01:27:52.311 --> 01:27:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I was actually at our event and Stockholm,</v>

3016
01:27:54.201 --> 01:27:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>

3017
01:27:54.710 --> 01:27:54.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3018
01:27:54.891 --> 01:27:56.960
<v Speaker 1>it was vividly on a Friday night.</v>

3019
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.943
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3020
01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:01.520
<v Speaker 1>I got a call from her and I can't even understand what she's saying.</v>

3021
01:28:01.521 --> 01:28:03.320
<v Speaker 1>She's just crying uncontrollably.</v>

3022
01:28:03.321 --> 01:28:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Saint Jeff,</v>

3023
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3024
01:28:04.101 --> 01:28:05.150
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>

3025
01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even understand what it happens.</v>

3026
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:08.120
<v Speaker 1>It slows down what happened.</v>

3027
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:11.150
<v Speaker 1>So there's stuff on the Internet about me testing positive.</v>

3028
01:28:11.151 --> 01:28:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

3029
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I've never even thought about using a prohibited substance.</v>

3030
01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm super careful about what I use.</v>

3031
01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:18.111
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

3032
01:28:18.111 --> 01:28:18.321
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3033
01:28:18.321 --> 01:28:19.250
<v Speaker 1>let me check into it.</v>

3034
01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:21.800
<v Speaker 1>And so I called a guy on the Texas commission.</v>

3035
01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:22.641
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3036
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:22.761
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3037
01:28:22.761 --> 01:28:23.870
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

3038
01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3039
01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:25.430
<v Speaker 1>with this Cortney Casey thing?</v>

3040
01:28:25.431 --> 01:28:26.151
<v Speaker 1>And he tells me,</v>

3041
01:28:26.151 --> 01:28:26.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3042
01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:27.110
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

3043
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:28.160
<v Speaker 1>she tested positive.</v>

3044
01:28:28.161 --> 01:28:29.450
<v Speaker 1>We just announced it and I said,</v>

3045
01:28:29.451 --> 01:28:30.980
<v Speaker 1>for what she said,</v>

3046
01:28:30.981 --> 01:28:33.470
<v Speaker 1>or her tee ratio was elevated.</v>

3047
01:28:33.471 --> 01:28:34.790
<v Speaker 1>It was over a four to one.</v>

3048
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:36.020
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3049
01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:36.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3050
01:28:36.381 --> 01:28:39.170
<v Speaker 1>knowing with that measurement means,</v>

3051
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:39.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3052
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3053
01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:40.931
<v Speaker 1>explain what it means.</v>

3054
01:28:40.931 --> 01:28:41.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3055
01:28:41.121 --> 01:28:44.060
<v Speaker 1>So tee tee his testosterone,</v>

3056
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.911
<v Speaker 1>he is Epi,</v>

3057
01:28:44.911 --> 01:28:49.911
<v Speaker 1>testosterone and every human being male and female have on average a one to one</v>

3058
01:28:50.571 --> 01:28:52.250
<v Speaker 1>ratio naturally occurring in them.</v>

3059
01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:55.910
<v Speaker 1>And if you take anabolic steroids,</v>

3060
01:28:55.911 --> 01:28:58.250
<v Speaker 1>it can have a tendency to raise that ratio,</v>

3061
01:28:58.460 --> 01:28:59.293
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3062
01:28:59.660 --> 01:28:59.961
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3063
01:28:59.961 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>where the t becomes higher than the e.</v>

3064
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3065
01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:03.541
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

3066
01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:07.440
<v Speaker 1>what anti-doping has found out and evolved into the last few years that</v>

3067
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:09.780
<v Speaker 1>especially mildly elevated ratios.</v>

3068
01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Sometime there are natural reasons for that happening,</v>

3069
01:29:13.050 --> 01:29:14.460
<v Speaker 1>especially in females,</v>

3070
01:29:14.670 --> 01:29:17.790
<v Speaker 1>especially females on birth control,</v>

3071
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.340
<v Speaker 1>which is illegal medication.</v>

3072
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do now in anti-doping,</v>

3073
01:29:22.831 --> 01:29:24.840
<v Speaker 1>when you have an elevated tee ratio,</v>

3074
01:29:24.841 --> 01:29:26.280
<v Speaker 1>you go to a backup test.</v>

3075
01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:31.020
<v Speaker 1>That backhoe test is called an isotope ratio mass spectrometry or earns test.</v>

3076
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:35.820
<v Speaker 1>And that reads the carbon atom in the testosterone in a sample to determine</v>

3077
01:29:35.821 --> 01:29:37.320
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's plant based,</v>

3078
01:29:37.321 --> 01:29:41.640
<v Speaker 1>which would mean a synthetic or it's naturally occurring because testosterone is</v>

3079
01:29:41.641 --> 01:29:43.890
<v Speaker 1>synthesized through wild yams.</v>

3080
01:29:43.891 --> 01:29:44.171
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>

3081
01:29:44.171 --> 01:29:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3082
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:45.171
<v Speaker 1>So that's how they find out.</v>

3083
01:29:45.171 --> 01:29:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Let's plant based.</v>

3084
01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:46.793
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

3085
01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 1>So Texas tells me,</v>

3086
01:29:48.601 --> 01:29:49.110
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3087
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:51.570
<v Speaker 1>her ratio was a little bit higher than afforded one.</v>

3088
01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.150
<v Speaker 1>That means she's positive and they say,</v>

3089
01:29:54.210 --> 01:29:54.751
<v Speaker 1>they tell me,</v>

3090
01:29:54.751 --> 01:29:56.730
<v Speaker 1>we're just following your guys' rules.</v>

3091
01:29:56.730 --> 01:29:58.680
<v Speaker 1>And I tell the guy that's not our rules.</v>

3092
01:29:59.310 --> 01:29:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3093
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:04.140
<v Speaker 1>you just announced a positive test for this girl.</v>

3094
01:30:04.141 --> 01:30:04.620
<v Speaker 1>And Hey,</v>

3095
01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:05.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3096
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe she did do something,</v>

3097
01:30:06.241 --> 01:30:07.074
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3098
01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:09.690
<v Speaker 1>but you're supposed to run the backup test for this.</v>

3099
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And it was basically told me,</v>

3100
01:30:11.401 --> 01:30:12.420
<v Speaker 1>well it was a Friday.</v>

3101
01:30:12.421 --> 01:30:12.601
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3102
01:30:12.601 --> 01:30:12.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3103
01:30:12.751 --> 01:30:14.400
<v Speaker 1>our office is closed Monday,</v>

3104
01:30:14.401 --> 01:30:15.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll get back to you on Tuesday.</v>

3105
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:19.260
<v Speaker 1>And really thereafter it was radio silence.</v>

3106
01:30:19.261 --> 01:30:21.480
<v Speaker 1>So we were working with Courtney,</v>

3107
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:25.350
<v Speaker 1>worked with Usada closely and you saw a stepped in and said,</v>

3108
01:30:25.351 --> 01:30:26.220
<v Speaker 1>absolutely,</v>

3109
01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:27.120
<v Speaker 1>that is wrong.</v>

3110
01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:31.410
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go back and look at her biological profile and we'll share that</v>

3111
01:30:31.411 --> 01:30:31.861
<v Speaker 1>with Texas.</v>

3112
01:30:31.861 --> 01:30:35.790
<v Speaker 1>We'll take a look at these tee readings over the time of the samples that she</v>

3113
01:30:35.791 --> 01:30:36.624
<v Speaker 1>submitted.</v>

3114
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough,</v>

3115
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.020
<v Speaker 1>most of the samples were mildly elevated.</v>

3116
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:41.191
<v Speaker 1>And sure enough,</v>

3117
01:30:41.191 --> 01:30:42.330
<v Speaker 1>you saw to do the right thing.</v>

3118
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:43.950
<v Speaker 1>And they went and did that backup testing.</v>

3119
01:30:43.951 --> 01:30:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And every time they did it she was negative.</v>

3120
01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.690
<v Speaker 1>So they reached out to Texas,</v>

3121
01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:48.991
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

3122
01:30:48.991 --> 01:30:49.141
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3123
01:30:49.141 --> 01:30:50.640
<v Speaker 1>we'll share this information with you.</v>

3124
01:30:50.641 --> 01:30:50.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3125
01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:51.270
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3126
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:52.530
<v Speaker 1>and our historical records,</v>

3127
01:30:52.531 --> 01:30:54.870
<v Speaker 1>his girl does have a naturally occurring,</v>

3128
01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:56.670
<v Speaker 1>mildly elevated t ratio.</v>

3129
01:30:57.330 --> 01:30:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3130
01:30:57.990 --> 01:31:00.690
<v Speaker 1>then went through a several week process of figuring out,</v>

3131
01:31:00.691 --> 01:31:01.290
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3132
01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:03.060
<v Speaker 1>is there some of that sample remaining?</v>

3133
01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Because if there is Texas,</v>

3134
01:31:04.261 --> 01:31:08.460
<v Speaker 1>you have an obligation to go ahead and do this backup testing on it.</v>

3135
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Took them a number of weeks were poor.</v>

3136
01:31:11.401 --> 01:31:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Courtney was in limbo and I'm finally,</v>

3137
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Dana put him on blast,</v>

3138
01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:18.330
<v Speaker 1>basically said Texas commission,</v>

3139
01:31:18.450 --> 01:31:18.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3140
01:31:18.691 --> 01:31:19.530
<v Speaker 1>get your shit together.</v>

3141
01:31:19.531 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 1>We're not coming back there.</v>

3142
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3143
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:25.170
<v Speaker 1>and we got ahold of that remaining sample or be sampled,</v>

3144
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:30.260
<v Speaker 1>had it tested at a lot of laboratory and was negative on the IRM mass that</v>

3145
01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.910
<v Speaker 1>putting someone on blast works.</v>

3146
01:31:36.170 --> 01:31:36.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3147
01:31:36.630 --> 01:31:36.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3148
01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:38.160
<v Speaker 1>it's an ego thing.</v>

3149
01:31:38.190 --> 01:31:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Like people are bitching at you,</v>

3150
01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:41.560
<v Speaker 1>you're going to succumb to that.</v>

3151
01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:42.180
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3152
01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:44.460
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's what it takes to get someone to do the right thing.</v>

3153
01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:45.001
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

3154
01:31:45.001 --> 01:31:45.181
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3155
01:31:45.181 --> 01:31:48.990
<v Speaker 1>so this poor girl is living with the fact that she's labeled as a cheater for</v>

3156
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:49.913
<v Speaker 1>two to three months,</v>

3157
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.330
<v Speaker 1>talked about she's still will be.</v>

3158
01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3159
01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3160
01:31:52.630 --> 01:31:55.140
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things like once someone says you're a steroid cheater,</v>

3161
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.451
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>

3162
01:31:56.451 --> 01:31:57.120
<v Speaker 1>the way she talked to,</v>

3163
01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:57.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean she lived,</v>

3164
01:31:57.710 --> 01:31:58.501
<v Speaker 1>she lives on Maui,</v>

3165
01:31:58.501 --> 01:31:59.500
<v Speaker 1>so small community.</v>

3166
01:31:59.501 --> 01:32:03.640
<v Speaker 1>She talked about going to the store and people pointing at her talking bad about</v>

3167
01:32:03.641 --> 01:32:04.360
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

3168
01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.490
<v Speaker 1>She talked about she,</v>

3169
01:32:05.491 --> 01:32:06.490
<v Speaker 1>she's a coach and a gym.</v>

3170
01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:07.061
<v Speaker 1>They're coaches,</v>

3171
01:32:07.061 --> 01:32:08.170
<v Speaker 1>kids about parents,</v>

3172
01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:08.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3173
01:32:08.351 --> 01:32:11.350
<v Speaker 1>not one her to coach their kids when this was inland labor,</v>

3174
01:32:11.351 --> 01:32:15.160
<v Speaker 1>how many of those people heard that she was exonerated headlines on page one for</v>

3175
01:32:15.161 --> 01:32:16.990
<v Speaker 1>tat retraction on the back page.</v>

3176
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.171
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3177
01:32:17.171 --> 01:32:18.580
<v Speaker 1>And nobody pays attention to that shit.</v>

3178
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:22.510
<v Speaker 1>And you know her performance and she fought Detroit,</v>

3179
01:32:22.511 --> 01:32:23.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3180
01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3181
01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:25.330
<v Speaker 1>It was not a great performance for her.</v>

3182
01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:28.630
<v Speaker 1>And I can't help but wonder if that had affected her,</v>

3183
01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:29.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3184
01:32:29.021 --> 01:32:30.280
<v Speaker 1>over those last couple of months.</v>

3185
01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that was just stylistic.</v>

3186
01:32:32.610 --> 01:32:32.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3187
01:32:32.771 --> 01:32:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I just think the way she matched up with a Felice heric was just,</v>

3188
01:32:36.701 --> 01:32:39.190
<v Speaker 1>those two bulldogs are just clashing heads with each other.</v>

3189
01:32:39.191 --> 01:32:40.300
<v Speaker 1>They just couldn't get anything done.</v>

3190
01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:41.051
<v Speaker 1>Could be.</v>

3191
01:32:41.051 --> 01:32:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

3192
01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.450
<v Speaker 1>but that's again going back to the mental game,</v>

3193
01:32:43.451 --> 01:32:47.890
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous amount of stress to carry with yourself through these last six or</v>

3194
01:32:47.891 --> 01:32:48.490
<v Speaker 1>so months.</v>

3195
01:32:48.490 --> 01:32:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Well I hope she gets past that cause she's a lot of fun.</v>

3196
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.273
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

3197
01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I like her a lot and I got to tell you man,</v>

3198
01:32:53.141 --> 01:32:54.970
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most satisfying things.</v>

3199
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Again going back to the golden snitch thing,</v>

3200
01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:00.520
<v Speaker 1>really my role here is as an advocate,</v>

3201
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:04.060
<v Speaker 1>someone who looks out for athletes and situations like that.</v>

3202
01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:08.050
<v Speaker 1>There's been other things that that we do is look when we put this program</v>

3203
01:33:08.051 --> 01:33:08.884
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

3204
01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:10.090
<v Speaker 1>the Sada program,</v>

3205
01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:10.990
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3206
01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:11.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3207
01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.400
<v Speaker 1>it's unprecedented.</v>

3208
01:33:12.401 --> 01:33:15.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no other professional sport that has the comprehensiveness of the</v>

3209
01:33:15.551 --> 01:33:16.384
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

3210
01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.380
<v Speaker 1>There's also no other professional sport.</v>

3211
01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:23.400
<v Speaker 1>It's quite put together like the UFC is in terms of you have individual athletes</v>

3212
01:33:23.681 --> 01:33:26.350
<v Speaker 1>that you know are competing against each other.</v>

3213
01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:28.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not a team sport worth one person tests positive.</v>

3214
01:33:28.841 --> 01:33:31.000
<v Speaker 1>You have another person you know to step on in.</v>

3215
01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:35.710
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of what I've done over those first couple of years is take a look at,</v>

3216
01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3217
01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:36.251
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3218
01:33:36.251 --> 01:33:36.670
<v Speaker 1>we took,</v>

3219
01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:39.160
<v Speaker 1>we think it was a pretty good shot at the rules to begin with.</v>

3220
01:33:39.161 --> 01:33:41.890
<v Speaker 1>But look and see how those rules played themselves out.</v>

3221
01:33:41.891 --> 01:33:44.680
<v Speaker 1>As time went on and after about a year and a half,</v>

3222
01:33:44.681 --> 01:33:46.270
<v Speaker 1>there were a couple instances where I saw,</v>

3223
01:33:46.271 --> 01:33:46.780
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3224
01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:49.300
<v Speaker 1>this isn't quite fair to an athlete.</v>

3225
01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:50.200
<v Speaker 1>We need to change that.</v>

3226
01:33:50.201 --> 01:33:50.711
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>

3227
01:33:50.711 --> 01:33:51.730
<v Speaker 1>So after a year and a half,</v>

3228
01:33:51.731 --> 01:33:53.290
<v Speaker 1>there was a couple rules that we change.</v>

3229
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.371
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>

3230
01:33:54.371 --> 01:33:55.960
<v Speaker 1>there's kind of a funny story behind this too,</v>

3231
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 1>was on if you remember when Nate fought Conor,</v>

3232
01:33:58.961 --> 01:34:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I think the second time he goes to the press conference after it takes out a</v>

3233
01:34:03.821 --> 01:34:04.610
<v Speaker 1>vape pen.</v>

3234
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:05.443
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

3235
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.250
<v Speaker 1>And someone asked him what he was doing and he said he was with CBD.</v>

3236
01:34:09.850 --> 01:34:12.610
<v Speaker 1>And at the time though,</v>

3237
01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.930
<v Speaker 1>the rule was the in competition period where CBD was prohibited,</v>

3238
01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:20.350
<v Speaker 1>lasted until four hours after the conclusion of the fight.</v>

3239
01:34:20.351 --> 01:34:22.630
<v Speaker 1>And he was clearly within that time period.</v>

3240
01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:25.540
<v Speaker 1>So you saw the contacted me and said,</v>

3241
01:34:25.541 --> 01:34:25.870
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3242
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:26.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3243
01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.270
<v Speaker 1>technically Nate was in violation of this.</v>

3244
01:34:28.271 --> 01:34:29.350
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3245
01:34:29.351 --> 01:34:29.501
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3246
01:34:29.501 --> 01:34:30.334
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3247
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:32.590
<v Speaker 1>this was not the intent of the rule of this is,</v>

3248
01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:32.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3249
01:34:32.861 --> 01:34:35.230
<v Speaker 1>and they never indicated that they were going to sanction him,</v>

3250
01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:36.880
<v Speaker 1>but I made it clear to say,</v>

3251
01:34:36.881 --> 01:34:40.270
<v Speaker 1>explain CBD for anybody that might not know what we're talking about.</v>

3252
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3253
01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.430
<v Speaker 1>So CBD part of the,</v>

3254
01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:42.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3255
01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:45.640
<v Speaker 1>the marijuana plant but is not psychoactive part of it.</v>

3256
01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3257
01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of our fighters anecdotally use it,</v>

3258
01:34:50.110 --> 01:34:50.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3259
01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.350
<v Speaker 1>for anti-inflammatory PR purposes.</v>

3260
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3261
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:55.181
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3262
01:34:55.181 --> 01:34:55.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3263
01:34:55.361 --> 01:34:59.060
<v Speaker 1>have you ever used it or what benefits is a anxiety?</v>

3264
01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:00.210
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3265
01:35:00.210 --> 01:35:02.120
<v Speaker 1>it's great for people that are under stress.</v>

3266
01:35:02.150 --> 01:35:02.451
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3267
01:35:02.451 --> 01:35:02.631
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3268
01:35:02.631 --> 01:35:02.850
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3269
01:35:02.850 --> 01:35:04.970
<v Speaker 1>it actually has a great response for that.</v>

3270
01:35:04.971 --> 01:35:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people that use it just for anxiety.</v>

3271
01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3272
01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.550
<v Speaker 1>but anti-inflammation is,</v>

3273
01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:10.281
<v Speaker 1>is a big one.</v>

3274
01:35:10.281 --> 01:35:10.881
<v Speaker 1>That's the big one.</v>

3275
01:35:10.881 --> 01:35:12.560
<v Speaker 1>People use it for people with arthritis.</v>

3276
01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

3277
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3278
01:35:13.461 --> 01:35:13.761
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3279
01:35:13.761 --> 01:35:14.610
<v Speaker 1>comparing to,</v>

3280
01:35:14.670 --> 01:35:14.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3281
01:35:14.851 --> 01:35:17.810
<v Speaker 1>a natural plant derived product versus a synthetic,</v>

3282
01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:18.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3283
01:35:18.201 --> 01:35:22.760
<v Speaker 1>nonsteroidal antiinflammatory Advils Tylenol's can be toxic on.</v>

3284
01:35:22.770 --> 01:35:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3285
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Probably Common Sense.</v>

3286
01:35:24.411 --> 01:35:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Would would,</v>

3287
01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:26.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3288
01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:28.940
<v Speaker 1>in addition to science would say that the CBD is maybe a little bit healthier</v>

3289
01:35:28.941 --> 01:35:29.774
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

3290
01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3291
01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.450
<v Speaker 1>nevertheless it was prohibited in competition.</v>

3292
01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Is it still?</v>

3293
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.620
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3294
01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:35.060
<v Speaker 1>So that was actually a rule change.</v>

3295
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:36.223
<v Speaker 1>The water,</v>

3296
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:37.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3297
01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:37.731
<v Speaker 1>prohibited list,</v>

3298
01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:38.471
<v Speaker 1>which we follow,</v>

3299
01:35:38.471 --> 01:35:39.710
<v Speaker 1>took it completely off.</v>

3300
01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:40.920
<v Speaker 1>The prohibited list started.</v>

3301
01:35:40.921 --> 01:35:41.330
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3302
01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:42.950
<v Speaker 1>2018 so that's great.</v>

3303
01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:45.640
<v Speaker 1>So we can just take CBD the entire time.</v>

3304
01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:46.250
<v Speaker 1>The training,</v>

3305
01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:46.821
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

3306
01:35:46.821 --> 01:35:48.710
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously there's no performance benefit,</v>

3307
01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:50.390
<v Speaker 1>there's no psychoactive effect.</v>

3308
01:35:50.391 --> 01:35:53.000
<v Speaker 1>It just reduces inflammation and it doesn't have a natural way,</v>

3309
01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:53.961
<v Speaker 1>way healthier.</v>

3310
01:35:53.961 --> 01:35:55.820
<v Speaker 1>And it was the case before they can do it in training.</v>

3311
01:35:55.821 --> 01:35:57.470
<v Speaker 1>It was only prohibited in competition.</v>

3312
01:35:57.471 --> 01:35:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So weigh in day and fight day.</v>

3313
01:35:59.121 --> 01:36:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Now it's completely been taken off the list and it's okay to use it anytime.</v>

3314
01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:03.260
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic.</v>

3315
01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.131
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic.</v>

3316
01:36:04.131 --> 01:36:04.821
<v Speaker 1>So it was good.</v>

3317
01:36:04.821 --> 01:36:05.091
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3318
01:36:05.091 --> 01:36:06.940
<v Speaker 1>but we identified a problem with,</v>

3319
01:36:06.941 --> 01:36:09.590
<v Speaker 1>with the rules in that when Nate finished that,</v>

3320
01:36:09.591 --> 01:36:10.880
<v Speaker 1>that fight with Conor,</v>

3321
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you sought it,</v>

3322
01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.000
<v Speaker 1>came to the post fight medical tent said,</v>

3323
01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Nate,</v>

3324
01:36:14.230 --> 01:36:15.530
<v Speaker 1>we need to make a collection from you.</v>

3325
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:16.910
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know whether it was blood or urine,</v>

3326
01:36:16.911 --> 01:36:18.560
<v Speaker 1>but they got a sample from him.</v>

3327
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:22.130
<v Speaker 1>He then went to the press conference after and it was on,</v>

3328
01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:22.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3329
01:36:22.551 --> 01:36:23.510
<v Speaker 1>took the CVD.</v>

3330
01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:24.950
<v Speaker 1>What I said is,</v>

3331
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.370
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3332
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:26.780
<v Speaker 1>you can't punish him.</v>

3333
01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:29.480
<v Speaker 1>You have the sample that shows what was in his system.</v>

3334
01:36:29.481 --> 01:36:29.711
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3335
01:36:29.711 --> 01:36:31.940
<v Speaker 1>CBD was prohibited in competition,</v>

3336
01:36:31.941 --> 01:36:34.190
<v Speaker 1>but you have a sample to show whether or not he was using it.</v>

3337
01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:35.870
<v Speaker 1>It's clear that you know,</v>

3338
01:36:35.871 --> 01:36:37.160
<v Speaker 1>he was using it after the fight.</v>

3339
01:36:37.161 --> 01:36:41.450
<v Speaker 1>We just put those extra four hours in there with a thought of if a fight or</v>

3340
01:36:41.451 --> 01:36:44.720
<v Speaker 1>finishes a fight and somehow you saw it as not able to get to him,</v>

3341
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:46.580
<v Speaker 1>say gets in the ambulance right away.</v>

3342
01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:47.660
<v Speaker 1>It goes to the hospital.</v>

3343
01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:50.630
<v Speaker 1>You increase that window just in case they can't get them.</v>

3344
01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:51.771
<v Speaker 1>Come to find out.</v>

3345
01:36:51.771 --> 01:36:53.570
<v Speaker 1>As we started putting this program together,</v>

3346
01:36:53.571 --> 01:36:53.920
<v Speaker 1>you saw it.</v>

3347
01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.390
<v Speaker 1>It can always get to that fight or after if they're transported,</v>

3348
01:36:56.391 --> 01:37:00.290
<v Speaker 1>they can hop in the ambulance with them and it wasn't an issue where we needed</v>

3349
01:37:00.291 --> 01:37:01.520
<v Speaker 1>those extra four months.</v>

3350
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:03.080
<v Speaker 1>So we changed that rule.</v>

3351
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:05.120
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm basically,</v>

3352
01:37:05.121 --> 01:37:09.860
<v Speaker 1>the rule is the in competition period ends with a collection immediately after</v>

3353
01:37:09.861 --> 01:37:11.540
<v Speaker 1>the fight or you know,</v>

3354
01:37:11.541 --> 01:37:11.901
<v Speaker 1>you saw it,</v>

3355
01:37:11.901 --> 01:37:14.000
<v Speaker 1>it has a reasonable amount of time after the fight.</v>

3356
01:37:14.410 --> 01:37:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3357
01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.490
<v Speaker 1>so the funny thing is,</v>

3358
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3359
01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:18.890
<v Speaker 1>after we changed this rule,</v>

3360
01:37:19.190 --> 01:37:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Nate and Nick Diaz come to a fight and they're sitting,</v>

3361
01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:23.840
<v Speaker 1>call it the zoo for section,</v>

3362
01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:24.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3363
01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Kinda Dana's section right there behind Dana's table.</v>

3364
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:29.120
<v Speaker 1>So I go over to nick and Nate and I said,</v>

3365
01:37:29.121 --> 01:37:29.481
<v Speaker 1>hey Nate,</v>

3366
01:37:29.481 --> 01:37:29.790
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3367
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:30.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3368
01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:30.471
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3369
01:37:30.471 --> 01:37:31.610
<v Speaker 1>we changed that rule,</v>

3370
01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:32.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3371
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:33.440
<v Speaker 1>the whole CBD thing.</v>

3372
01:37:33.441 --> 01:37:35.210
<v Speaker 1>And actually we kind of refer to it as,</v>

3373
01:37:35.211 --> 01:37:36.440
<v Speaker 1>as the Nate Diaz rule.</v>

3374
01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And when the Diaz brothers ratified,</v>

3375
01:37:39.531 --> 01:37:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's pandemonium and chaos.</v>

3376
01:37:41.361 --> 01:37:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's yelling their name and I literally,</v>

3377
01:37:43.431 --> 01:37:43.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3378
01:37:43.701 --> 01:37:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I have the demon registered with them.</v>

3379
01:37:44.961 --> 01:37:45.710
<v Speaker 1>He didn't look at me,</v>

3380
01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:46.820
<v Speaker 1>he was looking somewhere else.</v>

3381
01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:49.070
<v Speaker 1>So about a month later,</v>

3382
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Nate,</v>

3383
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.421
<v Speaker 1>I see him,</v>

3384
01:37:50.421 --> 01:37:50.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>

3385
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Vegas.</v>

3386
01:37:51.771 --> 01:37:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the kind of walk out 10 hole and here comes Nate.</v>

3387
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:55.020
<v Speaker 1>So he sees me,</v>

3388
01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:55.860
<v Speaker 1>he comes over me,</v>

3389
01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 1>gives</v>

3390
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.390
<v Speaker 2>me kind of the bro Hug,</v>

3391
01:37:57.391 --> 01:37:58.224
<v Speaker 2>what's up,</v>

3392
01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:01.350
<v Speaker 2>he's with Yancey Mendez and so against the,</v>

3393
01:38:01.351 --> 01:38:06.330
<v Speaker 2>and I started talking and Yancy beyond being just an unbelievably entertaining</v>

3394
01:38:06.331 --> 01:38:06.751
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>

3395
01:38:06.751 --> 01:38:08.100
<v Speaker 2>One of the best dudes on the roster.</v>

3396
01:38:08.101 --> 01:38:08.491
<v Speaker 2>Great Guy.</v>

3397
01:38:08.491 --> 01:38:09.510
<v Speaker 2>So I'm talking against,</v>

3398
01:38:09.511 --> 01:38:10.500
<v Speaker 2>he all the sudden Nico's,</v>

3399
01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.390
<v Speaker 2>hey Jeff man,</v>

3400
01:38:12.391 --> 01:38:14.310
<v Speaker 2>tell Yancey about my usada rule.</v>

3401
01:38:15.050 --> 01:38:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I've got a sata rule named after me dog.</v>

3402
01:38:18.570 --> 01:38:19.261
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought,</v>

3403
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:19.501
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3404
01:38:19.501 --> 01:38:23.590
<v Speaker 2>you're doing something right when Nate Diaz is like excited about a change in</v>

3405
01:38:23.591 --> 01:38:24.271
<v Speaker 2>that you sought a rule,</v>

3406
01:38:24.271 --> 01:38:24.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3407
01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:24.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3408
01:38:24.961 --> 01:38:25.480
<v Speaker 2>That is a,</v>

3409
01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.670
<v Speaker 2>that is a very good rule.</v>

3410
01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm really excited about that.</v>

3411
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:28.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3412
01:38:29.010 --> 01:38:30.180
<v Speaker 2>what's the story with neck?</v>

3413
01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:31.290
<v Speaker 2>He can't fight?</v>

3414
01:38:31.410 --> 01:38:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Is he still have like some sort of a,</v>

3415
01:38:32.771 --> 01:38:33.260
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

3416
01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Nicholas will,</v>

3417
01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:37.380
<v Speaker 2>nick was our first fire that ran into the whereabouts issue.</v>

3418
01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:38.970
<v Speaker 2>So he got three whereabouts,</v>

3419
01:38:38.971 --> 01:38:40.950
<v Speaker 2>failures and a rolling 12 months.</v>

3420
01:38:40.951 --> 01:38:43.920
<v Speaker 2>So he's currently going through that process.</v>

3421
01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:44.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3422
01:38:44.490 --> 01:38:46.770
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough one cause I don't want to fight.</v>

3423
01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I think he does.</v>

3424
01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:49.291
<v Speaker 2>I think he does.</v>

3425
01:38:49.291 --> 01:38:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've,</v>

3426
01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.010
<v Speaker 2>and I've sat down with him over the last couple months and talking about trying</v>

3427
01:38:53.011 --> 01:38:54.420
<v Speaker 2>to resolve this whereabouts issue.</v>

3428
01:38:54.421 --> 01:38:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean the unfortunate thing there is look the whereabouts failure sanctions are</v>

3429
01:38:58.921 --> 01:39:01.950
<v Speaker 2>meant to catch people that are cheating and trying to avoid testing.</v>

3430
01:39:01.951 --> 01:39:06.951
<v Speaker 2>And I just think Nick's lifestyle led to those three kind of whereabouts,</v>

3431
01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:09.150
<v Speaker 2>not that he was trying to avoid testing.</v>

3432
01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3433
01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:10.793
<v Speaker 2>nick being nick,</v>

3434
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:11.240
<v Speaker 2>we're trying.</v>

3435
01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3436
01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:12.540
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to work through that.</v>

3437
01:39:12.541 --> 01:39:12.810
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3438
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:13.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3439
01:39:13.111 --> 01:39:13.944
<v Speaker 2>he put,</v>

3440
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:17.700
<v Speaker 2>he trusted certain individuals to do his whereabouts for him.</v>

3441
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3442
01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I think is what happened over time and those individuals would come in and out</v>

3443
01:39:21.301 --> 01:39:22.770
<v Speaker 2>of his life and of course,</v>

3444
01:39:22.771 --> 01:39:25.410
<v Speaker 2>kind of unbeknownst to him that he was missing a lot of these things,</v>

3445
01:39:25.411 --> 01:39:26.011
<v Speaker 2>never less,</v>

3446
01:39:26.011 --> 01:39:26.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3447
01:39:26.281 --> 01:39:26.431
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3448
01:39:26.431 --> 01:39:26.731
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3449
01:39:26.731 --> 01:39:30.540
<v Speaker 2>there's strict liability here and it's currently under sanction,</v>

3450
01:39:30.541 --> 01:39:33.060
<v Speaker 2>but we're hoping to resolve that pretty quick now.</v>

3451
01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3452
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:34.350
<v Speaker 2>last time we,</v>

3453
01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.160
<v Speaker 2>you were on,</v>

3454
01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.630
<v Speaker 2>you talked about this,</v>

3455
01:39:36.631 --> 01:39:41.631
<v Speaker 2>a new potential testosterone that was derived from animals and that there might</v>

3456
01:39:42.601 --> 01:39:46.680
<v Speaker 2>be a way that people could take this stuff and go undetected.</v>

3457
01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:47.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3458
01:39:47.521 --> 01:39:47.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3459
01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard much about that since then.</v>

3460
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3461
01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.240
<v Speaker 2>was it just a theoretical?</v>

3462
01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:53.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3463
01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:54.870
<v Speaker 2>now it's out there.</v>

3464
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:55.550
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>

3465
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3466
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:56.760
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3467
01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:57.241
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3468
01:39:57.241 --> 01:40:01.350
<v Speaker 2>some of the things that to combat that or the biological passport program where</v>

3469
01:40:01.351 --> 01:40:03.300
<v Speaker 2>you're looking over time,</v>

3470
01:40:03.301 --> 01:40:06.660
<v Speaker 2>it's somebody t ratio and even though that,</v>

3471
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:07.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3472
01:40:07.110 --> 01:40:10.710
<v Speaker 2>won't trigger a positive on the isotope ratio mass spectrometry,</v>

3473
01:40:10.711 --> 01:40:13.950
<v Speaker 2>if you see wild variances and t ratios over time,</v>

3474
01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:15.750
<v Speaker 2>that could potentially trigger,</v>

3475
01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.090
<v Speaker 2>would there be a way to more violation,</v>

3476
01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:18.610
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

3477
01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:20.640
<v Speaker 2>There was a way to mitigate that,</v>

3478
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:25.750
<v Speaker 2>a biological passport thing by making a specific time that you inject it every</v>

3479
01:40:27.091 --> 01:40:29.250
<v Speaker 2>day and doing it on a regular basis.</v>

3480
01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:30.083
<v Speaker 2>Like instead of,</v>

3481
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.811
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

3482
01:40:30.811 --> 01:40:31.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3483
01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:32.370
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the ways that,</v>

3484
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:32.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3485
01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:36.150
<v Speaker 2>some fighters have gotten caught is that they knew they were going to be in</v>

3486
01:40:36.151 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Vegas or something for a long period of time.</v>

3487
01:40:37.711 --> 01:40:39.200
<v Speaker 2>So they couldn't take any and they,</v>

3488
01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:40.410
<v Speaker 2>maybe we'd take it twice a week.</v>

3489
01:40:40.411 --> 01:40:44.490
<v Speaker 2>So they doubled their dose and took it in a one shot and then they got hit with</v>

3490
01:40:44.491 --> 01:40:47.400
<v Speaker 2>a random and then it showed that they had this massive,</v>

3491
01:40:47.690 --> 01:40:48.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3492
01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:49.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a potential.</v>

3493
01:40:49.081 --> 01:40:49.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3494
01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:49.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3495
01:40:49.801 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 2>someone who has the resources and sophisticated and somebody has someone who's</v>

3496
01:40:54.191 --> 01:40:55.840
<v Speaker 2>educated in chemistry.</v>

3497
01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3498
01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:57.020
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3499
01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:59.170
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a cat and mouse game anti-doping.</v>

3500
01:40:59.171 --> 01:41:00.010
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3501
01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:00.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3502
01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Vogel talked about that when he was on here.</v>

3503
01:41:02.561 --> 01:41:03.394
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

3504
01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:06.190
<v Speaker 2>the premise of ICARUS initially it was right,</v>

3505
01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:08.950
<v Speaker 2>he was going to show that that anti-doping doesn't work.</v>

3506
01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:11.020
<v Speaker 2>And it was actually something I was,</v>

3507
01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:13.930
<v Speaker 2>I watched your podcast with them and watch the movie as well.</v>

3508
01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:18.130
<v Speaker 2>And initially I was a little bit turned off on that premise cause he gave,</v>

3509
01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:20.230
<v Speaker 2>he gave the examples of Armstrong.</v>

3510
01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Marion Jones just said,</v>

3511
01:41:21.461 --> 01:41:21.641
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3512
01:41:21.641 --> 01:41:25.120
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping just doesn't work and I'm going to go out and prove that that</v>

3513
01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:25.731
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make any sense.</v>

3514
01:41:25.731 --> 01:41:27.400
<v Speaker 2>If both those people got busted that right.</v>

3515
01:41:27.401 --> 01:41:28.121
<v Speaker 2>That's the reality.</v>

3516
01:41:28.121 --> 01:41:29.530
<v Speaker 2>But look how they did.</v>

3517
01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:33.250
<v Speaker 2>They got busted through the investigative element of anti-doping and that's</v>

3518
01:41:33.251 --> 01:41:36.100
<v Speaker 2>what's something that was learned and came out of I think the investigations I</v>

3519
01:41:36.101 --> 01:41:38.440
<v Speaker 2>was involved in and all,</v>

3520
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3521
01:41:38.711 --> 01:41:39.700
<v Speaker 2>you started does this,</v>

3522
01:41:39.701 --> 01:41:40.810
<v Speaker 2>water does this.</v>

3523
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:44.170
<v Speaker 2>The drug testing is not enough.</v>

3524
01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:44.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3525
01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:46.780
<v Speaker 2>drug testing is a necessity.</v>

3526
01:41:46.781 --> 01:41:47.650
<v Speaker 2>You need to have that,</v>

3527
01:41:47.651 --> 01:41:50.620
<v Speaker 2>but you also need to have a strong investigative element.</v>

3528
01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:55.150
<v Speaker 2>You have to liaison and you sought a does this with law enforcement throughout</v>

3529
01:41:55.151 --> 01:41:55.984
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

3530
01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3531
01:41:56.770 --> 01:41:59.980
<v Speaker 2>so that if you can't catch somebody because they're sophisticated in the</v>

3532
01:41:59.981 --> 01:42:01.180
<v Speaker 2>techniques they're using,</v>

3533
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:01.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3534
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:03.280
<v Speaker 2>maybe you catch them through,</v>

3535
01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:03.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3536
01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:06.610
<v Speaker 2>informants or other investigative resources.</v>

3537
01:42:06.690 --> 01:42:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Pressure.</v>

3538
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:08.223
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3539
01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Now that documentary blew my mind.</v>

3540
01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:12.161
<v Speaker 2>It was incredible.</v>

3541
01:42:12.161 --> 01:42:13.570
<v Speaker 2>For people who haven't seen it.</v>

3542
01:42:13.571 --> 01:42:14.470
<v Speaker 2>It's on Netflix,</v>

3543
01:42:14.471 --> 01:42:15.370
<v Speaker 2>it's called ICARUS.</v>

3544
01:42:15.371 --> 01:42:17.560
<v Speaker 2>It's by Bryan Fogel and the documentary.</v>

3545
01:42:17.561 --> 01:42:20.100
<v Speaker 2>The premise was he was a guy who was a,</v>

3546
01:42:20.101 --> 01:42:25.101
<v Speaker 2>a cyclist and decided to compete in a race first clean and then come back and do</v>

3547
01:42:25.421 --> 01:42:30.160
<v Speaker 2>it again under the assistance of a guy who was an expert in anti-doping that</v>

3548
01:42:30.161 --> 01:42:30.701
<v Speaker 2>showed him like,</v>

3549
01:42:30.701 --> 01:42:33.220
<v Speaker 2>what's the stuff that you should take right along the line?</v>

3550
01:42:33.221 --> 01:42:35.170
<v Speaker 2>He makes friends with this Guy Gregory,</v>

3551
01:42:35.190 --> 01:42:36.023
<v Speaker 2>how do you say his last name?</v>

3552
01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3553
01:42:36.190 --> 01:42:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Check off,</v>

3554
01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:37.653
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

3555
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3556
01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:43.560
<v Speaker 2>and during this time period it's discovered that the entire Soviet Olympic team</v>

3557
01:42:46.991 --> 01:42:49.960
<v Speaker 2>is on steroids and that they cheated during the games.</v>

3558
01:42:49.961 --> 01:42:54.961
<v Speaker 2>It's Sochi and he explains how they did it and then the investigation comes down</v>

3559
01:42:55.301 --> 01:42:58.000
<v Speaker 2>and the guy has to flee Russia and then he comes to America.</v>

3560
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.220
<v Speaker 2>He goes into protective custody and Bryan Fogel just,</v>

3561
01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:03.310
<v Speaker 2>you talk about like just stepping in shit.</v>

3562
01:43:03.311 --> 01:43:04.061
<v Speaker 2>Holy smokes.</v>

3563
01:43:04.061 --> 01:43:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Did he come across on many,</v>

3564
01:43:05.141 --> 01:43:09.860
<v Speaker 2>did an awesome job of telling the story and this Gregory God and making him kind</v>

3565
01:43:09.861 --> 01:43:11.410
<v Speaker 2>of the sympathetic character.</v>

3566
01:43:11.411 --> 01:43:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Yet he was the kind of the evil villain that was doing all this over in Russia</v>

3567
01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:15.670
<v Speaker 2>was just incredible.</v>

3568
01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:17.560
<v Speaker 2>A movie.</v>

3569
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:20.170
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that he didn't cover too much in the movie,</v>

3570
01:43:20.171 --> 01:43:23.770
<v Speaker 2>it was a little bit disappointed is who really the true heroes were of that</v>

3571
01:43:23.771 --> 01:43:24.341
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>

3572
01:43:24.341 --> 01:43:29.341
<v Speaker 2>So there was a husband and wife couple the tally and Yuliya Stepanova and um,</v>

3573
01:43:31.630 --> 01:43:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Yulia was an 800 meter runner for Russia and Vitaly actually worked for Rosado.</v>

3574
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:42.750
<v Speaker 2>The Russian anti-doping organization has a drug collecting officer and they were</v>

3575
01:43:43.181 --> 01:43:48.181
<v Speaker 2>the ones basically that caused this German documentary to come out exposing what</v>

3576
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Gregory was doing.</v>

3577
01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 2>And then at that of time the heat came</v>

3578
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:56.030
<v Speaker 1>on Gregory because this information was out there and he was either forced to</v>

3579
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:57.500
<v Speaker 1>stay there and likely be,</v>

3580
01:43:57.820 --> 01:43:58.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3581
01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:00.800
<v Speaker 1>arrested and put the blame on or flee,</v>

3582
01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:01.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3583
01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:04.460
<v Speaker 1>to the u s it was dealt with very briefly in that movie.</v>

3584
01:44:04.461 --> 01:44:07.220
<v Speaker 1>But those two I think were the true heroes because,</v>

3585
01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:07.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3586
01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:10.040
<v Speaker 1>they just did this cause it was the right thing to do.</v>

3587
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3588
01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:11.713
<v Speaker 1>Gregory did it,</v>

3589
01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:11.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3590
01:44:11.961 --> 01:44:15.470
<v Speaker 1>obviously with a lot of self preservation in mind and that he had one of two</v>

3591
01:44:15.471 --> 01:44:16.304
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

3592
01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Either take off and come clean or stay there and face the consequences.</v>

3593
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:21.320
<v Speaker 1>But never less man.</v>

3594
01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Fogel did.</v>

3595
01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I thought an awesome job in that movie.</v>

3596
01:44:23.631 --> 01:44:25.430
<v Speaker 1>And just an incredible,</v>

3597
01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:26.480
<v Speaker 1>incredible story.</v>

3598
01:44:26.481 --> 01:44:26.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

3599
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:27.783
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

3600
01:44:28.190 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3601
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:29.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3602
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:29.721
<v Speaker 1>tough,</v>

3603
01:44:29.721 --> 01:44:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure for Olympic athletes to say,</v>

3604
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:32.091
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3605
01:44:32.091 --> 01:44:32.271
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3606
01:44:32.271 --> 01:44:32.770
<v Speaker 1>this is what,</v>

3607
01:44:32.770 --> 01:44:36.500
<v Speaker 1>what we're up against when you're talking about state sponsored doping and the</v>

3608
01:44:36.501 --> 01:44:38.240
<v Speaker 1>KGB being involved.</v>

3609
01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:41.420
<v Speaker 1>And there's almost a sense of hopelessness out there that,</v>

3610
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:41.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3611
01:44:41.721 --> 01:44:44.120
<v Speaker 1>how am I ever know that I'm as a clean athlete,</v>

3612
01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:44.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3613
01:44:44.451 --> 01:44:45.920
<v Speaker 1>my rights are going to be protected.</v>

3614
01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:46.821
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3615
01:44:46.821 --> 01:44:49.010
<v Speaker 1>going back to what we're doing with the UFC,</v>

3616
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:51.070
<v Speaker 1>the beauty of what we're doing is you,</v>

3617
01:44:51.130 --> 01:44:54.500
<v Speaker 1>you can never see that because you have an independent authority.</v>

3618
01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:58.790
<v Speaker 1>You sorta who's operating and administering our program.</v>

3619
01:44:59.180 --> 01:44:59.691
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3620
01:44:59.691 --> 01:45:03.680
<v Speaker 1>so unlike the Russian government where they have interest of Russian athletes,</v>

3621
01:45:03.681 --> 01:45:04.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3622
01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 1>doing well and winning gold medals,</v>

3623
01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:07.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3624
01:45:07.191 --> 01:45:07.641
<v Speaker 1>you saw it.</v>

3625
01:45:07.641 --> 01:45:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

3626
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3627
01:45:08.331 --> 01:45:08.811
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>

3628
01:45:08.811 --> 01:45:09.860
<v Speaker 1>give a crap about,</v>

3629
01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:10.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3630
01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:11.054
<v Speaker 1>who's being,</v>

3631
01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:12.760
<v Speaker 1>who's being caught and isn't.</v>

3632
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:14.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3633
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:17.750
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that came up in the film that was really disturbing was the</v>

3634
01:45:17.751 --> 01:45:22.280
<v Speaker 1>collusion between water and the IOC and that they really,</v>

3635
01:45:22.281 --> 01:45:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it was in their best interest to not sanction Russia.</v>

3636
01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3637
01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:25.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a con.</v>

3638
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:26.600
<v Speaker 1>You have people sitting,</v>

3639
01:45:26.630 --> 01:45:27.680
<v Speaker 1>you still do on the,</v>

3640
01:45:27.681 --> 01:45:29.960
<v Speaker 1>on the water board and on the IOC board.</v>

3641
01:45:29.961 --> 01:45:30.531
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

3642
01:45:30.531 --> 01:45:33.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a conflict of interest is wada is going to come in and say,</v>

3643
01:45:33.231 --> 01:45:36.350
<v Speaker 1>hey this was clearly state sponsored doping.</v>

3644
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:39.380
<v Speaker 1>We're going to exclude Russia from the Olympics for the next,</v>

3645
01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3646
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:41.660
<v Speaker 1>however many years.</v>

3647
01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a hit to the IOC cause IOC is getting money from these television</v>

3648
01:45:45.831 --> 01:45:49.880
<v Speaker 1>networks putting on the Games in Seoul or in Tokyo coming up.</v>

3649
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:51.021
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3650
01:45:51.021 --> 01:45:52.280
<v Speaker 1>a conflict of interest there.</v>

3651
01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:54.410
<v Speaker 1>You saw it as a nonprofit organization.</v>

3652
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:55.430
<v Speaker 1>So the UFC,</v>

3653
01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:58.460
<v Speaker 1>the UFC does pay them to administer our program,</v>

3654
01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:00.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's not lining the pockets of anybody.</v>

3655
01:46:00.861 --> 01:46:03.680
<v Speaker 1>They're CEOs not making more money because of the UFC is here.</v>

3656
01:46:03.681 --> 01:46:06.620
<v Speaker 1>They maybe have a few more personnel to administer the program,</v>

3657
01:46:06.621 --> 01:46:07.760
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3658
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:08.270
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

3659
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:09.410
<v Speaker 1>if we go away,</v>

3660
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:10.920
<v Speaker 1>you saw is still in existence.</v>

3661
01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:13.040
<v Speaker 1>They're still doing Olympic testing and you know,</v>

3662
01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:14.690
<v Speaker 1>nobody's pocket books are hurting.</v>

3663
01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:15.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3664
01:46:15.201 --> 01:46:17.780
<v Speaker 1>That independence I think is critical.</v>

3665
01:46:17.781 --> 01:46:19.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that you brought up earlier.</v>

3666
01:46:19.101 --> 01:46:20.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that's so awesome.</v>

3667
01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:22.580
<v Speaker 1>And you know what a massive credit to the UFC,</v>

3668
01:46:22.581 --> 01:46:25.550
<v Speaker 1>they decided to do it this way and not do it in house.</v>

3669
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Just take on your protocol out of courage to do that.</v>

3670
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:31.370
<v Speaker 1>And it takes a real commitment to try to clean up the sport.</v>

3671
01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:31.941
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3672
01:46:31.941 --> 01:46:36.380
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that was really weird was like they banned some,</v>

3673
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:39.110
<v Speaker 1>some teams from Russia,</v>

3674
01:46:39.210 --> 01:46:42.530
<v Speaker 1>like not all the sports but the sports they band where like nobody gives a fuck</v>

3675
01:46:42.531 --> 01:46:42.900
<v Speaker 1>about what,</v>

3676
01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:43.940
<v Speaker 1>what the sports wear.</v>

3677
01:46:44.110 --> 01:46:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3678
01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Well I think in reality you could find out what,</v>

3679
01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:47.750
<v Speaker 1>what they banned,</v>

3680
01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:49.710
<v Speaker 1>they were going to ban the team,</v>

3681
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.170
<v Speaker 2>but the outrage from that was just so strong.</v>

3682
01:46:52.171 --> 01:46:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And then they realize the economic impact of that would be literally in the</v>

3683
01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:56.850
<v Speaker 2>billions of dollars.</v>

3684
01:46:56.850 --> 01:46:59.070
<v Speaker 2>But think they abandoned track and field team from,</v>

3685
01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:00.090
<v Speaker 2>from Rio Games,</v>

3686
01:47:00.091 --> 01:47:03.180
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty significant track and field being a pretty big Olympic sport.</v>

3687
01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:04.270
<v Speaker 2>There was a new hair,</v>

3688
01:47:04.290 --> 01:47:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Russia banned from Winter Olympics,</v>

3689
01:47:05.941 --> 01:47:07.830
<v Speaker 2>but clean athletes can compete.</v>

3690
01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:08.664
<v Speaker 2>So this is new,</v>

3691
01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:09.533
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3692
01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Russia athletes make that a little bigger for my fucking shitty eyes.</v>

3693
01:47:14.190 --> 01:47:18.180
<v Speaker 2>It Russia has been banned from the 2018 winter Olympics in South Korea over the</v>

3694
01:47:18.181 --> 01:47:18.481
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

3695
01:47:18.481 --> 01:47:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Systematic manipulation of anti-doping rules.</v>

3696
01:47:20.641 --> 01:47:21.360
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

3697
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Russian athletes who can prove,</v>

3698
01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:24.210
<v Speaker 2>prove that they are clean,</v>

3699
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:29.390
<v Speaker 2>we'll be invited in in quotes to compete in say that Pyong Chang Look at Jamie</v>

3700
01:47:31.201 --> 01:47:32.640
<v Speaker 2>was degree in Korean.</v>

3701
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3702
01:47:33.370 --> 01:47:36.360
<v Speaker 2>the International Olympic Committee said Tuesday,</v>

3703
01:47:36.361 --> 01:47:37.141
<v Speaker 2>so that's fascinating.</v>

3704
01:47:37.141 --> 01:47:37.650
<v Speaker 2>So they'll,</v>

3705
01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:41.550
<v Speaker 2>they'll be literally competing under the Olympic flag,</v>

3706
01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.450
<v Speaker 2>which is like woo.</v>

3707
01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:48.140
<v Speaker 2>It's the most wide ranging punishment ever met it out by the IOC in a party on a</v>

3708
01:47:48.421 --> 01:47:49.470
<v Speaker 2>participating nation,</v>

3709
01:47:49.471 --> 01:47:51.840
<v Speaker 2>let alone a powerhouse of the Olympic movement.</v>

3710
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3711
01:47:52.451 --> 01:47:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3712
01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.070
<v Speaker 1>you're competing on the Olympic flag,</v>

3713
01:47:54.071 --> 01:47:57.440
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's still gonna know the commentators are going still gonna say the</v>

3714
01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Russian athletes competing on the Olympic flag.</v>

3715
01:47:59.690 --> 01:48:00.431
<v Speaker 2>That's bizarre.</v>

3716
01:48:00.431 --> 01:48:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3717
01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:01.301
<v Speaker 2>Competing,</v>

3718
01:48:01.301 --> 01:48:01.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3719
01:48:01.571 --> 01:48:02.860
<v Speaker 2>is this unprecedented?</v>

3720
01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Someone competing under the Olympic flag?</v>

3721
01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure whether it's happened before.</v>

3722
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Not Man.</v>

3723
01:48:08.770 --> 01:48:09.131
<v Speaker 2>How's it?</v>

3724
01:48:09.131 --> 01:48:11.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I remember just random people.</v>

3725
01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:11.351
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3726
01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:14.350
<v Speaker 2>they might not have had to country to perform or their whole country might not</v>

3727
01:48:14.351 --> 01:48:14.801
<v Speaker 2>have sent them,</v>

3728
01:48:14.801 --> 01:48:16.310
<v Speaker 2>but they would qualify or something.</v>

3729
01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:17.553
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3730
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3731
01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

3732
01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3733
01:48:18.970 --> 01:48:22.240
<v Speaker 2>but there was also a certain teams that were,</v>

3734
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:23.410
<v Speaker 2>were kicked out of,</v>

3735
01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:26.530
<v Speaker 2>or certain gold metals that were a rescinded,</v>

3736
01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:29.260
<v Speaker 2>but that was the other thing that I thought was really interesting about you saw</v>

3737
01:48:29.261 --> 01:48:29.620
<v Speaker 2>it as,</v>

3738
01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:30.453
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3739
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:34.030
<v Speaker 2>protocol is that they freeze samples.</v>

3740
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:37.420
<v Speaker 2>So just in case the testing improves in the future,</v>

3741
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:39.260
<v Speaker 1>he used to turn again,</v>

3742
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.100
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3743
01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:40.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3744
01:48:40.311 --> 01:48:42.980
<v Speaker 1>there's no denying it's a cat and mouse game going on out there,</v>

3745
01:48:42.981 --> 01:48:45.320
<v Speaker 1>but a deterrent is that it's not all of them,</v>

3746
01:48:45.321 --> 01:48:47.900
<v Speaker 1>but certain samples can be frozen up to 10 years.</v>

3747
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:50.120
<v Speaker 1>And as new tests come online,</v>

3748
01:48:50.121 --> 01:48:52.370
<v Speaker 1>like the longterm metabolite tests that,</v>

3749
01:48:52.371 --> 01:48:52.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3750
01:48:52.730 --> 01:48:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Gregory developed after five or six years,</v>

3751
01:48:55.461 --> 01:48:57.830
<v Speaker 1>they may go back and retest those samples.</v>

3752
01:48:57.831 --> 01:48:58.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3753
01:48:58.851 --> 01:49:00.350
<v Speaker 1>when we go out and educate our athletes,</v>

3754
01:49:00.351 --> 01:49:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I tell them,</v>

3755
01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:01.490
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3756
01:49:01.490 --> 01:49:02.960
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not in the UFC anymore,</v>

3757
01:49:02.961 --> 01:49:05.270
<v Speaker 1>but your legacies around forever and you know,</v>

3758
01:49:05.271 --> 01:49:07.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a smear to your legacy forever.</v>

3759
01:49:07.041 --> 01:49:09.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's all about creating that.</v>

3760
01:49:09.171 --> 01:49:10.004
<v Speaker 1>My job,</v>

3761
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I worked for the UFC,</v>

3762
01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:13.040
<v Speaker 1>my job is not,</v>

3763
01:49:13.041 --> 01:49:13.191
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3764
01:49:13.191 --> 01:49:14.690
<v Speaker 1>let's see how many athletes we can catch.</v>

3765
01:49:14.691 --> 01:49:17.120
<v Speaker 1>My job is to try to get out there,</v>

3766
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.961
<v Speaker 1>educate,</v>

3767
01:49:17.961 --> 01:49:19.310
<v Speaker 1>develop relationships,</v>

3768
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:21.020
<v Speaker 1>and create that deterrent saying,</v>

3769
01:49:21.021 --> 01:49:21.321
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3770
01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:22.490
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do this.</v>

3771
01:49:22.491 --> 01:49:24.230
<v Speaker 1>It's going to catch you eventually.</v>

3772
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:25.850
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do something,</v>

3773
01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:29.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you every resource and bit of knowledge.</v>

3774
01:49:29.301 --> 01:49:31.820
<v Speaker 1>I have to make sure you're successful under the program.</v>

3775
01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:32.811
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3776
01:49:32.811 --> 01:49:36.380
<v Speaker 1>success in my eyes is very few positive tests.</v>

3777
01:49:36.381 --> 01:49:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3778
01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:37.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3779
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:38.001
<v Speaker 1>right on the Kuwait,</v>

3780
01:49:38.001 --> 01:49:40.580
<v Speaker 1>the program with success because we've had,</v>

3781
01:49:40.581 --> 01:49:40.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3782
01:49:40.851 --> 01:49:42.680
<v Speaker 1>60 or so positives over time.</v>

3783
01:49:42.681 --> 01:49:43.514
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see,</v>

3784
01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:44.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3785
01:49:44.121 --> 01:49:45.680
<v Speaker 1>none and see more of that.</v>

3786
01:49:45.681 --> 01:49:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Those graph showing those,</v>

3787
01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:47.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3788
01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 1>common</v>

3789
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:48.971
<v Speaker 2>markers of a,</v>

3790
01:49:48.971 --> 01:49:50.860
<v Speaker 2>of a doper come more into line.</v>

3791
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:51.131
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3792
01:49:51.131 --> 01:49:54.400
<v Speaker 2>You're not in the position of a detective or a prosecutor anymore.</v>

3793
01:49:54.401 --> 01:49:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Your position is now an athlete liaison.</v>

3794
01:49:57.010 --> 01:49:57.431
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

3795
01:49:57.431 --> 01:49:57.721
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

3796
01:49:57.721 --> 01:49:58.660
<v Speaker 2>it's a much different role.</v>

3797
01:49:58.661 --> 01:49:59.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a role I'd really,</v>

3798
01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:00.573
<v Speaker 2>I'd really enjoy.</v>

3799
01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a lot less stressful.</v>

3800
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Definitely a lot stressful,</v>

3801
01:50:02.831 --> 01:50:03.790
<v Speaker 2>a lot less stressful.</v>

3802
01:50:03.791 --> 01:50:04.301
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3803
01:50:04.301 --> 01:50:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Dana says it all the time,</v>

3804
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:09.790
<v Speaker 2>the importance level in the UFC and MMA is off the charts.</v>

3805
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3806
01:50:10.690 --> 01:50:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3807
01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:14.700
<v Speaker 2>I still have a strong belief in ethics and sports and beliefs.</v>

3808
01:50:14.701 --> 01:50:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Sports are so good for kids and teaching them life lessons.</v>

3809
01:50:18.131 --> 01:50:19.210
<v Speaker 2>It transcends sports.</v>

3810
01:50:19.211 --> 01:50:19.511
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

3811
01:50:19.511 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I have three daughters that,</v>

3812
01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:21.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3813
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:23.020
<v Speaker 2>played sports growing up.</v>

3814
01:50:23.050 --> 01:50:24.190
<v Speaker 2>A couple of them still do.</v>

3815
01:50:24.191 --> 01:50:27.760
<v Speaker 2>And I know when they get out into the real world and that work environment,</v>

3816
01:50:28.150 --> 01:50:28.691
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing,</v>

3817
01:50:28.691 --> 01:50:30.400
<v Speaker 2>they can't handle it because they've already handled it.</v>

3818
01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.233
<v Speaker 2>And Sports,</v>

3819
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:33.310
<v Speaker 2>they've run up against a coach who's an asshole.</v>

3820
01:50:33.311 --> 01:50:35.410
<v Speaker 2>They'd run up against teammates that are selfish.</v>

3821
01:50:35.411 --> 01:50:36.640
<v Speaker 2>They've had great,</v>

3822
01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:37.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3823
01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:39.640
<v Speaker 2>occurrences when they've worked well as a team.</v>

3824
01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:43.060
<v Speaker 2>All of that is going to come into play to help them in their lives.</v>

3825
01:50:43.061 --> 01:50:45.130
<v Speaker 2>And when you introduce something and something,</v>

3826
01:50:45.131 --> 01:50:48.430
<v Speaker 2>it's so pure and good that's breaking the rules.</v>

3827
01:50:48.850 --> 01:50:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3828
01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 2>that short term mostly longterm is not healthy for your sports,</v>

3829
01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:55.690
<v Speaker 2>is about to be healthy for you.</v>

3830
01:50:55.691 --> 01:50:56.590
<v Speaker 2>And at some level,</v>

3831
01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:59.380
<v Speaker 2>especially the way these performance enhancing drugs are used,</v>

3832
01:50:59.381 --> 01:51:01.060
<v Speaker 2>they're not really being used in a healthy,</v>

3833
01:51:01.450 --> 01:51:02.201
<v Speaker 2>healthy manner.</v>

3834
01:51:02.201 --> 01:51:02.740
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3835
01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:03.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3836
01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:04.001
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

3837
01:51:04.001 --> 01:51:04.481
<v Speaker 2>but I feel,</v>

3838
01:51:04.481 --> 01:51:07.180
<v Speaker 2>I feel very strongly and very positive about what we're doing and the role that</v>

3839
01:51:07.181 --> 01:51:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm playing here.</v>

3840
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:08.051
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3841
01:51:08.051 --> 01:51:09.460
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting that the UFC,</v>

3842
01:51:09.461 --> 01:51:10.660
<v Speaker 2>unlike a lot of sports,</v>

3843
01:51:10.690 --> 01:51:10.981
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3844
01:51:10.981 --> 01:51:14.980
<v Speaker 2>the history is pretty transparent and the history of doping is also</v>

3845
01:51:14.981 --> 01:51:15.730
<v Speaker 2>pretransplant.</v>

3846
01:51:15.730 --> 01:51:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody's really aware of what the wild west days where like,</v>

3847
01:51:20.530 --> 01:51:20.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3848
01:51:20.891 --> 01:51:21.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3849
01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:22.300
<v Speaker 2>people talk about it,</v>

3850
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:23.200
<v Speaker 2>they laugh about it.</v>

3851
01:51:23.201 --> 01:51:23.680
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3852
01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.370
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of an,</v>

3853
01:51:24.370 --> 01:51:27.910
<v Speaker 2>it's not a secret at all in particular as we were saying about pride.</v>

3854
01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3855
01:51:28.590 --> 01:51:29.740
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3856
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that ultimately what sports should be about,</v>

3857
01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:35.200
<v Speaker 2>it should be about effort,</v>

3858
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:36.303
<v Speaker 2>skill,</v>

3859
01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:37.390
<v Speaker 2>determination,</v>

3860
01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:38.170
<v Speaker 2>focus,</v>

3861
01:51:38.170 --> 01:51:39.003
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

3862
01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:40.750
<v Speaker 2>And those are the lessons that you could pass on.</v>

3863
01:51:40.751 --> 01:51:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Not who has the best pharmacist,</v>

3864
01:51:42.221 --> 01:51:42.820
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3865
01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:43.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3866
01:51:43.031 --> 01:51:46.570
<v Speaker 2>not who has the best team of scientists that can hide the results better.</v>

3867
01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the more disturbing things about it.</v>

3868
01:51:49.841 --> 01:51:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Gris or,</v>

3869
01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:51.071
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

3870
01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:53.980
<v Speaker 2>or any of these other things that have shown that,</v>

3871
01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:54.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3872
01:51:54.850 --> 01:51:59.620
<v Speaker 2>there's systematic anti-doping or are doping or state sponsored doping.</v>

3873
01:51:59.910 --> 01:52:00.743
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3874
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:02.440
<v Speaker 2>it distorts the whole thing.</v>

3875
01:52:02.441 --> 01:52:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Like what a victory is or why you've got some athletes,</v>

3876
01:52:05.711 --> 01:52:08.350
<v Speaker 2>it probably would have won anyway if everybody was clean.</v>

3877
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:11.620
<v Speaker 2>They might've been the best athlete anyway and then they could have one.</v>

3878
01:52:11.650 --> 01:52:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Floyd Landis told me,</v>

3879
01:52:12.730 --> 01:52:14.350
<v Speaker 2>told me that all the time about lance,</v>

3880
01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:19.440
<v Speaker 2>he said that dude was the baddest ass bicycle rider ever and take away all the</v>

3881
01:52:19.721 --> 01:52:21.130
<v Speaker 2>drugs that were taken in the sport.</v>

3882
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:23.560
<v Speaker 2>He would have been the best writer ever.</v>

3883
01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:24.760
<v Speaker 2>He had something going on there,</v>

3884
01:52:24.761 --> 01:52:27.610
<v Speaker 2>but the reality was everybody was using something men.</v>

3885
01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:29.170
<v Speaker 2>That's how fucked up sport.</v>

3886
01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3887
01:52:29.770 --> 01:52:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I think I talked about this last time,</v>

3888
01:52:30.941 --> 01:52:31.774
<v Speaker 2>but I really,</v>

3889
01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:32.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3890
01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:33.340
<v Speaker 2>people are surprised to hear this,</v>

3891
01:52:33.341 --> 01:52:37.840
<v Speaker 2>but I had a lot of compassion and understanding for a lot of these dopers after</v>

3892
01:52:37.841 --> 01:52:38.980
<v Speaker 2>they told me their stories.</v>

3893
01:52:38.981 --> 01:52:39.814
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3894
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.020
<v Speaker 2>you're a young kid,</v>

3895
01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:42.910
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable kid that you know,</v>

3896
01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:43.960
<v Speaker 2>wasn't really worldly,</v>

3897
01:52:43.961 --> 01:52:45.920
<v Speaker 2>that all your teenage life,</v>

3898
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

3899
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:50.750
<v Speaker 1>aspire to go over to Europe and get on a bike and compete and he's awesome races</v>

3900
01:52:50.751 --> 01:52:52.130
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden you're over there,</v>

3901
01:52:52.131 --> 01:52:53.330
<v Speaker 1>dropped off in a coach,</v>

3902
01:52:53.630 --> 01:52:55.670
<v Speaker 1>sitting in a room says you want to stay here a kid.</v>

3903
01:52:55.671 --> 01:52:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Here's the program that were on Meth.</v>

3904
01:52:57.980 --> 01:52:58.491
<v Speaker 1>I heard one,</v>

3905
01:52:58.491 --> 01:52:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I heard a dozen of those stories,</v>

3906
01:52:59.811 --> 01:53:00.890
<v Speaker 1>grown men crying,</v>

3907
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:02.240
<v Speaker 1>retelling those stories.</v>

3908
01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:03.613
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3909
01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:04.520
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

3910
01:53:04.521 --> 01:53:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean I feel good about,</v>

3911
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:06.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3912
01:53:06.150 --> 01:53:08.810
<v Speaker 1>change in the culture in this sport radically.</v>

3913
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I would love to have a podcast with you and lance sit down together and discuss</v>

3914
01:53:12.621 --> 01:53:15.050
<v Speaker 1>this now that the dust has kind of settled and you know,</v>

3915
01:53:15.051 --> 01:53:19.220
<v Speaker 1>he's been pretty open about it and transparent about the whole process himself.</v>

3916
01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:19.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3917
01:53:19.491 --> 01:53:19.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3918
01:53:19.731 --> 01:53:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I think the difference,</v>

3919
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:24.560
<v Speaker 1>the difference that that he has with everybody else is,</v>

3920
01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:24.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3921
01:53:24.861 --> 01:53:25.161
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3922
01:53:25.161 --> 01:53:29.600
<v Speaker 1>this is back to [inaudible] contention that they didn't catch lance is you look</v>

3923
01:53:29.601 --> 01:53:31.940
<v Speaker 1>back at his history and they did actually,</v>

3924
01:53:31.941 --> 01:53:32.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3925
01:53:32.181 --> 01:53:36.920
<v Speaker 1>in 99 I think he had a corticosteroid positive in 2001.</v>

3926
01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I think he had a test that showed,</v>

3927
01:53:39.690 --> 01:53:40.311
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3928
01:53:40.311 --> 01:53:42.920
<v Speaker 1>high likelihood of EPL use that wasn't followed on.</v>

3929
01:53:42.921 --> 01:53:47.921
<v Speaker 1>But what he did is he became very powerful in the sport and the International</v>

3930
01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Cycling Union was,</v>

3931
01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:54.170
<v Speaker 1>was corrupt and basically use that power and wield it and they cover it up.</v>

3932
01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3933
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:56.540
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those tests</v>

3934
01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:58.910
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

3935
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:59.631
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy.</v>

3936
01:53:59.631 --> 01:54:00.464
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

3937
01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:05.710
<v Speaker 1>and the crazy thing about combat sports is that we're not just talking about</v>

3938
01:54:06.441 --> 01:54:07.760
<v Speaker 1>crossing a finish line quicker.</v>

3939
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:10.550
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the ability to deliver more damage on your opponent.</v>

3940
01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:13.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's so critical that people fight clean,</v>

3941
01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:14.293
<v Speaker 1>whole new level.</v>

3942
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:15.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely different thing.</v>

3943
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:16.461
<v Speaker 1>There's just really,</v>

3944
01:54:16.461 --> 01:54:17.390
<v Speaker 1>there's no comparison.</v>

3945
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Now let's get into,</v>

3946
01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:23.120
<v Speaker 1>we briefly touched on weight cutting.</v>

3947
01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3948
01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:26.740
<v Speaker 1>but I know that the UFC has recognized that there's,</v>

3949
01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:28.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a real issue and,</v>

3950
01:54:28.311 --> 01:54:28.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3951
01:54:28.730 --> 01:54:32.690
<v Speaker 1>what steps have we taken to try to mitigate the problems that are caused by</v>

3952
01:54:32.691 --> 01:54:33.500
<v Speaker 1>weight cutting?</v>

3953
01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3954
01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:34.810
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

3955
01:54:34.810 --> 01:54:38.330
<v Speaker 1>And another one of the reasons why I love the performance institute and the</v>

3956
01:54:38.331 --> 01:54:40.670
<v Speaker 1>staff that we had there and that before them.</v>

3957
01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:45.140
<v Speaker 1>And it really stemmed from the Usada program where under the Wada Code you</v>

3958
01:54:45.141 --> 01:54:46.460
<v Speaker 1>banned the use of Ivs.</v>

3959
01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:47.421
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

3960
01:54:47.421 --> 01:54:51.690
<v Speaker 1>cause I was kind of the point person obviously explained why ivy's or you know,</v>

3961
01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:52.541
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to the,</v>

3962
01:54:52.541 --> 01:54:53.331
<v Speaker 1>to the cyclist,</v>

3963
01:54:53.331 --> 01:54:58.331
<v Speaker 1>they were using ivs to basically flush their system of drugs to manipulate their</v>

3964
01:54:58.521 --> 01:55:00.260
<v Speaker 1>bicycle biological passport.</v>

3965
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:03.670
<v Speaker 1>So if their blood doping or using EPO and um,</v>

3966
01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:06.590
<v Speaker 1>it would have a tendency to lower those and,</v>

3967
01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:09.260
<v Speaker 1>and normalize those biological passport levels.</v>

3968
01:55:09.650 --> 01:55:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of learn that through some of the investigations that,</v>

3969
01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:13.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3970
01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:16.180
<v Speaker 1>they were conducted and determined that ivy use,</v>

3971
01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:16.551
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3972
01:55:16.551 --> 01:55:19.370
<v Speaker 1>in excess of 50 milliliters,</v>

3973
01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:21.140
<v Speaker 1>every six hours would be prohibited.</v>

3974
01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:24.860
<v Speaker 1>So when we announced that we were adopting the water prohibited list and</v>

3975
01:55:24.861 --> 01:55:25.970
<v Speaker 1>prohibited methods,</v>

3976
01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:27.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3977
01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:27.890
<v Speaker 1>there was some,</v>

3978
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:30.560
<v Speaker 1>some blow back within the UFC community saying,</v>

3979
01:55:30.561 --> 01:55:31.280
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3980
01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:34.790
<v Speaker 1>these things are used regularly because fighters are pushing themselves to the</v>

3981
01:55:34.791 --> 01:55:37.910
<v Speaker 1>edge to make weight and do you understand what you're doing here?</v>

3982
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:40.610
<v Speaker 1>You're going to put fighters and unsafe positions where they're going to get in</v>

3983
01:55:40.611 --> 01:55:41.444
<v Speaker 1>and not be,</v>

3984
01:55:41.530 --> 01:55:42.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3985
01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:42.853
<v Speaker 1>rehydrated.</v>

3986
01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:46.410
<v Speaker 1>So we took a look at that and spoke with you,</v>

3987
01:55:46.411 --> 01:55:46.831
<v Speaker 1>saw it,</v>

3988
01:55:46.831 --> 01:55:47.370
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

3989
01:55:47.370 --> 01:55:47.730
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3990
01:55:47.730 --> 01:55:48.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3991
01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:48.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should,</v>

3992
01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:49.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3993
01:55:49.471 --> 01:55:51.430
<v Speaker 1>slowly rolled out the ivy band.</v>

3994
01:55:51.431 --> 01:55:53.460
<v Speaker 1>So we actually delayed that by three months.</v>

3995
01:55:53.461 --> 01:55:58.140
<v Speaker 1>The program went into effect July 1st and we instituted the IB band,</v>

3996
01:55:58.290 --> 01:55:58.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3997
01:55:58.890 --> 01:55:59.730
<v Speaker 1>October 1st.</v>

3998
01:55:59.731 --> 01:56:03.180
<v Speaker 1>So we had three months of getting fighters prepared for it,</v>

3999
01:56:03.210 --> 01:56:04.470
<v Speaker 1>educating them why,</v>

4000
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:05.191
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4001
01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:06.024
<v Speaker 1>that they were banned.</v>

4002
01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

4003
01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:08.213
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4004
01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:12.300
<v Speaker 1>real quickly the whole weight cutting issue came kind of into my plate.</v>

4005
01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And while,</v>

4006
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:13.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4007
01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't an expert in it,</v>

4008
01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I had to get out and talk to a lot of fighters,</v>

4009
01:56:17.101 --> 01:56:17.491
<v Speaker 1>camps,</v>

4010
01:56:17.491 --> 01:56:20.190
<v Speaker 1>coaches about ivs and give them,</v>

4011
01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:20.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4012
01:56:20.431 --> 01:56:23.130
<v Speaker 1>alternatives to rehydrating the right way.</v>

4013
01:56:23.131 --> 01:56:24.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

4014
01:56:24.781 --> 01:56:25.201
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4015
01:56:25.201 --> 01:56:26.370
<v Speaker 1>not being an expert myself,</v>

4016
01:56:26.371 --> 01:56:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I reached out to what I found were we're experts in the world.</v>

4017
01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:34.230
<v Speaker 1>A certain guy by name of Doctor Robert [inaudible] who is a phd exercise</v>

4018
01:56:34.231 --> 01:56:35.160
<v Speaker 1>physiologist,</v>

4019
01:56:35.610 --> 01:56:40.380
<v Speaker 1>works with the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine Studies,</v>

4020
01:56:40.381 --> 01:56:42.360
<v Speaker 1>environmental effects on soldiers,</v>

4021
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:44.580
<v Speaker 1>his expertise being dehydration.</v>

4022
01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:48.240
<v Speaker 1>So soldiers in the Middle East that are marching for hours,</v>

4023
01:56:48.241 --> 01:56:50.640
<v Speaker 1>days upon a time run out of water,</v>

4024
01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:52.380
<v Speaker 1>dehydrate themselves.</v>

4025
01:56:52.381 --> 01:56:54.060
<v Speaker 1>How do we get these fighters back?</v>

4026
01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Are these soldiers back rehydrated and back into the fight and thought,</v>

4027
01:56:57.871 --> 01:56:58.021
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4028
01:56:58.021 --> 01:57:00.120
<v Speaker 1>this is the type of expert that we need to talk to.</v>

4029
01:57:00.121 --> 01:57:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Its extreme dehydration.</v>

4030
01:57:01.591 --> 01:57:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

4031
01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:02.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4032
01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:04.050
<v Speaker 1>some kid that has diarrhea,</v>

4033
01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:05.750
<v Speaker 1>it's mildly dehydrated with some,</v>

4034
01:57:05.751 --> 01:57:06.584
<v Speaker 1>some pedialyte.</v>

4035
01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:08.430
<v Speaker 1>So we brought him in.</v>

4036
01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4037
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:11.850
<v Speaker 1>had him actually the week of UFC 200,</v>

4038
01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:12.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4039
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:13.290
<v Speaker 1>he was in town,</v>

4040
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:14.940
<v Speaker 1>got a chance to talk to a lot of the,</v>

4041
01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:18.940
<v Speaker 1>the fighters coming in and analyze the message they were using.</v>

4042
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4043
01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:21.150
<v Speaker 1>he recommended to us,</v>

4044
01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:21.690
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4045
01:57:21.690 --> 01:57:22.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4046
01:57:22.111 --> 01:57:24.570
<v Speaker 1>here's the maximum amount of weight fighters,</v>

4047
01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:24.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4048
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:26.160
<v Speaker 1>that you should recommend.</v>

4049
01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Fighters are losing that fight week.</v>

4050
01:57:27.751 --> 01:57:31.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we came up with our weight guideline of 8%.</v>

4051
01:57:31.111 --> 01:57:36.030
<v Speaker 1>So we recommend when those fighters checkin Tuesday for a Saturday fight there</v>

4052
01:57:36.031 --> 01:57:37.800
<v Speaker 1>within 8% of their goal weight,</v>

4053
01:57:37.890 --> 01:57:39.030
<v Speaker 1>usually on Friday.</v>

4054
01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a requirement or recommendation,</v>

4055
01:57:41.911 --> 01:57:42.451
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4056
01:57:42.451 --> 01:57:45.000
<v Speaker 1>we put that out there and educated heavily on that.</v>

4057
01:57:45.570 --> 01:57:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4058
01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:47.071
<v Speaker 1>since then,</v>

4059
01:57:47.071 --> 01:57:47.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4060
01:57:47.370 --> 01:57:47.821
<v Speaker 1>you talked,</v>

4061
01:57:47.821 --> 01:57:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I think last week about Andy Foster,</v>

4062
01:57:49.411 --> 01:57:52.650
<v Speaker 1>the executive director of California who's really taken the lead in terms of</v>

4063
01:57:52.651 --> 01:57:55.560
<v Speaker 1>commissions on combating dangerous weight cutting.</v>

4064
01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4065
01:57:56.610 --> 01:57:59.700
<v Speaker 1>he worked with US pretty closely on developing his 10 point,</v>

4066
01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:00.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4067
01:58:00.330 --> 01:58:04.110
<v Speaker 1>weight cutting plan or plan to combat serious weight cutting.</v>

4068
01:58:04.530 --> 01:58:05.041
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4069
01:58:05.041 --> 01:58:09.780
<v Speaker 1>includes his commission making calls to fighters on the car 30 days out,</v>

4070
01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:10.650
<v Speaker 1>10 days out,</v>

4071
01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:12.750
<v Speaker 1>making them a little bit more accountable,</v>

4072
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4073
01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:14.820
<v Speaker 1>farther out than fight week.</v>

4074
01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:15.661
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4075
01:58:15.661 --> 01:58:18.210
<v Speaker 1>he's also got a provision where fight night,</v>

4076
01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:19.470
<v Speaker 1>he takes the fighters weight,</v>

4077
01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:24.630
<v Speaker 1>weighs them and their recommendation is you only put on 10% of your weight back</v>

4078
01:58:24.631 --> 01:58:25.860
<v Speaker 1>on plus a pound.</v>

4079
01:58:26.370 --> 01:58:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4080
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:30.720
<v Speaker 1>if they're over that California can recommend the fight or move up away class.</v>

4081
01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4082
01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:32.491
<v Speaker 1>so really,</v>

4083
01:58:32.491 --> 01:58:32.731
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4084
01:58:32.731 --> 01:58:33.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean just a lot of,</v>

4085
01:58:33.810 --> 01:58:34.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4086
01:58:34.051 --> 01:58:35.910
<v Speaker 1>education recommendations not here.</v>

4087
01:58:35.911 --> 01:58:37.020
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people talk about,</v>

4088
01:58:37.021 --> 01:58:39.360
<v Speaker 1>and I'm curious for your thoughts on this.</v>

4089
01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Hey we can,</v>

4090
01:58:40.530 --> 01:58:44.350
<v Speaker 1>we can stop instantaneous issue and instantaneously just put rules out there.</v>

4091
01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:47.560
<v Speaker 1>If you lose this much weight or put this much weight back on,</v>

4092
01:58:47.561 --> 01:58:49.150
<v Speaker 1>you're suspended for six months,</v>

4093
01:58:49.151 --> 01:58:50.020
<v Speaker 1>12 months,</v>

4094
01:58:50.230 --> 01:58:50.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4095
01:58:50.441 --> 01:58:50.920
<v Speaker 1>whatever your,</v>

4096
01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:51.930
<v Speaker 1>we're just not going to let you,</v>

4097
01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:52.853
<v Speaker 1>you fight.</v>

4098
01:58:53.230 --> 01:58:56.290
<v Speaker 1>My concern there is when you have absolute rules,</v>

4099
01:58:56.920 --> 01:59:00.820
<v Speaker 1>fighter's going to do everything possible to you know,</v>

4100
01:59:00.821 --> 01:59:01.451
<v Speaker 1>to make weight.</v>

4101
01:59:01.451 --> 01:59:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Say you had a rule that if you miss,</v>

4102
01:59:02.711 --> 01:59:03.011
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

4103
01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:04.570
<v Speaker 1>you can't fight it again for 12 months,</v>

4104
01:59:04.571 --> 01:59:08.470
<v Speaker 1>you have to move up a weight class fighter's going to kill themselves to make</v>

4105
01:59:08.471 --> 01:59:08.681
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

4106
01:59:08.681 --> 01:59:09.730
<v Speaker 1>My fear would be that you,</v>

4107
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:13.780
<v Speaker 1>you put an absolute rule out there and someone get hurts because of the rule</v>

4108
01:59:13.781 --> 01:59:14.860
<v Speaker 1>that you put in place,</v>

4109
01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:16.180
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

4110
01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:16.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4111
01:59:16.361 --> 01:59:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a measured approach.</v>

4112
01:59:17.530 --> 01:59:19.420
<v Speaker 1>You have to continually reevaluate it.</v>

4113
01:59:19.421 --> 01:59:23.380
<v Speaker 1>But I think right now the rules that are out there between our recommendations,</v>

4114
01:59:23.381 --> 01:59:26.980
<v Speaker 1>California has rules are more guideline recommendations.</v>

4115
01:59:26.981 --> 01:59:31.270
<v Speaker 1>And then that in conjunction with what we're doing at the performance institute</v>

4116
01:59:31.271 --> 01:59:32.020
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

4117
01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean you saw last week,</v>

4118
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:38.260
<v Speaker 1>there is no excuse if you have issues making weight or you're not sure what your</v>

4119
01:59:38.261 --> 01:59:38.981
<v Speaker 1>weight class is,</v>

4120
01:59:38.981 --> 01:59:43.960
<v Speaker 1>that you have every resource available the best in the world to you to come in</v>

4121
01:59:43.961 --> 01:59:45.010
<v Speaker 1>and find that out,</v>

4122
01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:48.070
<v Speaker 1>to be given a plan on how to safely then make weight.</v>

4123
01:59:48.670 --> 01:59:49.181
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4124
01:59:49.181 --> 01:59:49.630
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

4125
01:59:49.630 --> 01:59:49.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4126
01:59:49.841 --> 01:59:49.981
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4127
01:59:49.981 --> 01:59:50.271
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4128
01:59:50.271 --> 01:59:54.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a multimillion dollar investment that the UFC has put I think toward that</v>

4129
01:59:54.581 --> 01:59:55.810
<v Speaker 1>problem and you know,</v>

4130
01:59:55.811 --> 01:59:55.961
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4131
01:59:55.961 --> 01:59:56.681
<v Speaker 1>maybe two,</v>

4132
01:59:56.681 --> 01:59:57.880
<v Speaker 1>three years from now we say,</v>

4133
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.491
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4134
01:59:58.491 --> 01:59:59.680
<v Speaker 1>that was with good intentions,</v>

4135
01:59:59.681 --> 02:00:00.700
<v Speaker 1>but not enough.</v>

4136
02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:01.630
<v Speaker 1>We need to do more.</v>

4137
02:00:01.631 --> 02:00:02.800
<v Speaker 1>But I think right now,</v>

4138
02:00:03.130 --> 02:00:03.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4139
02:00:03.670 --> 02:00:04.750
<v Speaker 1>that's our strategy,</v>

4140
02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:05.081
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4141
02:00:05.081 --> 02:00:05.914
<v Speaker 1>on the issue.</v>

4142
02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:06.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4143
02:00:06.381 --> 02:00:10.190
<v Speaker 2>I think a couple things would have to happen to really stop weight cutting.</v>

4144
02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:12.740
<v Speaker 2>One thing you're going to have to blow up these weight classes because there's</v>

4145
02:00:12.741 --> 02:00:15.710
<v Speaker 2>going to be champions in these weight classes that really won't be in that</v>

4146
02:00:15.711 --> 02:00:16.730
<v Speaker 2>weight class anymore.</v>

4147
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:21.910
<v Speaker 2>If you cut all the real heavy duty weight cutting out of the picture.</v>

4148
02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:25.950
<v Speaker 2>I think what one FC is trying to do is they're,</v>

4149
02:00:25.951 --> 02:00:28.640
<v Speaker 2>they're doing hydration test and they do a series of them.</v>

4150
02:00:28.641 --> 02:00:30.590
<v Speaker 2>I believe they do three leading up to the fight,</v>

4151
02:00:30.591 --> 02:00:32.330
<v Speaker 2>which really was it.</v>

4152
02:00:32.331 --> 02:00:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Benevidez was telling me this,</v>

4153
02:00:34.190 --> 02:00:34.610
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

4154
02:00:34.610 --> 02:00:35.480
<v Speaker 2>someone was telling me this,</v>

4155
02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:39.950
<v Speaker 2>that they've essentially made it almost impossible for you to cut weight.</v>

4156
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:44.990
<v Speaker 2>So they do hydration test on weighing at the way they're doing hydration test</v>

4157
02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:46.220
<v Speaker 2>three different times,</v>

4158
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:47.990
<v Speaker 2>three different times leading up to the fight.</v>

4159
02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:49.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact protocol,</v>

4160
02:00:49.461 --> 02:00:52.520
<v Speaker 2>but what they've done is essentially made it so that you can't be dehydrated.</v>

4161
02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:53.331
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't,</v>

4162
02:00:53.331 --> 02:00:54.051
<v Speaker 2>when you weigh in,</v>

4163
02:00:54.051 --> 02:00:55.350
<v Speaker 2>you have to weigh in and as you know,</v>

4164
02:00:55.370 --> 02:00:58.800
<v Speaker 2>like if you're fighting at one 70 but you know you,</v>

4165
02:00:58.801 --> 02:01:00.800
<v Speaker 2>you get on the scale and you're fucking dying,</v>

4166
02:01:01.170 --> 02:01:01.520
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

4167
02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:01.701
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4168
02:01:01.701 --> 02:01:03.040
<v Speaker 2>you're not really one 70 like,</v>

4169
02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:03.883
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

4170
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:05.720
<v Speaker 2>that's really where it should be.</v>

4171
02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:10.930
<v Speaker 2>This idea that the best way to fight is to cheat and to drain all yourself of</v>

4172
02:01:11.121 --> 02:01:14.060
<v Speaker 2>fluids and then pretend that you're 160 pounds,</v>

4173
02:01:14.061 --> 02:01:15.440
<v Speaker 2>then get back on the scale,</v>

4174
02:01:15.890 --> 02:01:16.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4175
02:01:16.850 --> 02:01:21.050
<v Speaker 2>15 hours later at one 85 that's fucking crazy.</v>

4176
02:01:21.051 --> 02:01:22.190
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

4177
02:01:22.970 --> 02:01:25.010
<v Speaker 2>You're not really 160 pound fighter.</v>

4178
02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:27.890
<v Speaker 2>You're 185 pound fighter who almost died.</v>

4179
02:01:28.190 --> 02:01:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4180
02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:29.481
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>

4181
02:01:29.481 --> 02:01:29.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4182
02:01:29.661 --> 02:01:32.850
<v Speaker 2>if I talk with forest a lot about this because he went through it and again why</v>

4183
02:01:32.851 --> 02:01:36.650
<v Speaker 2>he's such a great asset to the probe to the company,</v>

4184
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4185
02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:37.731
<v Speaker 2>but he says,</v>

4186
02:01:37.731 --> 02:01:38.090
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4187
02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:41.690
<v Speaker 2>there's certain and girls that have a genetic,</v>

4188
02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:42.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4189
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:43.880
<v Speaker 2>ability to,</v>

4190
02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:44.780
<v Speaker 2>to carry,</v>

4191
02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:44.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4192
02:01:44.961 --> 02:01:46.190
<v Speaker 2>they have good muscle mass.</v>

4193
02:01:46.190 --> 02:01:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Usually that just carry a ton of water and it's not,</v>

4194
02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:50.150
<v Speaker 2>it's not difficult.</v>

4195
02:01:50.151 --> 02:01:53.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not dangerous for them to drop 10 or 15 pounds and not,</v>

4196
02:01:53.690 --> 02:01:57.230
<v Speaker 2>but it would be if they fought 15 pounds under c,</v>

4197
02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:00.080
<v Speaker 2>if they're a fighting at 170 pounds,</v>

4198
02:02:00.081 --> 02:02:04.160
<v Speaker 2>they really weigh one 85 and if they cut down to one 70 they make that weight</v>

4199
02:02:04.161 --> 02:02:05.510
<v Speaker 2>and then fought right then.</v>

4200
02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Then it would be dangerous.</v>

4201
02:02:06.771 --> 02:02:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Their performance would be radically diminished.</v>

4202
02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:09.410
<v Speaker 2>So we're lying.</v>

4203
02:02:09.411 --> 02:02:10.670
<v Speaker 2>When those people get on the scale,</v>

4204
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:14.960
<v Speaker 2>when they get on the scale and they flex and they say one 70 sure you're one 70</v>

4205
02:02:14.961 --> 02:02:16.010
<v Speaker 2>for about an hour,</v>

4206
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4207
02:02:16.731 --> 02:02:19.880
<v Speaker 2>and then you're going to go right back up to what you were before you dehydrated</v>

4208
02:02:19.881 --> 02:02:20.331
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

4209
02:02:20.331 --> 02:02:21.920
<v Speaker 2>This is madness to me.</v>

4210
02:02:22.150 --> 02:02:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Well this goes against what fighting is supposed to be.</v>

4211
02:02:25.461 --> 02:02:29.540
<v Speaker 2>What we talked about before about discipline and focus and and and technique and</v>

4212
02:02:29.541 --> 02:02:30.320
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

4213
02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:32.630
<v Speaker 2>That's what competing is supposed to be about.</v>

4214
02:02:32.631 --> 02:02:37.631
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be about a fight or two equally skillful individuals try to</v>

4215
02:02:37.761 --> 02:02:40.580
<v Speaker 2>figure out who's got the best strategy and who's got the best we'll and</v>

4216
02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:41.593
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>

4217
02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:46.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not supposed to be about who can do this legal cheating thing best cause.</v>

4218
02:02:46.731 --> 02:02:48.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what weight cutting is.</v>

4219
02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>

4220
02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:52.640
<v Speaker 2>really the modern history of the UFC and the reason I think it's so successful</v>

4221
02:02:52.641 --> 02:02:55.250
<v Speaker 2>is the Renzo and Dana ran toward regulation,</v>

4222
02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:55.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4223
02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4224
02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:56.631
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

4225
02:02:56.631 --> 02:02:56.811
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4226
02:02:56.811 --> 02:02:57.920
<v Speaker 2>this is a no,</v>

4227
02:02:57.980 --> 02:02:58.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4228
02:02:58.191 --> 02:02:59.840
<v Speaker 2>marketed as an no rules,</v>

4229
02:02:59.841 --> 02:03:01.040
<v Speaker 2>no hold bar event.</v>

4230
02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:02.390
<v Speaker 2>They ran toward rules.</v>

4231
02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:04.530
<v Speaker 2>And so I think you know what you're taught.</v>

4232
02:03:04.531 --> 02:03:07.640
<v Speaker 2>And I actually had a discussion with Bob Bennett about this executive director</v>

4233
02:03:07.641 --> 02:03:08.210
<v Speaker 2>of Nevada.</v>

4234
02:03:08.210 --> 02:03:10.740
<v Speaker 2>He's Graham last week and you know,</v>

4235
02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:12.380
<v Speaker 2>he's looking what California is doing says,</v>

4236
02:03:12.381 --> 02:03:13.214
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4237
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:16.370
<v Speaker 2>we have physicals after the way in.</v>

4238
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:17.181
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

4239
02:03:17.181 --> 02:03:18.860
<v Speaker 2>we do the way it is now at the host hotel.</v>

4240
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:21.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's usually done at a ballroom fighter,</v>

4241
02:03:21.410 --> 02:03:22.430
<v Speaker 2>gets up on the scale,</v>

4242
02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:23.630
<v Speaker 2>makes weight immediately,</v>

4243
02:03:23.631 --> 02:03:26.180
<v Speaker 2>goes behind the curtain and has their pre-fight physical.</v>

4244
02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:26.491
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4245
02:03:26.491 --> 02:03:27.890
<v Speaker 2>But do they have a hydration test?</v>

4246
02:03:28.630 --> 02:03:28.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4247
02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:29.511
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

4248
02:03:29.511 --> 02:03:32.180
<v Speaker 2>I know California does some hydration testing fight night,</v>

4249
02:03:32.181 --> 02:03:32.421
<v Speaker 2>but would,</v>

4250
02:03:32.421 --> 02:03:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Bob told me as I have the most experience,</v>

4251
02:03:34.411 --> 02:03:39.140
<v Speaker 2>ringside physicians in the world that have seen more combat sports events and</v>

4252
02:03:39.141 --> 02:03:39.441
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>

4253
02:03:39.441 --> 02:03:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm comfortable that these guys are evaluating these medical professionals or</v>

4254
02:03:44.061 --> 02:03:48.330
<v Speaker 2>evaluating these fighters in the scenario and if they feel or see something's</v>

4255
02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.510
<v Speaker 2>not safe for that fighter to compete the next night,</v>

4256
02:03:50.511 --> 02:03:51.440
<v Speaker 2>that they'll call them off.</v>

4257
02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I think that's wonderful.</v>

4258
02:03:52.431 --> 02:03:56.390
<v Speaker 2>But I think all that does is keep fighters from getting to the point of death.</v>

4259
02:03:56.900 --> 02:03:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4260
02:03:57.170 --> 02:03:58.680
<v Speaker 2>getting to the point where they're sick and tear,</v>

4261
02:03:58.730 --> 02:04:01.070
<v Speaker 2>they're definitely compromised when they're making the weight.</v>

4262
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:02.330
<v Speaker 2>They're not really at that weight.</v>

4263
02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:03.680
<v Speaker 2>What I would really love,</v>

4264
02:04:03.681 --> 02:04:04.580
<v Speaker 2>in a perfect world,</v>

4265
02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:05.870
<v Speaker 2>besides the bare knuckle thing,</v>

4266
02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:09.320
<v Speaker 2>what I would really love is a weight class every 10 pounds.</v>

4267
02:04:09.650 --> 02:04:10.461
<v Speaker 2>Just have every time.</v>

4268
02:04:10.461 --> 02:04:10.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4269
02:04:10.641 --> 02:04:11.990
<v Speaker 2>there's just giant gaps.</v>

4270
02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:15.620
<v Speaker 2>The gap between 85 and two oh five is 20 fucking pounds.</v>

4271
02:04:15.621 --> 02:04:16.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of weight.</v>

4272
02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I hear that.</v>

4273
02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:23.260
<v Speaker 2>But let me give you a scenario where it shows that alone and can work female new</v>

4274
02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:27.620
<v Speaker 2>division for the UFC one 25 right?</v>

4275
02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Because we had a one 15 to one 35 pound gap,</v>

4276
02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:30.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4277
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:32.840
<v Speaker 2>What happened in our first championship fight?</v>

4278
02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:36.590
<v Speaker 2>So Jara Eubanks couldn't make weight.</v>

4279
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.711
<v Speaker 2>She didn't,</v>

4280
02:04:37.711 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 2>she</v>

4281
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:38.450
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even,</v>

4282
02:04:38.450 --> 02:04:38.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4283
02:04:38.641 --> 02:04:39.474
<v Speaker 1>so there,</v>

4284
02:04:39.810 --> 02:04:40.890
<v Speaker 1>that in and of itself,</v>

4285
02:04:40.891 --> 02:04:42.090
<v Speaker 1>just making a weight class,</v>

4286
02:04:42.091 --> 02:04:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think solves the problem.</v>

4287
02:04:43.710 --> 02:04:47.850
<v Speaker 1>But she's also relatively inexperienced young to sport.</v>

4288
02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:50.670
<v Speaker 1>And this is a brand new way class that they really didn't have a,</v>

4289
02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he had more weight classes,</v>

4290
02:04:52.591 --> 02:04:53.280
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't help,</v>

4291
02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:54.780
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to help by themselves.</v>

4292
02:04:54.781 --> 02:04:57.360
<v Speaker 1>You gotta it's gotta be a multiple prong attack.</v>

4293
02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>I think the hydration test should be along with that,</v>

4294
02:05:00.270 --> 02:05:05.070
<v Speaker 1>the hydration test and weight classes every 10 pounds and then give the champion</v>

4295
02:05:05.071 --> 02:05:05.881
<v Speaker 1>the benefit of the doubt.</v>

4296
02:05:05.881 --> 02:05:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Like whoever is the champion,</v>

4297
02:05:06.991 --> 02:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>each division,</v>

4298
02:05:07.650 --> 02:05:07.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

4299
02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:09.480
<v Speaker 1>whatever weight class,</v>

4300
02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:15.120
<v Speaker 1>you know what we find out what they really way and they have an opportunity to</v>

4301
02:05:15.121 --> 02:05:16.830
<v Speaker 1>fight for the title in that weight class.</v>

4302
02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:17.611
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

4303
02:05:17.611 --> 02:05:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked about it when you tour through the Pie,</v>

4304
02:05:20.101 --> 02:05:25.101
<v Speaker 1>but we have on a couple of occasion use that bioelectrical impedance machine to</v>

4305
02:05:25.141 --> 02:05:26.820
<v Speaker 1>determine is that the proper term?</v>

4306
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4307
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4308
02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:31.020
<v Speaker 1>but it basically can you step on the scale and you,</v>

4309
02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:35.430
<v Speaker 1>you hold onto these handles and it gives you some type of hydration reading.</v>

4310
02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4311
02:05:36.150 --> 02:05:38.790
<v Speaker 1>we've done that a few times on checking day,</v>

4312
02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:39.961
<v Speaker 1>weigh in day.</v>

4313
02:05:39.961 --> 02:05:42.150
<v Speaker 1>We're not sure exactly what the numbers look like,</v>

4314
02:05:42.151 --> 02:05:43.170
<v Speaker 1>but that's something that,</v>

4315
02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:43.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4316
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:44.310
<v Speaker 1>we're looking into.</v>

4317
02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Clint also does a lot of specific gravity testing,</v>

4318
02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:49.350
<v Speaker 1>fight week on fighters where,</v>

4319
02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:49.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4320
02:05:49.730 --> 02:05:52.950
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a Tuesday or Wednesday and I think he showed you that chart.</v>

4321
02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4322
02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:57.540
<v Speaker 1>he'll look at how much weight fighter has to lose and then look at what their</v>

4323
02:05:57.541 --> 02:05:58.920
<v Speaker 1>specific gravity reading is,</v>

4324
02:05:58.921 --> 02:06:01.080
<v Speaker 1>how diluted or concentrated the urine is.</v>

4325
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:02.041
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

4326
02:06:02.041 --> 02:06:05.130
<v Speaker 1>if you see someone with a bunch of weight to lose that is,</v>

4327
02:06:05.131 --> 02:06:05.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4328
02:06:05.371 --> 02:06:07.920
<v Speaker 1>relatively dehydrated specific gravity wise,</v>

4329
02:06:07.921 --> 02:06:08.731
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

4330
02:06:08.731 --> 02:06:09.850
<v Speaker 1>it can alter their plan.</v>

4331
02:06:09.851 --> 02:06:11.160
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

4332
02:06:11.161 --> 02:06:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've got a lot of,</v>

4333
02:06:12.210 --> 02:06:13.620
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that stuff going on.</v>

4334
02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily disagree with you that that more needs to be done,</v>

4335
02:06:17.551 --> 02:06:20.730
<v Speaker 1>but right now our plan of attack is to use these resources,</v>

4336
02:06:20.731 --> 02:06:22.470
<v Speaker 1>use the facility of the pie.</v>

4337
02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:23.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4338
02:06:23.071 --> 02:06:24.210
<v Speaker 1>in an ideal world,</v>

4339
02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I think rather than making these absolute rules,</v>

4340
02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.100
<v Speaker 1>trying to educate our fighters,</v>

4341
02:06:29.130 --> 02:06:29.970
<v Speaker 1>trying to show them,</v>

4342
02:06:29.971 --> 02:06:30.804
<v Speaker 1>I tell you one thing,</v>

4343
02:06:31.110 --> 02:06:35.010
<v Speaker 1>you can talk until you're blue in the face about things being bad,</v>

4344
02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:37.110
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy for a fighter.</v>

4345
02:06:37.290 --> 02:06:38.123
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

4346
02:06:38.570 --> 02:06:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm bullet proof.</v>

4347
02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:40.021
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

4348
02:06:40.021 --> 02:06:40.854
<v Speaker 1>they're fighters,</v>

4349
02:06:41.330 --> 02:06:42.060
<v Speaker 1>they're fighting.</v>

4350
02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:43.140
<v Speaker 1>That's bad for you anyway.</v>

4351
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4352
02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:43.891
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4353
02:06:43.891 --> 02:06:44.131
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4354
02:06:44.131 --> 02:06:45.450
<v Speaker 1>cut and weights bad for me too.</v>

4355
02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4356
02:06:45.930 --> 02:06:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Where they start listening.</v>

4357
02:06:46.981 --> 02:06:49.620
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is where the performance institute comes into play when you</v>

4358
02:06:49.621 --> 02:06:51.900
<v Speaker 1>start talking about the effect on your performance.</v>

4359
02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4360
02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:54.090
<v Speaker 1>so if you tell them,</v>

4361
02:06:54.180 --> 02:06:55.013
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

4362
02:06:55.110 --> 02:06:57.690
<v Speaker 1>if you can come to you know,</v>

4363
02:06:57.691 --> 02:07:02.691
<v Speaker 1>your proper weight in a more measured approach and not lose a whole bunch and</v>

4364
02:07:02.701 --> 02:07:03.780
<v Speaker 1>put that what look,</v>

4365
02:07:03.810 --> 02:07:08.700
<v Speaker 1>look at the difference it's going to make on your performance 24 to 30 hours</v>

4366
02:07:08.701 --> 02:07:09.600
<v Speaker 1>later because you see this,</v>

4367
02:07:09.601 --> 02:07:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see this occasionally when fighters go through,</v>

4368
02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:12.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4369
02:07:12.150 --> 02:07:12.900
<v Speaker 1>tough weight cuts.</v>

4370
02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:13.733
<v Speaker 1>You see them,</v>

4371
02:07:13.810 --> 02:07:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Sandra says after a round or two,</v>

4372
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4373
02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:16.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>

4374
02:07:16.171 --> 02:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>He's looked moving up to 170 pounds.</v>

4375
02:07:18.021 --> 02:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just phenomenal.</v>

4376
02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I also think now it's interesting,</v>

4377
02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

4378
02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:21.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4379
02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:23.250
<v Speaker 1>on one side of it the criticism would be,</v>

4380
02:07:23.251 --> 02:07:26.790
<v Speaker 1>well you're just encouraging even greater weight cuts and regains.</v>

4381
02:07:26.791 --> 02:07:29.700
<v Speaker 1>But I think this morning weigh in thing that we've,</v>

4382
02:07:29.790 --> 02:07:33.930
<v Speaker 1>we've put together I think has had a positive impact in a couple of areas.</v>

4383
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Explain that for people to know what we're talking about.</v>

4384
02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:38.020
<v Speaker 1>So actually Andy Foster again,</v>

4385
02:07:38.021 --> 02:07:41.920
<v Speaker 1>California before UFC one 99 came to me and said,</v>

4386
02:07:41.921 --> 02:07:42.041
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4387
02:07:42.041 --> 02:07:46.270
<v Speaker 1>we've been doing this morning weigh in for a couple regional local shows.</v>

4388
02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Would you guys be interested in it?</v>

4389
02:07:47.711 --> 02:07:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Where we do it at the host hotel,</v>

4390
02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:50.890
<v Speaker 1>we do it,</v>

4391
02:07:50.890 --> 02:07:51.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4392
02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>we'd open the scales from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and the idea would be a fighter</v>

4393
02:07:56.321 --> 02:07:57.820
<v Speaker 1>gets on weight in their hotel room,</v>

4394
02:07:57.821 --> 02:08:01.300
<v Speaker 1>upstairs hops on the elevator steps on the scale.</v>

4395
02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:02.170
<v Speaker 1>They make weight,</v>

4396
02:08:02.170 --> 02:08:06.040
<v Speaker 1>they can start eating and drinking again right away with the idea of they don't</v>

4397
02:08:06.041 --> 02:08:08.620
<v Speaker 1>have to wait til 4:00 PM and extra know exactly what the idea of,</v>

4398
02:08:08.621 --> 02:08:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the dangers of,</v>

4399
02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:11.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4400
02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:14.950
<v Speaker 1>weight cutting and being dehydrated is the amount of time that you're at a,</v>

4401
02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:15.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4402
02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:16.600
<v Speaker 1>add a loss of that water.</v>

4403
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:19.990
<v Speaker 1>And in the past when we'd have the weigh ins at an arena,</v>

4404
02:08:21.070 --> 02:08:21.521
<v Speaker 1>it would be,</v>

4405
02:08:21.521 --> 02:08:23.290
<v Speaker 1>the fight would have to check in downstairs.</v>

4406
02:08:23.291 --> 02:08:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Say the,</v>

4407
02:08:23.650 --> 02:08:25.540
<v Speaker 1>we had the way ends at four o'clock in an arena,</v>

4408
02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:26.710
<v Speaker 1>the firewood,</v>

4409
02:08:26.710 --> 02:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>the fighter would check in downstairs that maybe two,</v>

4410
02:08:29.570 --> 02:08:30.403
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4411
02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:32.260
<v Speaker 1>two 30 the bus would leave.</v>

4412
02:08:32.650 --> 02:08:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I remember in Rio were in one time on a bus for an hour,</v>

4413
02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:36.581
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half to the arena.</v>

4414
02:08:36.581 --> 02:08:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's depleted and dehydrated on the bus ride you step on a scale and a</v>

4415
02:08:40.721 --> 02:08:41.554
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>

4416
02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:42.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4417
02:08:42.730 --> 02:08:44.770
<v Speaker 1>environmentally unfriendly arena.</v>

4418
02:08:45.250 --> 02:08:48.130
<v Speaker 1>You then get back on the bus drive another hour,</v>

4419
02:08:48.130 --> 02:08:48.131
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half.</v>

4420
02:08:48.131 --> 02:08:51.910
<v Speaker 1>You're talking multiple hours where these fighters are in a depleted state.</v>

4421
02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:54.700
<v Speaker 1>So I think the morning way and protects against that.</v>

4422
02:08:54.701 --> 02:08:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I think the other benefit we've seen out of it,</v>

4423
02:08:56.930 --> 02:09:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more of a longterm than a short term benefit is we've seen a lot</v>

4424
02:09:00.221 --> 02:09:03.640
<v Speaker 1>more fighters missing weight since we went to the morning weigh ins.</v>

4425
02:09:03.970 --> 02:09:06.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a product of timing.</v>

4426
02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:08.860
<v Speaker 1>And that in the past you had four,</v>

4427
02:09:08.890 --> 02:09:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4428
02:09:09.130 --> 02:09:10.210
<v Speaker 1>four or five in the afternoon,</v>

4429
02:09:10.211 --> 02:09:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you had all day long to cut weight and you would see fighters at 10 or 11 said,</v>

4430
02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I can't do anymore.</v>

4431
02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And a one or two o'clock I said,</v>

4432
02:09:17.261 --> 02:09:17.351
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4433
02:09:17.351 --> 02:09:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I can do a couple more pounds and just all day long now,</v>

4434
02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:22.570
<v Speaker 1>unless you're literally not sleeping the night before you fight,</v>

4435
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you have a shorter window in the morning to do that.</v>

4436
02:09:25.570 --> 02:09:26.830
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of those myths,</v>

4437
02:09:26.831 --> 02:09:30.220
<v Speaker 1>weights has helped identify those fighters that I'm probably on the right,</v>

4438
02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>the wrong weight class.</v>

4439
02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:33.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't make that weight of waking up,</v>

4440
02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:33.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4441
02:09:33.881 --> 02:09:34.870
<v Speaker 1>five or six in the morning,</v>

4442
02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:35.651
<v Speaker 1>a couple hours,</v>

4443
02:09:35.651 --> 02:09:37.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's probably too much weight to lose.</v>

4444
02:09:37.181 --> 02:09:40.180
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen some fighters move up in weight class because of that.</v>

4445
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:42.970
<v Speaker 1>We've also seen some fighters that have decided,</v>

4446
02:09:42.971 --> 02:09:43.211
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4447
02:09:43.211 --> 02:09:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I gotta take this more professionally and hire a nutritionist.</v>

4448
02:09:46.541 --> 02:09:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Like could be,</v>

4449
02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.160
<v Speaker 1>it could be a number of Madoff who made weight easily for his last fight and the</v>

4450
02:09:51.161 --> 02:09:55.450
<v Speaker 1>fight before that obviously fell out of the fight because his body shut down and</v>

4451
02:09:55.451 --> 02:09:56.290
<v Speaker 1>he had to go to the hospital.</v>

4452
02:09:56.291 --> 02:09:57.190
<v Speaker 1>It'd be rehydrated.</v>

4453
02:09:57.880 --> 02:09:58.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4454
02:09:58.151 --> 02:09:58.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean I again,</v>

4455
02:09:58.811 --> 02:10:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a one size fits all solution.</v>

4456
02:10:00.941 --> 02:10:01.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to be careful,</v>

4457
02:10:01.841 --> 02:10:02.260
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4458
02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:04.720
<v Speaker 1>it'd be missed weight that last time went to the hospital.</v>

4459
02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:05.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4460
02:10:05.461 --> 02:10:06.860
<v Speaker 1>a knee jerk reaction would be you,</v>

4461
02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:08.760
<v Speaker 1>you can't fight this weight anymore.</v>

4462
02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:09.730
<v Speaker 1>What we saw this time,</v>

4463
02:10:09.731 --> 02:10:11.410
<v Speaker 1>he just changed the way he did things.</v>

4464
02:10:11.411 --> 02:10:11.951
<v Speaker 1>He came in,</v>

4465
02:10:11.951 --> 02:10:13.510
<v Speaker 1>he was on wait the night before,</v>

4466
02:10:13.511 --> 02:10:15.880
<v Speaker 1>he had a couple of pounds to lose fight week.</v>

4467
02:10:16.270 --> 02:10:17.260
<v Speaker 1>So it can be done.</v>

4468
02:10:17.261 --> 02:10:17.621
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

4469
02:10:17.621 --> 02:10:19.700
<v Speaker 1>that reverts back to the performance institute.</v>

4470
02:10:19.730 --> 02:10:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no excuse now that if you're a new fighter and you're not making</v>

4471
02:10:24.431 --> 02:10:27.220
<v Speaker 1>a hell of a lot of money and don't have the resources to hire,</v>

4472
02:10:27.490 --> 02:10:27.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4473
02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:29.290
<v Speaker 1>George Lockhart who ever,</v>

4474
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4475
02:10:29.591 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 1>have Clinton Wattenberg who's an ivy league educated Sports Dietitian that can</v>

4476
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:36.200
<v Speaker 1>provide you all that remotely.</v>

4477

02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4483
02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.460
<v Speaker 1>if you can get to Vegas,</v>

4484

4485
02:10:46.311 --> 02:10:51.050
<v Speaker 1>but you have a kitchen and cooks and staff that will provide you that meal</v>

4486
02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:53.630
<v Speaker 1>throughout your whole fight camp that just want to be there for free.</v>

4487
02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:54.643
<v Speaker 1>So amazing.</v>

4488
02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:55.910
<v Speaker 1>The place is incredible.</v>

4489
02:10:55.940 --> 02:10:58.710
<v Speaker 1>And we will have a Clint and um,</v>

4490
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Dunkin,</v>

4491
02:10:59.570 --> 02:10:59.781
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4492
02:10:59.781 --> 02:11:00.540
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast.</v>

4493
02:11:00.540 --> 02:11:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Explain all that.</v>

4494
02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:02.550
<v Speaker 1>What's in that little silver?</v>

4495
02:11:02.590 --> 02:11:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4496
02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:03.321
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4497
02:11:03.321 --> 02:11:04.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4498
02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:04.843
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

4499
02:11:04.910 --> 02:11:05.301
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4500
02:11:05.301 --> 02:11:06.540
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that,</v>

4501
02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:09.080
<v Speaker 1>that we want to do with this program again is,</v>

4502
02:11:09.110 --> 02:11:09.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4503
02:11:09.650 --> 02:11:10.670
<v Speaker 1>first and foremost,</v>

4504
02:11:10.671 --> 02:11:12.320
<v Speaker 1>it's to protect the UFC athlete,</v>

4505
02:11:12.321 --> 02:11:13.640
<v Speaker 1>protect the rights of clean athletes,</v>

4506
02:11:13.641 --> 02:11:18.641
<v Speaker 1>but we also want to influence other sports influenced anti-doping as a whole.</v>

4507
02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:21.770
<v Speaker 1>So you saw came to us earlier this year and said,</v>

4508
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:23.660
<v Speaker 1>we've got some new technology.</v>

4509
02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:27.620
<v Speaker 1>What do you guys think about using your program to be the first to kind of roll</v>

4510
02:11:27.621 --> 02:11:28.070
<v Speaker 1>it out?</v>

4511
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:29.810
<v Speaker 1>And so the answer was,</v>

4512
02:11:29.811 --> 02:11:30.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4513
02:11:30.170 --> 02:11:31.070
<v Speaker 1>is the science good?</v>

4514
02:11:31.071 --> 02:11:31.821
<v Speaker 1>Is it validated?</v>

4515
02:11:31.821 --> 02:11:32.031
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

4516
02:11:32.031 --> 02:11:32.271
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4517
02:11:32.271 --> 02:11:33.104
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

4518
02:11:33.170 --> 02:11:34.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4519
02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I was actually at a,</v>

4520
02:11:35.150 --> 02:11:40.150
<v Speaker 1>at a conference mid summer back in New York and sat on a panel with Major League</v>

4521
02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Baseball Pga tour and the UFC and a bunch of anti-doping scientists there.</v>

4522
02:11:45.710 --> 02:11:48.830
<v Speaker 1>And they were talking about this technology and the other leagues.</v>

4523
02:11:48.831 --> 02:11:49.281
<v Speaker 1>We're asked,</v>

4524
02:11:49.281 --> 02:11:49.491
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4525
02:11:49.491 --> 02:11:50.900
<v Speaker 1>you guys gonna Institute that?</v>

4526
02:11:50.901 --> 02:11:51.201
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

4527
02:11:51.201 --> 02:11:52.034
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>

4528
02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4529
02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:53.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4530
02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4531
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think enough stare and they went to me.</v>

4532
02:11:54.951 --> 02:11:55.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4533
02:11:55.221 --> 02:11:55.911
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

4534
02:11:55.911 --> 02:11:57.890
<v Speaker 1>If you saw the science tells me this,</v>

4535
02:11:58.040 --> 02:11:58.671
<v Speaker 1>this works.</v>

4536
02:11:58.671 --> 02:11:59.570
<v Speaker 1>We want to be the first,</v>

4537
02:11:59.571 --> 02:12:02.750
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's more convenient and more efficient for our program.</v>

4538
02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So what this is,</v>

4539
02:12:04.191 --> 02:12:07.610
<v Speaker 1>is it's a leaching device and um,</v>

4540
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:08.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4541
02:12:08.121 --> 02:12:12.320
<v Speaker 1>until this came out basically to get any blood tests from a shit,</v>

4542
02:12:12.321 --> 02:12:13.041
<v Speaker 1>you got some scissors.</v>

4543
02:12:13.041 --> 02:12:13.874
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4544
02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:14.713
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4545
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:15.763
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

4546
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:17.143
<v Speaker 1>That was ready for you</v>

4547
02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:20.300
<v Speaker 1>and tell this came out.</v>

4548
02:12:20.690 --> 02:12:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Basically any blood tests done from,</v>

4549
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4550
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:26.150
<v Speaker 1>from our athlete had to be done with the phlebotomist.</v>

4551
02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:29.540
<v Speaker 1>The full on needle in the vein take out a vial of blood.</v>

4552
02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:31.460
<v Speaker 1>So with this leaching device,</v>

4553
02:12:31.461 --> 02:12:34.730
<v Speaker 1>it's got 30 micro needles in it.</v>

4554
02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.380
<v Speaker 1>The size about eyelash,</v>

4555
02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:38.060
<v Speaker 1>you put it up on your arm,</v>

4556
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:43.040
<v Speaker 1>you hit this button and painlessly the microneedles reach into just the</v>

4557
02:12:43.041 --> 02:12:43.641
<v Speaker 1>capillary.</v>

4558
02:12:43.641 --> 02:12:45.320
<v Speaker 1>So just the blood of the top of the,</v>

4559
02:12:45.321 --> 02:12:45.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4560
02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:48.920
<v Speaker 1>of the skin and draw out a small amount of blood.</v>

4561
02:12:49.070 --> 02:12:49.570
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

4562
02:12:49.570 --> 02:12:50.840
<v Speaker 1>this light turns red.</v>

4563
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:52.040
<v Speaker 1>When that blood's drawn out.</v>

4564
02:12:52.190 --> 02:12:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

4565
02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:55.310
<v Speaker 1>The blood is then deposited onto a,</v>

4566
02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:56.360
<v Speaker 1>an index card.</v>

4567
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:58.220
<v Speaker 1>It's called dried blood spot testing.</v>

4568
02:12:58.221 --> 02:13:01.550
<v Speaker 1>So a drop or two of blood on the four corners,</v>

4569
02:13:01.970 --> 02:13:03.380
<v Speaker 1>the cards then sealed up,</v>

4570
02:13:03.710 --> 02:13:06.710
<v Speaker 1>placed in the mail and sent to a water laboratory.</v>

4571
02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:09.440
<v Speaker 1>This is all have to be done on video so that no,</v>

4572
02:13:09.441 --> 02:13:10.400
<v Speaker 1>well you have a color.</v>

4573
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:13.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not the athlete doing themselves can have a collector doing that.</v>

4574
02:13:13.221 --> 02:13:13.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4575
02:13:13.371 --> 02:13:16.460
<v Speaker 1>that could be the future where an athlete is doing it themselves,</v>

4576
02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:17.720
<v Speaker 1>but then facetime or something.</v>

4577
02:13:17.721 --> 02:13:18.291
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

4578
02:13:18.291 --> 02:13:18.530
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

4579
02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:20.540
<v Speaker 1>but here are the benefits of that a,</v>

4580
02:13:20.541 --> 02:13:20.991
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

4581
02:13:20.991 --> 02:13:21.980
<v Speaker 1>this is huge for me.</v>

4582
02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I want to make things as convenient for our athletes as possible.</v>

4583
02:13:25.041 --> 02:13:25.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4584
02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:25.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4585
02:13:25.881 --> 02:13:27.560
<v Speaker 1>you talked to our roster and ask them,</v>

4586
02:13:27.561 --> 02:13:31.950
<v Speaker 1>would you prefer big needle stuck in the vein of your arm and a of blood taken</v>

4587
02:13:31.951 --> 02:13:33.930
<v Speaker 1>out versus completely painless,</v>

4588
02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:34.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4589
02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:35.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4590
02:13:35.041 --> 02:13:36.870
<v Speaker 1>leach of some blood from your capillaries.</v>

4591
02:13:36.871 --> 02:13:37.681
<v Speaker 1>They're all gonna say,</v>

4592
02:13:37.681 --> 02:13:38.580
<v Speaker 1>obviously this,</v>

4593
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you talk about cost.</v>

4594
02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:41.753
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4595
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:42.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4596
02:13:42.540 --> 02:13:45.330
<v Speaker 1>blood taken out of a vein in your arm requires a phlebotomist.</v>

4597
02:13:45.331 --> 02:13:47.790
<v Speaker 1>So in those cases where you saw it as doing a blood test,</v>

4598
02:13:47.791 --> 02:13:51.510
<v Speaker 1>they usually take a drug collection officer and a phlebotomist to take out of</v>

4599
02:13:51.511 --> 02:13:52.950
<v Speaker 1>the blood to take out the blood.</v>

4600
02:13:53.070 --> 02:13:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

4601
02:13:53.580 --> 02:13:55.200
<v Speaker 1>that's a couple hundred dollars there.</v>

4602
02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4603
02:13:56.580 --> 02:14:00.480
<v Speaker 1>a vial of blood needs to be cold shipped to the water laboratories.</v>

4604
02:14:00.481 --> 02:14:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Here you're talking about dried blood on an index card that just needs to be</v>

4605
02:14:04.561 --> 02:14:05.190
<v Speaker 1>sealed up.</v>

4606
02:14:05.190 --> 02:14:09.720
<v Speaker 1>It becomes tamper proof once it is and put it in the mail for 55 cents.</v>

4607
02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4608
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4609
02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:13.230
<v Speaker 1>so I think incredible efficiency,</v>

4610
02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:15.690
<v Speaker 1>convenience to the athlete for our program.</v>

4611
02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:16.583
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

4612
02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:18.300
<v Speaker 1>we want to lead and I think,</v>

4613
02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:19.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4614
02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:23.520
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about a master's question regularly about local or regional,</v>

4615
02:14:23.521 --> 02:14:24.480
<v Speaker 1>and then may show saying,</v>

4616
02:14:24.481 --> 02:14:24.601
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4617
02:14:24.601 --> 02:14:26.760
<v Speaker 1>this is great what you guys are doing for your program,</v>

4618
02:14:26.761 --> 02:14:28.560
<v Speaker 1>but how much does this program costs you?</v>

4619
02:14:28.561 --> 02:14:31.410
<v Speaker 1>And it is a multimillion dollar program in a year.</v>

4620
02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:32.251
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

4621
02:14:32.251 --> 02:14:32.341
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4622
02:14:32.341 --> 02:14:33.630
<v Speaker 1>we love to do something like that,</v>

4623
02:14:33.631 --> 02:14:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4624
02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:35.490
<v Speaker 1>we can't afford that.</v>

4625
02:14:35.550 --> 02:14:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Something like this where now you cut your costs down from sending blood to,</v>

4626
02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:40.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4627
02:14:40.561 --> 02:14:42.660
<v Speaker 1>for maybe thousand dollars to,</v>

4628
02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:42.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4629
02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:44.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe a hundred dollars,</v>

4630
02:14:44.161 --> 02:14:47.370
<v Speaker 1>this device in one DCL going to collect it out and put it on a card.</v>

4631
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it has some really great implications,</v>

4632
02:14:49.801 --> 02:14:50.940
<v Speaker 1>not just for the UFC,</v>

4633
02:14:50.941 --> 02:14:51.541
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4634
02:14:51.541 --> 02:14:52.500
<v Speaker 1>throughout the sport.</v>

4635
02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Can I see that thing?</v>

4636
02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

4637
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:54.840
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty bad ass.</v>

4638
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:56.003
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4639
02:14:57.570 --> 02:14:58.403
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4640
02:14:58.770 --> 02:14:59.603
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

4641
02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4642
02:15:00.570 --> 02:15:01.290
<v Speaker 1>anything else?</v>

4643
02:15:01.290 --> 02:15:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Should we wrap this up?</v>

4644
02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:02.700
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>

4645
02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:02.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4646
02:15:02.911 --> 02:15:03.610
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4647
02:15:03.610 --> 02:15:04.081
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm good.</v>

4648
02:15:04.081 --> 02:15:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Unless you got anything else doing an amazing job.</v>

4649
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4650
02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:06.871
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

4651
02:15:06.871 --> 02:15:07.651
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible.</v>

4652
02:15:07.651 --> 02:15:08.340
<v Speaker 1>The results.</v>

4653
02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

4654
02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:12.420
<v Speaker 1>it's so cool to see the results on the biological passport that you get.</v>

4655
02:15:12.421 --> 02:15:14.910
<v Speaker 1>You guys could show it in a chart and,</v>

4656
02:15:14.911 --> 02:15:15.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4657
02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean it pretty much everyone agrees.</v>

4658
02:15:18.181 --> 02:15:18.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4659
02:15:18.391 --> 02:15:18.681
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

4660
02:15:18.681 --> 02:15:21.060
<v Speaker 1>it's really changed the nature of fighting.</v>

4661
02:15:21.061 --> 02:15:21.691
<v Speaker 1>It really has,</v>

4662
02:15:21.691 --> 02:15:22.650
<v Speaker 1>it changed the sport.</v>

4663
02:15:22.651 --> 02:15:23.330
<v Speaker 1>It changed.</v>

4664
02:15:23.330 --> 02:15:25.470
<v Speaker 1>It's almost eliminated doping.</v>

4665
02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4666
02:15:26.550 --> 02:15:27.383
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate it.</v>

4667
02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:27.871
<v Speaker 1>As I told you,</v>

4668
02:15:27.871 --> 02:15:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate the platform you have here.</v>

4669
02:15:29.491 --> 02:15:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Literally every fighter in and camp and manager,</v>

4670
02:15:32.100 --> 02:15:32.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4671
02:15:32.311 --> 02:15:33.480
<v Speaker 1>on our roster watches this.</v>

4672
02:15:33.481 --> 02:15:36.090
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be able to get in and talk about these things.</v>

4673
02:15:36.091 --> 02:15:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Talk about that new technology.</v>

4674
02:15:37.561 --> 02:15:41.640
<v Speaker 1>We just use that actually I think rose Nama Junis was the first fight or that</v>

4675
02:15:41.641 --> 02:15:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you sought to try that out on,</v>

4676
02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:44.450
<v Speaker 1>so a center tax tactical.</v>

4677
02:15:44.450 --> 02:15:44.851
<v Speaker 1>Hey rose,</v>

4678
02:15:44.851 --> 02:15:45.440
<v Speaker 1>I heard they,</v>

4679
02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:47.300
<v Speaker 1>they did the leaching device and the blood,</v>

4680
02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:48.820
<v Speaker 1>the dried blood spot tests.</v>

4681
02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Would you think she said awesome.</v>

4682
02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:53.040
<v Speaker 1>It didn't feel a thing and she said,</v>

4683
02:15:53.070 --> 02:15:58.070
<v Speaker 1>my mind is blown by the tech how far technology's come here and that's a big</v>

4684
02:15:58.081 --> 02:16:01.860
<v Speaker 1>part of anti-doping and that deterrent when you're now saying look at how the</v>

4685
02:16:01.861 --> 02:16:05.670
<v Speaker 1>technology is evolving here and you get an athlete that thinks,</v>

4686
02:16:05.671 --> 02:16:09.210
<v Speaker 1>well you know I think I can out with them or out cat and mouse them.</v>

4687
02:16:09.211 --> 02:16:13.140
<v Speaker 1>They see shit like this that are going to think and perceptions almost as</v>

4688
02:16:13.290 --> 02:16:16.560
<v Speaker 1>important as reality and a lot of these occasions and they start seeing things</v>

4689
02:16:16.561 --> 02:16:20.130
<v Speaker 1>like this and that deterrent factors built up I think higher and higher.</v>

4690
02:16:20.150 --> 02:16:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4691
02:16:20.290 --> 02:16:23.280
<v Speaker 1>It seems like at one point in time there was a race and the dopers we're just</v>

4692
02:16:23.281 --> 02:16:25.260
<v Speaker 1>like one half step ahead.</v>

4693
02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:27.480
<v Speaker 1>But now it seems like it's even,</v>

4694
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:32.290
<v Speaker 1>and with the possibility of freezing your sample and then looking towards it to</v>

4695
02:16:32.291 --> 02:16:33.124
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>

4696
02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:34.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not worth it.</v>

4697
02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4698
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I call it even yet,</v>

4699
02:16:36.461 --> 02:16:38.740
<v Speaker 1>but that goes is definitely narrowing and you're,</v>

4700
02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:42.490
<v Speaker 1>you're affecting the way that dopers are doping these days.</v>

4701
02:16:42.491 --> 02:16:43.211
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

4702
02:16:43.211 --> 02:16:44.044
<v Speaker 1>now the,</v>

4703
02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:44.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4704
02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:47.030
<v Speaker 1>you know microdosing I think is big and it's,</v>

4705
02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:51.290
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to catch microdosing but you've altered the behavior of the doper</v>

4706
02:16:51.330 --> 02:16:56.330
<v Speaker 1>from taking drugs really unabated to very small amounts of the benefits aren't</v>

4707
02:16:56.651 --> 02:16:57.311
<v Speaker 1>going to be as great.</v>

4708
02:16:57.311 --> 02:17:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I think you got to consider that a win for anti doping.</v>

4709
02:17:00.281 --> 02:17:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I think that gap continues to,</v>

4710
02:17:01.611 --> 02:17:03.850
<v Speaker 1>to narrow and when they microdose like what,</v>

4711
02:17:03.851 --> 02:17:07.180
<v Speaker 1>what it like say would that be like testosterone or something like that?</v>

4712
02:17:07.210 --> 02:17:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Testosterone Epo.</v>

4713
02:17:08.351 --> 02:17:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Probably the two most common vary how much of a window of detection matter of</v>

4714
02:17:12.581 --> 02:17:14.410
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

4715
02:17:14.410 --> 02:17:14.410
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

4716
02:17:14.410 --> 02:17:15.040
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

4717
02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:15.431
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4718
02:17:15.431 --> 02:17:16.264
<v Speaker 1>going back to,</v>

4719
02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I think I might've told this story last time I was on,</v>

4720
02:17:18.491 --> 02:17:20.650
<v Speaker 1>but the Floyd Landis Lance days,</v>

4721
02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:24.610
<v Speaker 1>they were manipulating during the Tour de France and eight hour window.</v>

4722
02:17:24.850 --> 02:17:29.230
<v Speaker 1>So from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM they wouldn't test them during the tour of the</v>

4723
02:17:29.231 --> 02:17:32.590
<v Speaker 1>thought was these guys are racing up side of the mountain for five,</v>

4724
02:17:32.591 --> 02:17:33.221
<v Speaker 1>six hours a day.</v>

4725
02:17:33.221 --> 02:17:34.330
<v Speaker 1>We got to let these guys sleep.</v>

4726
02:17:34.930 --> 02:17:35.770
<v Speaker 1>And they figured out,</v>

4727
02:17:35.771 --> 02:17:35.891
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4728
02:17:35.891 --> 02:17:39.400
<v Speaker 1>if we do something at 10 oh one by 601 there are list of tests or can come.</v>

4729
02:17:39.401 --> 02:17:40.234
<v Speaker 1>It'd be clear.</v>

4730
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4731
02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:42.440
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

4732
02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:42.641
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4733
02:17:42.641 --> 02:17:44.140
<v Speaker 1>that prospect's all is out there.</v>

4734
02:17:44.170 --> 02:17:45.490
<v Speaker 1>That's why the UFC program,</v>

4735
02:17:45.491 --> 02:17:46.990
<v Speaker 1>there's no limits on the test now.</v>

4736
02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4737
02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:48.521
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bummer.</v>

4738
02:17:48.521 --> 02:17:50.230
<v Speaker 1>It's in terms of their sleep side is,</v>

4739
02:17:50.290 --> 02:17:50.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4740
02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:51.191
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

4741
02:17:51.191 --> 02:17:52.000
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

4742
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:52.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4743
02:17:52.241 --> 02:17:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I think most appreciate that that's,</v>

4744
02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:55.120
<v Speaker 1>that's the price of,</v>

4745
02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:55.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4746
02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:57.160
<v Speaker 1>clean sport and tried to ensure,</v>

4747
02:17:57.220 --> 02:17:59.050
<v Speaker 1>would there be a way to change that?</v>

4748
02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Like would there be some sort of a wearable device that would detect changes in</v>

4749
02:18:02.621 --> 02:18:03.220
<v Speaker 1>your body?</v>

4750
02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I've often thought that.</v>

4751
02:18:04.110 --> 02:18:05.320
<v Speaker 1>How about a wearable device?</v>

4752
02:18:05.321 --> 02:18:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It was top secret.</v>

4753
02:18:06.130 --> 02:18:09.820
<v Speaker 1>They collected everything 24 hours a day that you peel it off after a couple of</v>

4754
02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:10.210
<v Speaker 1>weeks and it's,</v>

4755
02:18:10.210 --> 02:18:14.530
<v Speaker 1>and it's tested or give them the wearable device.</v>

4756
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:16.270
<v Speaker 1>So when they're sleeping,</v>

4757
02:18:16.271 --> 02:18:17.790
<v Speaker 1>so you don't interrupt our sleep cycles.</v>

4758
02:18:17.791 --> 02:18:21.670
<v Speaker 1>So 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM or whatever it is that you decide it would be the window</v>

4759
02:18:21.671 --> 02:18:22.600
<v Speaker 1>that they need to sleep.</v>

4760
02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:24.490
<v Speaker 1>While they're doing that,</v>

4761
02:18:24.491 --> 02:18:28.090
<v Speaker 1>they must have this device on that detects any changes to their metabolism,</v>

4762
02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:29.200
<v Speaker 1>any changes in input,</v>

4763
02:18:29.201 --> 02:18:30.400
<v Speaker 1>and then they can't eat while they're on.</v>

4764
02:18:30.830 --> 02:18:31.271
<v Speaker 1>This is we,</v>

4765
02:18:31.271 --> 02:18:31.661
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

4766
02:18:31.661 --> 02:18:34.150
<v Speaker 1>the anti-doping community is always thinking about things.</v>

4767
02:18:34.151 --> 02:18:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Travis Tygart,</v>

4768
02:18:35.651 --> 02:18:37.570
<v Speaker 1>the CEO of Usada last week,</v>

4769
02:18:37.571 --> 02:18:38.380
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

4770
02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:38.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4771
02:18:38.591 --> 02:18:43.420
<v Speaker 1>he made it clear and that you saw that I think dedicates $3 million a year</v>

4772
02:18:43.450 --> 02:18:46.000
<v Speaker 1>grants toward research and anti-doping,</v>

4773
02:18:46.001 --> 02:18:46.751
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

4774
02:18:46.751 --> 02:18:47.630
<v Speaker 1>So I mean that,</v>

4775
02:18:47.690 --> 02:18:51.160
<v Speaker 1>that race is always going on and is always continuing.</v>

4776
02:18:51.430 --> 02:18:52.263
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

4777
02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Great work.</v>

4778
02:18:53.650 --> 02:18:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Mr Novitsky,</v>

4779
02:18:54.370 --> 02:18:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry about the nickname.</v>

4780
02:18:56.380 --> 02:18:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4781
02:18:56.560 --> 02:18:57.310
<v Speaker 1>get over it.</v>

4782
02:18:57.310 --> 02:18:58.700
<v Speaker 1>You're okay with us right off the bat.</v>

4783
02:18:59.140 --> 02:18:59.561
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

4784
02:18:59.561 --> 02:19:00.011
<v Speaker 1>Thanks brother.</v>

4785
02:19:00.011 --> 02:19:00.461
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it,</v>

4786
02:19:00.461 --> 02:19:00.581
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4787
02:19:00.581 --> 02:19:00.810
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
