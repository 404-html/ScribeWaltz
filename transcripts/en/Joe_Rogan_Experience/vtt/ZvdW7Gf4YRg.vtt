00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.970
Hello Freak pitches this episode,

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.700
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by stamps.com if you go to

3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:13.701
stamps.com you can sell all sorts of shit online and measure it and weigh it off

4
00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:17.070
from your house.
Like we were talking about the other day.

5
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:21.660
If you have an exotic thing that you make from your own home and you want to

6
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:25.110
sell it yourself,
you don't want to go to the post office and say,
Hey,
can you,

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.060
can you,
can you weigh out these whale bone dildos?
You don't have to do that.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.000
You could do it all yourself and they'll provide you with a,

9
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.010
an actual postage scale so you can weigh everything out and they'll also provide

10
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:42.450
you with $55 of a free postage.

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.990
If you use the code word j r e x a Joe,
it's $110 bonus offer.
Yeah,

12
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.410
it's what?
Nevermind.
You're professionals.

13
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:55.830
Fuck yeah,
they give me all that stuff for free.
Sign Up,

14
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.250
use the Cobra Jerry and you can send shit online.
Like Brian Sends those,

15
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.200
those desk squad dot t v t shirts.

16
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:05.160
All those get sent directly through stamps.com super easy to do.

17
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.700
Measure it all from your computer or print it all out in your home printer and

18
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.140
then the postman comes and takes it away.

19
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:14.100
He got out all that nonsense of going to the actual fucking post office and

20
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.000
waiting in line and then someone looking at you that does not want to see you

21
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:22.590
with a stupid box of shit that you have to weigh out and then send off to
people.

22
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.780
This is way easier.
And uh,
if you have a home business and,
um,
why wouldn't you,

23
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.270
that's probably a good thing to do in this day and age.

24
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.970
Figuring out a home business.
Get on stamps.com.

25

26
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.060
What also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o n n I t a human

27
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.750
optimization website.
Kathleen Madigan.

28
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.410
Do you ever take brain pills?
You no fuck around with that shit.

29
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.560
It don't do they work well?
It do make us smarter.

30
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:56.220
Fuck No.
Make it lift more.
Poo.

31
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.900
Pooed is a Russian and unit of weight.
Um,
uh,
they,

32
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:06.660
they basically enhance your brain's ability to produce neurotransmitters.

33
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.590
So all the,
uh,
the nutrients and building blocks for the key components of,

34
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.563
of thinking,

35
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.170
they've kind of broken down certain nutrients that can enhance mental clarity.

36
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:20.400
Some that actually boosts serotonin.

37
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.430
We sell this stuff called new mood in new mood is how five HTP and l tryptofan

38
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.760
supplement.
That's my favorite one.
It's great stuff.
And it,

39
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.480
what it does is it literally enhances your brain to produce happy chemicals.

40
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.920
Yeah.
Well I'm pretty happy person anyway,
but yes,
it definitely has an effect.

41
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.940
It's a legit scientific effect and the,

42
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.960
the combining of El Tryptophan and five HTP l Tryptofan converts in the body to

43
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:48.421
five HTP.

44
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:52.350
So it's sort of like a time released benefit of having the two of them mixed in

45
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:57.000
together.
Um,
these are one of those things though that you,
if you're on an Ssri,

46
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.380
you shouldn't take it.
So if you're on an antidepressant,

47
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:04.350
you shouldn't take it because a,
they both enhance,
um,
the,

48
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.500
your,
your levels of certain chemicals like dopamine.
So I don't,

49
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.450
I don't think you're supposed to take the two of them together.

50
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.090
So be careful of that because I know that,
um,
like our friend Neil Brennan,
he's,

51
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.700
he actually stopped taking five HTP because his doctor was telling him he's

52
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:23.510
taking like both an Ssri and five HTP.
You can overload.

53
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.610
Your brain is not,
it's not a happiness chemicals.
There's a balance man.

54
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.750
And when the balance goes to the wrong way,
it's not good with anything,
you know,

55
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.190
whether it's adrenaline or whatever it is that when the balance is off,

56
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.970
whacked out,
it's not good.

57
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.430
When's this essentially what happens to people when they get depressed?

58
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:40.061
For a lot of them,

59
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:43.990
at least chemicals in the first place is that the brain is not balanced
properly.

60
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:45.780
They're chemicals on a balanced.

61
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.710
So if you're thinking about taking anything like that new mood or even even

62
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:52.780
Alpha brain,
I would talk to a doctor,

63
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.180
but the doctor's is probably going to tell you.
And vitamins are all bullshit,

64
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.400
right?
Doctors,
you know what?

65
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.750
It's so shocking when you find out how little time in medical school doctors

66
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:05.230
actually have to devote to nutrition.
It's like,
it's nothing.

67
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.720
It's like a regular person,
you know,
reading a book.

68
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.890
It's really not that big a deal unless you specialized in nutrition or

69
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:16.570
biochemistry or absorption of vitamins.
And most doctors don't really the wells,

70
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:20.350
you know,
multivitamins not even necessarily eat healthy.

71
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:22.760
Well fuck eats healthy enough to not take a bite of it.

72
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:25.660
And that's what I want to know.
Who are you that eats so healthy?

73
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:28.480
You don't need multivitamins.
Shut the fuck up bitch.

74
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.980
Unless you're eating salads every goddamn meal and a big one at that and then

75
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:36.220
you're eating like really clean food,
you probably need to,

76
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:37.750
vitamins don't get sick.

77
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.090
<v 1>You know,
it's even crazier.</v>

78
00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:44.091
It's nowadays that people that buy reports from other people that companies

79
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.080
like,
uh,
like if you need a report on your thyroid and your,

80
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:50.670
you're going to school to become a doctor,

81
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.230
you pay $10 per page for this other guy to write the whole thing for you.

82
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.040
I met a guy who does it.
What are you saying?
Right.
The whole Wa like report.

83
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:00.210
Like if that homework,

84
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.270
so these doctors that are going to college and stuff that have to write all

85
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:05.190
these exams and reports and stuff like that,

86
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.580
they just pay people to pay people the right $10 a page.
That makes sense.

87
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.280
You're so swamped with work.
Yeah.

88
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.400
<v 0>When you're going through your residency.
I have had two friends,</v>

89
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.920
two close friends that went through their residency,

90
00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:21.070
one for ophthalmology and I forgot what my other friend was going on,
what,

91
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.070
what particular field of medicine,

92
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:28.071
but the amount of time that these guys have to spend studying is insane.

93
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.670
My friend junks sick went through medical school and then into residency and I

94
00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:36.360
watched the whole thing and it was,
it's not even humanly possible.

95
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.390
You're just basically stretching the body out to the point where just before it

96
00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:43.770
snaps and then you red line it like that.

97
00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:46.740
Every day these fucking people are working 16 hour days.

98
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.890
My friend Steve fell asleep on the toilet eating lunch and his pager went off in

99
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.590
that woke them up.
That's how tired he was and that's how little time he had.

100
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.870
He would regularly sleep an a night and then they're in the hospital in the

101
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:02.270
emergency room.
Man.
I mean,
people were coming in with,

102
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.680
people came in with gunshot wounds.
One guy had a light bulb stuffed up his ass.

103
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.131
I mean,

104
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:10.910
you're dealing with real shit and you have one hour sleep like four or five days

105
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:15.440
in a row.
You got to help the gunshot guy.
First Light Bulb,
man,

106
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.920
you made some choices.
Gunshots.
Probably safer wound is if it's a,

107
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.790
if it's somewhere in your calf or something,

108
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.580
Ass ass light bulb was one of the worst ones I've ever heard.

109
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.600
Anybody who's ever done a residency in an emergency room and tell you some cuff

110
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:34.310
fucking raising stories almost every day to yeah,
yeah,
it can happen.

111
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.930
Um,
so don't do that.
Instead,
go take some Alpha brain,

112
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.180
good for your brain.
Uh,
and we have the prime new primal kettle bells in as well.

113
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.540
Then the kettlebells with the,
um,
the ape designs in them,

114
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.680
and if you buy the orangutan,
we donate $5 the orangutans and new one.

115
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.060
It's a 54 pounds.

116
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.740
We donate $5 from every sale of the rank time,

117
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:59.840
one to a a.
Um,

118
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.820
it's a collective or something that helps save orangutans.

119
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.530
I don't really remember the exact name of it,

120
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:11.531
but I know it's all up on a on.com has o n n I t use the code named Rogan and

121
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:16.310
save 10% off any and all supplements.
I take them all,

122
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.910
it's all shit that I would use in real life and do yours.
So,
uh,

123
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.590
I stand behind it and you know what I stand behind Brian.
Oh than that.
Hmm.

124
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.680
You Q and a music bitch.
Kathleen Madigan is here.
I respect.

125
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.870
Okay.
Right now,
hold on.

126
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.213
They get new iPad.

127
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.320
<v 2>Joe Rogan planned obsolescence.
Try by day.</v>

128
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:43.830
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.
Brian is

129
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.960
<v 0>king of the grand conspirators when it comes to planned obsolescence for
laptops.</v>

130
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:50.920
Every time like a new operating system comes out,
they make your phone slow down.

131
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.540
You have to get a new phone.
You're the king of that.
Right?

132
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.190
You can really believe that they actually engineer that.

133
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.060
<v 1>Oh,
that's absent.
I think it's even been proven.
I mean it hasn't been.</v>

134
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.480
Can you have to also think that a lot of times when they make a phone it's four

135
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:06.160
one single,
the software's designed around one single graphic processor,

136
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.820
one single processor and blah blah blah.

137
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.770
So that every time they make a new one they have a different processor and they

138
00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:14.330
kind of backs,
you know,
engineer it to make it work a little bit with this.

139
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:17.160
But yeah,
it's all,
it's all reverse engineer.

140
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.970
<v 0>Well that's always been the argument about apple.</v>

141
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:22.240
Why apple is so good is because they make the hardware and they make the

142
00:08:22.241 --> 00:08:24.280
software that makes it,
two of them go together perfectly.

143
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:27.860
You don't have to worry about like the million different android type phones

144
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.570
that are made from Samsung and this guy and that guy.

145
00:08:30.571 --> 00:08:34.330
And I'm remember Motorola and it's not always,

146
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.810
it didn't always work perfectly because of that.
Same as like windows.

147
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:40.330
Computers got a bunch of different shit you got shoved in there.

148
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.090
It doesn't always work perfectly.

149
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.111
<v 1>Speaking of foot,</v>

150
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:48.930
I just found one of the greatest new tips that will help most iPhone users,

151
00:08:48.931 --> 00:08:50.110
specially females.

152
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.300
And it's when you plug it in and you're looking at your storage and your,

153
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.910
it says like you music,
uh,
whatever.

154
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.730
And then it has other and the others like a super big and we're like,

155
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:02.850
what's this other?
And it doesn't tell you what that means.

156
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.100
I found out that that is people's text messages,
like all the photos and videos.

157
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.000
Like if you don't delete your text messages and you have,

158
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:13.740
or you have that one where it's like you and one person had been talking for the

159
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.050
last year and a half but you've just never deleted it and started over.

160
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.440
That's just a saving all those old videos and photos that you've sent me.

161
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.340
Data.
Yeah.
So mine,
I just noticed that the other day was uh,

162
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.210
I think it was like 30 gigs of just other,
and I'm like,

163
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:28.380
what the fuck is this other?

164
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:31.860
And I just started deleting and just dump the whole thing.
Yeah,
you can't,

165
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.070
well you just have to go through each thread and just like swipe it to the
right.

166
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.310
Delete.
It's like you can just clear all maybe

167
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.100
let's see.
Edit.
Oh yeah.

168
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.360
You could just go down the list and hit the red dots.

169
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.320
Are those dots are all automatically?
No,

170
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.520
I mean like I could go through here and just like,
uh,
I don't know.

171
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.330
<v 0>Oh,
like you want to keep one?
Yeah.
Right,
right,
right.
Powerful.
Kathleen Madigan,</v>

172
00:09:55.331 --> 00:10:00.130
how do you do powerful,
but I just got a little lost in the beginning there.

173
00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:04.060
Are you saying if you get a new computer or your phone slows down?
Well,
no,
no,
no,

174
00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:07.810
no.
He's saying when the new operating systems come out in the new computers come

175
00:10:07.811 --> 00:10:12.670
out,
they,
they purposely engineer the new operating system to fuck with the older

176
00:10:12.671 --> 00:10:14.080
computers to make it slower.

177
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.030
<v 1>Meaning like,</v>

178
00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:19.870
like today apple just released a new software update for their iPhone.

179
00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:23.620
So you plug it into your computer,
you can update it to a brand new.
Uh,

180
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.890
it looks like all brand new operating says everything looks different now on

181
00:10:26.891 --> 00:10:27.724
your iPhone.

182
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.480
And people are already saying that it's just slowing their shit down and stuff

183
00:10:31.481 --> 00:10:34.420
like that because that means they want you to go,
oh yeah,

184
00:10:34.421 --> 00:10:39.190
my shit sucks now so I might by this new iPhone that's been programmed for this

185
00:10:39.191 --> 00:10:41.790
operating.
So it makes sense.
Here's why it makes sense.
Sounds.

186
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.230
<v 0>But it's also a double edged sword,
isn't it?
I mean I'm not afraid,</v>

187
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.980
I'm not a technology person,

188
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.450
but I would think that when you're using new hardware and new advanced stuff,

189
00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:53.900
you kind of have to engineer stuff for that new advanced hardware if you're

190
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:55.520
going to get the full benefits out of it.
Right.

191
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.580
Here's the new operating system that it looks like the old shit,

192
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.420
everything's bigger,
they can't see it.

193
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.760
So what's going on Kathleen Madigan now that you've heard phone one oh one I

194
00:11:07.761 --> 00:11:11.180
know it's a lot to,
you boys have a lot going on here with technology.

195
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.320
I have a giant Samsung that's basically,
those are dope.

196
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.040
That's the galaxy s four it's really pretty huge.

197
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.890
They're the best for like going online reading shit.

198
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.830
Like you don't actually read it.
It's huge.
It's our little law.

199
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.760
The note is the nuttiest one.
You've seen that one scene to know.

200
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.160
You know what's weird too is all the guys at the sprint store,
that young guys,

201
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.000
they have it of course,
but they're also gigantic.

202
00:11:34.001 --> 00:11:36.290
That in their pocket is like this in my pocket.

203
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.570
But that's pretty big in your pocket too.

204
00:11:38.571 --> 00:11:41.130
That's the thing about the iPhone without a case is absolutely perfect.

205
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:43.970
That should just slides in your pocket.
So perfect size.

206
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.760
Well the young people seem to like the note.

207
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.950
You know the young people love the big,

208
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.960
the big screen and now it does four k video.

209
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.250
It does this insanely high definition video

210
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.870
<v 3>right off the camera.
It does shed that.</v>

211
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:58.720
I found campus wouldn't think guys would want something that big in their pocket

212
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.840
trying to be sexy.
But guys,
we're just trying to,

213
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.640
I guess some room to fill.
We also get really,
uh,

214
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.110
guys get addicted to like gadgets that can do more.
It's a very strange thing.

215
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.030
We don't know why it is better than yours.

216
00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:15.880
Check what I can do and you can't do it.
There's definitely that,

217
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:19.090
but we always are thirsty for the new shit that will never even use,

218
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:21.370
like to just got an infrared on it.
You can change the channel.

219
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.530
You could change the channel with these things now.
So now,
oh,

220
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.580
get ready for this folks.
Every asshole at a bar,
it was going to think he's cute.

221
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.000
He's going to be changing the fucking channels on the TV over and over again.

222
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.910
You know football is going to be on and he's going to think it's cute to put on

223
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:37.510
Romper room cause that Shit's gonna happen.
It's gonna happen.

224
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.420
People are going to use like,
I am not interested.

225
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:44.350
I don't know anything this on does.
And not even the guy said,
no,

226
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:49.150
do you want me to give you a little lesson?
And I was like,
ah,
no.

227
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:53.500
I don't think Miguel,
who is 23 he liked me as a comedian.

228
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:56.170
You know me as a comedian,
but I don't think,
yeah,
you never know.

229
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.180
I called Miguel called me and it rang.
I go,
I'm good.

230
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.480
That's all I need to know.
It works.
It works.
It's a phone I could text.
Yeah.

231
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.960
Apparently it has super powers.
I'm not aware of it.
Do you ever use like apps,

232
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.250
like applications for stuff?
ESPN,
that's about it.
Oh,

233
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.360
you're a sports fan.
Felt well,
sadly I'm a rams fan.

234
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.040
I have no idea what that means.
It's a,
it's a bad pro hockey,
football,
football,

235
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:28.400
football.
They're not doing well.
Terrible.

236
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.820
Oh,
I watch football and the cardinals.
St Louis Cardinals.
Good.

237
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:38.440
I watch baseball and uh,
I don't know if I have any other apps.
Oh,

238
00:13:38.441 --> 00:13:42.450
around me.
Doesn't like comedy.
Central's comes central.
Have an APP.

239
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.640
Probably everyone should.
You do what?
You can do it around me.
Wait,

240
00:13:47.641 --> 00:13:52.060
is that one of the dating ones are just no rounds for like restaurants thing.

241
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.190
When you're on the road,
let's say you're in some town,

242
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.250
you know nothing about town.
Instead of actually having to speak to people.

243
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.151
If I'm in York,

244
00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:02.180
Pennsylvania and I hit Irish pub and you shake it like a magic eight ball and

245
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.820
see how I do this,
you shake it.
What's up?

246
00:14:04.821 --> 00:14:07.840
Sometimes it says you have to do it in a figure eight.
Oh,

247
00:14:07.841 --> 00:14:12.770
that's what the GPS will work somehow or another.
As crazy as I call it,

248
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.420
a phone would say that move your hand in the shape of a figure eight.
I'm like,

249
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:18.280
I'm just totally being punked by these people.

250
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.400
There's just some kid who put that in there so that people are walking around go

251
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:24.580
like this all day,
but I did it and it worked.
I'm like,
wow.

252
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.540
It really was still around me.
It's the greatest app for the road.

253
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.660
You can find anything,
anything.
It's pretty good.

254
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.200
It's pretty good like that to y'all.

255
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.530
It was nice too because you get to see the reviews.
I know,

256
00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:37.460
but people get too wordy and then,
I don't know.

257
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.850
I don't trust the reviews because one bad experience or maybe somebody just got

258
00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:45.340
to pull up their ass about a lot of people.

259
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.160
A lot of pull up their ass people.
Yup.

260
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.670
Is the camp that is like the Kingdom of the,
they live.

261
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:56.750
They live on Yelp and your shit on businesses.
How you go do that?
You know,

262
00:14:56.751 --> 00:14:58.790
I'm a Yelp gold member.
I,

263
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:03.680
I've got over 70,000 reviews.
That's a,

264
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.490
I don't think I have really any other apps that I use.
weather.com I'm that.

265
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.450
I'm just that Kiki.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's it.
Huh?
That's fine.
It's enough.

266
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.940
You use the web browser.
Do you get online with that thing?

267
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:18.260
It's a big giant ass screen.
Yup.
I can read anything.
Perfect.

268
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.250
Get your email and I have a mini iPad and they're like little tiny computers
now.

269
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.160
Yes.
It's going to be weird when they become a part of our bodies,

270
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.550
that Shit's going to happen.
It's going to happen nice and slow.

271
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.820
<v 4>This is us already in your email.
It's going to be in,</v>

272
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:32.690
you're going to see any of that

273
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.780
<v 3>right?
Walls or something?
Yeah.
I think it'll be on your wrist.
Like,
uh,</v>

274
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.140
like when you're born they'll just put your little TV in.

275
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.000
I think they're gonna be able to see it in your eyeballs.

276
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.180
I think they're going to have my goal.
That's what they're working on.

277
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.170
Like a contact lens.
How are you going to turn that off?

278
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.830
<v 5>Uh,
I guess I'll have to take it out.
You don't have to take the lens out.</v>

279
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.020
<v 4>Oh,
you put the Lens,
what I already have context.</v>

280
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:55.490
So I put it the lens over my lines.

281
00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.490
<v 5>Be a contact lens with some sort of Nano devices in it that will illuminate</v>

282
00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:03.520
things in front of your eyes and give you directions and show it to you.

283
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.160
Like it's a screen,
like a giant screen in front of you.

284
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:11.100
<v 4>I am already predicting so many.
Okay.
I can't see close up or far,</v>

285
00:16:11.101 --> 00:16:13.890
far away.
Like I just can't see it.
All right.

286
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.980
So if there's something this close that I'm supposed to read,

287
00:16:16.981 --> 00:16:20.190
I'd have to put my glasses on.
Well,

288
00:16:20.191 --> 00:16:23.040
there'll be the lead the lens that wouldn't work.
No,

289
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.500
I don't think this can work for people with bad vision.

290
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.640
<v 5>I bet.
I bet it Ken.
I bet they just adjust it to whatever your vision is,</v>

291
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.610
how bad they just make it so that you know,
like a contact lens on.
Yeah.

292
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.220
If it's a contact lens,

293
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:40.460
this is obviously me with zero science and no technical knowledge of we're

294
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.520
finding this is possible.

295
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:46.550
But I would imagine that you would be able to accurately,

296
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.010
uh,

297
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.790
imitate the same effect that you get them on a three dimensional movie screen,

298
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:55.790
which is flat as well.
I quite,
well why can't you do that in with,
uh,

299
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.800
with,
with the text and the images that you show?
And if that's the case,

300
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.330
why can't you tune it?

301
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.890
Like lasses why can't you tune it to where a person's vision would and wouldn't

302
00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:08.460
work?
It's a Lens,
you know,
I mean,
it's just like a contact lens.

303
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.770
<v 4>So you're saying you'd have to be fitted for your vision and then they would</v>

304
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:15.440
just put the thing on that,
right?

305
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.040
<v 5>Until they came up to you one day.
And then when Kathleen Madigan,</v>

306
00:17:18.041 --> 00:17:19.090
why keep fucking around with these?

307
00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:22.960
Realize we've got artificial eyes that works so much better.
So let's let late,

308
00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:27.670
let's scoop your eyeballs out and slamming these bad boys and they're awesome.

309
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:31.180
You'll be able to fucking see through walls and people think you're dope.

310
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.340
<v 4>Yeah.
Well,
I would do that.
I'm already planning on,
uh,
uh,
Mark Ridley,</v>

311
00:17:35.341 --> 00:17:37.980
the guy who owns the club in Detroit and he's owned it forever.

312
00:17:37.981 --> 00:17:42.981
His mom is 80 and had ocular implants and now she's a driver for all of our old

313
00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:48.230
people friends.
Cause now she has 20,
20 vision.
What is an ocular implant?

314
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.670
I really know except that they put new isen you'd have to Google it.

315
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.720
I don't know.
Google.
It's a surgery though for old people.
Two weeks.
That's all.

316
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:00.600
You're out of the game and then you're back in the game and she has perfect

317
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:02.580
vision.
It's crazy.

318
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.970
<v 6>Brian said just googling silly pictures.
Why don't you look up ocular implants?</v>

319
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.940
That's a,
that's what that robot,
I,
that's not real though.

320
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.190
That's just some goofy picture.
Ocular implants and popular science.
Yeah.

321
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.980
Electrodes.
Jesus Christ.
Future is here.

322
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.400
Electrodes in print and Clinton implanted in the retina.

323
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.420
Blind patients can read.
Wow.
Yeah.

324
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.350
That's insane.
That is insane.

325
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.700
What are you looking at?
And then there's another one.

326
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:40.110
There's another one that's working on a completely different,
um,
in a,

327
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:42.210
in a completely different area there,

328
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:46.280
but they have a different retinal implant that can lead blind people to,

329
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:51.340
to see and it's fractal shaped eye implants and they mimic neurons allowing

330
00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:57.570
blind people to see Jesus fucking Christ.
Who are these people?

331
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.510
It's working.
It's amazing.

332
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.330
<v 4>There's an 80 year old lady driving around Detroit at nighttime.</v>

333
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.910
<v 6>Man,
this is insane stuff.
I,
yeah,
I've,</v>

334
00:19:09.911 --> 00:19:12.250
I find it incredibly fascinating and I don't,

335
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.320
this is just the beginning of all this stuff.
They,

336
00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:16.960
they literally are going to have artificial bodies that work better than our

337
00:19:16.961 --> 00:19:19.800
body.
They're just going to have to figure out a way to get your brain into it.

338
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.280
<v 4>I saw that episode of your show where they're talking about it.</v>

339
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.360
It's all a little,
at some point though,
do you really want to be immortal?

340
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.070
<v 6>This sounds like the beginning of a superhero movie.
Why,
what do you know?</v>

341
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.790
<v 4>Do you really want to be a mortal?
Um,
that's a good question.
What happened?
Did I</v>

342
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.850
<v 6>the thing out?
Yeah.
You probably pop the court out.
Um,</v>

343
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.140
that question,
do you really want to be a moral?
It's a good question because no,

344
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.990
what if life is what life is not as good as what's next.

345
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.350
You know what if we leave life and there literally is another dimension where

346
00:19:55.351 --> 00:19:58.740
you're not contained by your ego and your body and your life experiences and

347
00:19:58.741 --> 00:19:59.280
your past.

348
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.720
<v 4>What if this just never ends?
I mean at some point sometimes I'm already bored.</v>

349
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.310
Really.
I mean,
what are we going to do when we're 511 I mean,
seriously,

350
00:20:08.311 --> 00:20:11.220
how many do we get to do tomorrow?
Isn't it the same thing?
No,

351
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.050
you don't look forward to tomorrow.
Yes,

352
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.510
but there's things tomorrow that I haven't done yet.

353
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.740
I think I'll be doing the same things over and over again.

354
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.270
Well then you would like it mortality,
Joe.
Just as you though,

355
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:27.300
not as something different.
Like you just get to live forever.
I

356
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:32.820
<v 6>thank that life today is filled with so many fascinating things that you can do.</v>

357
00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.020
So many fascinating things.

358
00:20:35.021 --> 00:20:38.800
You can learn so many fascinating things that you could experience and just read

359
00:20:38.801 --> 00:20:41.530
about and watch documentaries on.
I never get bored.

360
00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:44.050
I don't think you can get boards today fee for me,

361
00:20:44.051 --> 00:20:45.610
I feel like if you're bored today,

362
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.040
it's because you're trying to be bored because if you

363
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.000
<v 3>really pay attention,</v>

364
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:52.300
there's so much cool and interesting shit out there and I see a lot going on.

365
00:20:52.301 --> 00:20:55.300
I would just say fine enough tire.
It's wise.
I can't find enough time.

366
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.800
I can't find enough time to do the things I love.
I would like,

367
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.240
I would like a million more lives of these people who sleeps five hours.

368
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.640
I sleep when I have to sleep.
You know,

369
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.650
I sleep like I tried to sleep eight hours a day.

370
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.050
You shouldn't really fuck around with your body like that.

371
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:11.410
I think when I would be the first one to sign up for 10 hours,
I have not.

372
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.440
But the people that really love life seem to sleep a lot less than I do.

373
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.050
I don't know about that.
I just,
I think they're silly.
You,
you really should.

374
00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.930
Sleeping is one of the most important things a person can do.

375
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.900
You can live your life on like four and five hours sleep at night,

376
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.500
but you're not optimum.
You're just not,
you're not going to be optimum.

377
00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:32.230
You're not going to feel optimum.
You're not going to perform optimum.

378
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.770
It's the Bill Clintons.
I mean,
he did it.
That was his big thing.

379
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.470
Swarts and I here too.
He does it to really,
yeah.

380
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.000
Well he certainly does get a lot done in a day.
Good for you.

381
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:46.870
Aren't all of that.
Thank you.
I think that,
um,
it's,

382
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.950
it really important to get at least six.
I think when you get,
you know,

383
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.490
stress and exercise and whatever you're doing during the day,

384
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:57.610
your body needs to decompress and then it needs to recharge.

385
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.350
But there's also a joy and sleeping.

386
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:03.060
I don't know why people don't understand the pleasure of deep sleep.
Hmm.

387
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.740
The pleasure.
Certainly when you get up and you're like,
oh,
that was so good.

388
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.570
I slept so good.
I don't know

389
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.570
really smart people like Bill Clinton,
you know,
Rhodes scholar,

390
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.730
a guy,
and it's five hours and I think I'm just,
I'm not that motivated.

391
00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.270
I think everybody's the same though.
You know,
I think some people,

392
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:25.270
five hours is good.
I think everybody's body is different.

393
00:22:25.271 --> 00:22:28.600
Just I know for me I need eight hours.
If I don't get eight hours,
I feel stupid.

394
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.970
What did you have your brain pills that helps health?
These are really good.

395
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.350
<v 0>If I,</v>

396
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.940
if I'm jet lagged or if I'm traveling somewhere and I'm only getting a few hours

397
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:39.250
sleep,

398
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.330
I have to do something where I have to use my brain like a show sometimes that

399
00:22:42.331 --> 00:22:43.160
difficult.
Yeah.

400
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.850
<v 3>You're flying somewhere.
You leave early in the morning,</v>

401
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.210
flying someone there and you go like right on stage.
Yeah.

402
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.940
<v 0>Yeah.
But uh,
I'll balance it out before,</v>

403
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.380
make sure the night before I got some sleep.
Shit's important.
Counseling Madigan,

404
00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.000
<v 3>my mortality I have,
he's not buying it.
I have to get eight or more.</v>

405
00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:03.040
I don't know how you guys do it.
Less than an eight.
Mm.
That's hard.

406
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.940
10 is what a hand is what I,
yeah,
that's a good number right there.

407
00:23:05.941 --> 00:23:07.350
I love second in line.
Yeah.

408
00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.060
<v 0>Then yeah,
I just feel like better.</v>

409
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.290
It's like everything got done in the night that needed to get done.
You know,

410
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.690
even problems,
even things that are bugging you,

411
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.950
it's amazing how you just sleep on them and you wake up in the lane.

412
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.070
<v 3>The answer comes clear in the dream or,
yeah.</v>

413
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.070
Well that's one of the reasons

414
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.710
<v 0>is that they think you're taking a psychedelic trip when you're,
uh,</v>

415
00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.070
when you're dreaming dream chemicals,

416
00:23:33.071 --> 00:23:37.030
like the chemicals associated with dreaming really very similar to chemicals

417
00:23:37.031 --> 00:23:39.460
associated with a psychedelic plants.

418
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.380
<v 3>I wonder,
uh,</v>

419
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:46.070
if you use nicotine patches and you keep them on at your dreams,

420
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.920
<v 4>go like into hyperdrive sanity talked about this before,
but I think,</v>

421
00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.890
yeah,
that's right.
I used to do it.
Yeah.
To dream more.
Well,
yeah.
Oh yeah.

422
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:58.250
It'll take you on a ride like no other.
I mean it,

423
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.010
but it's almost like if you're saying all those chemicals are there from a
dream,

424
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.280
the nicotine just fast forwards it faster and then adds more.

425
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:12.410
<v 1>It keeps you in nicotine receptors,
uh,
awake.
So when it happens is,</v>

426
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:15.460
is that you're dreaming while things are on that are supposed to be turned off.

427
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.830
It's fucked up.
Yeah.

428
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.790
But it's really everybody should put on a patch once and go to sleep.

429
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.130
Get the little,
actually they actually,
yeah,

430
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.680
I was going say did they actually say don't do it?
Cause it's like,

431
00:24:26.681 --> 00:24:29.350
I guess there's probably something that's bad for you that you can like get

432
00:24:29.351 --> 00:24:32.140
really seriously injured doing that.
Like oh wow.
Yeah.

433
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.700
Flailing around or something like that.
So I recommend just like,

434
00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.930
like a half or a quarter even.
I don't recommend it at all.

435
00:24:40.931 --> 00:24:43.800
But like if you're going to do it,
don't use a full pout.

436
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.040
Definitely don't use a for you.
Do you,
have you ever done a full patch?
All right.

437
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:46.790
Yeah,
but the,

438
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:50.740
I have had the patch on the whole day from having it on and I just fell asleep.

439
00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:51.620
Delete.
Yes.

440
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.440
<v 4>Well it's if you put them on late night shows to bedtime.
Yeah.</v>

441
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.680
So I,
I had like,

442
00:24:59.681 --> 00:25:02.920
this is a kind of dumb ass dream.
The nicotine,

443
00:25:02.921 --> 00:25:06.190
there was like a rap competition and I was forced to enter,

444
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:11.710
but you had to stutter and I ended up winning the gold medal for my song.

445
00:25:11.711 --> 00:25:14.710
I always remember a song at all.
Well,
I don't remember my song,

446
00:25:14.711 --> 00:25:19.400
but my character was,
I was cheesy,
e e,

447
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:24.580
z and then the whole crowd would go easy,
but I'd make them,
I make a wait for it.

448
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.000
Then I'd change it up.
I go cheesy.
He,
they never knew when it was coming

449
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.880
in my dream I was with Louis Black and I made them go downtown to a,

450
00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.870
I had to go pick up my gold medal.
It was a tough post office downtown La.

451
00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.740
I was like,
I've never been to the post office,
but this is the nicotine.

452
00:25:41.741 --> 00:25:46.450
Like he just,
how vivid was it?
Oh,
I can't even describe the metal.

453
00:25:46.451 --> 00:25:50.320
And it came in like this crossed I box.
I'm like,
this is kind of religiously odd.

454
00:25:50.321 --> 00:25:52.450
Why are they,
is the Olympics getting into religion?

455
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.480
<v 1>And it also makes it makes your dreams like a,
like an action movie.
Like,
like,</v>

456
00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.750
like everything's really like,
well,
like the story's really good and

457
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:03.780
very clear.
All of the stuff.
Yeah.

458
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.070
<v 4>In real life that I'm capable of injuries.
I don't mean physically,</v>

459
00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:09.170
I mean to think of those things.
I was never thinking

460
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.980
<v 5>Stephen King credits nicotine with having a really strong effect on his</v>

461
00:26:13.981 --> 00:26:16.920
creativity and his a nerd,
you know,

462
00:26:16.921 --> 00:26:20.010
neurons firing synapses firing because he said,
oh no,

463
00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:23.280
he quit and he said it had a big change and you said,
uh,
yeah,

464
00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:25.230
I said it was a lot harder after that.

465
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.050
<v 4>The doctor will tell you that.
I said,
how long can I chew that gum forever?</v>

466
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.670
Like I had a coach you in the Como cause it was pulling my crowns out.
Whoa.

467
00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:38.990
It gets really hard after like 20 minutes.
But if you're a nicotine freak,

468
00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:40.130
you're still chomping on it.

469
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.860
And then Mark Marin just keeps rotating them bitches with heartburn

470
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.630
<v 3>retail.
It's me,
mark and Greg,</v>

471
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.750
<v 4>uh,
uh,
Canada hots,
Jeremy Hotz.</v>

472
00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.050
<v 3>It's so,
it's always sounds the canary in the coal mine.</v>

473
00:26:51.051 --> 00:26:53.900
Who's the one that you guys watch?
It's like totally out of control.

474
00:26:53.901 --> 00:26:55.010
Is it mark or is it Jeremy?

475
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:55.441
<v 4>Well,</v>

476
00:26:55.441 --> 00:27:00.441
actually it's a Gregg Rogell Gregg Rogell with all out of the four of us.

477
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.800
I know,
I know.
Wherever I see that man anywhere on the planet at,

478
00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:07.500
I threw him to the ground.
He has nicotine products on him somewhere.

479
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:11.220
I couldn't stay on.
It's either in his pockets or his back.
It's the way

480
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.260
<v 3>I was flipping through the channels and a,
I saw him on one of those,
uh,</v>

481
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:20.010
access TV live from Gotham things.
Yeah,
it was hilarious.
It's very funny.

482
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.910
<v 4>His dear Saint [inaudible],
it's dues deuce.</v>

483
00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:27.340
It's a homage to letter is one of the funniest.
He won't do it hardly anymore,

484
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.860
but I begged them to do it at Macho.

485
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:30.250
<v 3>He's one of those guys where I'm like,</v>

486
00:27:30.251 --> 00:27:33.910
how come people don't know who that guy is?
I don't know.
I couldn't agree more.

487
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.710
I see him when I go on national star.
He's hilarious.
And yet,
I don't know,

488
00:27:38.711 --> 00:27:41.250
maybe I don't even know if he's doing it anymore.
Yeah.

489
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.470
While he was doing this access TV thing was really recent.
Well,

490
00:27:44.471 --> 00:27:46.930
I also think he's not a big traveler.
Oh,
okay.

491
00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:49.450
So he just likes to work in New York.
He's in the city a lot.
I don't,

492
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.710
does he have a regular job?

493
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:55.010
<v 4>I don't know.
It's one of those guys.
I don't know.
He's,
he's kind of neurotic.</v>

494
00:27:55.011 --> 00:27:57.410
The conversations with Greg I have are usually about

495
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.900
the nicotine or art.
Just nothing.

496
00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.970
<v 3>Just nicotine or we don't talk.
It's like,
I dunno.
He's hard to reach.</v>

497
00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.170
He's not casual.
That's funny.
Intense.
Well,
he lives in New York,
right?

498
00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.870
Yeah,
but I bet you if you looked online,
he doesn't have a,

499
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.000
I don't even know if he would have got a Wikipedia.
Does he?
Yep.

500
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.810
Professional comedian resides in New York City,

501
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.170
has appeared on the tonight show late night with Conan O'brien and the nanny.

502
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.710
He has had his own half hour special on comedy central and it was a feature

503
00:28:26.711 --> 00:28:28.300
performer in the movie,
the aristocrats.

504
00:28:28.301 --> 00:28:31.850
He's a regular performer at New York City's comedy cellar.
There you go.

505
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.620
[inaudible] powerful Gregg Gal.
I just want to say hi buddy.
Yeah,

506
00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:39.150
I haven't seen you in awhile.
Come on out.
Gray.
Come out play region.

507
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.970
This the letter.
I'm going to read your Sandal.
Yeah,
he's a nice guy too.
Yeah.

508
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:48.040
Well we,
you did a,
you did last comic standing.
Yeah.
It was torture.

509
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.960
Yeah.
Who won that season?
Did you win?
No.
Have Fun.
Jeff.
Ron.
Yes.
Season two.
Yeah.

510
00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.460
That was the one of the best seasons

511
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.280
<v 4>I thought.
I really thought it was the best.</v>

512
00:28:56.281 --> 00:29:00.330
Not just cause I was on it cause the first season like a lot of comics didn't

513
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.660
try know everybody wanted to see what is it and they had,

514
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.820
they had some good people.
Uh,

515
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:10.440
then the second one and then the third one they just proceeded to ruin it and

516
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:11.940
then it just kept getting worse.
I'm like,

517
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.290
how could you take a show that has 13 million people in the summer,

518
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.670
the 13 million people and single handedly destroyed and they uh,

519
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:22.530
I mean it was working perfectly.

520
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.880
There's no reason that the comedians have to be hot.
They don't have to be young.

521
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.260
This is crazy.
It's comedy.
They should,
they just went so far off the rails.

522
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.870
I really think if somebody brought that back in the right way,

523
00:29:33.871 --> 00:29:37.140
like you were saying,
it could be fixed.
There is no comedy in prime time.

524
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.120
<v 3>Well I think we had the,
I don't think that's the move to bring that thing back.</v>

525
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.040
Well not that,
but us.
Something like that where you're doing comedy,
right.

526
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:46.930
Kill Tony.
Why think that

527
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.810
<v 5>the move would be to have,
uh,
some sort of a reality show with comedians.
Some,</v>

528
00:29:51.811 --> 00:29:53.560
some sort of an organized reality show.

529
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.940
What a bunch of funny people doing funny things so we could,

530
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.430
it can really be easily done when you just follow them around doing things

531
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:01.031
during the day.

532
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:04.570
You could have a funny show if you just figured out the right things for them to

533
00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:06.370
participate in.
Get Joey Diaz,

534
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:08.410
Dunkin trusts on Arusha fear and send them to the race track.

535
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.980
<v 3>You gotta find your show.
You gotta show it does.
You don't need a goddamn script.</v>

536
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.740
I'd like to go with it and just start gambling the gambling people.
I want to go,

537
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:19.060
I mean,
that's a fucking show real easy.
That's a hit show.

538
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.000
And that show could be fucking hilarious if they would actually just let it

539
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:24.580
happen.
You know,
like,
just film it for a day.

540
00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.480
It's going to be better than anything you write out and pretend you're working

541
00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:32.320
in an office stop.
Yeah,
let's let us really gamble.
Let us,
you know,

542
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.480
let me and Lou and Ron White go golfing.

543
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:38.200
The good shit about that show was the comedians interacting with each other.

544
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:39.820
I mean,
that was like the best,

545
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.470
which was weird too because I thought that was another way they ruined it.

546
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:49.240
Like half those guys I already knew and liked.
I'm friends with Todd glass,

547
00:30:49.241 --> 00:30:52.120
like these are my friends,
and they just kept saying,
well,

548
00:30:52.121 --> 00:30:54.160
we need there to be drama and we need as well.

549
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.320
I'm not going to fight with people just to amuse you.

550
00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:59.590
I'm not going to pick a fight with Todd.
Although Todd's such a good actor,

551
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:03.130
we could've pulled it off it to go,
okay,
but I go,
you have a tad,

552
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.140
then I'm going to look like this crazy bitch to America and I'm not so I'm not

553
00:31:08.141 --> 00:31:09.370
going to,
it's not worth it.

554
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.860
It's not worth not for one episode two then that gets stuck in it,
you know?
No,

555
00:31:13.861 --> 00:31:16.060
no,
no.
Not only that,
they don't give a fuck about you.

556
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:19.150
They will use you as a pawn to do this.

557
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:22.090
And they proved they didn't give a fuck about people the way they handle that

558
00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:25.180
show in the first place where they didn't really let the comedians pick who the

559
00:31:25.181 --> 00:31:27.300
performers were that actually made it through.
Right.

560
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.330
That's why I thought I'll never judge again.
Yeah,
I did as well.
It was a fake,

561
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.920
it was a fake judging and that's when,
uh,
Brett Butler and drew Carey walked off.

562
00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.130
Oh yeah,
I remember that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we're like,
this is fake.
Like you're not,

563
00:31:39.131 --> 00:31:42.040
we're not really judging you pretending we're judging there.
I mean,

564
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:44.380
we shouldn't even get into what was wrong with that show because there was so

565
00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:47.350
much wrong with that show.
We could easily,
like,
you know,

566
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:49.810
there was a lot of issues.
Well,
here was my biggest issue.

567
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:54.760
Me and John have friends,
biggest issue,
no alcohol.
And that's hilarious.
No,

568
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.030
every other show I've ever seen.
Uh,
the Beverly housewives,

569
00:31:58.031 --> 00:32:01.690
everybody's slamming drinks.
Yeah,
you get a good show and Martinis.

570
00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:06.070
And so one of,
finally,
John and I complained enough.
I said,

571
00:32:06.071 --> 00:32:10.030
first of all,
it was never in the contract that there would be no alcohol here.

572
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:14.380
You didn't tell me that.
Oh,
so it was not allowed.
No,
it was not on the property.

573
00:32:14.381 --> 00:32:18.580
We had to live in this house for a month.
Comics,
but no alcohol.
That's so stupid.

574
00:32:18.581 --> 00:32:21.490
Yeah.
And I don't even know about the pot people on that pop person.

575
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:23.770
So I don't know if they brought pot.

576
00:32:23.771 --> 00:32:25.570
They probably brought it in their suitcase or something.

577
00:32:25.571 --> 00:32:30.410
But had I been told I would have brought a case of wine or me and John would

578
00:32:30.411 --> 00:32:34.960
have gotten a keg of something.
And so they brought in a six pack and they said,

579
00:32:34.961 --> 00:32:39.920
fine,
you guys have bitched so much.
And with John to,

580
00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:40.100
I

581
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.340
<v 4>had one,
so there were three left,
woke up in the morning and they took him.</v>

582
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:48.110
I'm like,
you can't even leave.
I was so excited.
The next day I'm like,

583
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.560
I'm going to have a beer by the fire.
I'm going to go get a beer.

584
00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:55.550
I'm going to sit there and drink a beer and I go in the fridge.
I'm like,
fine.

585
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.533
They took.

586
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.991
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

587
00:32:56.991 --> 00:33:00.860
That's a big problem in those shows is these ideas that these producers have

588
00:33:00.861 --> 00:33:05.861
stuck in their head about how a show has to be and they just to get the best out

589
00:33:07.041 --> 00:33:09.740
of people's personalities that are already performers.
You don't have to,

590
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.160
you'd have to arrange fake shit.
You don't have to,
you know,

591
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.690
just let them blow him,
do things.

592
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.330
<v 4>That was the problem with,
uh,</v>

593
00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:20.530
Lou had that show root of all evil on comedy central and we had the greatest

594
00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:24.460
people,
uh,
Andy Kindler,
Greg Geraldo,
like you know,

595
00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:29.020
all these guys that are super smart,
super funny,
and they just kept saying,

596
00:33:29.021 --> 00:33:32.530
what has to be more scripted?
It has to be more scripted.
And why,
why,

597
00:33:32.531 --> 00:33:37.330
why wouldn't you want Andy to just go off?
Like you had to say who is more evil?

598
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:41.450
<v 5>Well,
they all have an idea in their head that's ancient there.</v>

599
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:42.540
The idea in their head is it,

600
00:33:42.541 --> 00:33:45.780
everything is scripted and you have to make sure that you control what the

601
00:33:45.781 --> 00:33:49.350
content is.
He can't just let it be entertaining or not be entertaining.

602
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:54.380
<v 4>That's why.
That's why I just,
I just sold my special to Netflix.</v>

603
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.460
I will never,
talking to the networks is like talking your grandparents.

604
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.010
Really?
It is it.
Netflix is like,

605
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:03.740
you're cool young neighbor who knows all kinds of secret things you don't know

606
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:07.100
about.
There's super hip and you want to,
Eh,
keep asking him.

607
00:34:07.101 --> 00:34:07.820
But I'm going to be like,

608
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.060
I'm bothering him and I'm crazy old lady in the neighborhood and Netflix,

609
00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:15.680
they don't care.
I said,
is there any rules now?
Just go to your special,
here's a,

610
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.390
here's a boatload of money.

611
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:21.770
<v 5>Yeah.
I did my first special with them and will not my first,
but my first DVD,</v>

612
00:34:21.771 --> 00:34:25.850
like 2005,
six not my first.
I had one before that,

613
00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:26.990
but this was a better one,

614
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:31.760
2005 I did it with them and then sold to showtime.
Yeah,
they were awesome.

615
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:36.740
<v 4>No problems.
Nobody calls.
There are very,
uh,
uh,
modern,</v>

616
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.570
you know,
like showtime.
Okay.

617
00:34:38.571 --> 00:34:42.560
So Kathleen know we're going to air your special on September 30th,
nine o'clock.

618
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:44.060
That's a premiere date.
Okay,
great.

619
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.550
And then how many times you're going to show it after that?
Uh,

620
00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:50.330
we don't know what time would that be on a,
if you do,
I can't tell you.

621
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.160
If you find out,
we let me know.
No.
Okay.
Well you know what good is this?

622
00:34:55.161 --> 00:34:58.670
I can't even tell anybody.
Netflix.
You just say,
Hey,
it's always on,

623
00:34:58.671 --> 00:35:03.320
but the arrogance of the networks is what is going to kill them.

624
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:07.460
It's like,
do you understand that on a Netflix?

625
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:11.150
I can just turn on anything what I want it do you guys get that?

626
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:15.020
Like they don't,
they don't know the arrogance.

627
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.520
<v 5>Assume that what they have is so special.
So CBS,</v>

628
00:35:20.521 --> 00:35:24.090
NBC,
Fox,
whatever.
They assume what they have is so special.

629
00:35:24.091 --> 00:35:26.460
You're not going to duplicate that online,

630
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.820
but you're going to do a lot better than that online,
believe it or not,

631
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.970
way better.
Pretty soon

632
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.020
<v 4>in anybody that is store that checks me out.
That's under the age of 30.
I go.</v>

633
00:35:34.021 --> 00:35:38.270
Do you have a TV?
No.
Have Tvs.
Yeah.

634
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.370
A lot of people these days know they go home and watch iPad cables,

635
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:45.720
experimental it.
Six months is over $70 a month or whatever.
Why would they?

636
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:49.560
They've gay get Hulu.
Netflix,
what else do you need on your iTunes?

637
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:54.150
Go download whatever you want.
It's like,
but it's as if the networks,
the big,

638
00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:57.750
not showtime and Hbo as much,
but the CBS,
NBC,

639
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:02.100
they don't even know any of this exist.
Yeah,
that's how they speak in a meeting.

640
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:06.480
It's like you'd have to tell them,
well do you understand that on this channel?

641
00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:09.570
Comedians can just do whatever they want.
No,
no.

642
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.950
<v 6>Well they're starting to realize it.</v>

643
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.860
They're starting to slowly realize that they're starting to wake up to Internet

644
00:36:14.861 --> 00:36:16.720
content.
When when it starts like this,

645
00:36:16.721 --> 00:36:20.010
see some of these youtube channels that people just create and then they see,

646
00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.890
oh my goodness guys,

647
00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:25.890
channel is 60 million people that have tuned into him just talking about shit

648
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:30.820
and you're like fuck.
And then you start doing,
they start realizing like,

649
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.380
oh wait,
what are we doing?

650
00:36:32.381 --> 00:36:36.880
Like putting on these elaborate sets and like there's a lot of entertaining shit

651
00:36:36.881 --> 00:36:40.720
that you're not even attempting because you have this rigid idea in your head of

652
00:36:40.721 --> 00:36:41.090
what a,

653
00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.480
<v 4>a rigid old idea,
dumb old formula.</v>

654
00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.770
And like the USA Today the other day had all the new sitcoms coming out.

655
00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.820
Bobo boom.
I mean it looked like a racing form and I thought,
you know,

656
00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.700
90% of these won't make it.

657
00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.680
You might as well just write garbage.
Uh,
monkey crab.

658
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.900
He Schmincke hot because none of this matters.

659
00:37:02.901 --> 00:37:07.400
It won't be here cause it's all half of it.
At least half is total shit.

660
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:10.880
Yeah.
And then the stuff that isn't just total garbage,

661
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:13.940
what do you keep it a year or two?

662
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.540
<v 6>It's fucking hard to put together a TV show.
Yeah,
it's fucking hard.</v>

663
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.510
And there's a lot of people involved.
You know,

664
00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.220
you're going to have to have a bunch of different people.
Satisfied.

665
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:25.390
<v 4>Too many people.
That's why the Sitcom thing,</v>

666
00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:29.320
like when I see younger comics and that's what they want to do,
I'm like,
wow,

667
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:33.730
good news is you're young and if you want to spend a lifetime fighting with

668
00:37:33.731 --> 00:37:38.050
these people too,
to get a TV show on,
but then even if you get it on,

669
00:37:38.051 --> 00:37:38.980
it's gotta be a hit.

670
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.560
<v 6>I did it and um,
I have never attempted it again.
I was like,</v>

671
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.230
this is just a brutal,
it's just brutal.

672
00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:51.160
Like we got it to a point where it was easy,
like news radio started out,

673
00:37:51.161 --> 00:37:54.850
you know,
really long hours and took a while for the show to find its place.

674
00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:56.320
But then once it got going,

675
00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:58.990
we would only work sometimes two days a week or three days a week.

676
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.860
Like we would show up and do a run through on Friday or whenever the day before

677
00:38:02.861 --> 00:38:06.220
we shot was,
we'd get the script then like that script problems,

678
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.580
like we would miss several days of rehearsal.
We just wouldn't do it.

679
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:13.040
He would get there and then we would figure it out within a day.
Fine.
Yeah,

680
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.490
it should be fine because we had it down to,

681
00:38:15.491 --> 00:38:20.450
it would is a smooth oiled machine by then,
but in the beginning it's brutal.

682
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.730
The beginnings are horrible.

683
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:25.050
<v 4>Just too many people.
Even at,
even at comedy central,</v>

684
00:38:25.051 --> 00:38:28.590
I remember I had written all this stuff and one of the executive ladies came

685
00:38:28.591 --> 00:38:32.530
over and said,
I'll do take off.
Instead of saying gymnast Hera,

686
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.370
be Funnier if you said,
I don't know.

687
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:38.810
She threw out a word like giraffe or something.
And I go,
oh no,

688
00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.660
uh,
I don't.
And she's like,
okay.
I go,
I'll do it if you want.

689
00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.690
I'm tired of fighting.
I'm completely,
you've worn me down.
You,

690
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:49.360
when you want me to say Giraffe,
I'll say it,
but it's going to suck.

691
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.420
It's up to you.
They'll get upset too if you're not healthy,
you know,

692
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:57.220
meet us halfway here.
Okay.
How about draft gymnast?
How about gymnast?

693
00:38:57.221 --> 00:38:58.960
Giraffe?
You can't even just throw it in there.

694
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.480
<v 6>One of the arguments Doug and I had,</v>

695
00:39:00.481 --> 00:39:04.740
we were doing the man show is there was a show that we created called make me

696
00:39:04.741 --> 00:39:08.460
hard.
And the show was,
you,
uh,
have a,

697
00:39:08.461 --> 00:39:11.820
a box over a penis with a light bulb that goes off when you,

698
00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.590
and it reads reason erection.
Obviously we control the light bulb.

699
00:39:14.591 --> 00:39:16.710
So it's like Maajid Banana,
bananas,

700
00:39:16.711 --> 00:39:20.760
things along those lines gives you these incredible boners.
And um,
they didn't,

701
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:24.720
they had no problem with,
we had a trainee,
uh,
I should say transgender,
excuse me,

702
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:29.470
partying.
My trainee friends,
they get upset with that word.
Um,
and the,
the,

703
00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.940
the Gig was that this guy had this box on his penis.

704
00:39:32.941 --> 00:39:34.800
Let's see what really gets them hard.
Um,

705
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.740
we had to all these hot girls in front of him dancing,
nothing.

706
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:42.120
And this other hot girl comes over and he starts sucking lip cream off our

707
00:39:42.121 --> 00:39:44.430
breasts.
Like everybody's going crazy.

708
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:49.730
Then she pulls her pants off Chesapeake Ines and everybody goes fucking bananas.

709
00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:54.270
Like it's the like the loudest,
oh my.
Ah,

710
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.820
you've ever heard from 200 audience members?

711
00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:01.450
They didn't have any problem with that,
but the word hard is just too much.
Well,

712
00:40:01.451 --> 00:40:05.420
yeah,
they wanted it to be called make me stiff and you know,
so we're in the art.

713
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.340
We were in this argument and Doug and I are just sitting there going,

714
00:40:08.341 --> 00:40:09.990
I don't even understand what you're saying here.

715
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.200
You're saying that we can have a transgender person whipped their Rivard cock

716
00:40:15.841 --> 00:40:16.621
out.
I mean,

717
00:40:16.621 --> 00:40:20.820
it was a cock that had been suffered three years of a female hormones.

718
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:25.440
So this cog was just barely,
and it was,
it was,
it was a sad,
sad cock.

719
00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:29.700
That's okay,
but you can't say hard like you're,

720
00:40:29.701 --> 00:40:34.080
you're allowing this guy to unknowingly suck whipped cream off a man's tits.

721
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.740
He doesn't even know.
And everybody's okay with that.

722
00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:41.130
Then he whips out his penis and then you're okay with that too.

723
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:45.360
This guy's going to be humiliated by this,
I'm sure.
Or you know,
he obviously,

724
00:40:45.361 --> 00:40:48.900
he was a good sport.
He thought it was hilarious,
but that's okay.

725
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:54.130
<v 4>It's a long time ago.
I want to,
I did the tonight show at one of the,</v>

726
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.540
one of the sets on there,

727
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:59.290
and I had a joke with a setup was kids are like homeless people.
And they go,

728
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.760
could you,
uh,
could you not say homeless people?
I go,

729
00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.320
the jokes not about homeless.
People listen to the joke,
it's about kids and,

730
00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:11.020
and they go,
ah,
maybe just say,
ah,
a Hobo.
I go,
well,
here,

731
00:41:11.021 --> 00:41:13.510
it's a problem.
I'm not a comic from the 18 hundreds.

732
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:19.720
Fucking Hobo Volvo.
Then they came back.
Hobos a great word.
I love Hobo.

733
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:23.830
It just didn't fit.
And then,
then they came back with why no,
I go,

734
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:28.420
so it's okay to make fun alcoholics,
but homeless people,

735
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:33.190
they are homeless that I'm not judging,
right.
It's what they are.

736
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:38.070
I just a fine,
what's the context?
How's the rest of the big,
uh,
it was to,

737
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.760
don't judge who was a long,
long time ago.
I don't,
kids are like,
ah,

738
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.430
I don't have kids.
My sister's got kids.
If they're not yours,

739
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:46.310
you realize what kids really are.
A dark,
dark,
tiny homeless people.

740
00:41:46.311 --> 00:41:48.800
There's chase you around the house,
all the land going,
hey,
can I have a dollar?

741
00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.860
Hey food,
I'm missing a shoe and I need a ride.
Hey,
can I have a ride?
Okay.

742
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.400
It's silly.
It's stupid.
And that's where they,

743
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:58.880
they just lost their mind over the word homeless.
Well then,

744
00:41:58.881 --> 00:42:00.740
because I then I said,
uh,

745
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.590
I always give homeless people money and maybe you shouldn't.
My brother goes,

746
00:42:03.591 --> 00:42:06.050
don't,
he's just going to go buy more alcohol and cigarettes.
And I go,
oh,

747
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:10.700
like I wasn't,
so I'm bringing,
it's still back to me.
So making fun of me,

748
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:14.930
right.
I go,
so what am I supposed to say?
Don't give that wine.
Oh,
money.

749
00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:19.790
Yeah.
Why?
You know a Hobo?
I'm sorry,

750
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:21.680
I don't have any material about riding the rails.

751
00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:22.331
<v 5>Well,
Kathleen,</v>

752
00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:26.140
we've done some poles and people are very uncomfortable with the word homeless.

753
00:42:26.141 --> 00:42:28.690
Yeah,
I guess so.
Yeah.
It's not funny.
Okay.

754
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:32.080
The are victims involved here and it's not funny,
but fuck wine.
Okay.

755
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.840
<v 4>It's a societal problem that we're trying to work through and we those mocking</v>

756
00:42:35.841 --> 00:42:36.674
it.
Yes.

757
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.340
<v 5>Why knows like the softest version of alcoholic too?</v>

758
00:42:40.341 --> 00:42:41.760
It's like they're not even drinking whiskey.

759
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:43.420
<v 4>No,
it's fine.
Wine.
Okay.</v>

760
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.660
<v 5>Someone has a great taste for wine.
It got a little out of hand</v>

761
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:51.110
<v 4>and had him Hawaii.
No.
Too many bottles a night.
It was fine when it was a glass</v>

762
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:55.300
<v 5>somewhere along the line.
Assad pleasure in that bottle.</v>

763
00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.250
I sought freedom and release Nama.
Why?
No.
Hm.

764
00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:01.770
<v 4>Yeah,
I think,
well also I said,
you know,
Hobo,</v>

765
00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:05.100
was it a life choice?
Yes.

766
00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:09.810
There were people that just chose to ride the rails.
Maybe they like to travel.

767
00:43:09.811 --> 00:43:10.860
I don't know why they did it,

768
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.640
<v 5>but was it depression too?</v>

769
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:16.480
I think there's a great book that I read about a guy named,
it was,

770
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:20.140
I think the book's called McGurty.
It's a life of a pool hustler in the,

771
00:43:20.141 --> 00:43:22.370
during the depression.
And this guy,
uh,

772
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:25.180
traveled all over the country and like you oftentimes they were starving the

773
00:43:25.181 --> 00:43:29.400
begging people for food,
but they were trying to like gamble and each town like,

774
00:43:29.401 --> 00:43:32.860
I'll stop blowing away because there was no jobs and there was nothing for young

775
00:43:32.861 --> 00:43:33.371
men to do.

776
00:43:33.371 --> 00:43:36.790
Like it was desperate times and some people just did whatever the hell they

777
00:43:36.791 --> 00:43:38.920
could to do it.
Fat,
fascinating book.

778
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.270
<v 4>I feel like Hobos,
uh,
we're doing more things to like homeless.</v>

779
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:49.070
I just picture Santa Monica promenade sign,
you know,

780
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:51.890
ask him for money.
Hobos,
I felt like were active.

781
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:55.270
They were building fires or riding trains.
Yeah.

782
00:43:56.190 --> 00:44:00.840
<v 5>This is the book.
It's called Mcgourty,
m.
C,
g.
O.
R,
t,</v>

783
00:44:00.841 --> 00:44:05.640
y.
Uh,
a poolroom hustler.
And uh,

784
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.470
I wrote it,
it's an interesting book.

785
00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:12.240
It's all this guy telling his whole life story about what it was like,
you know,

786
00:44:12.241 --> 00:44:15.900
like traveling on the rails and being a hobo and you know,

787
00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.150
<v 4>begging for food.
Yeah.</v>

788
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.340
Like at least he has enough to write and alive because he traveled.

789
00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.640
He did met friends.
He gambled like homeless.

790
00:44:24.641 --> 00:44:29.530
Just implies to me kind of hanging around.
Right.
They're not really.
Um,

791
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:34.650
but speaking of,
uh,
crazy weird people.
Have you guys seen this story today?

792
00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:39.150
Today?
I saw it about the clown.
One clown in North Hampton.
Yeah.

793
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.650
There's this clown.
This is going around fucking freakiest thing ever.

794
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:49.010
<v 3>North Hampton,
Massachusetts,
as scary as it is in England.
I think you're right.</v>

795
00:44:49.011 --> 00:44:53.600
I think it was North Hampton.
It's this clown that's been terrorizing.
Oh,

796
00:44:53.601 --> 00:44:55.620
it's an English town.
So yeah,
it's an England.
England,

797
00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:00.630
<v 5>yeah,
North Hampton clown.
Terrorizes English town.
And it's so scary.</v>

798
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:01.620
Photos of this fucking,
yeah,

799
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.130
<v 3>it looks like.
Can you put up,</v>

800
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:07.500
<v 5>yeah.
It doesn't speak English.
It doesn't juggle and has balloons,</v>

801
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.110
but doesn't hand them out.
It probably doesn't even sleep,

802
00:45:10.111 --> 00:45:14.190
but just stand there haunting our dreams with that sinister smile.
Anonymous.

803
00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:15.570
Matt has been stocking fear,

804
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.220
striking fear into the hearts of Hampton UK community by ominously standing

805
00:45:20.221 --> 00:45:22.950
around in a creepy clown and creepy clown apparel.

806
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.713
<v 0>Wow.</v>

807
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.220
<v 4>Yeah.
He looks like the the the,
the Stephen King a clown.</v>

808
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:31.950
This position is super scary.
I don't know why,

809
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:35.730
but like it's relieving to came home and that guy was in your driveway.

810
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.560
I would immediately turn around and drive straight to the police department

811
00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:43.770
station.
Like that's crazy.
And then apparently doesn't he?

812
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.940
He either,
I don't know think he tweets,
but I think he has a Facebook page.
Yeah.

813
00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.340
That's like you don't really end up,
they don't know who it is.

814
00:45:50.341 --> 00:45:53.910
It's just he talks his him and he's like,
I'm not going to harm any weight.

815
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:57.270
Anyone.
Okay.
Off to go outside.

Wow.</v>

This photo and his Facebook page is from Stephen King's it.</v>

819

I just,

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.150

Yeah,

821
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.320
<v 5>that is from it.
I remember that movie.
Who played the the,</v>

822
00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:22.230
was it Leguizamo?
Oh No.
Was it Leguizamo that played?
No.
Tim.

823
00:46:22.231 --> 00:46:26.990
Someone I'm playing Stephen King's at.
Who the fuck played at?
Tim Conway did?
No,

824
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.413
<v 3>come over here.</v>

825
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:35.290
Remember Tim Conway had all those fucking videos about golf,

826
00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.680
about a guy with no legs.
Like what the fuck it was Dorothy.

827
00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:40.450
Dorothy fuck wrong with America.

828
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:45.310
That that was on like late night TV infomercials every night in woop.

829
00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:49.050
Woops,
boom.
And he'd fall over and they'll sell phony.

830
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.850
They couldn't get going to wait to get the next door if on golf video.

831
00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.600
What the fuck was that?
I don't remember.

832
00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:59.370
<v 4>Started on the show,
I think on a Johnny Carson.
Was it trend?
No,</v>

833
00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:04.290
I think it started on a,
Oh,
maybe it didn't with Mrs. Wiggins with the second

834
00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:07.740
<v 3>Terry.
Yeah.
Uh,
whatever the Carol Burnett show.
Yeah,
it was,</v>

835
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:12.040
I bet it started as a sketch.
Oh,
it Dorf on that and then

836
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:15.000
<v 4>he,
he off,
you know,
routed.</v>

837
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:16.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

838
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:20.590
<v 3>Tim Curry.
Tim,
the guy from rocky horror picture show,</v>

839
00:47:20.591 --> 00:47:25.240
he was the clown that's even creepier man already creepy to be thing,

840
00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.970
but then bought North Hampton's clown.
That's what he calls himself,

841
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:35.410
calls himself spot.
He's answering questions,

842
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:39.010
he's doing like question answering.
See you all very soon.

843
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.530
BP became wow.
Okay,

844
00:47:41.531 --> 00:47:45.610
let's see how come the cops kick get his address off that computer and go over

845
00:47:45.611 --> 00:47:48.580
and say,
I guess what is the crime?
Is he committing though?

846
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:53.640
Isn't it really gearing up the guys finding so much attention from this?

847
00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:57.520
I bet he's probably,
if I had a guest and uh,
I would love to,

848
00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:02.670
I would say I see is a borderline or ready to fucking blow a gasket and go full

849
00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:07.570
postal.
Yeah guys handing out fucking waves.

850
00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.930
Just dressed up like a clown standing there and they're like,

851
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.440
apparently he stood across the street from neighbors and just stared at their

852
00:48:14.441 --> 00:48:16.420
house for like three hours in that position.

853
00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.640
I might bring that guy with a baseball bat.

854
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:24.410
Sometimes there's not time for law.
Sometimes you just,

855
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:29.430
everybody's smashed the city cameras and dragged back into the forest or he's

856
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:34.300
just promoting a shitty band or something stupid like that down.
Crazy guy,

857
00:48:34.301 --> 00:48:35.110
man.

858
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.780
Could you imagine if that was like the beginning of their music video and then

859
00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:40.090
they just had this guy to do this for days and days and days.

860
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:45.100
So writing and huff and it's,
well actually one direction,
one direction

861
00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.480
and the clown terrorizes them.

862
00:48:48.481 --> 00:48:52.570
It chases them around their music video I splashed through a pool.
Bare chested.

863
00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:55.300
They're not even reaching puberty yet.
This sleek.

864
00:48:55.690 --> 00:49:00.390
How much went to week listening to Joe Zero just learned about it a couple of

865
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:04.780
days ago.
I didn't know.
I knew there was going to be a new one.
You know,

866
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:09.010
it's just a matter of time for it.
Adoption toys becomes in sync,
becomes this,

867
00:49:09.011 --> 00:49:11.440
becomes that.
I knew there's going to be a new one,
but I wasn't aware.

868
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:16.030
I don't think these boys are that cute though and they can't do,
oh,
how dare you?

869
00:49:16.031 --> 00:49:19.420
How dare you?
How dare you?
They're very cute.

870
00:49:19.421 --> 00:49:23.200
Do you remember Donny Walberg?
Jesus Christ dairy?

871
00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.970
I don't.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Google it.
They don't want to shit on these.

872
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:31.540
Poor young man.
Poor little cuties.

873
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:35.170
Are they all British?
How long has this fucking clown been doing this?

874
00:49:35.171 --> 00:49:37.990
Does anybody know?
I just saw the story today.
I don't know how long,

875
00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:39.310
but this is what,
okay.

876
00:49:39.311 --> 00:49:44.311
I'm a big fan of the discovery id channel in line and let's see.

877
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:48.670
Oh,
they're fine.
They have all those crackers,

878
00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:54.550
chips Ahoy and crackers.
They're selling cookies.
I don't know man.
That's awesome.

879
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:56.350
Okay.
The one on the end.
It's really cute.

880
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.800
They're all about the music and the Ritz.
They're all about selling crackers.

881
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:03.520
You can still look cool and so crackers dude,
isn't that weird?

882
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:07.120
Products look at the products they sell their products aren't they?

883
00:50:07.121 --> 00:50:09.850
Are they probably created by by who?

884
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:11.960
Like chips Ahoy Warner brothers or something.

885
00:50:11.961 --> 00:50:15.630
Quite focus on a dude's package back.
Oh,
I was stuck at the blind sheikh off.

886
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.090
I know you're doing captain supplemental package.

887
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:22.600
Young boy package man.
You're very one direction sensitive.

888
00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.800
What dare you call me on that.
Especially the live,

889
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.440
<v 4>so you don't know about the smell.
But on the,</v>

890
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:37.490
I watch a lot of the ID channel and they have a whole series called stocked and

891
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:40.880
when you see what you can get away with that it not being a crime,

892
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:41.810
this clown could,

893
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:46.520
has a lot of room left to go before he's doing anything legally wrong.
Really.

894
00:50:46.521 --> 00:50:49.580
You just stand right in front of someone's house and stare at them and do it
now.

895
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.750
Yeah.
Some lady had this guy and it wasn't like an ex boyfriend.

896
00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:55.250
It was just this crazy person.

897
00:50:55.610 --> 00:51:00.050
And she would call the cops and he'd be right across on the other sidewalk and

898
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:04.220
they'd go,
we can do it's public property.
We can't make him stop it,
do anything.

899
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:08.330
So clown guy,
you know,
he could keep going and going,

900
00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.680
I think the Facebook page.
So now you've created an identity for your identity.

901
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:15.680
Like you're taking it at another layer.

902
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:20.780
I would go visit his house to make sure there weren't,
uh,
bodies in the basement.

903
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:23.630
It's too challenging.
Gacy too.

904
00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.820
<v 5>Yeah.
Well,
it's the fact that it's Facebook page has,</v>

905
00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:31.100
it has the Tim Curry version of Stephen King's

906
00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.560
<v 4>character.
Yeah.
It's mean it's not a happy creepy.
Yeah.</v>

907
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:38.480
The v the whole look is creepy.
Like that's a person who's trying to intimidate.

908
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.900
Yeah.
Freak people.
Totally freak people out and it's working.

909
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.420
Or it's of a music video.
It could be,
yes,

910
00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.750
<v 5>probably the last couple of months.</v>

911
00:51:45.751 --> 00:51:50.751
And then next thing you'll see the see the boys dancing and spinning around in

912
00:51:51.211 --> 00:51:54.240
the clouds to con tries to kidnap them maybe as rope,

913
00:51:54.241 --> 00:51:55.650
but he keeps missing him with the robe.

914
00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.340
<v 4>Maybe he's the new map.
A new member.</v>

915
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.241
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

916
00:52:00.241 --> 00:52:03.450
They want to make it a little bit more accessible to people that like clowns.

917
00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:08.080
<v 3>Sure.
I'll hit right in the middle of that picture in a director's chair.
Come on.</v>

918
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.970
So that band actually does that.

919
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.630
<v 5>How's this band get made?
Is this is as a corporation gets together and they say,</v>

920
00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:16.340
we're just going to get a bunch of cute guys.
Yeah,

921
00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.750
we're going to get a bunch of songs.

922
00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:20.630
It's suck and we're going to make you sing them and they're going to be all

923
00:52:20.631 --> 00:52:22.760
about love.
And the next thing you know,
you've got a Ferrari

924
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.600
<v 3>who's,
yeah.
Who's in Emba fuckers.
If you're going to be completely crazy.</v>

925
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:29.740
Oh,
for raising.
Yeah.

926
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:35.600
<v 4>You were staying at some hotel and I went to the hotel to go to their spa,
uh,</v>

927
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:40.090
to get a pedicure and I wa I,
I didn't know one direction was there.

928
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:43.570
There must have been.
I can't,
I don't know,

929
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:48.310
2000 girls outside the hotel screaming their name.
Wow.
Thought.

930
00:52:48.311 --> 00:52:50.260
Wow.
Okay.
I'm still out of it.
Yeah.

931
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:52.310
<v 5>Those are girls that don't even know what they're going to do with them when</v>

932
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:55.660
they get them.
That's what's hilarious.
It's not like these girls later to fuck,

933
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:56.803
they're like eight.

934
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:59.260
<v 3>No.
Like,
oh my God.
Oh my God.</v>

935
00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.080
<v 5>Like they don't even know what's happening and their parents are bringing them</v>

936
00:53:03.081 --> 00:53:07.170
there.
They're the hard curls.
Oh my goodness.
It's screaming,
cheering.

937
00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:09.230
They don't even know what they're actually setting up.

938
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:12.410
<v 3>Well,
I don't,
I just liked the idea of when you get,
um,
like,</v>

939
00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:15.250
like you got one and he gets in your car,
it goes home with you.

940
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:18.280
Could you imagine got direction

941
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:20.990
<v 5>if one of those girls who was in love with one of those guys and the guy was</v>

942
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:23.060
just kind of nutty and he's like,
look,
I'll go home with you guys.

943
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.280
You really like me.
Come on,
take me to home.
I'll have dinner with you.

944
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.550
And so the one direction guys like sitting across the table from the eight year

945
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:33.180
old and the eight year olds freaking out,
what,
what difference does it make?

946
00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.640
Like what are you actually doing here?

947
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.490
Are you just trying to meet this guy or are you trying to fuck him and you're

948
00:53:38.491 --> 00:53:41.500
eight years old,
you know you can't fuck guys.
Like why you doing,

949
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.260
what do you want out of getting

950
00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:47.760
<v 4>I come,
I got,
was she screaming and cheering from?
I think if you,</v>

951
00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.780
what do you want one and put it in front of the eight year old girl should

952
00:53:50.781 --> 00:53:52.610
freeze up.
Oh yeah.

953
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.680
It would just be over her probably kidneys would fail something serious,

954
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:00.770
whatever gotten,
if I would've gotten this close to Sean,
Cassie,

955
00:54:00.771 --> 00:54:01.580
I might've fainted

956
00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.470
<v 5>so happy together.
Was that him?
No,
no,
it wasn't as to do Ron.
Ron To do run run.</v>

957
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:09.030
Yeah.
I remember David more than I remember Sean.
Yeah,

958
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:11.750
<v 4>sure.
I liked him better.
He was the underdog because he was blind.</v>

959
00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:15.290
He was the blonde one in Sean wasn't in the TV show that much.

960
00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:18.140
He was not in the sh no,
he wasn't that at all.

961
00:54:18.141 --> 00:54:21.890
He was in the hardy boys with Parker Stevenson.
He became really huge too.
Well,

962
00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:23.000
he's more sane.

963
00:54:23.001 --> 00:54:27.820
He's a director now and David's kind of off the rails,

964
00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:30.340
<v 5>the new show comics hanging out with David Cassidy.</v>

965
00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:35.840
He does some of the same show,
the a new show couple Cominos,

966
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:40.150
David Cassidy.
What went wrong?
David build the houses,

967
00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.280
the houses of one direction.
He had a big thing in Vegas for a while.

968
00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:49.690
Didn't he have a big Gig?
Not a big Gig,
but a Gig,
but I thought it was a big one.

969
00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.830
I thought it was a pretty big gig because I think someone else had it and then

970
00:54:53.831 --> 00:54:58.710
he had it for a while and maybe I'm not so crazy the that it didn't work out.

971
00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:02.530
Didn't work.
No,
it didn't work.
I read some great stories about him though.

972
00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:07.390
He just got a Dui like two weeks ago was in all the stuff two weeks ago.

973
00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:10.150
David,
how dare you.
You should have learned by now.

974
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.120
<v 4>Nobody's Duis better recently than Al Michaels.</v>

975
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:15.850
What happened without Michael Monica Al Michaels?

976
00:55:15.851 --> 00:55:18.280
I mean this is because of a joke of my art.

977
00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:20.530
The when you're rich and famous should major drinking you driving,
blah,
blah,

978
00:55:20.531 --> 00:55:24.010
blah.
But Al Michaels go is hammered.

979
00:55:24.011 --> 00:55:29.011
Santa Monica comes upon a Dui checkpoint freaks out and does an illegal u turn

980
00:55:29.441 --> 00:55:33.700
in front of the checkpoint and speeds away
the hope of four hours.

981
00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:38.860
We just played right into their hand like fuck.
They usually just go right,
right?

982
00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:44.230
Yeah.
I mean that end they got him,
they got one.

983
00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.620
<v 5>You a mug shot a fucking owl,
bro.</v>

984
00:55:48.621 --> 00:55:50.120
What happened buddy?

985
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:54.500
<v 4>Yes.
Yeah.
Does he do that?
It's more Robert.
More.
Yeah.</v>

986
00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:59.040
Al Is football guy.
He's a football and I'll talk a hockey guy.

987
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:02.430
How hammered was he?
Uh,
I don't remember.

988
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:05.330
He blew a [inaudible] say

989
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:08.110
David Katz.

990
00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:13.110
<v 5>The arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in New York August 21st so yeah,</v>

991
00:56:14.411 --> 00:56:18.910
it was really recently.
Yeah.
One time teen dream.

992
00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:23.950
And the Partridge family star was arrested Wednesday morning just after midnight

993
00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:24.010
in

994
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:28.580
<v 6>upstate New York.
Cassidy 63 was initially pulled over.</v>

995
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.240
No.
Yeah,

996
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:36.480
he was initially pulled over for driving with his high beams on Tmz reported and

997
00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:40.660
the officer does administered the field sobriety test after smelling alcohol.

998
00:56:40.661 --> 00:56:45.280
The actor singer did poorly on the sobriety test and showed a blood alcohol

999
00:56:45.281 --> 00:56:48.640
level of zero point 10.
It's just a little bit over drunk.
Right.

1000
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:52.720
He was cuffed and jailed or Ma Ma Ma Ma.

1001
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:59.290
I don't really think he was previously arrested a Dui in Florida in 2010 yeah,

1002
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:01.630
happening a lot.
Yeah.

1003
00:57:01.631 --> 00:57:05.650
Dash Cam footage showing him failing a field sobriety test and the officer

1004
00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:09.910
finding an open bottle of Bourbon in the car.
Oh,
that's hardcore.
Yeah.

1005
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:14.440
He changed his mind and pleaded to a no contest.
Oh,

1006
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:18.640
Sally.
David,
I guess it's fucking hard for those people,

1007
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:20.440
those teen throbs that become,

1008
00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:23.100
<v 4>boy,
you remember the show a man,</v>

1009
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:28.170
while the way politically incorrect used to be when it was on,
uh,

1010
00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:31.080
not comedy central,
then it went somewhere else.
I want,
I want,

1011
00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:35.400
I did an episode with Dick Van Patton and he had read a book how to make your

1012
00:57:35.401 --> 00:57:40.380
child a star.
Right?
Creepy,
right.
And Bill Maher,
I'll,

1013
00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:46.050
it was me,
uh,
Dick Van Patten,
somebody and Queen Latifa,
I don't remember.

1014
00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:50.490
And Dick Van Patten was so out of his mind,
he was screaming,

1015
00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:54.510
uh,
whoever was sitting next to me was saying,
this is terrible.

1016
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:56.850
You shouldn't write books like this.
These kids all end up crazy.

1017
00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.790
It's almost like Dick van Patten has been prepared for this.
And he goes,

1018
00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:04.770
I have a list of people that are completely sane.
Rodney Howard.

1019
00:58:04.771 --> 00:58:09.771
And he starts spitting out all these names of child stars that went on to not

1020
00:58:09.841 --> 00:58:12.980
become crazy.
Right.
But his list wasn't that long.

1021
00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:14.140
<v 6>Jody foster?</v>

1022
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:17.990
<v 4>Uh,
yeah.
I'm trying to remember.
It's on the amount of,</v>

1023
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.140
mostly actors from way back,

1024
00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:25.070
like not now.
Like,
good.

1025
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:29.640
<v 6>It must be so crazy to have something happen to you early in life,</v>

1026
00:58:29.641 --> 00:58:33.600
like becoming a David Cassidy type guy where you're this enormous star.

1027
00:58:33.601 --> 00:58:37.530
You're like a young,
young,
young guy and you'll never hit that height again.

1028
00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:41.010
So all of a sudden it goes away and just living a normal life,

1029
00:58:41.011 --> 00:58:44.010
which is like fine for most of us just living a normal life,
right?

1030
00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:48.360
But living a normal life is like a torture.
Like,
like,
yeah,
you didn't,
you don't,

1031
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:51.990
you didn't make it.
Huh?
Look at you.
It gets you go,
went away.
Huh?
Hey,

1032
00:58:51.991 --> 00:58:55.070
are you the guy from hey,
yeah,
go you hanging around with us.

1033
00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:00.660
There was this a really douchey guy that works at the cvs in my house.

1034
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:06.010
He's just really angry Middle East and dude,
I don't know what his deal is.

1035
00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:10.950
He's a weird guy.
And uh,
one time I was there and uh,
I was,

1036
00:59:10.951 --> 00:59:13.380
I'm paying for something and he goes,
it will happen to your show.

1037
00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:18.750
What would you show?
And I go,
what?
You know,
I was playing stupid.
He goes,

1038
00:59:18.751 --> 00:59:22.070
this show you had,
what happened to it?
I go,
I don't know what happened to it.
He

1039
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.340
<v 3>goes,
this is not on,
no,
I mean more like,
dude,</v>

1040
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:29.300
you're working at fucking cvs and we really having this argument,
man,

1041
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:33.590
let me pay for my fucking candy bar winner.
Yeah,
you win.

1042
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.390
My show's not on TV anymore.

1043
00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:40.550
Are you fucking paying attention on t v Jesus Christ dickhead.

1044
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:44.960
It was just,
it's a weird guy like,
but people like to do that.
The elected.
Oh,

1045
00:59:44.961 --> 00:59:48.710
look at you.
I'm not doing a thing.
Went away.
Huh?

1046
00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.880
I think he got canceled all the movie didn't do so good.
Huh?
Oh,
that movie dude.

1047
00:59:52.881 --> 00:59:57.590
It wasn't so good.
Huh?
I heard that movie didn't do so good.
You're not so tall.

1048
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.580
Short guy.
Little tiny guys.
I've got a fat face.

1049
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:04.520
You meet a lot of food or what do you eat?
Bad food.
He would,

1050
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:07.760
he would drink a lot that's going on with you.
And the money goes away too.

1051
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.270
If you're David Cassidy,
the attention goes away and now the money is gone.

1052
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:15.200
I've tried to think of the casino.
We,
uh,
we all did it,
uh,
in Vegas.

1053
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:17.780
They're very nice people.
It's all the way down at the end though,

1054
01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:22.730
it's not really connected.
Uh,
Green Valley ranch station,
casino,

1055
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:27.380
no s all the way at the end.
All the way to the end.
Red Rock.

1056
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:31.400
No squirting pass lux or keep going past all that bitch.

1057
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.620
No sparks
walk it.
Give me your money.
Silly Bitch.

1058
01:00:36.621 --> 01:00:41.570
That's my new Casino Swan.
Like Oh yeah,
I dunno.
Sahara.
No,
no,
no.

1059
01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:44.600
You're going the wrong way.
Oh,
the other way to know what's where.

1060
01:00:44.601 --> 01:00:48.610
I'm not start us star five star fire.

1061
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.290
No circus circus.
They have a room.

1062
01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.050
It's probably a 500 seater and David Cassie was involved there.
Okay.
Yeah,

1063
01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.020
that makes sense.
Yeah.
These guys like they always have a career,
right?

1064
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:01.550
They could always like get gigs.

1065
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:05.660
45 year old women that will always go see David Cassidy further long trip down

1066
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:10.280
memory lane.
Oh,
he's still kind of cute.

1067
01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.600
Fuck him.
I'll just dim the lights.
Take a Xanax off.
Fuck.

1068
01:01:14.601 --> 01:01:19.580
'Em just to put it on the bucket.
Cassidy.
I don't know.

1069
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:21.870
Um,
I don't know.
I don't,

1070
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:25.130
Shit on David's class is going to happen to Justin Bieber.
I mean,
come on.

1071
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:29.630
I remember when Gary Coleman was working as a security guard and it was like

1072
01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:31.280
this fucking big thing.
They would,

1073
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.690
people would go and goof on them and take pictures with them.
You know,
guys,

1074
01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:36.590
just trying to make a living.

1075
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:41.630
One of one of the cleavers became a cop while the cleavers like for cleaver

1076
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.870
beaver.
Yeah.
He might be the cleavers account.

1077
01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:51.650
Remember when the dude from the love boat became a senator,
congressman,

1078
01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:55.930
congressman or senator.
What one was hungriness congressman.
Yeah.

1079
01:01:56.810 --> 01:02:00.430
Who was that from the love boat though.
Yes.

1080
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.820
Bernie something.
Alright.
Love Boat Congress.

1081
01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:07.700
The glasses.
He kind of looked like a Mitch McConnell type,

1082
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.980
but not that other Fred granddaddy.
Fred.
Yeah.
There he is.

1083
01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.210
Remember the US House of Representatives from Iowa?

1084
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.220
Gary Coleman as a security guard.

1085
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:24.930
<v 6>Yeah.
That shit man.
Oh yeah.
There he is.
The saddest shit was a,</v>

1086
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.870
the wife that he had that took the photos of him dying,

1087
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.670
I was off of feeding tubes.

1088
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.810
She put it took a Selfie of her in front of the feeding tubes.

1089
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.270
Fucking evil.
Just,

1090
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.690
those are the people that you get attached to and you know,

1091
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.810
where was he a security guard at a lot like cvs or something.

1092
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:46.380
I forget something along those lines.

1093
01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:52.250
<v 3>I mean,
how badly is that career managed though?
I mean it's Gary Coleman.</v>

1094
01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:53.510
You can get them on something.

1095
01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.910
<v 6>It's parents stole from it in there.
Yeah.</v>

1096
01:02:56.870 --> 01:03:00.470
That's a super common thing that parents steal from people.
Man.

1097
01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.500
You could at least on porn.
Oh Brian,

1098
01:03:03.501 --> 01:03:07.970
that's not an at least sometimes you're better off just becoming a security

1099
01:03:07.971 --> 01:03:08.804
guard.
Okay.

1100
01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:13.010
<v 3>Yeah.
And letting a bunch of dudes fuck you.
Why is it going to be too?</v>

1101
01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:17.450
Cause that's where the real money is.
The real money from male performers.

1102
01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:20.750
Let's be realistic.
The real money from me

1103
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:24.020
<v 6>farmers is not in pitching and catching,</v>

1104
01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:31.460
um,
be normal.
He's not,
he's not a congressman anymore.

1105
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.030
Let's say quit.
Do you not get reelected?
He's still alive.

1106
01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:40.060
65 but it says a 1995 he was in office from a 87 to 95.

1107
01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.540
Huh?
Maybe it was like this.
Fucking people are too crazy

1108
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:50.300
<v 3>doing better than David Cassidy.
Maybe drinking and walking.</v>

1109
01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:54.410
True drinking and not leaving the house.
I didn't get this role.
It's Iowa,

1110
01:03:54.411 --> 01:03:57.710
it's called outlets.
Yeah.
I drink and shoot deer out his window

1111
01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:02.220
hours.
I fucking Congress,
man.

1112
01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:05.390
I love the lab

1113
01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:11.060
and that's a thing people love to like stick in people's face,
you know?
Yeah.

1114
01:04:11.061 --> 01:04:12.730
You're using the TV.
Yeah.

1115
01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.910
<v 6>Worse than a failure because at least like a regular failure.
Like,
you know,</v>

1116
01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:21.650
if you're a guy and you're,
I'm just sweeping up on the street,

1117
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:22.521
that's one thing.

1118
01:04:22.521 --> 01:04:25.280
But if you're Warren Beatty and you're sweeping up in the street,

1119
01:04:25.281 --> 01:04:26.870
you used to be Warren Beatty right

1120
01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.860
<v 3>in.
They're all in from now.
You've got a push broom.
You,</v>

1121
01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.500
it's not just a regular guy.
It's like,
oh,
you see,
be privileged.

1122
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.020
He's too one of the elite.
Now look at you.

1123
01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:42.910
<v 6>I'm above you.
Or was that guy still at your cvs?</v>

1124
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:45.900
Um,
no,
I haven't seen them in awhile.
I think you've probably got fired.

1125
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.750
Guy Was a deck,
but I had interactions with him a couple of times.
It was like,

1126
01:04:49.751 --> 01:04:53.200
there was a couple like odd ones,
but that one was like real specific.

1127
01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:56.080
Like he just started like quiz,
like you couldn't help himself.

1128
01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:59.410
He was quizzing me on my my where is your show?
Not on anymore.
Huh?

1129
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.630
<v 3>Why?
What is your pent up anger about what it was?</v>

1130
01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:07.320
At least your cvs has employees.
Mine.
It's a free for all.

1131
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:10.310
I mean it seriously like I think I could just,

1132
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:13.460
if there weren't cameras just walk right out with shit.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1133
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:18.180
I mean I don't even want to,
I want to pay.
There's no one to pay the job men

1134
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.113
<v 5>do at night.</v>

1135
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.090
Do you do it at like late it and neither will usually 24 hours a day,
right?

1136
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:26.290
<v 4>No,
I don't go the one on all by my house.
Creepy.
I wouldn't go there at night.</v>

1137
01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:30.130
There's just Harold people piss and everywhere and it's not good

1138
01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:34.680
<v 5>to go to a pharmacies.
24 pharmacies really late at night.</v>

1139
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.630
Like sometimes like when I'm coming home from a Gig,

1140
01:05:36.631 --> 01:05:40.470
if I notice that the place is open and it's like 2:00 AM what's your shoe is up,

1141
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:44.280
I'll park the car and go wander around.
Well,
no,

1142
01:05:44.281 --> 01:05:48.870
because you see weird people and you see some weird shit go down at these these

1143
01:05:48.871 --> 01:05:52.740
places because it's one of the only things open.
So usually it's people,

1144
01:05:52.741 --> 01:05:56.760
a lot of people that are cranked up and we're fucked up or drunk or something.

1145
01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:59.970
And so like sometimes when you go through them,
like you'll see some shit,

1146
01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.610
you'll see something that's interesting.
You see some weird people.

1147
01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.790
<v 4>I did see,
uh,
at the CVS late.
It was,
it was Paul,
not too late.</v>

1148
01:06:06.791 --> 01:06:08.310
It was nighttime though,
probably eight,

1149
01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:13.180
eight o'clock and the pharmacy was still open and this gigantic drag queen

1150
01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:17.980
trying.
See,
I tried to return medicine.
I thought this was the best reason.

1151
01:06:17.981 --> 01:06:22.930
Every slammed a door.
Then he goes,
I'm on my Mac.
This medicine didn't work.

1152
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.440
And The lady's like,
uh,
sir,
ma'am,

1153
01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:30.970
whatever we can't take back opened used medicine.

1154
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.560
Why not?
It don't work.
And I thought,
wow,
he does have a point of it,
right?

1155
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:36.130
I don't know what he was supposed to do.

1156
01:06:36.131 --> 01:06:39.450
Maybe it was supposed to make them a lady faster.
I don't know what

1157
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:45.400
medication was,
but clearly it didn't calm him down.

1158
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.530
And he is not achieved the results he wants.

1159
01:06:47.531 --> 01:06:50.410
I think you should be held to give it back.
Tick.
Dissolver

1160
01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:52.330
<v 3>yeah,
I don't think,</v>

1161
01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:57.660
I don't think you're the proper protocol surely have established protocols

1162
01:06:57.910 --> 01:07:00.760
<v 4>for this poor pharmacists lady.
Like,
like,</v>

1163
01:07:00.761 --> 01:07:04.120
I need this crap at nine o'clock call for a manager.
There isn't one.

1164
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.750
You might as well just call the cops at that point.
There's no managers and cvs.

1165
01:07:07.751 --> 01:07:08.381
I mean if they are,

1166
01:07:08.381 --> 01:07:12.520
they don't come out in the public eye and they're also working the cash
register.

1167
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:14.610
Yeah.
To teach me how to use the cash register.

1168
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.810
Now they're teaching me how to use the self checkout.

1169
01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.810
I don't want to use the self checkout.
You're here.
You do it.

1170
01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:23.310
<v 5>I like the self checkout.
I love it.
It feels very space to me.</v>

1171
01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.900
Like you don't even have to talk to people.

1172
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:28.530
Just pick some stuff up and you'd scan it and then you run a credit card and you

1173
01:07:28.531 --> 01:07:29.400
don't talk to a person.

1174
01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:34.010
<v 3>Uh,
yeah.
But uh,
nicotine patches.
You got it.
Oh,</v>

1175
01:07:34.011 --> 01:07:36.320
you need a person.
Someone's got a problem by that shit.

1176
01:07:36.321 --> 01:07:40.820
A little on someone needs some drugs.
It's,
yeah.
Somebody needs to make money.

1177
01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:44.910
Yeah.
Why don't you buy it on Amazon so much cheaper at Amazon.
Are you serious?

1178
01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.710
Listen,
when are these people going to learn about the internet?

1179
01:07:48.711 --> 01:07:51.410
I know you don't even know about amazon.com yeah,

1180
01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:55.370
no Amazon buy things from it.
I wouldn't think they'd sell nicotine.

1181
01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.960
They sell everything that exists.
I Buy,

1182
01:07:57.961 --> 01:08:01.710
I do maybe 70% of my shopping on amazon.com I'm not bullshit.

1183
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:06.730
And not to mention La is when the most unique cities that has Amazon fresh now,

1184
01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:11.480
which is a app that you download that consent groceries to your house,
like,
like,

1185
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:15.860
like next day or even earlier than that sometimes where you just order all your

1186
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:16.430
groceries

1187
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.550
<v 5>on an app and they come right to your house and drop it off.</v>

1188
01:08:18.551 --> 01:08:21.610
Why don't you Google how long that actually takes instead of saying or maybe

1189
01:08:21.611 --> 01:08:25.030
even closer some times.
Well,
let's find out.
Yeah,

1190
01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.250
I mean there's no need to not find out.
When you say something like that,

1191
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:31.670
you should always Google it instead of just panicking.

1192
01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:33.470
That's why I covered my house.

1193
01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:37.050
<v 4>Well,
I Google it bitch.
I think a bit grocery stores you can,</v>

1194
01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:41.700
some of them like pavilions you can send in an order and then grocery.

1195
01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:46.300
So he kind of got to pick them out.
Yeah.
Well yes.

1196
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.480
<v 5>Some people that are like super,
uh,
you know,
wealthy and live in New York,</v>

1197
01:08:50.481 --> 01:08:54.640
they do that as well.
Like in New York City,
that's like you can't fucking drive.

1198
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:56.540
<v 4>Where are you going to go to get groceries,
right.</v>

1199
01:08:56.650 --> 01:08:58.840
<v 5>They have to walk to get groceries.
So,</v>

1200
01:08:58.841 --> 01:09:02.350
and then you gotta walk home like Jesus Christ and what are you going to do?

1201
01:09:02.351 --> 01:09:04.150
Right.
You're going to bring your own grocery cart.

1202
01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:06.370
<v 4>Well,
yeah,
they don't get knocked.
What do they do?</v>

1203
01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.950
They're not getting bags out either same or next day.

1204
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:13.140
<v 5>Same or next day.
Nice.
Yeah.
See like living in New York City,</v>

1205
01:09:13.141 --> 01:09:17.250
that would be one of the big bombers is that you can't just go drive to the

1206
01:09:17.251 --> 01:09:21.690
grocery store and then come home and pull into the driveway and unloaded like a

1207
01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:23.400
fucking human,
right.

1208
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:27.840
You have to live in this gigantic cage stacked up on top of each other.

1209
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:29.700
We have to venture out on foot,

1210
01:09:29.701 --> 01:09:34.080
like a fucking caveman and hunt and gather your food,
bring it back to the cave.

1211
01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.120
<v 4>It only works for people like,</v>

1212
01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:41.310
like Lou loves restaurants.
He just loves to eat out.

1213
01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:45.840
So like New York is perfect for him.
Louis Black.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a foodie.
Right?

1214
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.340
Oh dear.
Hey.
Like you know it new restaurants opening up,
he can't wait.

1215
01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:54.570
He knows he is a Zagat guide.
He's a walking Manhattan Zagat Guide.

1216
01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.580
So he's uses in his pig heaven.
Oh yeah.
Makes mixed sound like,

1217
01:09:59.581 --> 01:10:02.820
I don't even think he would understand how to drive to the grocery store,

1218
01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.140
buy bags of it and then bring it home.
Really?
Yeah.
He's too much into that.

1219
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:09.990
But I,
it bothers me.
That's why I won't live there.

1220
01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:14.610
I mean I constantly going out to eat well and I don't like even like my house,

1221
01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:16.080
like I don't,
I don't want to get,

1222
01:10:16.081 --> 01:10:20.700
I never wanted a house with gates and all and I want to be able to just walk

1223
01:10:20.701 --> 01:10:25.510
onto my front porch and go on my house and then walk out the back door and be in

1224
01:10:25.511 --> 01:10:26.340
a backyard.

1225
01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:30.810
<v 5>You live in la?
The La area?
Yeah.
This is this a good thing about living in la.</v>

1226
01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:34.050
There's too many God damn people.
But you do get some space at least.

1227
01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.830
<v 4>Yeah.
There's plenty of space for what your money compared to,</v>

1228
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.570
I could sell the house here and flip with Lou and what has to be a little bit

1229
01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:45.980
more,
but it's way smaller.
Yeah.
And then you know,
it's an elevator.

1230
01:10:45.981 --> 01:10:47.060
I feel like I'm in a hotel,

1231
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:51.080
<v 5>like he's selling an apartment.
Yeah.
And they're cool with that.
Yeah.</v>

1232
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.430
People that live in hotels are living,
you know,
apartments.

1233
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:56.990
They're cool with that.
Like they don't,

1234
01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.210
they don't have any problem with living on the 80th floor.

1235
01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:04.120
<v 4>No,
not at all.
He's done in his whole life.
No car.
And I said,</v>

1236
01:11:04.121 --> 01:11:08.680
what if like no car?
What it has?
It had a car in 25 years.
I go,
what if,

1237
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:13.550
uh,
I had a heart attack it or lamb.
It's too extreme.

1238
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:18.600
Maybe something you can't drive me to the hospital so we just go hail a cab.

1239
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:22.320
You know Amy Lou,
I mean,
uh,
hardest.
Heck you'd call nine one one,

1240
01:11:22.321 --> 01:11:24.060
but then how long is it going to take them to get here?

1241
01:11:24.061 --> 01:11:28.020
Where are they going to park?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought it's not for me.

1242
01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.210
Uber,
all my heart attacks.
I'm two minutes late.
You could always Uber,
um,

1243
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.960
to Midwest.
Even golf.

1244
01:11:33.961 --> 01:11:38.520
Like he has his golf clubs in some storage unit and then we have to get the golf

1245
01:11:38.521 --> 01:11:42.960
clubs and either there's a town car that he'll pay for or we take the subway or

1246
01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:46.520
dragon golf clubs.
Right.
It's crazy.
I'll be like,
this is too much.
Too much.

1247
01:11:46.521 --> 01:11:51.060
He takes,
he has a storage unit where he puts his shit.
A lot of his extra stuff.

1248
01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:52.860
Yeah.
Can't keep it all in his little apartment.

1249
01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.760
And his apartment for New York is actually quite,
well.
It's one bedroom wall,

1250
01:11:56.761 --> 01:12:00.540
an office and a big deck.
The deck is probably as big as the actual apartment,

1251
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:04.710
which is awesome,
but he can't store everything up there.
No Way.

1252
01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.710
And so he has a storage unit and then does he have a crazy view?

1253
01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.430
We have to walk down.
Oh,
he has a really good view.
He's not too high though.

1254
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:16.140
He's the top of,
it's only I think seven floors.
Oh yeah.

1255
01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:19.470
So he's not,
it's a great circular view.

1256
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:22.350
You're not looking down on this city.
You're,
you're right in.

1257
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:26.100
He's like surrounded by all these big buildings.
You're almost like in a vortex.

1258
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.110
That's kind of cool too.
I like it.
Yeah,

1259
01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:31.730
<v 5>I like that looking at the other,
but there's no view like that.
You know,</v>

1260
01:12:31.731 --> 01:12:34.760
every time I stay in New York and I take pictures of like out the window of the

1261
01:12:34.761 --> 01:12:38.240
hotel room,
I always like,
this is no view like this.
This is such a weird view.

1262
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.350
It's so crazy.

1263
01:12:39.351 --> 01:12:43.460
All these giant ass fucking building stacked in on top of each other.

1264
01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:44.750
It's such an odd point.

1265
01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.610
<v 4>Sun,
like other big cities in the world,
like Paris,</v>

1266
01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:53.020
there's always sun because the buildings are short.
Right.
Roam the building.

1267
01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:57.400
New York,
everything is so high.
Light doesn't come in,

1268
01:12:57.490 --> 01:13:00.940
which I never thought I even cared about light until it was taken away.

1269
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:06.010
Do you think you live like in Seattle?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
I love it up there,

1270
01:13:06.011 --> 01:13:09.830
but do you think you could deal with the winter then?
The no light?
Yeah,
the,
yeah.

1271
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:13.200
Yeah.
Yeah.
Rain,
love rain.

1272
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.000
We were just talking about that because the direct TV and my brother goes

1273
01:13:16.001 --> 01:13:19.000
terrible.
Right?
The under stores,
they said,
we'll sadly,
there are none in la.

1274
01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:23.400
He's in the Midwest and I go there.
That's the thing.
I miss the most funders.

1275
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:27.340
There's no thunderstorms here or even just a gloomy day.
Yeah.

1276
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:30.130
There's never a where you feel like it's okay to be lazy

1277
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:35.480
<v 5>funder at night when you're sleeping.
Yeah.
It sounds cool.
Right?</v>

1278
01:13:35.481 --> 01:13:37.700
It's like it's the law.
The skies alive.

1279
01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.810
<v 4>Yeah.
I didn't even know what's under it was until I watched your show.</v>

1280
01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:45.250
You didn't know why?
No.
Wow.
That's funny.

1281
01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:50.080
I've made it through the entire Missouri school system and I was never told
that.

1282
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:55.180
I didn't understand that it was the ions of the lightning being released.

1283
01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:59.950
And you could count by seconds of how far that lightning strike is.
So that one,

1284
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:03.840
<v 5>yeah,
you got one Mississippi,
two men.
If it's three,
that's three miles away.
Yeah,</v>

1285
01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:08.970
seriously.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah,
something like that.
It's not an exact obviously,

1286
01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.040
but yeah,
there's a,
there's a

1287
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.120
<v 3>way to,
just a way to actually tell,
like if you have a stopwatch,</v>

1288
01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:21.380
you know there's a way to actually judge it.
Mississippi.
Just make that up.
Yeah,

1289
01:14:21.381 --> 01:14:24.520
that's,
no,
there really is a formula.
Like if you had a stop light on your phone,

1290
01:14:24.521 --> 01:14:26.720
I'm sure your phone has a watch and a stopwatch,

1291
01:14:26.721 --> 01:14:28.030
you press the stop watch feature,

1292
01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:31.070
right when you see the lightning [inaudible] then when the boom had,

1293
01:14:31.071 --> 01:14:33.990
so you just calculate the seconds and you know how far away it is.
Oh,
I see.

1294
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.810
It's the best thing to tell a child,
by the way,
because as a kid living in Ohio,

1295
01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:40.240
I was so scared of lightning and thunder and shit like that.

1296
01:14:40.241 --> 01:14:43.470
So my dad told me that and so like I would see this bright flash of light and

1297
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.930
that one too.
You like to see how far it was?

1298
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:51.130
Well it's crazy when you hear one,
it's like 30 seconds away.
Yeah.

1299
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.030
And you can see it.

1300
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:55.870
I mean you could see a giant ass bolt of lightning 30 seconds away,

1301
01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:58.380
30 miles away.
It's wow.
Crazy

1302
01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:03.660
<v 4>sees lightening I've ever seen was in Iraq because there was a sand storm.</v>

1303
01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:07.900
So,
and a lot of the sands,
you don't see it.
It's weird.

1304
01:15:07.901 --> 01:15:11.200
I took pictures with my camera and I'm like,
man,
it's just camera already broken.

1305
01:15:11.201 --> 01:15:14.380
Cause there were dots,
right?
Nighttime pictures and there's dots.
I'm like,

1306
01:15:14.381 --> 01:15:17.770
I thought maybe I got it wet.
And they're like,
the soldier guys were like,
no,

1307
01:15:17.771 --> 01:15:22.300
that's sand.
I go,
I don't see it with my naked eye.
He goes,
you,
you don't,
he goes,

1308
01:15:22.301 --> 01:15:24.640
wait till you see a thunderstorm.
The lightning,

1309
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:26.590
I don't know anything about science,

1310
01:15:26.591 --> 01:15:29.410
but somehow it connects with all these sand particles.

1311
01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:32.620
So the lightening is like a spiderweb.

1312
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:37.840
Whoa man.
Alright.
It's freaky.
Weird storm.

1313
01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.420
Yeah,
I know.
And probably the Middle East.

1314
01:15:40.421 --> 01:15:45.400
The heat has something to do with it too.
How long did you go to Iraq for?
Uh,
uh,

1315
01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:48.230
we could go two weeks at a time when we and Afghanistan and all.

1316
01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:51.820
How many times have you gone?
Twice.
I'm done now.
I've retired from the military.

1317
01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:56.050
Yeah.
Yeah.
What happened?
I keep my boots back.
I just can't,
I can't,

1318
01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.810
I can't,
I can't do it again.

1319
01:15:58.870 --> 01:16:03.520
I mean it would really have to be a major request.

1320
01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.550
It's just there's something wrong over there.
Yeah.

1321
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:12.280
You don't feel right when you get home.
We got weird skin things.

1322
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:17.400
Lou Leica,
his skin started all rotting off right here,
but bizarrely enough,

1323
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:21.700
it looked exactly like a Hitler mustache.
He got off the plane,

1324
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.010
got to Hitler disease,
he dead.
He got,
and I said,

1325
01:16:24.011 --> 01:16:25.450
that's weird because you're Jewish.

1326
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.040
<v 3>You have the Hitler mustache and the hat up.</v>

1327
01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:33.010
What do you think you got that from the air there?
It's polluter or something.

1328
01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:33.844
I don't know if it was

1329
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.570
<v 4>the air and then I got this thing here on my face.</v>

1330
01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:40.860
What'd you get at like the swelling?
That wouldn't go away for no reason.

1331
01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:45.930
I thought maybe it was like,
God,
do I get bitten by like a sand flea or,
right.
Uh,

1332
01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:49.110
and the military always just says,
oh,
well,
we don't know.

1333
01:16:49.111 --> 01:16:52.200
We don't think it has anything to do with here.
Just weird things.
Just,

1334
01:16:52.201 --> 01:16:55.650
just not necessarily to go.
I feel like I did it to twice.
That was enough.

1335
01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:59.160
Is that what it looks like?
You're supposedly,
uh,
yes.

1336
01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:03.850
<v 3>Holy Shit.
That's in night vision.
It's even crazier.</v>

1337
01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:08.680
It looks like a rave.
Like,
yeah,
it looks amazing.
And then when you're like,
blah,

1338
01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:10.100
camera's not

1339
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:13.400
<v 4>great.
Great.
The way it connects with the particles,</v>

1340
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:18.740
almost like instead of a bolt,
it looks like a spiderweb.
Oh Wow.

1341
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.010
That looks amazing.
Super Freaky.
And we were there in winter.

1342
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:25.880
I can only imagine what it's like in the summer when it's 130.

1343
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:28.430
It's probably even more spectacular.
But then I think,

1344
01:17:28.431 --> 01:17:29.780
well why doesn't that happen in Vegas?

1345
01:17:29.781 --> 01:17:31.820
But they don't have sand storms per se in Vegas.

1346
01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:36.060
Not like they do know the Vegas will stand.
Storms aren't shit compared to what?

1347
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:40.190
To the Middle East.
Where,
I mean the sky is orange from sand,

1348
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:43.610
sand orange.
It's like an orange out two times.

1349
01:17:43.611 --> 01:17:47.570
We couldn't buy anywhere for the entire day.
They were like,
yeah,
network.

1350
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:52.590
No one could go anywhere.
Helicopters can't go up.
It depends.
It depends.
But the,

1351
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:56.960
the ones we got into lasted a day,
a whole day though of just,

1352
01:17:58.730 --> 01:18:01.970
it's like the moon,
like people shouldn't be living there.
It's crazy.

1353
01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.180
Or are like the guys that used to just travel with their little

1354
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:09.710
tents and camels and roam around.
Maybe they knew the deal.

1355
01:18:09.711 --> 01:18:13.760
Like a sandstorm coming,
let's get out.
But to plant yourself there,

1356
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.270
I think you're asking for problems.

1357
01:18:18.150 --> 01:18:20.760
<v 6>Yeah.
It's not a good spot.
Look at that.</v>

1358
01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:24.110
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Very much.</v>

1359
01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:28.320
<v 6>Lightening Bolt through sand is Christ.
It's incredible.
It does.</v>

1360
01:18:28.321 --> 01:18:33.120
It interacts with all the sand particles.
Yeah.
And there's billions of them,

1361
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.330
which are,
you can see on my camera.
So when you asked about the,
the,
the,

1362
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:40.250
the skin things that you guys are both have and they,

1363
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:42.420
they didn't think that they're related,
is that what they said?

1364
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:45.540
<v 4>Well,
I didn't even know if they were related either.
I'd,</v>

1365
01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:50.200
I didn't have a Hitler mustache and he didn't have any swelling.
Uh,

1366
01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.470
uh,
and we,
he was doing gigs that he came out here and he's like,

1367
01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.650
we take me to a dermatologist.
I said,
funny enough,
I have to go to,

1368
01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:00.820
there's something in my face.
And then we went and the lady was like,

1369
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:06.460
uh,
I don't know kids.
Um,
I'm going to give you some antibiotics and,

1370
01:19:06.461 --> 01:19:11.230
uh,
let's hope this works.
Whoa.
Like she had never seen nothing,
nothing.
I said,

1371
01:19:11.231 --> 01:19:14.320
well,
will this go down?
Is it an allergy?
She's like,

1372
01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:18.970
could be like,
it was like,
I should've just asked my sister.
Oh,

1373
01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:23.110
maybe,
I don't know.
His Hitler mustache took a while too,

1374
01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:24.790
and then he couldn't shave.

1375
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:30.030
So it looked like shape right here and it said that seriously.

1376
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:34.030
So did you just grow a mustache just grow over the whole thing?
No,

1377
01:19:34.031 --> 01:19:36.040
he didn't want to do that.
He thought that looked crazy.
I still,

1378
01:19:36.041 --> 01:19:40.880
I think it's crazier to look like Hitler with a man completely ruined,

1379
01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:45.910
ruined the mustache for a tire forever.
That mustache can't be pulled off.

1380
01:19:45.911 --> 01:19:50.560
Lou.
And he took it from chaplain.
Yeah.
Chaplain shorten it though.

1381
01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.880
It's still mid,
tighter.

1382
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:55.400
<v 6>It's like chaplain,
like if you see one of those things,
you assume it's a Hitler.</v>

1383
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:57.830
Even if it's a Chaplin,
you can be a Charlie Chaplin Fan.

1384
01:19:57.831 --> 01:20:00.140
You can't wear that mustache.
It's too close to Hitler,

1385
01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:03.030
<v 4>which is all related to my favorite website of all time cats.</v>

1386
01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:06.440
It look like Hitler,
Hitler's.
Oh,

1387
01:20:06.450 --> 01:20:11.300
I can't every day.
Every day or really?
Yeah,
they have new ones every day.

1388
01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.840
What is wrong with you man,

1389
01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:16.470
and my other favorite is just the photo of the Batman Kat.
Do you know him?

1390
01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:21.720
I said greatest.
We're no,
if it's for sale just on the road too much.

1391
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.261
No.

1392
01:20:22.261 --> 01:20:25.860
This is what I do when my brother calls and tries to explain financial things to

1393
01:20:25.861 --> 01:20:30.780
me,
I go on,
Huh?
Yeah,
I've had,
yeah,
I'll see.
Come on.

1394
01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:37.650
How is that not funny?
How do you not buy that cat?
If you see it?
It's cute cat.

1395
01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:41.100
Some of them,
there's one and he's got World War II gear on.
It's really funny.

1396
01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:43.530
It's only funny now in 2013 right.

1397
01:20:43.531 --> 01:20:47.520
It wouldn't have been funny in 1948 it would have been too soon.
No,

1398
01:20:47.521 --> 01:20:50.070
and it can't be offensive because they're cats.
They don't know.

1399
01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:52.430
They didn't do it on purpose.
They might have though.

1400
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:54.390
What if you thought that that cat was Hitler?

1401
01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:02.450
Hitler.
They'd called killers.
They're called killers.
Okay.

1402
01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:07.390
We've seen enough.
Brian loves stupid cats.
Me Too.

1403
01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:08.700
I fall for it.

1404
01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:12.450
This is what I do when my brother calls and tells me I have to pay attention.

1405
01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:17.490
I go,
okay,
pat.
Yeah,
sure.
Bad.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's fine.

1406
01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:22.020
Yeah.
So since uh,
last comic standing,

1407
01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:25.590
how much of an impact did that have on like people coming out to see you?

1408
01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:31.470
Uh,
well,
it got people that watch prime time.

1409
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:35.910
They usually have kids and real jobs and go to bed and don't stay up and watch

1410
01:21:35.911 --> 01:21:39.120
Letterman and Leno.
It exposed me to new people,

1411
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:41.130
but it's not like,

1412
01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:45.570
that's why everybody is getting way too excited when we're doing the show.
Well,

1413
01:21:45.571 --> 01:21:46.770
I'm going to do this,
I'm going to do this.

1414
01:21:46.771 --> 01:21:48.710
I'm going to tell this guy to go fuck himself now,
man.

1415
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:53.460
Like thinking that this is just another step in a giant staircase.

1416
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:56.940
It's not a is it,
you're not going to leap anywhere from this.

1417
01:21:56.941 --> 01:22:00.810
You got to build on it and everybody just needs to know what it is for now.

1418
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:04.660
Who got the biggest from that show,
if you have ever imagined what,
who,

1419
01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:07.260
who had the biggest,
who had the biggest impact?

1420
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:10.890
I would say the person that got the most out of it was Ralphie May.

1421
01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:16.560
He's the one he worked at and always an advantage.
Uh,

1422
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:21.360
being a big fat guy,
you're recognizable liking seriously.

1423
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:26.700
I get Fiko walking around an airport with John Pinette,
every single person,

1424
01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:32.070
all my God,
you're the buffet guy cause they saw him.
Oh Ron White.

1425
01:22:32.071 --> 01:22:36.700
He's huge runs.
Luke can get lost in a crowd.
I,

1426
01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.100
I'm,
I'm a dwarf.

1427
01:22:38.101 --> 01:22:40.590
Nobody even sees me walking in if I have a baseball hat and forget it.

1428
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.780
But the recognizable,

1429
01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:47.430
and then Ralphie worked hard and worked it and I think he's still,

1430
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:51.570
a lot of his people came to him through that.
I had already,

1431
01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:56.170
there's a lot of good people just didn't capitalize well,
they capitalize.

1432
01:22:56.190 --> 01:23:00.230
But I don't really know that they could have what,
you know,
what's,

1433
01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:03.780
I have oil and then some were just not stable.

1434
01:23:05.490 --> 01:23:06.370
I mean,
you know,

1435
01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:10.270
well how many communities are some of them out on the road alone,
right?

1436
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:15.070
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
You know,
I won't mention it.

1437
01:23:15.071 --> 01:23:17.800
I mean the one guy would still just be wandering around Nashville.

1438
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:19.600
You know what I mean?
Like you,
you can't allow that.

1439
01:23:19.601 --> 01:23:23.470
You'd have to send a handler or something because they or some of them hadn't

1440
01:23:23.471 --> 01:23:28.000
done the road at Knopf and you just kept going wherever your career was.

1441
01:23:28.001 --> 01:23:30.160
That's where you're going to just keep going.
But people,

1442
01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.300
there were some people on the show.

1443
01:23:31.301 --> 01:23:35.800
I think that these ideas that just because we're really famous right now.

1444
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:41.020
Yes,
we're very recognizable right now.
This doesn't mean it's going to last.
No,

1445
01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:43.450
nothing does.
Nothing lasts.

1446
01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.860
<v 5>It was interesting seeing guys like Jane London,</v>

1447
01:23:45.861 --> 01:23:48.790
like get this big bump and all of a sudden we were hanging out with this comedy

1448
01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:51.680
store and people come up to him and ask him to take pictures.
I was like,
wow.

1449
01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:52.543
And you know,

1450
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:57.350
I told you I did my first TV show with Jay and like 92 so it was wild to see

1451
01:23:57.351 --> 01:24:00.390
that it was wild to see like all of a sudden things were happening

1452
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:03.620
<v 4>and how many people really like fell in love with Jay?</v>

1453
01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:08.570
Like they were all that was their guy at his stuff is quirky and funny and
weird.

1454
01:24:08.571 --> 01:24:12.410
He,
I just didn't know there were that many.
I think your fans reflect your act.

1455
01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:17.780
I didn't understand that there were that many people as weird as Jay.

1456
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:20.540
Well he's not in a bad way,
right?
No,
he's very funny.

1457
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:24.250
It's just if I saw the whole show,
uh,

1458
01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:28.610
Jay wouldn't be the,
the one I would have written fan mail to first.

1459
01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:31.670
It's not say the wrong thing.
He's funny.
He is funny,

1460
01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:36.980
but I don't connect with him and like,
it was hard.
I tried to,

1461
01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.550
he's so sweet,
but I dunno.

1462
01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:46.340
<v 2>Yeah.
God,
welcome back to the liquid.</v>

1463
01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:51.320
<v 4>This makes me don't play this.
Okay.
Yeah,
I can watch.</v>

1464
01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.500
That's how bad it was.
Like Vietnam,
that's how bad that experience was.

1465
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:57.200
It wasn't really that bad.
Yeah.
I don't usually,
I don't,

1466
01:24:57.350 --> 01:25:02.000
I don't being trapped in the house for a month get well just we don't own that.

1467
01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:06.470
They just ruined it because I thought it was going to be fun.
I love Todd glass.

1468
01:25:06.471 --> 01:25:08.270
I love John Half.
Ron were friends,

1469
01:25:08.850 --> 01:25:10.920
<v 5>fun and just hanging out in the house together.
But then once you got there,</v>

1470
01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:12.060
the artificial drama.

1471
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:16.420
<v 4>Yeah they want to take,
they took away.
We had no phones,
no Internet,</v>

1472
01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:19.060
no newspaper.
Because that would date the episode.

1473
01:25:19.061 --> 01:25:22.120
If I'm reading the newspaper it says USA Today,
Blah Blah.

1474
01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:26.890
A book and a Yes,
but you had to put your on book covers on them.

1475
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:30.150
So yeah,
but then you get in trouble for reading.
Come on,

1476
01:25:30.170 --> 01:25:33.620
we got another challenge for you guys.
And then they drive us challenge.
Yeah,

1477
01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:34.840
we had to go do challenges.

1478
01:25:34.841 --> 01:25:38.020
They were terrible and they were know what kind of challenges ill thought out.

1479
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:41.170
So they owned you guys for a month?
Yeah,
we were their slaves.

1480
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.380
You couldn't leave if you left,
you would get,
so I said,

1481
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:45.880
what happens if I leave the property if I run away?

1482
01:25:45.881 --> 01:25:47.860
Is there like a guard tower while I get shot.

1483
01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:50.400
Is this like Hogan's heroes and there's somebody in,

1484
01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:55.810
because we were in some castle up in the Brentwood Canyon with did they use to

1485
01:25:55.811 --> 01:25:58.840
shoot porn?
I guess it,
they rent this place out.
It's filthy.

1486
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.620
It was filthy to his gross.
Um,
they said,

1487
01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:06.470
well you'll your contract and then we'll sue you cause I really did think I'm

1488
01:26:06.471 --> 01:26:08.480
just going to run away.
I can't do this anymore.

1489
01:26:08.481 --> 01:26:12.560
I don't care enough to go through this.
If they would sue.
Did anybody leave?

1490
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:15.770
Did anybody try it?
No,

1491
01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:19.640
but I thought you could also say medical reasons.
Yeah.
Total.
Right.

1492
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:21.900
Eat something bad gets fucked.

1493
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:25.340
They would bring you back cause somebody like broke their leg I think or

1494
01:26:25.341 --> 01:26:28.220
something and they went and fixed it and brought him back.

1495
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:32.820
May Not have been a serious,
is breaking a leg but fell.
We couldn't uh,

1496
01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:35.660
go on the treadmill because that made too much noise for the filming.

1497
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:39.680
We were so bored.
And then you try to,
me and John,

1498
01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:43.820
let's go hike.
We can't,
let's exercise.

1499
01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.760
You can't exercise while,

1500
01:26:46.761 --> 01:26:49.670
unless you can think of something to do besides the treadmill or the basketball

1501
01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:54.620
court.
I don't get it cause it all made the machines make too much noise.

1502
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:59.270
Really?
Yup.
They're filming all the time.
24 hours.
24 hours a day.

1503
01:26:59.271 --> 01:27:03.680
There's a camera above my bed is ridiculous.
Crazy above your bed.

1504
01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.120
So you couldn't masturbate?
No.
Well you had to sleep.
How to sleep full clothes.

1505
01:27:08.121 --> 01:27:12.830
I'm not going on in America.
I'm not going on TV.
I'm not a super bottle.

1506
01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:16.370
This is not happening so quick.
And they,
you couldn't talk about anything.

1507
01:27:16.371 --> 01:27:18.230
So Tammy and I shared a room,

1508
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:22.580
Pesky telly and we would write notes on the toilet paper.
I mean like prisoners.

1509
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:26.840
Like I would say this is what,
this is the plan,
this is what we're going to do.

1510
01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:30.380
And then she would okay it and then we'd flush the toilet paper down the thing

1511
01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.300
cause they didn't have a camera.

1512
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:34.460
The only place it could have a camera was in the bathroom.
That's ridiculous.

1513
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:38.190
Yeah.
It's not what people,
yeah,
that's insane.

1514
01:27:38.230 --> 01:27:41.330
I can't even believe people agree to do that.
We didn't know.

1515
01:27:41.331 --> 01:27:44.810
We didn't know what they were gonna do.
Did anybody step up and say,
listen,

1516
01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.410
we know what it was.
It became like,
uh,
how I would envision you.

1517
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:53.450
Um,
they call it like when you get a patty Hearst,
when you brainwash people,

1518
01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:58.100
it's a very slow yeah.
You,
you know,
first it's like,

1519
01:27:58.101 --> 01:28:00.320
here's where you're gonna live and you'd think,
oh,
okay.
Right.

1520
01:28:00.321 --> 01:28:04.310
You see this big castle up in the hills.
This will be fun every step of the way.

1521
01:28:04.311 --> 01:28:08.390
I still had hope for fun and they would just shoot the hope right out of the

1522
01:28:08.391 --> 01:28:12.650
barrel.
And it was just,
it was just absolutely,
it was torture.
Awful.

1523
01:28:12.651 --> 01:28:16.230
I didn't think you can make me not have fun with Todd glass.
How did that,

1524
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:19.160
how did,
how did you manage that?
Nobody is more fun than Todd.

1525
01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:24.350
How many seasons they do that thing?
Uh,
I think I judged the one after that.

1526
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:27.780
That was three and then four,
they stopped doing that.

1527
01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:31.970
The house thing around fourth thing.
Yeah.
But that's where it got weird.

1528
01:28:33.370 --> 01:28:37.160
Yeah.
He hosted it when I judged it.
Yeah.
Well,

1529
01:28:37.161 --> 01:28:40.730
how come you didn't keep doing it?
I don't know.
No idea.

1530
01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.050
If they would have let all the comedians have what they want.
Like you said,

1531
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:47.570
let me have my wine like half rotten.

1532
01:28:47.571 --> 01:28:50.330
I have his beard so that the pot guys have their pot,
whatever.

1533
01:28:50.331 --> 01:28:54.560
And then just film us talking a conversation.
That's funny.

1534
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:59.480
But no,
everything was organized and just the challenges were so degrading.

1535
01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:02.880
We had to go to comedy in front of five year olds.

1536
01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.650
<v 3>Why is that was a challenge.
Yeah.</v>

1537
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:10.410
<v 4>Uh,
and I actually won that one cause I didn't do comedy.</v>

1538
01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:13.800
I just told them a story and they liked to me best.
It's all,
you know,
it's like,

1539
01:29:13.801 --> 01:29:16.530
well,
is a kid going to like me?
I just,

1540
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:21.660
we would never do that and stand up comedy.
I would never accept,
uh,

1541
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:25.020
money to perform at a five year old's birthday party.
It's like a,

1542
01:29:25.021 --> 01:29:28.260
it's like call the clown in Northampton.
He's available.

1543
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:32.460
It's not just terrible challenges that made no sense.

1544
01:29:32.461 --> 01:29:37.020
They're not connected to our job.
Well,
one was like a do a,

1545
01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:39.630
and this was that.
It did make me laugh,
uh,

1546
01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:45.300
to go through what a Hollywood in one of the tour buses and be the funny tour

1547
01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:45.601
guide,

1548
01:29:45.601 --> 01:29:50.580
but these are people who actually paid so they don't really want to watch my

1549
01:29:50.581 --> 01:29:54.690
lame attempt at being funny about this tour.

1550
01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:59.160
Aunt did it for a living though before he was a comic.
Aunts was great.

1551
01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:03.030
I sat there and listened and I was like,
Oh man,
I go,
that was a great tour,

1552
01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:06.810
but I didn't know he did for a living and then he told me he made half of it up

1553
01:30:06.811 --> 01:30:07.860
anyway and I go,
well,

1554
01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:10.680
what would be the difference for a tourist if you told me that was Dolly Parton

1555
01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:11.101
Song?
I'd be like,
oh,

1556
01:30:11.101 --> 01:30:14.220
I thought that like though it doesn't really matter if it's Sally part,
it's all,

1557
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:16.110
if I think I saw it,
then I saw it.

1558
01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:19.860
<v 3>Let's you get that one wise ass and the crowd that knows that's not Dolly</v>

1559
01:30:19.861 --> 01:30:23.430
Parton's home.
Right,
right.
He'd need another two blocks away.

1560
01:30:23.431 --> 01:30:27.570
You don't even know what you're talking about.
My Star maps as original

1561
01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:29.760
<v 4>that where you're like,
wow,</v>

1562
01:30:29.761 --> 01:30:34.140
you have totally managed to make me hate myself.

1563
01:30:34.170 --> 01:30:36.480
My job,
my choice for being here.

1564
01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:37.540
<v 3>There's a way to do it though.</v>

1565
01:30:37.630 --> 01:30:40.700
This is a way to do a reality show with standup comedians more.

1566
01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:41.534
It could be really fun.

1567
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:46.120
<v 4>There is definitely way it.
If somebody would go pitch it you,</v>

1568
01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:47.260
they know you well enough.

1569
01:30:47.261 --> 01:30:52.261
Do you have power go in and every network it has 13 million people watching it

1570
01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:56.050
per episode in summer.
That's unheard of.
They,

1571
01:30:56.290 --> 01:31:01.030
when they say American idol's ratings are crap,
they've fallen to 19 I'm like,

1572
01:31:01.031 --> 01:31:02.950
we had 13 as comics.

1573
01:31:03.370 --> 01:31:07.120
<v 3>American idol's ratings are crap falling every year.
They just keep falling.</v>

1574
01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:11.260
Really?
This TV,
you know people are tired of it.

1575
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:14.380
Everyone still have 19 million fucking people.
That's is there anyone?

1576
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:18.910
Is there anybody left?
It has an audition.
Come on.
I mean it has an audit.
Oh,

1577
01:31:18.911 --> 01:31:23.500
hasn't all his shit growing up who've watched American idol a known that this

1578
01:31:23.501 --> 01:31:25.630
was their chance.
Is that breakout moment?
This is it.

1579
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:27.880
That's a really good argument.

1580
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:32.600
I think the judging because once you break up the initial judges,
you know,

1581
01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:33.690
I loved Paula.

1582
01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:38.920
You can't get rid of her pills out of her mind being know what was going on.

1583
01:31:39.011 --> 01:31:43.390
Seeing that much drinking on TV since bewitched.
I loved it.

1584
01:31:43.391 --> 01:31:47.290
And she literally for booze,
right.
You guys have to buy,

1585
01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:50.940
it's in a height Hakan Song here.

1586
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:54.950
Just guards.
That's,
and that was it.

1587
01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:59.830
Yeah.
That's the good shit wasn't with things.

1588
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.200
<v 4>Yeah.
Don't know what the matter was,
but I liked it.</v>

1589
01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:05.760
Whatever the matter was more of it.
And then to let her go.
I'm like,
yeah.

1590
01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:10.480
<v 6>Uh,
if somebody hasn't done though the proper reality show with comics yet,</v>

1591
01:32:10.481 --> 01:32:12.160
they haven't done it.
They haven't figured it out.

1592
01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:16.050
The best parts of my show or me and Dunkin hanging around in my,

1593
01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:20.230
the one I thought was the best part is the funnest part was just me and Dunkin

1594
01:32:20.231 --> 01:32:23.450
investigating Ufos,
bigfoot and shit together,
just goofing around me.

1595
01:32:23.451 --> 01:32:25.700
It just so happened that we were looking for bigfoot.

1596
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.470
What was fun was hanging out with Dunkin.

1597
01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:30.450
<v 4>Right.
Did you see the new big foot footprint today?</v>

1598
01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.750
<v 6>Does it look good bro?</v>

1599
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:39.950
I believe that new big foot print and the dead Shoup AQAP or last week.

1600
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:43.620
That was interesting.
The guy who shot that,

1601
01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:48.030
that thing that he said was a Chupacabra in Mississippi.
A raccoon or something.

1602
01:32:48.290 --> 01:32:51.420
Um,
no,
I don't think they know what the fuck it is.

1603
01:32:51.421 --> 01:32:56.220
They think it's like a coyote with a mange.
But uh,
but it was really fresh.

1604
01:32:56.221 --> 01:32:59.090
The body was really fresh after each shot.
It like he was poking it.

1605
01:32:59.091 --> 01:33:02.490
It was still pliable.
Hooves.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

1606
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:06.300
Well it has long claws.
New Chewbacca.
What are you saying?

1607
01:33:06.301 --> 01:33:08.070
You think it's a Chupa carver?
Is that what you're telling me?

1608
01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:11.880
We're gonna think it's real.
And you liked the Armadillo dare moving north.

1609
01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:17.340
He started,
they started in Mexico.
Chupa cobre in the news.

1610
01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:22.740
The trooper cover a video
camera with them.
Look good.

1611
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:27.990
Chupacabra really man shot at you because it was on CNN,
right?

1612
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:32.430
I saw it on Huffington Post.
Yeah.
Post huff post.
Okay.

1613
01:33:33.690 --> 01:33:34.523
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1614
01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:38.600
<v 6>Yeah.
There it is.</v>

1615
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:44.770
August 27th this silly bitch has a video fill this Canyon k captures Texas blue

1616
01:33:48.201 --> 01:33:50.750
dog possibly.
Chupacabra

1617
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:52.423
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1618
01:33:52.450 --> 01:33:54.090
<v 7>Oh,
this is another one.
I don't really count.</v>

1619
01:33:54.091 --> 01:33:57.190
It kills a mysterious animal and a repurpose chicken coop this morning.

1620
01:33:57.191 --> 01:34:01.750
And some people in the area say it could be the mythical to macabre have a

1621
01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:06.670
hairless creature was killed in a pig town.
[inaudible] Mississippi,

1622
01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:09.490
new Shovel Coal Jacob kiddle set takes us there.
But first,

1623
01:34:09.491 --> 01:34:10.540
if you're just a little squeamish,

1624
01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:13.480
you may want to look away if the story contains some graphic images.

1625
01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:17.250
<v 6>Hmm.
Suffering.
It's like attack</v>

1626
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:23.520
<v 4>armed with his 22 Matt Hugh Harrell was coon hunting when he saw the red eyes</v>

1627
01:34:24.101 --> 01:34:28.240
and the,
hey,
this wasn't,
I mean he wouldn't have,
hey,
we're das hold like a cat.

1628
01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:33.160
And unlike a typical coyote,
the beast moved to attack.
Oh,

1629
01:34:33.170 --> 01:34:36.160
when I was standing right,
John Right here.
We were like,

1630
01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:38.500
he was sending jumped down there and I didn't even change.

1631
01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.190
<v 8>He brought her down here and showed a 10 man,
which my labor,</v>

1632
01:34:41.191 --> 01:34:46.110
when he a child got chicken houses and uh,
he said he's seen it.

1633
01:34:46.111 --> 01:34:48.550
Don't walk two or three times in the city.
Wrong.

1634
01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:52.040
Funny is funny and we're lower than this.
Back in.

1635
01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:57.340
I said it was one them cool combos or whatever and

1636
01:34:58.930 --> 01:35:03.770
<v 4>I'll [inaudible] July here.
It's still alive.</v>

1637
01:35:03.771 --> 01:35:05.510
She is almost without hair.

1638
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:10.310
Nails longer than a dog's on its paws and a build online,
not one animal.

1639
01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:11.900
A local scene in the area.

1640
01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:16.670
<v 9>Oh,
oh,
oh my dog.
Even one a day and then my dog was scared of it.</v>

1641
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:21.910
<v 4>Chupacabra Spanish work literally translated as suck goat for the mythic</v>

1642
01:35:23.291 --> 01:35:24.124
creature.
Attacks,

1643
01:35:24.130 --> 01:35:28.840
livestock draining blood by chomping down on to farm animals flesh.

1644
01:35:31.690 --> 01:35:33.440
Wow.
That's some good watermelon.
Anyway,

1645
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:37.370
it's the Department of Wildlife and fisheries says that this to Pecan

1646
01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:38.773
<v 10>right</v>

1647
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:43.240
<v 4>play more likely a wild dog or coyote with mange,</v>

1648
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:46.370
but the locals are not having any of it.
I don't really know why.

1649
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:48.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1650
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:51.370
<v 4>I mean you look at it,
I never signed the Blue Code.</v>

1651
01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:55.530
Matt says he dismissed the mains explanation.
The moment he shouted

1652
01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:59.410
<v 9>and I'll read on my gun and I walked over my shine a light down our oh shit,</v>

1653
01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:03.230
my God.
I said,
well,
and I unload it again or make sure you will.

1654
01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.090
<v 4>And based on the late of the Hay in the barn,</v>

1655
01:36:07.330 --> 01:36:10.080
another rumor has also started going around,
well,

1656
01:36:10.081 --> 01:36:12.560
it's weird to me and I figured out for more

1657
01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.980
you answers in Lee County back to you.

1658
01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:20.640
<v 6>Well,
what's interesting is that thing looks exactly like these other ones that</v>

1659
01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:22.950
they've shot.
Yeah,
yeah.
There's more,

1660
01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:26.280
I mean there's more than one that look like really similar,

1661
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:28.140
almost exactly the same.
And the deck,

1662
01:36:28.141 --> 01:36:32.130
I looks exactly like Dale Earnhardt Jr so probably is real.
Yeah,
right.

1663
01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:36.350
He's real and so is that it was a fucking real animal or coyote type animal that

1664
01:36:36.351 --> 01:36:39.600
they just hadn't discovered yet.
There's the trooper Cabo really was real.

1665
01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:42.080
Did he's a mix between uh,
uh,

1666
01:36:42.090 --> 01:36:46.500
Mexican wolf and then some sort of coyote.
Well,

1667
01:36:46.501 --> 01:36:51.501
what's interesting is they found a really recently in America,

1668
01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:54.840
they found Jaguars that have made it up from South America.

1669
01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.760
They're starting to find here in Phoenix,

1670
01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:01.390
they're finding out I'm on camera traps.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
We'll here.

1671
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:05.610
I'll pull up.
So you could say,
I'll pull up some pictures.
Jaguar in Phoenix

1672
01:37:07.450 --> 01:37:08.890
<v 2>or in Arizona.</v>

1673
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:14.700
<v 6>What's the difference for Jaguar and a Puma?
Puma is a cougars.</v>

1674
01:37:14.730 --> 01:37:17.900
Mountain Lion.
A Jaguar is a much larger animal.
A little looser.

1675
01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:19.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1676
01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:22.680
<v 6>A little more dangerous.
A Jaguar is more dangerous than a lion.</v>

1677
01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:26.520
No more or less dangerous than a mountain lion.
Yeah.
See there,
they're spotted.

1678
01:37:26.521 --> 01:37:30.900
They were crazy.
The catching,
they're finding these in Arizona.
Oh,
shut up.

1679
01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:36.120
You could see it.
Wow.
Yeah.
That's a camera trap.

1680
01:37:36.121 --> 01:37:40.770
Photo in Arizona with a fucking giant South American cat.

1681
01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.020
Well,
that's,
you know,
the whole,
do you know they're black too?

1682
01:37:46.021 --> 01:37:50.820
Sometimes.
This is one that's in northern Mexico.
Look at that.
Oh my God.

1683
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:54.360
Yeah.
They found that close to the United States border and they've,
uh,

1684
01:37:54.361 --> 01:37:57.840
there's been some of Jaguars Black Jaguars in America.

1685
01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.650
They haven't been substantiated.
They don't know whether or not they're out.

1686
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:05.370
They actually legit.
Uh,
Jamie.
Um,

1687
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:09.060
but they,
uh,
they know they're making it up here.

1688
01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:12.270
There's a lot of photographs of them in Arizona.
Oh look,
here's another one.

1689
01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:16.560
Oh my God.
They're fucking huge.
Yeah.

1690
01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:18.390
They were like way bigger than a mountain line.

1691
01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:23.400
<v 4>Uh,
you know,
I,
I was teasing Lou,
we did this big golf thing,</v>

1692
01:38:23.401 --> 01:38:25.350
charity thing,
and in Phoenix I said,

1693
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:27.950
we're staying at this place where the CASITA's are way out in the middle.

1694
01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:32.280
You follow these paths?
I go,
careful,
careful of the hub.
Aleena's and he said,

1695
01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:36.450
what is that?
And I said,
they're tiny pigs at a tag you in the night.
He was like,

1696
01:38:36.451 --> 01:38:38.340
you're totally making that up.
I said,
no,

1697
01:38:38.341 --> 01:38:41.480
I'm not Google it beat people think I'm making it up.
I'm not

1698
01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:45.670
<v 6>the New Mexico to Jaguars in New Mexico.</v>

1699
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:52.180
They say they're using the same routes that the drug dealers use.
Probably.
Yeah.

1700
01:38:52.181 --> 01:38:52.961
Well that's what they're saying.

1701
01:38:52.961 --> 01:38:56.500
They're saying you shouldn't clan to the same clan to Stein routes as drug

1702
01:38:56.501 --> 01:39:00.550
smugglers.
Male Jaguars are crossing into the United States from Mexico

1703
01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:04.650
<v 4>illegally.
No paperwork.
Exactly.
And they're fuck.</v>

1704
01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.610
So wait,
that thing is bigger than a lion mountain lion.
Bigger than a mountain.

1705
01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:13.600
It's bigger than a mountain lion.
Yes.
Wow.
Yeah.
Let's say Jaguar.

1706
01:39:15.490 --> 01:39:19.640
<v 6>There's not a thing.
There are about 200 pounds.
Hot.</v>

1707
01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:22.530
See the cat not the car.
You fuck heads.

1708
01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:27.360
Wikipedia wants me to send me to Jaguar USA.
What's the average weight?

1709
01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:28.620
That's a big cat.

1710
01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:36.700
I didn't find anything because you're a dumb cunt.
Siri.
Siri,

1711
01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:37.593
you useless.

1712
01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:41.490
<v 4>Oh,
asked the Google Person My,
I betcha they know more.</v>

1713
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:42.663
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1714
01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:45.070
<v 4>Let's see.
I don't remember how to do it.</v>

1715
01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.960
What's the average weight of a Jaguar?

1716
01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:54.260
<v 6>350 pounds.
They can weigh as much as 350 pounds,</v>

1717
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:55.350
larger

1718
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:57.810
<v 4>mail.
It's just did it gave me an answer right there.
Yeah.</v>

1719
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:59.590
I don't have the sound on or you could have heard it.
Yeah.

1720
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:04.940
<v 6>Weights are normally in the range of 90 56 to 96 kilograms,</v>

1721
01:40:04.941 --> 01:40:07.010
which is 124 to 211 pounds.

1722
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:12.310
Larger males had been recorded to weigh as much as 350 pounds or 160 kilograms

1723
01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:16.430
roughly matching a Tigris or Elias.

1724
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:20.780
So the males grow to the same size as a female lion.

1725
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:24.980
That's how big male Jaguars are.
That's a big fucking cat.

1726
01:40:25.210 --> 01:40:29.020
<v 4>Yeah.
Because my brother's afraid to go hunting in Missouri because he's secretly</v>

1727
01:40:29.021 --> 01:40:31.390
afraid of mountain lions.
But he won't tell my dad,
Dad,

1728
01:40:31.391 --> 01:40:34.600
cause my dad would make fun of them.
So when you're going out in the morning,

1729
01:40:34.601 --> 01:40:38.680
it's dark in the woods.
There are trail cams in Missouri with pictures of,

1730
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.910
they're all about 200 pounds.
So yeah,
Mountain Lion,
Missouri.

1731
01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:48.000
<v 6>Yeah,
I saw one in Santa Barbara,
some mountain line in Monosito.</v>

1732
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:50.250
Shut up man.
Driving down the street wasn't a big one.

1733
01:40:50.251 --> 01:40:54.130
It was probably about 80 70 80 pounds.
But I saw bounding across the street.

1734
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.270
It was fucking loud,
like dark out.
And I thought it was a coyote for a second.

1735
01:40:58.271 --> 01:41:01.750
And then I saw its tail,
Mike,
that's a cat tail and I'm like,
oh my God,

1736
01:41:01.751 --> 01:41:04.630
it's a mountain lion running across the street real quick.

1737
01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:11.190
<v 4>I went golfing with my dad in Florida and if my mom,
my mom's afraid of dogs,</v>

1738
01:41:11.191 --> 01:41:14.460
my mom's afraid of everything.
But I went with him and we were on a whole,

1739
01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:18.300
it was a golf course like in a queue.
So it's well developed community,

1740
01:41:18.301 --> 01:41:20.820
like a subdivision.
And I said,
what is that?

1741
01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.470
And I saw this thing coming towards the tee box and it was sauntering like,

1742
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:29.670
and he's like,
that saw Bob Mountain Lion.
And I said,

1743
01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:34.140
I at that sure is and we need to get in the cart and get the fuck outta here.

1744
01:41:34.590 --> 01:41:35.131
But it just,

1745
01:41:35.131 --> 01:41:39.060
it walked as if it was just going to play the hall and then it kept walking and

1746
01:41:39.061 --> 01:41:43.110
I was like,
wow.
Well apparently in the swamps now down there,

1747
01:41:43.170 --> 01:41:47.190
the panthers are out of control in Florida,
completely out of hand,

1748
01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:50.370
real along with the pythons,
the pythons in the pants.
There's,
because every,

1749
01:41:50.371 --> 01:41:51.960
I don't know how the panther thing started,

1750
01:41:51.961 --> 01:41:55.320
but the python from the people dumping their pets that they couldn't end up

1751
01:41:55.321 --> 01:41:59.460
taking care of and now they're allowing people to go on python haunts.
I'm like,

1752
01:41:59.490 --> 01:42:02.100
I don't really think,
if you don't know how to do that,
you should do that.

1753
01:42:02.130 --> 01:42:05.390
They should do that.
Let him,
let him,
let him,
let him like weed them out.

1754
01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:10.350
<v 6>So many fucking people.
Anyway,
I let him go,
well,
we're Finna go pass on hunting.</v>

1755
01:42:11.130 --> 01:42:13.770
There's they,
they're having a real hard time with that though.

1756
01:42:13.771 --> 01:42:15.860
They can't find them.
They're having a really hard,

1757
01:42:15.970 --> 01:42:18.850
<v 4>I know.
So they were sending the idiots out and they are finding them.</v>

1758
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:21.730
It's the same like those two guys.
Did you see the alligator,

1759
01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:25.650
the largest one ever?
Just like dice.
We'd call it by those two guys.

1760
01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:28.630
<v 6>Well,
large one in Mississippi.
Yeah.
More.
Well,</v>

1761
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:32.110
in two in one day they broke their same record.

1762
01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:36.010
They're broke the world record in will the state record in Mississippi and one

1763
01:42:36.011 --> 01:42:39.790
day it was like 600 something pounds and then two people on the same day caught

1764
01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.350
more than 700 pounders.

1765
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:46.230
<v 4>Wow.
They're so big to carry guys.
I was in South Carolina,</v>

1766
01:42:46.231 --> 01:42:49.560
queue up golf in with Lou and there there's alligators everywhere.
I go,

1767
01:42:49.561 --> 01:42:53.670
but who eats the alligator?
Who kills you?
Alligator.
He goes,
other alligators.

1768
01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:56.910
I said,
no way.
They're cannibals.
He goes,
oh yeah.
He goes,

1769
01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:01.680
they dominate a pond like on a golf course in the swampy golf courses that they,

1770
01:43:01.770 --> 01:43:05.730
they dominate a pond.
And then if anyone knew alligators come to their pond,

1771
01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:09.120
they just eat them.
So who's their natural predator?

1772
01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:12.620
Except did you see the video of that mount line taken out and the alligator or

1773
01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:15.300
not?
Or what are the common South America?
Not An alligator I can be in.

1774
01:43:15.301 --> 01:43:19.770
Or a Cayman.
Cayman.
Yeah.
Uh,
that it's a Jaguar.

1775
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:22.080
It's not a video.
It's pictures and you see him.

1776
01:43:22.170 --> 01:43:23.280
<v 6>That's a Jaguar.
Okay.</v>

1777
01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:25.740
One of the animals is getting into it doesn't have spots though.

1778
01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:28.050
They don't always have spa.
Okay.
Black ones too.

1779
01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:31.080
<v 4>Okay,
well that thing took down an alligator and they go,
finally,</v>

1780
01:43:31.110 --> 01:43:34.620
here's a predator.
Because who's their predator?

1781
01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:37.340
Why aren't there millions and millions in first?

1782
01:43:37.610 --> 01:43:39.890
<v 6>That's a small crocodile to those Caymans.
Yeah,</v>

1783
01:43:39.891 --> 01:43:44.390
it's Jaguar eating and Cayman car.
These are actually a couple of youtube videos.

1784
01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:48.380
One control that,
if he can pull that up,
that is,
yeah,

1785
01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:52.060
they're fucking ferocious cats.
Yeah.
And this is what

1786
01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:52.893
<v 0>I hear</v>

1787
01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.790
key.
Oh Wow.
Fuck these animals,
man.

1788
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:04.720
Eight spectacular looking though.
It is.
I mean,
I wouldn't want to see it,

1789
01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:07.510
but look at that fucking creepy thing.
If I was standing,

1790
01:44:07.570 --> 01:44:11.020
he blends right in so well.
Of course.
He's a tall,

1791
01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:17.140
let's go baby crocodile by the head,
dragging it out of the water.

1792
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:22.470
Wow.
Yeah.
They eat them.
I mean,
that's how bad as they are.

1793
01:44:22.471 --> 01:44:25.620
They eat crocodiles now.
Tough fucking crocodile skin is.

1794
01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:27.780
These fuckers just chew right through it.

1795
01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.113
<v 2>Wow.</v>

1796
01:44:32.610 --> 01:44:36.810
<v 0>Yeah.
That is a big fucking cat,
man.</v>

1797
01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:41.370
That's a really big fucking cat.
Well,
and they say they'll stalk us.
Oh,

1798
01:44:41.371 --> 01:44:42.900
fuck you people.

1799
01:44:42.930 --> 01:44:46.180
The only reason why they don't is because they don't do it all the time that

1800
01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:48.930
they did it all the time.
If you're used to killing people,
they would.

1801
01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:51.570
That would be on the menu.
They're not ethical.

1802
01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:55.560
Like people have this ridiculous idea that while they don't even eat people,

1803
01:44:55.590 --> 01:45:00.270
they don't just don't know about it yet.
It's a delicacy they've heard of.

1804
01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:04.030
They just love it.

1805
01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:08.280
It's that everyday menu add becomes a huge problem in any area where they do

1806
01:45:08.281 --> 01:45:12.190
have that already go down.
That's already went down.

1807
01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:13.440
Once you show the attack part,

1808
01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:18.970
it becomes a real problem in any area where big cats find out that they can eat

1809
01:45:18.971 --> 01:45:21.730
people.
That's what that movie,
that ghost in the darkness was about.

1810
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:27.220
These lions got a taste of,
oh shit,
whoa.
Look how fast this mother fucker moves.

1811
01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:28.083
Wow.

1812
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:31.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1813
01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.740
<v 0>They only have it in slow motion or they show it in full speed.</v>

1814
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.290
Is this full be no,
the run running their only show him awesome.

1815
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:44.000
It's too bad
when you see them move,

1816
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:47.570
like pounce on something.
You see how quick that they can cover distance.

1817
01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:51.980
There's one,
um,
look up.
This Jaguar eats copy Barra,

1818
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:56.990
Jaguar kills copy Barra.
What's a copy of Bobby bar is a giant rodent,

1819
01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:00.920
a huge road and like a hundred pound rodent that lives in the Amazon and Jaguars

1820
01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:05.210
eat them and they stock them when these people catch them all the time because

1821
01:46:05.211 --> 01:46:05.880
the coffee bar,

1822
01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:10.430
a feed like right on the shore and the Jaguar sneak through the grass right on

1823
01:46:10.431 --> 01:46:13.070
the shore and it happens on film all the time.

1824
01:46:13.290 --> 01:46:17.510
Whether they just come bum rush these giant rats,
it's a fuck them up.

1825
01:46:17.511 --> 01:46:20.830
Look at this.
Look how creepy that motherfucker has to be moving.

1826
01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:26.090
Those are so terrifying.
Look how creepy he is.
And then he'd just sprints

1827
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:31.260
and there's a cabinet bar.
Yup.

1828
01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:36.300
Look at that role like gator roll.
He just did my hold it on that things neck.

1829
01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:39.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1830
01:46:39.010 --> 01:46:42.190
<v 0>He's got it by the face,
man.
He doesn't even have him by the neck.</v>

1831
01:46:42.191 --> 01:46:46.390
He hasn't by his face.
Just dragging them into the woods where he fucks him up.

1832
01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:49.890
There's a few videos like this.
That's this a pretty good one.

1833
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:55.560
But there's a gang of these videos.
It happens all the time.
There's a,

1834
01:46:55.561 --> 01:46:57.930
there's a great one.
Where gets it in the water?

1835
01:46:59.070 --> 01:46:59.903
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1836
01:47:00.250 --> 01:47:04.260
<v 0>Is Coffee Bar.
They have those things at the Santa Monica.</v>

1837
01:47:04.261 --> 01:47:08.930
Is the or the San Diego Zoo?
Uh,
no.
Yeah,
I think so.
Well,
no,

1838
01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:12.410
I'm Santa Barbara there.
About which ones though?
The coffee bars,

1839
01:47:12.411 --> 01:47:15.500
they have those things.
They're like the same as a nutria.
Yeah,

1840
01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:17.810
no bigger way bigger.
Oh yeah.
Look at this.

1841
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:19.640
This one doesn't even know that fucking things.

1842
01:47:19.641 --> 01:47:23.900
They're looking at just wandering around like a dumb ass dude tutor to do a

1843
01:47:23.901 --> 01:47:27.420
giant rent.
What's that thing right there?
Just pick,
pick,
pick.

1844
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:33.540
<v 3>Oh my God.
At these people in the,
yeah.
Those people are right there.
Oh well.</v>

1845
01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:35.330
Like Holy Shit.

1846
01:47:37.130 --> 01:47:40.460
<v 0>He just ran into the water to gang them.
I'm looking at him.</v>

1847
01:47:40.461 --> 01:47:44.810
He's way out there with a rat in his mouth,
a giant rat,

1848
01:47:44.811 --> 01:47:48.320
and he's going to swim to shore and I would not be standing.
Well,

1849
01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:51.470
it's just such a weird thing that things willing to go into the water and kill.

1850
01:47:51.471 --> 01:47:53.570
Why isn't it going get you?
Yeah.
Right.

1851
01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:57.110
Look at this and it just kills it right in front of these fucking people.

1852
01:47:57.111 --> 01:48:00.740
It doesn't give a flying fuck that there's two boats there with cameras and guns

1853
01:48:00.741 --> 01:48:05.420
and shit.
Does that black,
is that a black one?
Yeah,
it's a dark,
dark one at least.

1854
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:10.300
And they vary.
Yeah,
it's mighty too,
I'm sure.
But they vary sometimes their spots,

1855
01:48:10.301 --> 01:48:12.110
so like almost their whole bodies a spot.

1856
01:48:12.710 --> 01:48:17.520
And you can see like in the really black Jaguars,
you can see the kind of uh,

1857
01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:20.720
the little,
the coloration,
but they come on,
they vary.

1858
01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:23.900
Some of them are completely black and those are the ones that are the fucking

1859
01:48:24.010 --> 01:48:25.850
scariest.
The hunt at night.
Right.

1860
01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:28.460
You can't see anything when you're in the jungle.
In the Amazon.

1861
01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:32.660
Apparently it's the most terrifying thing because they're everywhere and they're

1862
01:48:32.661 --> 01:48:35.150
just looking for something to kill at night and they can see.

1863
01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:37.400
They could see like the fucking fluorescence or on.

1864
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:42.230
<v 3>That's why do you watch at show naked and afraid?
Yes.
Love it.
It's great.</v>

1865
01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:47.090
What's your favorite survival rating?
Give you a primitive survival.
Ready Watch.

1866
01:48:47.150 --> 01:48:49.070
I told my brother minds negative for,

1867
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:53.180
I would start crying the minute the helicopter was landing and kicking me out.

1868
01:48:53.210 --> 01:48:56.270
That's last comic standing taken to the next level.
It will,
yeah.

1869
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:59.480
It is basically the same thing or until we kill each other.

1870
01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:03.500
You either die on your own or I kill you,
kill you.
It's basically the same thing,

1871
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:09.320
but they put them in horrible places and I know,
you know my brother goes,

1872
01:49:09.321 --> 01:49:11.480
well they producers and stuff,
Kathleen.
Yeah,
I know,

1873
01:49:11.481 --> 01:49:15.400
but a producer can't stop a spider.
Yeah,
or a wolf.

1874
01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:17.720
You right?
Yeah.
If you're naked,

1875
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:21.380
you know how much it would suck if you got bit by a wolf and you were naked.

1876
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:25.250
Oh my God.
What?
Take it with Wolf.
Just grabs your belly,

1877
01:49:25.810 --> 01:49:28.680
just locks on your belly and starts chewing through it.

1878
01:49:28.730 --> 01:49:33.680
Just raw meat right there.
It would visit.
Erupt were made out of butter.

1879
01:49:33.890 --> 01:49:36.890
We're basically made out of butter.
We just slice wide open.
Yeah,

1880
01:49:36.891 --> 01:49:40.550
we'd be easy like a little seal for him.
Just a little seals.

1881
01:49:40.551 --> 01:49:42.850
Way tougher than their skin is tougher.
You're right.
Wait,

1882
01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:43.940
you can make shoes out of them.

1883
01:49:44.570 --> 01:49:49.510
Seal shoes I'm sure can make that course I did.

1884
01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:51.873
Okay.
Let's see.

1885
01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:56.710
<v 6>Leather.
Let's say no.
Can you make leather out of seals?
I bet you can.</v>

1886
01:49:57.520 --> 01:49:58.810
Wet seal leather jacket.

1887
01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:01.030
<v 3>That wet seal is snow.</v>

1888
01:50:02.850 --> 01:50:05.700
Snow seal original bees.
Whack waterproofing.

1889
01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:11.120
<v 6>I'm Australian leather seal seal leather.</v>

1890
01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:14.780
Can you make leather out of seals?
No.
Actually you can.
Wow.
That's weird.

1891
01:50:17.770 --> 01:50:22.000
Huh?
Leather made from seals.
Let's try that.

1892
01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:23.650
This might be bullshit.

1893
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:28.320
<v 3>Look at Ios seven somebody posted a photo.
Joe Is this Siri,</v>

1894
01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:29.880
what's the average weight of a Jaguar?

1895
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:33.780
Look how the answers now like the answer and it gives you all this shit like

1896
01:50:33.781 --> 01:50:36.240
conversions and,
but it's off by a hundred pounds.
Siri.

1897
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:39.660
Stupid bitch can make leather out of seal biggest ones.

1898
01:50:44.050 --> 01:50:46.840
<v 6>Hmm.

There's like leather seals.</v>

1902
01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:58.320
The problem is it's like stuffy put on leather to seal it.

1903
01:50:58.321 --> 01:51:01.590
They call it leather seal.
So when you Google it,
that's mostly what you find.
Yes.

1904
01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:03.750
Made from a seal.

1905
01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:08.460
<v 3>Ken Seals be made into leather.
That's a good one.</v>

1906
01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:16.950
Oh,
it's all back to the Aragon.
How to make a leather piss deals.

1907
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:18.103
Facts

1908
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:21.360
<v 6>seal skins.
Yes.</v>

1909
01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:24.430
<v 3>Can Melt leather seal down to a liquid form.</v>

1910
01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:29.400
<v 6>No,
that's not the right answer.
But light and wind con.
Yeah,
it,</v>

1911
01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:33.440
you can use a seal.
Skin seal skin is something they use.

1912
01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:38.120
Let's say do the Inuits who Easterseal porn.

1913
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:43.740
Um,
can,
can Canada exports the following seal product,

1914
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:48.750
seal skins first skins pelts and leather seal oil and seal meat stasis.

1915
01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:54.160
This is a all about seal hunting.
It's,

1916
01:51:54.161 --> 01:51:58.200
I'm a conservation website that's trying to save seals because they fucking
club.

1917
01:51:58.201 --> 01:51:59.280
I'm the guy to death.

1918
01:52:00.210 --> 01:52:04.440
<v 3>Right?
We're really their oil particular moment.
Watch that show.
'Em.</v>

1919
01:52:04.441 --> 01:52:08.970
What's that crazy one where they,
oh,
a above the arctic circle.
Yeah.

1920
01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:14.070
It's on Nat Geo to the seal oil is what they used for cooking and everything.

1921
01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:19.260
Seal oil.
Yes.
It's very valuable.
Yeah.
They use it for like lamps too,
right?
Yup.

1922
01:52:19.850 --> 01:52:23.460
Yup.
Yeah.
Well that's the other set of crazy people that people on that show.

1923
01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:28.990
<v 6>Yeah.
Seal meat.
They sell seal meat.
They sell a lot of different things.</v>

1924
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:31.000
Wow.
That's so weird.

1925
01:52:31.001 --> 01:52:34.570
Finding out here's the Canada not satisfied the underperformance of seal meat

1926
01:52:34.571 --> 01:52:36.100
sales according to their own website.

1927
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:40.240
Finding a market for seal meat outside of Newfoundland continues to present a

1928
01:52:40.241 --> 01:52:42.520
major challenge for the ceiling industry.

1929
01:52:42.670 --> 01:52:46.850
The amount of seal meat landed in 2002 was extremely low in part because the

1930
01:52:46.851 --> 01:52:49.700
hunt was mainly directed at younger animals,

1931
01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:54.530
which have very little recoverable meet beaters.
They call them beaters.

1932
01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:55.393
Oh my God.

1933
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:59.090
That's the ones they beat to death because they want their fur because the

1934
01:52:59.091 --> 01:53:02.150
younger ones are white and fluffy before they get old and funky

1935
01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:07.410
<v 4>beating baby cook club clubbing baby seals.
That's like what our Busmat about</v>

1936
01:53:07.530 --> 01:53:11.910
<v 6>and they sell seal oil capsules.
They sell it as a nutritional supplement?
Yeah.</v>

1937
01:53:13.170 --> 01:53:17.190
<v 4>Wow.
I think you live,
if you live above the Arctic Circle,</v>

1938
01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:20.990
you can do whatever you want.
Yeah.
You,
you're living in the gangster world.

1939
01:53:21.010 --> 01:53:25.320
You have to fit right in.
Yup.
If you need to go,
um,
club a seal,

1940
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.923
then I don't think you need,

1941
01:53:27.130 --> 01:53:29.940
<v 6>do you ever watch those shows like Alaska,
the great front,
the last frontier.</v>

1942
01:53:30.010 --> 01:53:33.100
<v 4>I haven't watched that one that I liked.
The one of where they live,</v>

1943
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:37.090
they have like six people that they focus on that live above the arctic circle.

1944
01:53:37.150 --> 01:53:42.130
Right.
That's the one lady in our own camp.
I can't think of her name.

1945
01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:46.900
It's like the,
you want to,
she has like a little sayings and stuff.
Were you like,

1946
01:53:46.901 --> 01:53:51.100
this is the hardest woman I've ever seen.
Ever.
You want to,

1947
01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:56.060
you want to be of a pork chop it,
you're going to,

1948
01:53:56.110 --> 01:53:59.080
you got to act like a pork chop.
Like things like she's always,

1949
01:53:59.110 --> 01:54:02.590
she's always haunting the wolves and other things around her camp.

1950
01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:06.820
That's like miles and I,
you can't,
I can't even when I really can't believe this.

1951
01:54:06.821 --> 01:54:10.000
There's a crew up there.
Yeah.
Where are they staying and somebody,

1952
01:54:10.001 --> 01:54:12.340
they have to go film this stuff every day.

1953
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:14.420
There's a family that lives in an Igloo.
I mean,
okay.

1954
01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:17.740
<v 6>Best one is mountain men.
You ever watch that one?
I haven't.</v>

1955
01:54:17.741 --> 01:54:20.650
It's on the history channel and it's about these guys and one of them,
this guy,

1956
01:54:20.651 --> 01:54:25.600
Marty Mirano,
he lives in the dark north of Alaska.

1957
01:54:25.930 --> 01:54:29.830
He lives deep into the woods.
He has to fly on a fucking plane,

1958
01:54:29.831 --> 01:54:34.831
two hours over like woods to land in the camp where he goes like for for two

1959
01:54:35.831 --> 01:54:39.670
hours he's flying around not seeing nothing but trees.
There's no cities,

1960
01:54:39.671 --> 01:54:42.790
no nothing.
I'm afraid of bears.
He's got to be afraid of bears.

1961
01:54:42.791 --> 01:54:45.940
Got to carry a rifle every time.
He does take a shit.
Everything he does,

1962
01:54:45.941 --> 01:54:46.930
he has to have a rifle on him.

1963
01:54:47.250 --> 01:54:51.480
<v 4>That's why.
Okay.
I love house hunters.
I know it's a chick show.
Just let,</v>

1964
01:54:51.481 --> 01:54:54.750
they were looking at Alaska.
These people wanted to get away.

1965
01:54:54.810 --> 01:54:58.350
They want it as far away from possible or no,
it's not.
It wasn't how centers,

1966
01:54:58.351 --> 01:55:03.270
it's a show buying Alaska.
Yeah.
And so,
uh,
they were like,
well,
we want to,

1967
01:55:03.570 --> 01:55:06.720
but they're like from Wisconsin.
Right.
And that people were like,

1968
01:55:06.810 --> 01:55:10.560
you don't seem to understand what's going to happen because they're up there in

1969
01:55:10.561 --> 01:55:13.260
summertime.
Right.
Uh,
first of all,
I said,

1970
01:55:13.261 --> 01:55:14.940
what if you have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night?

1971
01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:18.480
You have to take a gun because there was a bear.
Yes.
Who wants it?

1972
01:55:18.481 --> 01:55:21.630
Who would choose to,
to,
what is the perk?
What is the park?

1973
01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:23.760
The perks seems to be with all these people.

1974
01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:26.340
We don't want to be around any other people.

1975
01:55:26.370 --> 01:55:28.650
When you're taking it that far at they,
there's something wrong.

1976
01:55:28.651 --> 01:55:29.484
What's really wrong?

1977
01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:32.920
<v 6>Well,
some people,
they love the idea of living with nature too.</v>

1978
01:55:32.921 --> 01:55:34.810
It's not just about being with no people.

1979
01:55:34.811 --> 01:55:37.570
It's like every day you're going to see a moose or you're going to see a bear.

1980
01:55:37.571 --> 01:55:40.210
You're going to see there's something really magical about that.

1981
01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:44.040
I don't want to live like that,
but I get it.
I get that part,
but

1982
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.400
<v 4>when the,
when the,
the living becomes so difficult,</v>

1983
01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:52.740
it would take the joy out of the Moose for me when it's going to take us 11

1984
01:55:52.741 --> 01:55:57.540
hours in a sled to go get some smokes.
There's no smokes up there.

1985
01:55:57.541 --> 01:56:01.950
You roll your own tobacco and we got to get paper.

1986
01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:05.220
We need,
AH,
some bread.
We need some diet coke.

1987
01:56:05.250 --> 01:56:10.160
I mean at all of a sudden living,
they need some diet coke.
We need that.

1988
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:12.030
That you say when you're living in Alaska,

1989
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:15.840
roughing it in a house made out of trees.
Well,
okay beer.

1990
01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:18.930
I don't know what people need to live,
but what do you want it to store?

1991
01:56:18.931 --> 01:56:20.820
It's going to take us 11 hours a slide.

1992
01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:24.950
<v 6>Well this guy,
Marty,
he,
he's a trapper and he lives like in,</v>

1993
01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:27.830
it's like 50 below zero all the time where he lives.

1994
01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:33.040
His beard gets entirely covered with ice and snow is the gnarliest shit you've

1995
01:56:33.651 --> 01:56:37.140
ever seen.
The guy's walking around in his face is just covered in this room.

1996
01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:41.570
White snow,
frozen beard.
And he's up there wandering around alone.

1997
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:45.020
Yeah,
he lives alone.
This is not,
what were you looking at?
What are you doing?

1998
01:56:45.670 --> 01:56:48.990
You were talking about like [inaudible] no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
But you like,

1999
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.080
you know who you answer?
The fucking fake guy.
He's like,
Les Stroud hates.

2000
01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:57.920
Yeah,
he's eating a full meal out there pretending to be roughing it.
Yeah.

2001
01:56:58.110 --> 01:57:03.110
It's that guy selling that stock show was created because of survivor man.

2002
01:57:03.370 --> 01:57:06.770
You know,
Les Stroud,
like they wanted less job to do all this fake shit.
Like,

2003
01:57:06.771 --> 01:57:09.590
let's pretend you just shot a moose and we'll bring in a moose.
And was like,
no,

2004
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:11.780
like I'm not doing,
I'm not faking anything.

2005
01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:14.300
And they wanted to fake a bunch of things and they were like,
look,

2006
01:57:14.301 --> 01:57:16.220
we know how to make television.
He's like,
I'm not faking it.

2007
01:57:16.370 --> 01:57:19.370
So they made that show and put it on the same network just to fuck him.

2008
01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:24.540
Just to like,
wow.
Yeah,
but that show is bullshit.
Like that guy doesn't he?

2009
01:57:24.541 --> 01:57:28.010
The guy stays in hotels every night,
which is not really the guy on the far left.

2010
01:57:28.011 --> 01:57:32.030
Bear Grylls.
No.
But what show is this?
Uh,
what is his show?

2011
01:57:32.031 --> 01:57:32.841
I forget what it's called,

2012
01:57:32.841 --> 01:57:35.350
but when people found out that he was bullshitting everybody,

2013
01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:38.650
like they've stopped watching it,
man versus mammary for

2014
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:42.410
<v 4>wild.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's where they drop them off.
Okay.
Yeah,
I've seen it.</v>

2015
01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:47.480
It didn't seem real.
No,
not doing a very good job of shaking it.

2016
01:57:47.630 --> 01:57:51.710
<v 6>It was,
it was really obviously fake.
It wasn't just like a little bit of fake.</v>

2017
01:57:51.711 --> 01:57:52.500
It was,

2018
01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:57.150
I mean the guy would like do all this crazy shit that you would never do like g

2019
01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:01.580
leap from the top of an ice cliff and slide down this ice tunnel.

2020
01:58:01.581 --> 01:58:03.860
Like like why would you,
why are you doing all this?

2021
01:58:03.861 --> 01:58:05.480
Like you're doing a stunt in the movie.

2022
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:08.150
That's not what you would do if you were surviving.
If you're out here,

2023
01:58:08.190 --> 01:58:11.430
<v 4>Ryan,
you wouldn't be having fun.
You're surviving,
surviving.
It's not,</v>

2024
01:58:12.090 --> 01:58:12.990
there's no games

2025
01:58:13.610 --> 01:58:17.660
<v 6>currently.
They edit them.
Removing elements that were two planned.
They had to,</v>

2026
01:58:17.661 --> 01:58:22.580
they re edited some of the episodes with a fresh voiceover and a proceeding

2027
01:58:22.581 --> 01:58:27.380
announcement pointing out that some situations are in quotes presented to bear

2028
01:58:27.381 --> 01:58:30.230
to show the viewer how to survive.
However,

2029
01:58:30.231 --> 01:58:34.310
five of the most controversial season one episodes were never released,

2030
01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:39.580
never re released after editing and are no longer available on DVD,

2031
01:58:39.771 --> 01:58:44.680
flowery.
These are the Rockies,
the mob desert,
Costa Rican,

2032
01:58:44.681 --> 01:58:47.770
rain forest,
mount,
mount key,
Luhya,

2033
01:58:48.010 --> 01:58:52.150
a Hawaii and a desert island in Hawaii.

2034
01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:53.600
Yeah.

2035
01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:55.280
<v 4>Well,
you know,
I'm still just shut out.</v>

2036
01:58:55.310 --> 01:59:00.170
The discovery channel really took a hit in my world because of Megla done.

2037
01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:02.750
<v 3>Mcglynn Darren.
I believed it.</v>

2038
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:07.150
<v 6>Oh,
they lied about like the whale that washed up on shore was missing half.
It's</v>

2039
01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:10.410
<v 3>[inaudible].
They made up all of it.
How about the fucking mermaids?</v>

2040
01:59:10.890 --> 01:59:14.160
What's not animal planet?
They made up mermaids.
That was discovery as well.

2041
01:59:14.230 --> 01:59:18.820
Was it?
I'm almost positive.
Come on.
Look it up.
Okay.
Discovery Channel.
No.

2042
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:20.550
Your mind or it might've been animal planet.

2043
01:59:20.551 --> 01:59:24.480
It was the biggest show ever on animal planet.
People are so fucking stupid.

2044
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:28.770
They're like mom telling you,
Ma,
there's a fucking mermaid.

2045
01:59:29.370 --> 01:59:32.910
<v 4>That one I didn't believe,
but I did believe mega della Don was possible.</v>

2046
01:59:33.690 --> 01:59:34.800
<v 6>You did believe?
Yeah,</v>

2047
01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:38.810
<v 3>I saw the shark that got bitten in half.
Yeah.</v>

2048
01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:43.090
You have a discovery channel?
Mermaids.
Mermaids.
Okay.
What's,
Oh,

2049
01:59:43.091 --> 01:59:47.320
it's animal planet.
Oh,
I guess animal planet.
Part discovery or together.

2050
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:50.200
<v 4>Yeah.
Here's what's Ma,
what's wrong with this?</v>

2051
01:59:50.201 --> 01:59:54.970
So like animal planet is supposed to be educating kids to write,
which is dark.

2052
01:59:55.210 --> 01:59:57.400
Wasn't the show won one of those.
What ifs shows?

2053
01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:01.180
<v 6>It's animals.discovery.com.
That's the website.
That's interesting.</v>

2054
02:00:01.181 --> 02:00:05.380
So animal planet is owned by discovery and it's the animal planet website were

2055
02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:07.480
surprisingly human animal planet.

2056
02:00:07.670 --> 02:00:11.360
<v 4>It wasn't,
what if it wasn't?
Oh No.
They had a guy from the navy.</v>

2057
02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:15.250
<v 6>Oh,
it was totally fake.
They had an animation and they had like a fake mermaid.</v>

2058
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:16.930
It's really disgusting.
What they did.

2059
02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:19.673
<v 3>Everybody,</v>

2060
02:00:19.810 --> 02:00:23.950
<v 4>a real investigation documentary with real people.
Um,</v>

2061
02:00:24.190 --> 02:00:27.490
my friend Lorraine,
no,
her husband Tony is a scientist.
He goes,

2062
02:00:27.491 --> 02:00:29.800
I dunno why yelling?
You would have believed any of this.

2063
02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:32.260
It could just know scientists aren't that hot ever.

2064
02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:37.390
<v 3>The other thing is why they're showing it on TV and it's channeled.</v>

2065
02:00:37.391 --> 02:00:41.070
It doesn't show fiction.
It's a,
it's an educational channel.
It's supposed to be.

2066
02:00:41.450 --> 02:00:44.430
So it was so,
it's discovery.
I cannot believe they would.

2067
02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:46.890
They talk an hour on my life.
I'm not only did I believe it,

2068
02:00:46.891 --> 02:00:51.870
I texted my brother and said,
you have got to go to evo or whatever.
Record Megla.

2069
02:00:51.871 --> 02:00:54.210
Dot.
Yeah.
All fake.

2070
02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.620
<v 6>Yeah.
They're just out of their fucking mind.</v>

2071
02:00:57.340 --> 02:00:59.260
I can't believe they even put this on the air,

2072
02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:03.520
but it just goes to show you when you were talking about like how hard it is to

2073
02:01:03.521 --> 02:01:05.920
make a good show because you're dealing with producers,

2074
02:01:05.921 --> 02:01:08.710
you're dealing with networks.
He did with all these fucking crazy people.

2075
02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:12.040
If they can let an idea get like this,
go through like they like,
yeah,

2076
02:01:12.041 --> 02:01:14.530
that's for Thomas Rail.
I just fucking pretentious room.
It

2077
02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:18.440
<v 3>tended,
they found mermaids.
You're an asshole.</v>

2078
02:01:18.890 --> 02:01:23.480
You are a fucking asshole.
You made a fake mermaid show on a discovery,

2079
02:01:23.630 --> 02:01:24.430
you know,

2080
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:27.350
and that's something you would sit down and watch with your kids and they would

2081
02:01:27.351 --> 02:01:30.940
go to moon or going over to metal one.
I really get me cause,

2082
02:01:30.970 --> 02:01:34.190
and you got to explain it to your kids that the people on television are liars,

2083
02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:36.310
sheds heads.

2084
02:01:36.610 --> 02:01:41.060
<v 6>We had an issue on my show where,
um,
there was,
uh,</v>

2085
02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:45.710
we had a reedit one of the episodes because the first airing it was the,

2086
02:01:45.711 --> 02:01:48.650
um,
uh,
weaponized whether episode,
I saw it,

2087
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:51.020
the first airing they showed this thing,

2088
02:01:51.021 --> 02:01:55.580
which is called a sky quake and they said,
sent in from a podcast viewer.

2089
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:58.280
So I,
I have zero to do with the editing.

2090
02:01:58.310 --> 02:02:00.500
I could say that I don't like this or we got to take this out,

2091
02:02:00.501 --> 02:02:02.150
but I didn't see this.
They just,

2092
02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:06.770
they stuck this in because we did like six episodes and we did them all in a few

2093
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:10.150
months.
It was a really quick,
and it was like within,
they brought,

2094
02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:12.080
I brought them the idea,
they said yes.

2095
02:02:12.081 --> 02:02:14.690
And then we started filming like almost immediately.
Wow.

2096
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:17.930
And it was crazy and we banged out six episodes and made a lot of mistakes.

2097
02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:21.650
But one of the big ones is one of the editors lied and they put this video

2098
02:02:21.651 --> 02:02:22.121
footage and,

2099
02:02:22.121 --> 02:02:26.180
and put this fake noise behind it and set a podcast listener sent in this sound

2100
02:02:26.181 --> 02:02:28.640
of a sky.
Quigg well,
here's the problem.

2101
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:33.860
The guy whose video that they used when they faked it was a guy who is being

2102
02:02:33.861 --> 02:02:37.400
criticized on the show.
So the guy criticized in the show was like,
no,

2103
02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:41.180
not only is that fake,
like that's my fucking hand,
that's my yard.

2104
02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:42.980
Like that's not true.
That's not real.

2105
02:02:42.981 --> 02:02:46.820
So I called them up and read them the riot act.
I'm like,
what the fuck?

2106
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:49.720
You know what happened?
And it was,
you know,
someone edit it.

2107
02:02:49.730 --> 02:02:52.160
Apparently that's what they do.
Like editors,

2108
02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:57.280
like they create fake shit like reality in quotes shows all the time.

2109
02:02:57.321 --> 02:03:01.170
Right.
So they took it out of the,
the subsequent performances,
but the first air,

2110
02:03:01.290 --> 02:03:03.800
the episode,
first time in their first couple of times a year,

2111
02:03:03.801 --> 02:03:06.270
they had this lie in it,
you know,

2112
02:03:06.290 --> 02:03:10.640
and it's supposed to be a show about finding the truth.
And you know,
there were,

2113
02:03:10.670 --> 02:03:11.600
they were really upset.

2114
02:03:11.601 --> 02:03:13.670
Like the production company was really upset that it happened.

2115
02:03:13.671 --> 02:03:14.600
They didn't know it was happening.

2116
02:03:14.601 --> 02:03:18.950
But this is a normal way that people create these shows.

2117
02:03:19.010 --> 02:03:22.250
They just fucking fake it up.
This guy sent us to today,

2118
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:26.570
here's a man living in Alaska.
Was stranded in the wolf,
the wolf pack,
Dan,

2119
02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:27.530
for six weeks,

2120
02:03:27.531 --> 02:03:31.400
and this is the video he sent us a bunch of wool snapping at the door.

2121
02:03:31.401 --> 02:03:34.940
There's no real wolves there,
man.
As you made this up,
they do it all the time.

2122
02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:40.180
They call it reality show and that's what Les Stroud was not willing to do.

2123
02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:44.390
That's why they made the bear man vs wild,
right,
because they look,
yeah,

2124
02:03:44.391 --> 02:03:47.060
we'll show you how smart you are and look what happened.

2125
02:03:47.090 --> 02:03:50.570
They got fucked because they're,
they think they're smarter than people.

2126
02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:53.330
They think that people are going to be too stupid to know that they're just

2127
02:03:53.630 --> 02:03:58.430
engineering the show and completely fabricating all this Survivorman is awesome

2128
02:03:58.610 --> 02:04:03.610
because that guy is a legit bad motherfucker who will go out into the woods with

2129
02:04:03.801 --> 02:04:08.260
a tin can and a shoe lace and survive for a week.
Right.
That's why.

2130
02:04:08.370 --> 02:04:11.790
<v 4>What about that River Guy?
I hope that's real.
Oh,
big river man.</v>

2131
02:04:11.791 --> 02:04:16.570
The guy who swam the Amazon?
No,
no.
Oh really?
Somebody.
Oh yeah.
No,

2132
02:04:16.571 --> 02:04:21.030
no,
a swamp.
Swampy.
Although river hunter,
the Monster Vermont.
Oh,

2133
02:04:21.031 --> 02:04:22.890
that guy is real.
I believe that.
That's real.

2134
02:04:23.070 --> 02:04:26.940
He seems to intuit to for it to be fake and he doesn't look,
uh,
right.

2135
02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:30.410
Like via TV host.
Like I liked the way he looks,
but he's not all

2136
02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:35.000
<v 6>river monsters.
Yeah.
That's the guy.
Yeah,
he's awesome.
He's going fishing.</v>

2137
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:38.190
He's basically fishing for evil fish.
Right.
That's what he does.
And he's finding

2138
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:40.740
<v 4>them.
Yeah.
Older out there things.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2139
02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:43.320
Those ones that he found in Africa and the Congo,

2140
02:04:43.321 --> 02:04:46.620
those giant tigerfish tigerfish yourself with,
with the crazy teeth.

2141
02:04:46.621 --> 02:04:50.250
What the fuck?
That is some ancient shit.
That's a,

2142
02:04:50.251 --> 02:04:52.170
that's some dinosaur type shit.
Well,

2143
02:04:52.171 --> 02:04:54.750
that's why we're the one that locals explain it and then people go,

2144
02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:58.080
well that doesn't exist.
That's a myth.
Well,
where did a myth start?

2145
02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:02.490
Somebody saw something fucked up.
Yeah.
And went back to their people and said,

2146
02:05:02.970 --> 02:05:04.860
I just saw it out of the lake,
this river,

2147
02:05:04.861 --> 02:05:07.860
this fucked up thing and had teeth and it growled.
Look a tiger.
Well,

2148
02:05:07.861 --> 02:05:10.700
no you didn't.
Yeah,
I did.
And it was a fish.
Yeah.
When did,

2149
02:05:10.701 --> 02:05:15.300
when they found fire tiger fish.
That's why I liked that he talks to the locals.

2150
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:18.750
Yeah.
He gets down with those fucking people.

2151
02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:22.650
There was something weird in Siberia to,
that's one of the first of the car.

2152
02:05:22.690 --> 02:05:27.420
That's the target fish.
Yeah.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Pull that shit up.
Look at that.

2153
02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:32.580
Pull that picture up.
That's,
so,
that was always my thing with the giant squid.

2154
02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:36.800
When they would say,
oh well you know,
probably not.
Probably not until the,

2155
02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:38.610
they've actually just recently found one,

2156
02:05:38.611 --> 02:05:43.611
but do you see those sketches of Japanese fishermen and the octopus is taking

2157
02:05:44.191 --> 02:05:47.850
them off the boat?
Who would sit down and draw that if it wasn't fucking true?

2158
02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:50.100
Why would you go through the bullshit of,

2159
02:05:50.850 --> 02:05:53.820
I'm going to sketch out this giant sea monster.
Oh Man.

2160
02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:57.810
<v 6>So get that fucking things mouth.
Oh my God.</v>

2161
02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:02.240
Well the giant squid.
The one of the things about the giant squid,

2162
02:06:02.241 --> 02:06:05.190
it's really fascinating is each one of those suction cups has a hook in it.

2163
02:06:06.210 --> 02:06:10.630
They have like a,
like it's sucks down and there's like a hook,
like a beak.

2164
02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:13.740
Tyco pluck you out of a rip you apart.
They would,

2165
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:17.400
it would tear you apart if one of those giant squids got ahold of your body

2166
02:06:17.401 --> 02:06:20.310
would literally just slice you open.
Like,

2167
02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:23.820
like a giant rope covered in razor blades is pulled across.

2168
02:06:23.821 --> 02:06:28.680
Your body would just rip you to shreds.
Yeah.
There's not like just suction cups.

2169
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:30.480
They have like a tooth in though.

2170
02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:33.940
<v 4>Oh,
I thought it was a mouth wrap around deal and the Yang side of the boat.</v>

2171
02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:35.710
<v 6>No.
Well the,
there's that too.</v>

2172
02:06:35.711 --> 02:06:39.640
But the suction cups of a giant squid have teeth.

2173
02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:41.890
Yeah.
It's nasty.

2174
02:06:42.970 --> 02:06:47.440
It's like this beak like thing here.
I'll pull it up.
Yeah.

2175
02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:51.400
There's so the,
the,
the fucking ocean is so God damn terrified.
It's creepy.

2176
02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:56.500
They found some new thing.
This video that they took.
Uh,
yeah.
Here look.

2177
02:06:56.501 --> 02:07:00.970
You could see that.
See the each hook.
Oh yeah.

2178
02:07:02.110 --> 02:07:07.030
Each one of those suction cups has hooks in it.
Like that's a God damn cat claw.

2179
02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:11.700
<v 4>Look at that and saying,
yeah,
it's huge.
What is the new thing?
Well,
creepy news.</v>

2180
02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:16.310
<v 6>It's a giant jellyfish like thing that they found,
uh,
on a,</v>

2181
02:07:16.311 --> 02:07:17.840
a deep sea oil rig.

2182
02:07:17.841 --> 02:07:22.841
Camera Brion pull up massive unidentified sea monster caught on oil rig cam and

2183
02:07:25.610 --> 02:07:30.610
this thing is really fucking weird and apparently it's been identified as a type

2184
02:07:31.761 --> 02:07:35.470
of jellyfish.
It's you see its underside,

2185
02:07:35.471 --> 02:07:39.790
it has like these like this weird testy area where there,
what's balls are,

2186
02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:41.800
it's so fucking freaky.

2187
02:07:41.801 --> 02:07:45.460
It looks like like a giant flying carpet monster

2188
02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:49.090
and it's just underneath the ocean.

2189
02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:53.140
I mean they find these things will always believe in the lochness monster.

2190
02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:56.380
Don't believe in that one.
Why?
Because the people that,

2191
02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:58.570
the best photographs of it are bullshit.

2192
02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:01.060
The best photograph they ever had was a total hoax.

2193
02:08:01.061 --> 02:08:03.280
The guy made up the best photograph that was ever taken.

2194
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:06.370
I thought he said he did and I took that back.
The Patterson film,

2195
02:08:06.460 --> 02:08:09.520
that's the Patterson film.
Did he say I made it up and then he didn't,

2196
02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:11.680
he never said he,
but he died young.

2197
02:08:11.710 --> 02:08:15.590
The guy who said that he wasn't in it but then said he was,
was the,

2198
02:08:15.591 --> 02:08:20.320
the guy who actually wore the suit himself and he did and he's not only did he

2199
02:08:20.321 --> 02:08:24.160
most likely wear that suit,
he walked like it.
Look at it.
Watch this thing.

2200
02:08:24.610 --> 02:08:29.380
This thing swims by.
See the oil cam,
they catch it swimming.

2201
02:08:29.381 --> 02:08:32.770
Look at that.
It's fucking enormous.

2202
02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:36.850
But wait til it comes around.
Don't worry,
you can't see it yet.

2203
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:40.300
Don't try to change the contrast when it comes back around and you can actually

2204
02:08:40.301 --> 02:08:41.134
see it again,

2205
02:08:41.230 --> 02:08:45.010
but it gets like right in front of the camera and you know there's oil rigs are

2206
02:08:45.011 --> 02:08:49.510
these huge fucking things and they have these remote cameras and they catch

2207
02:08:49.511 --> 02:08:51.970
these insane deep sea animals.

2208
02:08:51.970 --> 02:08:56.970
Like they caught this one squid that has these crab like arms,

2209
02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:01.090
but this thing,
it comes close.
It gets like way up to the camera.

2210
02:09:01.650 --> 02:09:04.540
And then why don't they think this is just like a big jellyfish or something is

2211
02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:06.460
it is a type of jellyfish.

2212
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:10.270
That's what they had to identify and figure out what it is.
But you know,

2213
02:09:10.271 --> 02:09:15.271
you're talking about something that's just fucking enormous toxic waste

2214
02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:21.140
jellyfish.
Oh yeah.
It's probably absorbing all that Fukushima's shit.

2215
02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:24.900
Look at the size of that thing.
It's so weird looking to,

2216
02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:27.430
when it gets up to the camera,
it looks like paper.

2217
02:09:27.670 --> 02:09:29.920
That'd be fun to play inside of that.
If you wouldn't get hurt.

2218
02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:34.390
So many toxic jellyfish.
So many jellyfish will fuck you up.

2219
02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:38.080
That's how they protect themselves from predation.
You know,

2220
02:09:38.081 --> 02:09:43.000
they're just covered in stingers.
People get scarred up really bad too.

2221
02:09:43.090 --> 02:09:46.360
Yeah.
My friend just got bit in the backer head and by jellyfish,

2222
02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:50.770
huge marks on it.
It looks like she has a tattoo now on the back of her neck.
Wow.

2223
02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:54.770
Yeah.
Jellyfishes fuck him up,
man.
No,
that was in uh,

2224
02:09:56.950 --> 02:10:01.610
Italy or somewhere.
If somebody tweeted me the actual explanation and our,

2225
02:10:01.630 --> 02:10:06.450
I retweeted it,
so give me a second here and I'll find it.
Whatever.
This was NPR.

2226
02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:11.700
Npr had the answer for what it is that it's some type of a jellyfish,

2227
02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:14.710
but how do they know if they didn't catch it?

2228
02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:18.880
Because they see it and they can recognize it.
They know what it is,

2229
02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:22.800
but there's still a lot of shit in the ocean that they really don't know.
Yeah.

2230
02:10:22.801 --> 02:10:24.010
There's,
there's sounds,

2231
02:10:24.011 --> 02:10:28.090
biological sounds that had been recorded that are like many,

2232
02:10:28.091 --> 02:10:32.050
many times louder than anything a whale can make.
Right.
And they don't know.

2233
02:10:32.490 --> 02:10:35.210
They don't know what it is,
but they know it's a biological sound.

2234
02:10:36.170 --> 02:10:39.470
<v 11>I think they call it the bloop.
Yeah.</v>

2235
02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:43.500
<v 4>Does dairy maids,
they said it was mermaids talking.</v>

2236
02:10:44.980 --> 02:10:47.180
<v 6>Yeah.
All those fucking dickheads.</v>

2237
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:49.960
They'll whoever put that thing on TV should go to jail.

2238
02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:52.570
<v 4>I seriously,
it's on an educational channel.</v>

2239
02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:55.300
I don't care if this is on the goofy movie channel.

2240
02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:57.170
<v 6>There's a giant squid in real life.</v>

2241
02:10:57.650 --> 02:11:02.560
Pull up giant squid with crab arms,
oil rig camera,

2242
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:06.380
giant squid,
crab arms.
Cause this is the weirdest fucking thing ever.

2243
02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:11.560
They found this squid that has like these like crazy crab arms and it's living

2244
02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:14.960
underneath the water just floating around like an alien.

2245
02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:19.760
<v 4>That's why I always,
when you see those underwater oil rig welder guys,</v>

2246
02:11:20.670 --> 02:11:24.650
ah,
all my God.
Well I,
what do you make?
It's not enough how much,

2247
02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:27.560
how much to go down there and uh,
weld.

2248
02:11:27.730 --> 02:11:29.620
<v 6>Look at this thing.
I mean,</v>

2249
02:11:29.621 --> 02:11:32.110
tell me that doesn't look like something right out of Star Trek.

2250
02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:36.090
Look how long it's legs are like,
look at those fucking 10 of goals.

2251
02:11:36.150 --> 02:11:41.080
It looks like an alien.
They look at those things.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.
Well,

2252
02:11:41.081 --> 02:11:44.380
not Asher,
but,
uh,
Geiger,
HR.
Giger.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2253
02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:46.420
Jesus Christ.

2254
02:11:47.090 --> 02:11:47.350
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

2255
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:50.450
<v 6>I mean,
we don't know,
literally 99%</v>

2256
02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:55.460
<v 4>of the Scotia I used to surf and then I also saw shark and that was the end.</v>

2257
02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:01.740
Yeah.
Yeah.
But the other stuff that you see,
like what,
um,

2258
02:12:02.130 --> 02:12:02.963
the weird,

2259
02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:07.650
the weird jellyfish that it don't even make sense just there up on top,

2260
02:12:07.651 --> 02:12:08.490
floating around.

2261
02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:12.510
But then you'd see like a dolphin and that's really cool to be on your surfboard

2262
02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:15.450
and there's a dolphin right there and they're totally friendly.
You know,
they'll,

2263
02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:17.700
they'll not hurt you.
Um,

2264
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:20.760
and to just see one in the wild and they'll surf a wave with you.

2265
02:12:21.150 --> 02:12:26.150
But the amount of coolness is not okay considering how many bad things are

2266
02:12:26.791 --> 02:12:31.570
there.
Yeah.
There's just so many unknowns.
It's Er.
Well,

2267
02:12:31.590 --> 02:12:36.420
and think that's why I really do think surfers are real surfers.
I mean,

2268
02:12:36.450 --> 02:12:40.620
it is like me that did a weekend,
but they're the bravest people.

2269
02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:41.491
What don't,

2270
02:12:41.491 --> 02:12:46.350
what other sport would you agree that the playing underneath the playing field

2271
02:12:46.890 --> 02:12:48.690
are the most dangerous things on earth?

2272
02:12:48.691 --> 02:12:52.320
That it any moment can come up and eat you like you wouldn't go on a soccer

2273
02:12:52.321 --> 02:12:52.921
field where they said,

2274
02:12:52.921 --> 02:12:56.670
we have 11 lions underneath the field and at any moment the lions can be

2275
02:12:56.671 --> 02:12:57.660
released and eat you.

2276
02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:02.500
<v 6>Well,
we were in Hawaii the week that two people got bitten by sharks.</v>

2277
02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:06.370
One person recently,
just this week or this month,
rather,

2278
02:13:06.610 --> 02:13:11.170
one person died and another person got his leg fucked up.

2279
02:13:11.470 --> 02:13:14.800
One guy in the big island got bit and then a woman while we were there died.

2280
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:18.250
She got her arm ripped off by a shark.
Oh,
a German lady or something.

2281
02:13:18.251 --> 02:13:20.410
I read about it.
Yeah.
Meanwhile,
we were in the water.

2282
02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:23.470
We were in that same water and I was,
we were joking around.
I was like,

2283
02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:28.960
imagine if we were at a picnic and a werewolf came in and rip someone's chest

2284
02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:32.190
open and then ran back into the woods.
We'd be like,
well look,

2285
02:13:32.191 --> 02:13:36.480
there's not that many werewolves and this is where they live.
It's their habitat,

2286
02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:38.100
which is just keep playing.
Yeah.

2287
02:13:38.250 --> 02:13:42.270
We're going to take all with the party or in the edge of the woods with sticks.

2288
02:13:42.271 --> 02:13:44.490
We would have like sentience,
you know,

2289
02:13:44.491 --> 02:13:48.090
we would have like people out there making sure that they stood guard and

2290
02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:49.740
watched certain areas.

2291
02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:51.450
<v 4>Well,
I don't understand.</v>

2292
02:13:51.451 --> 02:13:56.040
Like in Australia they do have a big net at a the one beach Bondai beach.

2293
02:13:56.070 --> 02:14:00.630
There's a giant net sweep sharks out.
Yeah,
but it,
that people are anti net

2294
02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:04.320
<v 6>people are anti net.
They're ass holes.</v>

2295
02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:07.120
<v 4>But it's an asshole.
Keep out the sea snakes.</v>

2296
02:14:07.490 --> 02:14:09.250
You know how many snakes in the ocean can kill you?

2297
02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:13.140
I didn't even know lots of Google.
If you go well,

2298
02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:15.550
how many poisonous snakes in the ocean?
I'll ask my Google.

2299
02:14:15.740 --> 02:14:17.530
Doesn't everything in Australia kill you though?

2300
02:14:17.710 --> 02:14:21.960
Australia is like one of the most dangerous place.
Most poisonous snakes,
uh,

2301
02:14:21.970 --> 02:14:23.260
on land too,
in the whole world.

2302
02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:25.710
<v 6>Well,
you can't even live in the middle,
right?
Australia,</v>

2303
02:14:25.711 --> 02:14:28.420
like you live around the edges and you get inside the middle and you're fucked.

2304
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:32.280
<v 4>The middle's even worse.
Um,
my friend live with my friend lives in the middle.</v>

2305
02:14:33.130 --> 02:14:37.620
That will be scared.
How many come on out to the meadow or in the ocean?

2306
02:14:42.170 --> 02:14:47.150
What does it say?
Oh,
it's in our stand.
Horny.
Hmm.
That's weird.

2307
02:14:48.290 --> 02:14:50.270
How many poisonous snakes are in the ocean?

2308
02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:57.090
Dupage is useless.
She's doing that to get yourself a fucking regular iPhone vet.

2309
02:14:57.190 --> 02:15:00.430
A venomous snake.
Sea snakes.
Um,
lots.

2310
02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:02.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2311
02:15:02.190 --> 02:15:05.610
<v 4>I mean,
so the net.
Okay,
so you got kept the sharks out.
That's great.</v>

2312
02:15:05.850 --> 02:15:09.540
But what about everything else?
There was one in my pants.
A long snake.

2313
02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:16.650
Hmm.
Um,
most venomous see snakes,

2314
02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:21.860
western Pacific Atlantic or the Atlantic.
The Caribbean and the Red Sea.

2315
02:15:21.861 --> 02:15:22.860
You have no seats.
Snakes.

2316
02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:27.110
<v 6>It's even dead specimens found the beach should not be touched because some</v>

2317
02:15:27.111 --> 02:15:32.111
species are known to feign death when stranded by the tide and once dead,

2318
02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:37.140
even decapitated snakes can still administer a reflex bite.

2319
02:15:37.770 --> 02:15:41.080
<v 4>Oh,
okay.
Did you see the copperhead bite its own body?
Yeah,</v>

2320
02:15:41.110 --> 02:15:42.410
actually said it was cut off.
You know,

2321
02:15:42.411 --> 02:15:45.080
my dad used to tell us that when we were kids and we didn't believe him.

2322
02:15:45.610 --> 02:15:48.610
<v 6>Yeah.
Snakes.
Apparently the,
their head can work for</v>

2323
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:53.530
<v 4>long,
long time.
Like a day to a say sundown to sundown to Sunup to sundown,</v>

2324
02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:57.390
<v 6>just whatever.
It just decides to clamp down on you and inject you with poison.</v>

2325
02:15:57.870 --> 02:16:00.840
They just try to make sure for sure that you don't get out of this.

2326
02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:02.430
They want to get you,

2327
02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:06.540
they have like a bunch of different fail safes set up so they can get you with

2328
02:16:06.541 --> 02:16:09.180
that.
What's going on here,
Shelley phase.
Like I said,

2329
02:16:09.181 --> 02:16:12.660
my friend has one that looks like a tattoo.
This is exactly like what hers,

2330
02:16:12.661 --> 02:16:16.700
it looks like.
It almost looks like somebody tutor or something like that.
Ryan.

2331
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:21.510
That's insane.
That's all from a jellyfish.
Correct.
The one above it.

2332
02:16:21.511 --> 02:16:24.710
Go back to that one above it.
Holy Fuck.
Yeah.

2333
02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:29.260
And it lasts for like a long time.
Like six months to a year.
It like,

2334
02:16:29.261 --> 02:16:30.094
that'd be permanent.

2335
02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:33.730
<v 3>What's the uh,
Rogan board member who posted this?
Uh,</v>

2336
02:16:34.220 --> 02:16:38.620
Ajl Al Wolf.
Wolf in the house.
Look at that top one.
That's crazy.

2337
02:16:38.621 --> 02:16:42.400
That looks like somebody like,
well lit it on fire.
Yeah,

2338
02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:46.090
it looks like someone's cooking it over a fire exit is pretty bad.

2339
02:16:46.091 --> 02:16:49.650
As I'd be kind of cool that it would not feel good.
Meanwhile,

2340
02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:50.690
people are going to do that.
Yeah.

2341
02:16:50.710 --> 02:16:54.240
Well he used to be in this clarification then I found it really cool shoes

2342
02:16:54.250 --> 02:16:58.840
getting jellyfish.
Sea snakes are as dangerous as cobras.
Whoa.

2343
02:16:59.950 --> 02:17:03.880
What the fuck?
And those are the ones that are in Australia?
They're everywhere.

2344
02:17:03.881 --> 02:17:06.700
Well,
they think they originated from a land snake,

2345
02:17:06.701 --> 02:17:11.230
but they're in that western Pacific and the Indian Ocean warm waters.

2346
02:17:13.490 --> 02:17:14.470
So,
oh,

2347
02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:19.090
there's 16 types of CSNYC 57 species of sea steaks.

2348
02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:22.570
We had ETFs on the podcast and he was telling us how big Kangaroos cat and that

2349
02:17:22.571 --> 02:17:26.680
they can kill people.
Oh,
absolutely.
There's huge.
Don't beat the crap out of you.

2350
02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:29.840
Yeah.
I was like,
what?
Kangaroo Gut.

2351
02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:34.060
You don't like rip your guts out.
Fucking

2352
02:17:35.770 --> 02:17:40.030
how many deaths by kangaroo put in here?
Let's take a wild guess.
Uh,
I would say,

2353
02:17:40.031 --> 02:17:44.490
well,
they're only really in Australia,
right?
So I was going to say 17.
Hmm.

2354
02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:48.850
I'll go with 10.
Don't we count kids?
Yeah.
Humans.

2355
02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:53.470
How many people are killed by Kangaroos in Australia each year and the answer

2356
02:17:53.471 --> 02:17:56.650
is,
oh,
it was extremely rare.

2357
02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:00.070
It's very,
very rare.

2358
02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:04.360
Apart from road deaths caused by hitting swerving to miss kangaroos.

2359
02:18:04.540 --> 02:18:08.410
The only reliable documented case of a fatality from kangaroo attack occurred in

2360
02:18:08.411 --> 02:18:13.411
New South Wales in 1936 a hunter was killed when he tried to rescue two dogs

2361
02:18:13.811 --> 02:18:15.520
from a heated fray with a kangaroo.

2362
02:18:16.550 --> 02:18:17.383
<v 2>Huh?</v>

2363
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:22.020
<v 3>That's interesting.
There's a videos of them going psycho online,</v>

2364
02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:27.760
a kangaroo getting angry at golf courses and stuff like people were also to be,

2365
02:18:29.010 --> 02:18:32.720
the government tries to cover it up.
I tried to cover up kangaroo desks.

2366
02:18:33.490 --> 02:18:37.990
He thinks I got this.
That's it.

2367
02:18:39.170 --> 02:18:42.490
What?
Its head cut off.
Yeah.
That's going to bite.

2368
02:18:48.850 --> 02:18:51.790
That's insane.
That's insane.

2369
02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:58.260
It's trying to get those people and its head is chopped off 24 hours.
Well,

2370
02:18:58.261 --> 02:19:01.630
I guess you could chop off its body and a lot of spots and it'll still stay

2371
02:19:01.631 --> 02:19:05.290
alive for a long time.
I don't know if it's true,

2372
02:19:05.291 --> 02:19:09.100
but also I get used to tell us they could grow back.

2373
02:19:09.250 --> 02:19:12.460
Primitive animal,
a snake,
and you see that thing,

2374
02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:14.620
they're supposed to be terrifying.
You know,

2375
02:19:14.621 --> 02:19:19.300
like there was a group that was working hard to conserve the Komodo Dragon.

2376
02:19:19.301 --> 02:19:22.540
They were talking about how important it is to conserve the largest fall Lippard

2377
02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:26.860
lizard species of like,
are you out of your fucking money?
Right?
One of those,

2378
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:28.190
shoot it stuff.

2379
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:31.790
<v 6>It take videos of the rest and then nuke it from space.</v>

2380
02:19:31.850 --> 02:19:36.080
Fly above in a jet and shoot rockets into those country lizards.

2381
02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:40.850
They're fucking terrifying.
They have botulism and their saliva.

2382
02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:44.150
You ever seen what a,
how a Komodo dragon kills?
No.
Oh,

2383
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:49.540
Google Komodo dragon kills water buffalo.
They just run up,

2384
02:19:49.610 --> 02:19:50.443
bite them,

2385
02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:55.480
and then follow them for a few days until they just fall from the toxic saliva.

2386
02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:59.360
They fall to the ground and then they start eating them guts first.

2387
02:19:59.361 --> 02:20:03.530
Where do they live in China?
Komodo islands.
Oh Wow.
Something like that.

2388
02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:08.270
Komodo dragons where they live chemo and they're limited to one island.
Really?

2389
02:20:08.271 --> 02:20:12.680
They're not on land.
I thought they were like in a,
I mean,
they're in zoos,
right?

2390
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:16.550
They,
um,
there's a thing called,
uh,
uh,

2391
02:20:16.610 --> 02:20:21.610
island dwarfism and it's one of the reasons why they were really concerned like

2392
02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:27.260
that,
that it works on everything,
but it doesn't work at everything.

2393
02:20:27.261 --> 02:20:30.350
It doesn't work on lizards.
Like elephants are smaller,

2394
02:20:30.351 --> 02:20:33.380
they have small elephants that are trapped on an island and people become

2395
02:20:33.381 --> 02:20:35.440
smaller and they're trapped on islands.
And a,

2396
02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:38.360
that's also one of the reasons why they believe in the island of Flores had

2397
02:20:38.361 --> 02:20:41.630
those little tiny hobbit people,
those little three foot tall people.

2398
02:20:41.810 --> 02:20:43.880
I think there's a thing called island dwarfism,

2399
02:20:43.881 --> 02:20:48.320
but with lizards it's the exact opposite.
When you put lizards on an island,

2400
02:20:48.321 --> 02:20:52.370
they get fucking big.
It's really weird.
Look at this thing.
Boom.

2401
02:20:54.610 --> 02:20:57.250
He just bites the leg and once he bites its leg,

2402
02:20:58.140 --> 02:20:58.720
<v 2>okay.</v>

2403
02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:02.800
<v 6>I mean his,
the toxicity of this Conti Lizard Saliva.</v>

2404
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:06.220
Then he just follows him around for a few days until it's poor fuck.

2405
02:21:06.221 --> 02:21:09.370
Just start shaking like look at,
let me see him.
He's like barely getting by.

2406
02:21:09.850 --> 02:21:13.680
And then the Komodo dragon is just waiting right there to Jag.
Um,

2407
02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:15.320
<v 2>okay.</v>

2408
02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:17.030
<v 6>Jack [inaudible] guts first.
Well,</v>

2409
02:21:17.031 --> 02:21:21.290
it's just crazy that there's anything left with the word dragon in it.
Yeah.

2410
02:21:21.380 --> 02:21:25.580
I mean,
it's in a few Indonesian islands.
Komodo,

2411
02:21:25.581 --> 02:21:29.960
Rinca,
Flores,
Gil montage and [inaudible].

2412
02:21:30.140 --> 02:21:34.550
Those are the islands where this thing exists.
Those are the natural islands.

2413
02:21:34.551 --> 02:21:39.500
So it's basically live there amongst them.
Yeah.
Islands of Indonesia.

2414
02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:43.080
Some,
some of the islands know some of the items are unpopulated I believe.
Oh,

2415
02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:47.930
but some of them,
yeah.
I mean this thing is,
it's a scary fucking thing.

2416
02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:52.670
How do you kill it?
You shoot it.
It's normal.
Schiff bullets.
Fire rockets.
Hello.

2417
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:56.360
There was a,
uh,
an incident where Sharon Stone was married to.

2418
02:21:56.361 --> 02:21:58.460
This guy was like a report or some shit like that,

2419
02:21:58.850 --> 02:22:03.550
and they went into a cage with commodity and didn't,
he got bit right then.

2420
02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:07.980
It's foot.
So his foot was a rabbit and white socks on.
So the,

2421
02:22:07.981 --> 02:22:12.740
the Komodo dragon thought his foot was a rabbit and his,
he got fucked by us.

2422
02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:17.000
I don't think he died,
but I think he was really badly hurt.
Got divorced.
Yeah.

2423
02:22:17.170 --> 02:22:21.650
Well,
Komodo Dragon.
Let's see.
Should I remember those braces?

2424
02:22:21.651 --> 02:22:26.000
Sharon Stone yesterday,
that magnetic bracelets.
And getting a lot of email.

2425
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:28.060
They work.
Brian,
did you really?

2426
02:22:28.350 --> 02:22:30.960
You guys are super skeptical and I think that's bullshit.

2427
02:22:31.180 --> 02:22:35.550
Just skeptical but cynical and you use your bro Science.
That's hilarious.

2428
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:39.630
Are you talking about the habits of magnets but the bear survival bracelet?

2429
02:22:39.810 --> 02:22:43.500
Oh those are actually common.
You buy those at like um,
his little whistle.

2430
02:22:43.530 --> 02:22:46.350
All the camp ground places,
rei places like that.

2431
02:22:46.470 --> 02:22:47.910
They've been selling those things forever.

2432
02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:49.750
Not with like a stupid whistle attached to it but I,

2433
02:22:49.751 --> 02:22:52.590
this is probably a good move to have.
Like what are the,
what's the reasoning?

2434
02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:55.080
If you cut one of those threads,
one of those,

2435
02:22:55.170 --> 02:23:00.170
you can unravel that thing and you have like several yards of really strong rope

2436
02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:06.090
that you can use for survival.
Like
you can carry your weight,

2437
02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:08.550
you can drag things with it.
You could make a pack,

2438
02:23:08.551 --> 02:23:12.300
you can bring bundle up some sticks and carry it and you could bring it back to

2439
02:23:12.301 --> 02:23:16.410
your camp.
Like you can use it for survival.
Anything to use it as a tourniquet.

2440
02:23:16.590 --> 02:23:19.680
Like when you would need a some rope,
you can use that stuff.
Oh,

2441
02:23:19.681 --> 02:23:21.590
I thought it was to help you protect it from bears.

2442
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:23.060
Like what are you gonna get tired?

2443
02:23:23.070 --> 02:23:26.360
This little rope around the bears and the mouth while it's in your face.
No,

2444
02:23:26.370 --> 02:23:28.690
that wouldn't know unless you were just a gangster with a,

2445
02:23:29.230 --> 02:23:34.040
when she was just really bad ass with a rope.
So yeah.
So this thing,
um,

2446
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:39.510
attack,
this dude is San Francisco Chronicle editor,
Phil Bronstein,

2447
02:23:39.511 --> 02:23:41.100
who is married to Sharon Stone,

2448
02:23:41.430 --> 02:23:45.870
who they were being treated to a private tour of the reptiles cage at the La Zoo

2449
02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:49.890
and he didn't have his shoes on.
I don't know why.

2450
02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:51.930
I guess like your shoes carry diseases or something.

2451
02:23:51.931 --> 02:23:55.680
They're worried about the fucking dragon,
this country monster with saliva of it.

2452
02:23:56.410 --> 02:23:59.670
Why would you want to get in the cage anyway to start with?

2453
02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:04.230
Let's take a private tour of the anamoly of the animal's home that's going to

2454
02:24:04.231 --> 02:24:06.840
kill you.
It would almost severed off his big toe.

2455
02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:11.520
The damage was exacerbated by the fact that Bronstein was barefoot at the time,

2456
02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:13.620
so it wasn't even white socks.
Oh.

2457
02:24:13.621 --> 02:24:16.650
He had removed his white tennis shoes before entering the cage.

2458
02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:21.060
After learning that the lizard was fed on a diet of white rats and might confuse

2459
02:24:21.061 --> 02:24:22.920
bronze teens feats for his next meal.

2460
02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:26.030
So this stupid bitch took his shoes off on a wall.
I don't want them affect,

2461
02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:30.170
my sneakers are a,
a rabbit trail foot.

2462
02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:35.550
The creature proved more myopic than officials anticipated.

2463
02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:39.570
Wow.
Stone who watched,
horrified from outside the cage,

2464
02:24:39.571 --> 02:24:43.230
later told San Francisco Chronicle that the lizard clampdown on Bronstein his

2465
02:24:43.231 --> 02:24:46.530
foot and became thrashing its body to and fro.

2466
02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:48.961
Fortunately,

2467
02:24:48.961 --> 02:24:52.590
Braunstein managed to free himself with the aid of it accompanies zookeeper who

2468
02:24:52.591 --> 02:24:55.980
was able to escape by clambering through the cages feeding hatch.

2469
02:24:56.430 --> 02:25:00.930
I would come back with an ax 100%.
It'd be like,
I don't know.

2470
02:25:00.931 --> 02:25:04.260
I don't care what you say.
I'm coming back with an ax.

2471
02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:07.950
I'm going to pay off the zookeeper guy and I'm going to come in there and I'm

2472
02:25:07.951 --> 02:25:10.770
going to hack that mother fucker to death and make a belt out of them.

2473
02:25:11.130 --> 02:25:14.900
Did the venom get it?
Oh yeah.
I mean,
I'm sure he had to be treated.
He,
uh,

2474
02:25:14.940 --> 02:25:18.760
he's in satisfactory condition at the time of this thing.
Um,

2475
02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:23.410
he apparently he's alive now,
but this was back in 2001.

2476
02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:25.380
Yeah.

2477
02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:28.830
<v 4>I wonder if it's like the snake that I'm,
where you get paralyzed and you know,</v>

2478
02:25:28.831 --> 02:25:30.870
it shuts your whole system down.

2479
02:25:31.140 --> 02:25:34.170
Like if you got bitten by a copperhead or something like that,

2480
02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:35.570
that's how it kills you.

2481
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:40.120
<v 6>Um,
no,
it's,
I think it's botulism.
I think that's what it is.</v>

2482
02:25:40.390 --> 02:25:41.770
I think the,
um,

2483
02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:47.160
the poison inside is basically just like rotting evil shit onside.

2484
02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:48.700
This thing's mouth.

2485
02:25:49.390 --> 02:25:53.260
Just the bacteria that grows inside of its mouth and what's,

2486
02:25:53.261 --> 02:25:56.040
find out colonel dryly guns.
Yeah.

2487
02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:59.410
But the idea that people would go way out of their way to make sure these things

2488
02:25:59.411 --> 02:26:02.770
are still alive.
Right.
Well,
I mean,
there's a lot,
there's a lot.
I mean,

2489
02:26:02.771 --> 02:26:06.520
it's kind of interesting to see them and I do agree that there's an educational

2490
02:26:06.521 --> 02:26:10.390
aspect to having crocodiles and lizards and things that your kids can see.

2491
02:26:10.391 --> 02:26:14.020
My kids love going to the zoo and seeing the,
the weird fucking animals.

2492
02:26:14.021 --> 02:26:16.250
I can probably kill you locked up in a cage,
but,

2493
02:26:18.430 --> 02:26:20.170
but man,
I dunno.

2494
02:26:20.410 --> 02:26:25.410
Well damn infected with so much bacteria that the bites can be deadly in the

2495
02:26:25.511 --> 02:26:30.130
bacteria spread from dragon two dragon.
Aw,
yeah.

2496
02:26:32.250 --> 02:26:33.083
<v 4>Boom.</v>

2497
02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:39.130
<v 6>Pray that escape one dragon often spread poison to the other dragons like one</v>

2498
02:26:39.681 --> 02:26:43.100
dragon.
We'll get bite it and it'll get all this bacteria in it too.

2499
02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:45.110
That show run away and another dragon won't bite it.

2500
02:26:45.111 --> 02:26:49.040
And then that's how they get their bacteria and give it to each other.
Wow.
Rose.

2501
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:51.920
Yeah.
Poor dental hygiene is what kills you.

2502
02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:52.551
<v 4>You know?</v>

2503
02:26:52.551 --> 02:26:57.200
The educational aspect of it is you don't need to see a real one to learn about

2504
02:26:57.201 --> 02:26:59.960
one.
Look how much we've learned today.
There's no dragon in here,

2505
02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:04.820
but we're learning.
You don't need a real one.
They're pretty dope.

2506
02:27:05.410 --> 02:27:09.140
<v 6>I mean,
I,
I don't want them here,
but if they're on an island somewhere,</v>

2507
02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:09.861
it's pretty dope.

2508
02:27:09.861 --> 02:27:13.940
But you can go and show up in a boat and videotape these crazy little dinosaurs

2509
02:27:13.941 --> 02:27:14.840
that are still alive.

2510
02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:20.320
Just a view as to at one point in time when dinosaurs really did own the earth.

2511
02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:24.170
If you go to these small islands,
these mother fuckers are running shit.

2512
02:27:24.470 --> 02:27:28.260
They're gigantic.
Huge evil lizards do.

2513
02:27:28.290 --> 02:27:33.020
They get their huge,
I think they get like more than way more than nine feet.

2514
02:27:33.050 --> 02:27:35.780
They're the biggest lizards.
They're not the biggest reptiles.

2515
02:27:35.781 --> 02:27:39.470
Crocodiles are the biggest reptiles,
but Komodo dragons are the biggest lizards.

2516
02:27:40.490 --> 02:27:43.720
I mean,
there are so nasty to,
Ooh,

2517
02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:46.070
<v 4>well that one looked really bad.
I don't want to see it fit.</v>

2518
02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:49.610
<v 6>They grow to a 150 pounds and they can be three meters long.</v>

2519
02:27:49.611 --> 02:27:54.500
10 it says 10 feet and weighing up to 150 pounds.

2520
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:59.390
Yeah.
Right here it says the unusual large size has been attributed to island

2521
02:27:59.391 --> 02:28:03.950
gigantism since no other carnivorous animals filled a niche on the islands where

2522
02:28:03.951 --> 02:28:05.210
they live.
However,

2523
02:28:05.211 --> 02:28:09.110
the recent research suggests that the large size of Komodo dragons may be better

2524
02:28:09.111 --> 02:28:14.111
understood as a representative of the relic population of very large Vera Nid,

2525
02:28:15.201 --> 02:28:18.680
lizards that once lived across Indonesia and Australia,

2526
02:28:18.770 --> 02:28:23.770
most of which along with other mega fauna died out after the pleistocene.

2527
02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:26.050
So the pleistocene,

2528
02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:30.040
<v 3>which was wow,
I'm looking at the pictures.
Don't do.
I looked at the face and one,</v>

2529
02:28:30.041 --> 02:28:33.430
they're nasty.
Yeah.
Wow.
You're fucking evil.

2530
02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:37.180
There's a great picture of one with its mouth wide open and you see all its

2531
02:28:37.181 --> 02:28:38.200
country saliva,

2532
02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:45.720
<v 6>see all that juicy poison roaming around and it's evil,</v>

2533
02:28:45.721 --> 02:28:46.830
stinky mouth.

2534
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:50.070
<v 3>Some of them are green and then some of them are brown.</v>

2535
02:28:50.190 --> 02:28:51.150
You know what's really interesting?

2536
02:28:51.151 --> 02:28:54.330
I bet someone's fucked one of those things take.
So yeah,

2537
02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:57.660
if there's an animal is a guy who was fucked it a local,

2538
02:28:57.780 --> 02:29:00.900
I don't think there's any for anything to,
they haven't fucked

2539
02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:04.940
<v 6>someone somewhere along the line that's known about these things.</v>

2540
02:29:04.941 --> 02:29:09.941
I mean if people have lived on the same planet as he's Kimono dragons for a

2541
02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:13.610
thousand years,
for sure.
One bad motherfucker had to have sex with one.

2542
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:19.120
<v 3>Yup.
And there's the one laying down that I think probably just shot a load right</v>

2543
02:29:19.121 --> 02:29:20.140
into a Komodo Dragon.

2544
02:29:20.141 --> 02:29:23.830
And just to let everybody know I'm a job the second in charge of this island,

2545
02:29:23.831 --> 02:29:28.090
I'm dominating this island.
If you,
uh,
yeah,

2546
02:29:28.450 --> 02:29:31.420
if you have an animal that a guy can hold down someone's fuck that somebody is

2547
02:29:31.430 --> 02:29:34.670
going to do it and they agree.
Canaries,
I can't,

2548
02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:37.000
someone's fucking narrowed it down to a bird.

2549
02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:39.730
They fuck the fuck chickens to death all the time.

2550
02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:45.070
A lot of people have done that.
Super Common.
Maybe Asians,
not agents.

2551
02:29:45.071 --> 02:29:48.720
Why would you say Asians and every bird?
Oh,
cause it's smalls.

2552
02:29:48.730 --> 02:29:53.110
I he's joking that they're just cute.
I thought you meant the chicken.
I'm like,

2553
02:29:53.111 --> 02:29:55.440
no,
it's two valid.
Okay,
well here's another one from really

2554
02:29:55.780 --> 02:29:58.990
<v 6>certainly the sister Commodos bite isn't an infectious at all.</v>

2555
02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:02.530
For years,
Komodo dragons have been thought to be filthy.

2556
02:30:02.531 --> 02:30:04.300
Mouths have filthy mouth.

2557
02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:07.360
It was said to the rotting flesh from past meals with collecting the teeth and

2558
02:30:07.361 --> 02:30:09.640
gums which shouldn't turn accumulate deadly bacteria.

2559
02:30:09.641 --> 02:30:14.641
This hypothesis jelled with observations made by herpetologists Walter,

2560
02:30:15.130 --> 02:30:16.060
often Berg,

2561
02:30:16.090 --> 02:30:20.350
who in the 1970s and eighties found even when Komodo dragons failed to bring

2562
02:30:20.351 --> 02:30:22.390
down massive pray like water buffalo,

2563
02:30:22.391 --> 02:30:27.040
a Bitton buffalo would succumb to sepsis within a matter of days.
Thus,

2564
02:30:27.041 --> 02:30:28.930
research researchers believed,

2565
02:30:29.380 --> 02:30:33.580
suggested that the Komodo had not just a venomous bite,
but aseptic one.

2566
02:30:33.581 --> 02:30:37.390
But now newly published findings revealed at the Komodo dragons bite is rather

2567
02:30:37.391 --> 02:30:41.950
ordinary and in fact no more toxic than many in any other carnivore.

2568
02:30:42.130 --> 02:30:46.870
The findings were made by a team led by venom researcher Brian Fe.

2569
02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:48.250
That's interesting.
Well,

2570
02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:51.280
he showed that the bacteria present in the Kimonos mouths are surprisingly

2571
02:30:51.281 --> 02:30:56.020
ordinary,
similar to what scientists find in any carnivore.
And more importantly,

2572
02:30:56.021 --> 02:31:01.021
the oral flora doesn't possess the pathogenicity required to kill.

2573
02:31:01.780 --> 02:31:05.530
As for previous research found about violent bacteria,

2574
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:09.760
the author notes that those species were identified without the advantage of

2575
02:31:09.761 --> 02:31:12.570
molecular methods of the 54 pre,
uh,

2576
02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:15.310
that previous research claim to be potentially pathogenic.

2577
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:20.670
33 of actually common microbes and unlikely to be the cause of the rapid fatal

2578
02:31:22.140 --> 02:31:25.620
infection when president of mood.
Huh?
That's interesting.

2579
02:31:25.621 --> 02:31:29.070
So what the fuck is what?
How's it killing people?
I don't know.

2580
02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:33.960
It says you have to visit,
discover to find out.
Okay,
so it was a discover.

2581
02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:38.340
What the fuck?
Let me get to the end here.
Figure it out.
Tell me what's up.

2582
02:31:39.180 --> 02:31:41.970
Did,
did,
did it,
do they have venom?

2583
02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:43.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2584
02:31:43.340 --> 02:31:47.180
<v 6>Monitor lizards.
A steak was venom is still mining reluctant.
Komodo Dragon Mri.</v>

2585
02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:50.830
Is this Steve Arvin?
Crazy asshole.
Okay.
Okay.

2586
02:31:50.831 --> 02:31:52.640
I was so nuts right away from it though.

2587
02:31:52.970 --> 02:31:55.280
Here's crawling around with them earlier in the video.

2588
02:31:59.060 --> 02:31:59.893
<v 2>Cranky.</v>

2589
02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:04.700
<v 6>Well,
they're saying that some of them,
it's from the,
the bleeding.</v>

2590
02:32:04.850 --> 02:32:08.390
The reason buffaloes get away from Kimonos aren't naturally equipped to take

2591
02:32:08.391 --> 02:32:11.680
down such large beasts.
Smelling his foot like,

2592
02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:16.430
oh God.
It's getting right up to him.
Yeah.
He just smelled his foot.

2593
02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:19.760
He's fucking crazy.
He lets those things get that close to him.

2594
02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:22.880
He did let those things get that call.
Some boy,

2595
02:32:22.881 --> 02:32:26.100
that guy dance with the devil for a long time before you got got.
Yup.

2596
02:32:26.640 --> 02:32:29.630
It's a fight.
A fight broke out right in front of him.

2597
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:30.583
<v 2>Great Point.</v>

2598
02:32:31.450 --> 02:32:32.650
<v 6>Two young miles.</v>

2599
02:32:35.380 --> 02:32:40.380
<v 2>[inaudible] they know that adults having a stand off midnight guy.</v>

2600
02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:43.860
Very powerful animals.

2601
02:32:45.130 --> 02:32:46.650
<v 6>He now I can.
Yeah,</v>

2602
02:32:49.170 --> 02:32:54.090
so they do have venom.
Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry.

2603
02:32:54.091 --> 02:32:56.250
You won't die of Sepsis from a Kimono bite.

2604
02:32:56.280 --> 02:33:01.050
You just die when the gigantic lizard with the inch long serrated teeth dripping

2605
02:33:01.051 --> 02:33:04.680
with hemorrhagic venom tears your flesh into shreds.

2606
02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:07.860
Oh,
it's hemorrhagic venom.

2607
02:33:08.670 --> 02:33:11.880
The strange interaction between a novel meal option.
No tourists.

2608
02:33:11.881 --> 02:33:15.900
Bees confused early investigators for water buffalo had never been introduced

2609
02:33:15.901 --> 02:33:16.650
onto the island.

2610
02:33:16.650 --> 02:33:21.060
Then this enhancing fairytale would have never come into existence.
Do,
do,

2611
02:33:21.070 --> 02:33:25.200
do this pitch around deep lacerations.
Oh,
is that his kid?
No,

2612
02:33:25.201 --> 02:33:27.360
I don't know who's getting this.
Okay,

2613
02:33:27.361 --> 02:33:32.361
so what they're saying is that it just the environment in which these animals

2614
02:33:33.271 --> 02:33:37.740
live,
anytime there's any sort of a deep laceration,

2615
02:33:37.950 --> 02:33:42.700
the environment is so filled with life and bacteria and jungle infect you.
Yeah.

2616
02:33:42.990 --> 02:33:46.380
You get infections or just what happens?

2617
02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:54.500
The buffalo wallow in stagnant warm water filled holes with their open feces.

2618
02:33:55.780 --> 02:33:58.300
The sewage fills hope filled holes say,

2619
02:33:58.360 --> 02:34:03.360
says fry our breeding pits of pathogenic bacteria when the water buffalo go

2620
02:34:03.911 --> 02:34:08.740
stand at the toxic water with gaping wounds that they get infected.

2621
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:12.250
And it's really been that simple all along they're saying it's a previous

2622
02:34:12.251 --> 02:34:16.300
research.
Okay,
so now they know.
So it's not saliva,
it's not poisoned all.

2623
02:34:16.301 --> 02:34:17.170
It's just a bite.

2624
02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:21.430
And anything that goes in that water with a big open sore is just going to

2625
02:34:21.431 --> 02:34:24.670
fucking die in a couple of days.
I'm gonna make sense.

2626
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:30.220
Yes.
So they're really good at killing pigs in deer.

2627
02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:35.350
That's their natural prey size.
So the water buffalo are large law a lot larger,

2628
02:34:35.470 --> 02:34:37.930
so that's why they,
they can't really take 'em out.

2629
02:34:38.050 --> 02:34:40.420
They just bite them and cut them open and then eventually,

2630
02:34:40.990 --> 02:34:42.040
so we learned something today.

2631
02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:47.130
<v 4>Yeah,
we did.
Do you feel better about Komodo dragons?
No,
I don't either.</v>

2632
02:34:47.220 --> 02:34:51.940
No.
I fucking hate those things.
I would like to be in,
like you said though,

2633
02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:55.400
in a boat that was not on shore.
Okay.

2634
02:34:55.480 --> 02:34:59.710
<v 6>I like to be under this looking at it,
but yeah.</v>

2635
02:35:00.430 --> 02:35:02.920
Yeah.
There's a lot of things out there that can fuck you up.

2636
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:06.100
That's why we made cities.
Exactly.
Just get in your car,

2637
02:35:06.490 --> 02:35:07.890
going to keep it together.
Bitch.

2638
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:11.260
Don't be bringing pythons and your fucking neighborhood and letting them loose

2639
02:35:11.261 --> 02:35:14.410
in your yard.
No,
Florida.
It's Florida.

2640
02:35:14.411 --> 02:35:16.890
Can you hear about the herpes infected monkeys in Florida?
I did.

2641
02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:19.690
Did you hear a thousand of them?

2642
02:35:20.350 --> 02:35:24.100
There's a thousand of growing breeding population of a thousand herpes infected

2643
02:35:24.101 --> 02:35:24.470
monkeys.

2644
02:35:24.470 --> 02:35:28.800
All of this living with old people who don't even know it's happening all the

2645
02:35:28.801 --> 02:35:32.050
way down.
All this capable.
There's are like a different kind of a herpes.

2646
02:35:32.051 --> 02:35:33.460
It's a herpes.
It kills people.

2647
02:35:33.550 --> 02:35:37.390
It's not like you get a bump on you and you got to go take some medication.
No,

2648
02:35:37.391 --> 02:35:41.470
this herpes like fucks your,
your neural system up.
Like you're,
you're done.

2649
02:35:41.900 --> 02:35:44.830
This is herpes be what?
Monkey herpes.

2650
02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:49.290
<v 4>I,
I'm,
I'm not even,
I'm not even clear on why there's wild monkeys in Florida.</v>

2651
02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:54.350
<v 6>Apparently they were brought in as part of like a Tarzan show that they put on.</v>

2652
02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:58.880
Seriously.
Yeah.
And then they,
you know,
just too fucking complicated.

2653
02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:02.300
People in Florida,
they get rid of their kids,
they send them to the jungle.

2654
02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:06.250
Everybody goes to everything.
Whenever you got,
just let it loose in the swamp.

2655
02:36:06.251 --> 02:36:07.970
But see what happens.
And these monkeys,

2656
02:36:07.971 --> 02:36:10.220
you started breeding and that was a thousand of them.

2657
02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:15.140
Thousand Rhesus monkeys with herps freezing.
Herps the kill.
I mean,

2658
02:36:15.141 --> 02:36:18.520
it's basically this,
the opening scene to 28 days later.
You know that,

2659
02:36:18.521 --> 02:36:21.500
that's Zombie movie where the monkey gets the range and then they run around

2660
02:36:21.501 --> 02:36:22.334
biting people.

2661
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:26.420
<v 4>Well,
the recent ones are so small too,
and they're fast.
They're quick as shit.</v>

2662
02:36:26.450 --> 02:36:27.283
That's a problem.

2663
02:36:27.390 --> 02:36:31.290
<v 6>And what are they eating?
They must be eating something.
Oh,
anything in the swamp?</v>

2664
02:36:31.370 --> 02:36:35.520
Yeah,
there's enough to eat Kraft thousand of them.

2665
02:36:35.521 --> 02:36:40.170
Herpes infected monkeys.
Florida is so strange.

2666
02:36:40.590 --> 02:36:44.400
It's like another planet.
It really is.
It's amazing.
Now for Comedians,

2667
02:36:44.401 --> 02:36:46.050
it's like one of the greatest resources ever.

2668
02:36:46.180 --> 02:36:48.880
<v 4>Mountain lions.
The panthers,</v>

2669
02:36:50.590 --> 02:36:53.860
pythons keep going out over at Florida.
How about the people?

2670
02:36:54.130 --> 02:36:56.920
Forget about all the animals that drive.
If you go across the state,

2671
02:36:56.921 --> 02:37:00.550
what do they call alligator alley from Muss Palm to Tampa.

2672
02:37:01.410 --> 02:37:05.170
[inaudible] America's finest.
Yeah,

2673
02:37:05.470 --> 02:37:08.290
it's creepy spot.
Well,
it's so transient.

2674
02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:12.190
That's why in like so many criminals and then you get the people who go,

2675
02:37:12.191 --> 02:37:14.800
I don't want to pay no state tax,
and they all run in Florida.

2676
02:37:14.801 --> 02:37:15.890
So you've got that group.

2677
02:37:16.310 --> 02:37:19.190
<v 3>You've got my parents and their friends and just kind of Washington state.</v>

2678
02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:22.240
Seattle is no state tax either.
They don't know where to see

2679
02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:27.920
lance too far.
I don't even talk Canadian.

2680
02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:32.950
They don't even have bass tournament's.
They don't know.
Yeah,

2681
02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:37.070
they have a contest to kill pythons and you win money and they didn't kill any

2682
02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:42.020
at a bunch of people on the couldn't get any.
It wasn't enough money either.

2683
02:37:42.021 --> 02:37:44.150
It's like 1000 bucks.
Really?

2684
02:37:44.151 --> 02:37:48.690
That's not enough money to win you only 1000 bucks.
Yeah,

2685
02:37:48.691 --> 02:37:50.480
but you have to kill a python.

2686
02:37:52.370 --> 02:37:57.040
I think somebody won.
I saw pictures of one probably went to a pet store.

2687
02:37:57.420 --> 02:38:00.770
Fucking beat something to death with a hammer.
Maybe for a grant.
I would do that.

2688
02:38:01.980 --> 02:38:05.510
Yeah.
They probably can't sell them anymore.
Right?
Isn't that what happens?

2689
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:07.250
They're killing.
No,
they killed him.

2690
02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:11.570
1500 bucks is what you get per python if you win.

2691
02:38:13.130 --> 02:38:17.870
I mean if they had 1500 bucks per python,
this is just bragging rights.

2692
02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:21.950
The 2013 python challenge.
We're kickoff this January.

2693
02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:27.650
Yeah.
Maybe they have another one this year.
Just this is just,
oh,
they,

2694
02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:30.940
okay.
They did turn in [inaudible] 68 of them.
Yeah.

2695
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:35.960
There's more than a million acres of swamps and saw grass and they found 68 of

2696
02:38:35.961 --> 02:38:39.920
these fucking pythons.
Well,
they're hard to find.
I know,
but it's not amazing.

2697
02:38:39.921 --> 02:38:43.430
They found 60 60 that's what I'm saying.
I knew it was a lot.
To me.

2698
02:38:43.431 --> 02:38:46.140
That's a lot that if you're,

2699
02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:51.550
how many of them are out there?
Good Shit.
Heads.

2700
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:56.660
I got a picture on here of this guy holding one.
Look how long it is.
Oh,

2701
02:38:56.670 --> 02:39:01.310
they're disgusting.
He's holding it by the tail.
Yeah,

2702
02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:05.910
it's enormous.
They found 1819 feeders footers.
They're feeders.

2703
02:39:07.010 --> 02:39:10.180
I don't think there are poisonous,
but they bite.
They'll fuck you up.
Yeah.

2704
02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:13.400
They grab a hold of union constrict you.
They've came,
they've killed kids.

2705
02:39:14.170 --> 02:39:17.090
They're really dangerous.
I know they're constrictors but they also bite.

2706
02:39:17.300 --> 02:39:22.250
I think people think,
oh,
it's a constrictor.
It won't bite.
Then still bytes.

2707
02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:26.600
Of course.
No Venom.
Right?
Yeah.
It doesn't have venom,
but it doesn't need it.

2708
02:39:27.090 --> 02:39:29.540
Right.
It's a gigantic crushing vice,

2709
02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:33.920
but just squeeze the life out of you and they also like time your breath.

2710
02:39:34.490 --> 02:39:38.840
Like they know when you breathe out.
That's when they clamped down.

2711
02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:41.540
So now he can't breathe and that's how they keep getting further.

2712
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:46.550
Further constricts your case and why is it okay to have them in your home and

2713
02:39:46.551 --> 02:39:48.820
I'll probably get hate mail for that,
but fucking crazy.

2714
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:51.980
That's why I think it's crazy.
That's the largest snake.

2715
02:39:51.981 --> 02:39:56.780
It was a 50 foot longs to 43 foot long size of a,
like a,
a bus.
Oh,

2716
02:39:56.781 --> 02:40:00.110
that's a titan boa.
Right.
That's what they call a titanic boa

2717
02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:04.130
anymore allegedly.

2718
02:40:05.130 --> 02:40:09.650
But they have anacondas that they think people have cited anacondas that are 90

2719
02:40:09.651 --> 02:40:14.010
feet long.
Shut up.
I have an anaconda wallet that used to be a

2720
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:17.730
<v 6>snake and I can go fuck itself.
Really?
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

2721
02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:19.080
not really into snakes.

2722
02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:23.550
<v 4>I am um,
the freakiest thing of all snake things to me.</v>

2723
02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:28.260
Is it a King Cobra can't stand up half its body length.
Yeah.

2724
02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:31.980
So if we were in a Indian rice field,

2725
02:40:32.010 --> 02:40:35.880
a Cobra could come up and cobras can grow up to be like 18 feet.

2726
02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:37.560
It could be nine feet tall.

2727
02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:43.190
You could come upon and he's only half up.
I mean,
how,

2728
02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:46.680
I mean,
seriously,
how,
how could anyone eat

2729
02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:50.110
<v 6>cobras are so dope.
Look into what a crazy body,</v>

2730
02:40:50.111 --> 02:40:52.810
that whole fan thing that it does.
Wow.

2731
02:40:54.250 --> 02:40:58.180
Giant Anaconda and Wiki PD.
Oh my God.

2732
02:40:59.350 --> 02:41:04.180
150 feet.
What?
Listen to this.

2733
02:41:04.181 --> 02:41:08.530
Reports of giant Anaconda is date back as far as the discovery of South America,

2734
02:41:08.531 --> 02:41:10.030
when sightings of Anacondas,

2735
02:41:10.060 --> 02:41:15.060
upwards of 50 meters began to circulate amongst colonists and the topic has been

2736
02:41:17.321 --> 02:41:21.130
the subject of debate ever since.
Among crypto zoologist in zoologists,

2737
02:41:21.340 --> 02:41:26.340
anacondas can grow to 20 feet and beyond and 330 pounds plus in weight.

2738
02:41:28.180 --> 02:41:31.810
Although some python species can grow larger and Anaconda,

2739
02:41:31.811 --> 02:41:35.920
particularly in green or common anacondas the heaviest,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

2740
02:41:35.921 --> 02:41:36.754
The largest,

2741
02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:41.880
longest reputably measured and confirmed Anaconda are 25 feet long and length

2742
02:41:43.811 --> 02:41:46.690
between 50 and 60 feet have been reported for this specimen,

2743
02:41:46.691 --> 02:41:49.270
but such extremes lacked verification.

2744
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:54.510
The only reliable claims it can be found describe measured anacondas ranging to

2745
02:41:54.641 --> 02:41:58.510
39 feet.
Fucking a man,

2746
02:41:59.770 --> 02:42:03.430
150 fucking feet.
If that's true,

2747
02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:09.610
that's like means literally that.
That's like the size of a car.

2748
02:42:09.970 --> 02:42:14.970
How wide is that God damn thing if it's 140 50 feet long as this table fucking

2749
02:42:15.220 --> 02:42:16.090
a,

2750
02:42:16.780 --> 02:42:20.320
that was that awesomely bad movie with Jon Voight and Jennifer Lopez.

2751
02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:24.100
Every,
every seen Jennifer Lopez had a tire shoes.

2752
02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:28.270
She just had a bent over and stick her ass up in the air and they're just stuck

2753
02:42:28.271 --> 02:42:29.470
counts giant.

2754
02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:33.670
She uhg how size snakes dropping down and fucking up Utah.

2755
02:42:33.940 --> 02:42:36.310
And John Voight has the worst Brazilian accent of all time.

2756
02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:40.180
John Voight's a great actor,
but boy does he suck at playing in Brazilian.

2757
02:42:40.210 --> 02:42:44.950
He's really good.
And um,
what you call it?
Uh,
uh,
Ray Donovan.

2758
02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:47.770
Oh,
is he really?
Yeah,
he's great.
He watched that.
And showtime.

2759
02:42:47.970 --> 02:42:52.000
Showtime finish showtime person.
Yes.
Dexter homeland.
Ray Donovan.
Yeah.

2760
02:42:52.001 --> 02:42:55.540
He plays an old [inaudible] gentleman's good,
please.
Oh,
you'd love it.
Really?

2761
02:42:55.560 --> 02:42:58.540
Yeah.
I'd love fucking homeland.
Is it good as homeland?

2762
02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:00.640
Better shut your fucking mouth.

2763
02:43:00.850 --> 02:43:04.410
<v 4>Not,
not,
not as a,
it's not as intense.</v>

2764
02:43:04.650 --> 02:43:07.130
<v 6>Oh,
what does it mean?
What's it better?
Because it has flowers.
Is that no,</v>

2765
02:43:07.140 --> 02:43:10.870
it's better because it's fucked up.
Irish violence.

2766
02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:15.580
<v 3>There's no terrorism and stuff.
This is just one guy out here.</v>

2767
02:43:15.581 --> 02:43:17.260
You're gonna wish you had him in your life.

2768
02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:20.440
I've already thought of a hundred times.
Wish I had right Donovan.

2769
02:43:20.441 --> 02:43:23.590
I could call right now.
He solves your problems.
Really?
Yeah.

2770
02:43:23.591 --> 02:43:25.470
And wish you had someone like that in your life.
Yeah.

2771
02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:28.840
Do you remember that guy who got arrested who was like a famous detective out

2772
02:43:28.841 --> 02:43:31.690
here who was actually that kind of a guy?
All the,
uh,

2773
02:43:31.691 --> 02:43:34.840
the Hollywood elite would use this guy and you would let stalk people.

2774
02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:37.990
That's probably what they modeled this after beat people up.
Yeah.

2775
02:43:38.100 --> 02:43:41.920
He beats people up a lot.
Yeah.
Um,
those guys exist,

2776
02:43:42.670 --> 02:43:46.300
but you just gotta be in the music business.
In the comedy business.

2777
02:43:46.301 --> 02:43:49.660
We don't have access to those guys were too loose lipped.
We would have like,

2778
02:43:49.661 --> 02:43:54.020
I got a fixer.
We look,
write jokes about it.
You know,
I have a stalker.

2779
02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:57.790
I can't too many beers at the bar and told everybody about the guy told

2780
02:43:57.791 --> 02:44:01.110
everybody about my fixer.
The Guy,
you're not supposed to tell anybody it.

2781
02:44:01.420 --> 02:44:04.450
You're not supposed to tell what that guy does.
Eddie the bar tender.

2782
02:44:04.451 --> 02:44:07.540
I don't know.
Maybe he told other people Kathleen Madigan.

2783
02:44:07.541 --> 02:44:10.930
You're fucking hilarious comedian.
Thank you.
When is your raw special coming out?

2784
02:44:11.050 --> 02:44:15.680

2785
02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:19.870

Knock it out.

2786
02:44:19.930 --> 02:44:24.430
Madigan again.

Yeah,
Matt,

2787
02:44:24.610 --> 02:44:27.960
I'm tired of thinking to titles.
That's a good way.
Tired that way.
People,

2788
02:44:27.970 --> 02:44:29.820

a lot of people put,
I have one from 2005 on there.

2791
02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:40.070
There's a lot of people have specials on Netflix now and so they're all the
rage.

2792
02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:44.120
All the rage,
all the kids are doing it.
Thanks for doing this.
We do it again.

2793
