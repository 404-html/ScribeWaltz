1
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.600
<v Speaker 1>And we're live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>that's the end of the world as we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.283
<v Speaker 1>Montana has been on fire for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida has three hurricanes headed </v>

4
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.630
<v Speaker 1>towards it and Houston is still have </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds</v>

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sad.</v>

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Have you been?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

8
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:24.070
<v Speaker 2>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

9
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of my ex sitting there and she's </v>

10
00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:28.660
<v Speaker 2>sending me photos and videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like her whole neighborhood's gone.</v>

11
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.793
<v Speaker 2>Her and like people have to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything outside for the insurance </v>

12
00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 2>collectors to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

13
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 2>So there's just everyone's house has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pile in front of it and all their stuff.</v>

14
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 2>And this is like no looting please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

15
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I saw that on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.523
<v Speaker 2>Fuck</v>

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.603
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's nothing stopping that </v>

18
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:49.094
<v Speaker 1>from happening for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the thing about like </v>

19
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:52.694
<v Speaker 1>Hurricane Irma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have harvey hits Houston and </v>

20
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>then Hurricane Irma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

21
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.093
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they said that this is very </v>

22
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>unusual because hurricane irma picked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed in the ocean,</v>

23
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.403
<v Speaker 1>which is a really bad sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They usually pick up speed in the Gulf </v>

24
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:13.490
<v Speaker 1>and the ideas that the Gulf has water </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's warmer and that's what causes it.</v>

25
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know shit about hurricanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally talking out my ass.</v>

26
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

27
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.743
<v Speaker 1>I really don't understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure that's what they're </v>

28
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:20.144
<v Speaker 1>saying is that this is a very unusual </v>
<v Speaker 1>storm because it actually picked up </v>

29
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>speed and picked up size and power in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean,</v>

30
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Speaker 1>which means the oceans warmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this could be a consequence of having</v>

31
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:32.294
<v Speaker 1>a warmer ocean is that these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurricanes could get bigger and bigger </v>

32
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.403
<v Speaker 1>in the ocean</v>

33
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 2>and it's usually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really unusual because you know you</v>

34
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 2>have like a such a big storm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the one I hit Houston,</v>

35
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.070
<v Speaker 2>that's usually once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once every couple years.</v>

36
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:45.904
<v Speaker 2>It's not twice in like a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like what Jose's right </v>

37
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 2>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's craziness.</v>

38
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:55.361
<v Speaker 2>I think they said there's two behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one formed in the Gulf next to</v>

39
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.130
<v Speaker 2>like off of Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eastern Mexico.</v>

40
00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.950
<v Speaker 2>So it's just another one at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

41
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.023
<v Speaker 2>Different place sitting there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There could be another one forming off </v>

42
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 2>the Cape in Africa where they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually forum,</v>

43
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.730
<v Speaker 2>but fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>

44
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.770
<v Speaker 2>We don't get hurricanes because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold water.</v>

45
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Is that the logic behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to live near cold water.</v>

47
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Just suck it up like a man and deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that cold water.</v>

48
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.673
<v Speaker 2>That water is fucking coal too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get in the water and the </v>

49
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.123
<v Speaker 2>Pacific Ocean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

50
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 2>what is this like?</v>

51
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.440
<v Speaker 2>This is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy cold.</v>

52
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Even in the middle of August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be a 100 degrees in Malibu.</v>

53
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 2>You get in that water and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

54
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.993
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only been in it twice since I've </v>

55
00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 2>lived here 13 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first,</v>

56
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first week I moved down </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

57
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.110
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to the ocean.</v>

58
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm running the ocean freezing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never hit it again.</v>

59
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 2>What does all this you're showing has </v>
<v Speaker 2>and please don't say that hurricanes and</v>

60
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.263
<v Speaker 2>these hurricanes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tropical cyclones or the 2017 Pacific </v>

61
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:53.924
<v Speaker 2>hurricane season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these are cyclones that I guess I've </v>

62
00:02:56.451 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>already happened this year either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assuming when I was pulling it up,</v>

63
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 3>they were in the past like long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

64
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know these other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this many had already come here.</v>

65
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.373
<v Speaker 3>When you look at this picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at this picture of the </v>

66
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.923
<v Speaker 3>United States gives you such a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>better sense of what it really is </v>

67
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.023
<v Speaker 3>because that picture like because all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the browns and the Greens and because </v>

68
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not seeing cities and because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a perfect scale,</v>

69
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 3>like pull back a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you see it in scale with the ocean.</v>

70
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you're looking at that,</v>

71
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.053
<v Speaker 3>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh that shit kid shift left and right a </v>

72
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:32.104
<v Speaker 3>bunch of times easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's way more water than there </v>

73
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 3>is ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is a fucking problem.</v>

74
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.710
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're next to an enormous chunk of blue.</v>

75
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 3>It's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

76
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

77
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 3>when I was living in that house in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Malibu for a couple months on the water,</v>

78
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rented a spot on the water.</v>

79
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 3>That's when you realize you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

80
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 3>that's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like you're living on the edge of</v>

81
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 3>a world that can just reach in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>swallow you freaking out.</v>

82
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Did you fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 3>You know when it freaks you out is at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

84
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 3>At night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It reveals its true self because like in</v>

85
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:19.440
<v Speaker 3>the day it looks beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Sun hits it.</v>

86
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:23.070
<v Speaker 3>It seemed so peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The birds or it's flat.</v>

87
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.323
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see a seal or maybe a dolphin or a </v>

88
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 3>whale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you see a whale,</v>

89
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 3>people see whales out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

90
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

91
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 3>But then at nighttime when the skies </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark and the sea is black,</v>

92
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 3>then you get to see what it really is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

93
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.193
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a.</v>

94
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 3>This is a whole nother world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a world of water,</v>

95
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.253
<v Speaker 3>and if we can touch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can go in between world and that </v>

96
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 3>world is far bigger than our world.</v>

97
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.593
<v Speaker 3>Then I started freaking out about all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit that we're pulling out of that </v>

98
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how gross we humans,</v>

99
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

100
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 3>we're just getting everything in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and scooping it up.</v>

101
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.433
<v Speaker 3>Just chopping it up and stuffed it into </v>
<v Speaker 3>cans and feed it to our pets and eating </v>

102
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 3>it like left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Raw Sushi whom yummy like that.</v>

103
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Never ending supply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucked up the world of the ocean.</v>

104
00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:20.084
<v Speaker 3>That is a real trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you stop and think about what it </v>

105
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:24.034
<v Speaker 3>really is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if it was in the sky above your </v>

106
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be freaked out all the time.</v>

107
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if like you reached up to touch it,</v>

108
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.443
<v Speaker 3>he'd be freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't want to be right next to </v>

109
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 3>that thing like Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's to alien.</v>

110
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:35.794
<v Speaker 3>I can't get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get away from it because it's </v>

111
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 3>right there and it's blue and we're on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>

112
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.063
<v Speaker 3>We feel like we're in control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're cocky because most of the time </v>

113
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 3>nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like no big deal.</v>

114
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 3>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the beach.</v>

115
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the beach gets sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut some bruise.</v>

116
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.733
<v Speaker 3>So like we like flirting with death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing at the edge of this impossible </v>

117
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:56.944
<v Speaker 3>to control life force filled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures filled with the biggest </v>

118
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 3>creatures in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

119
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 3>Aren't whales the biggest things on </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

120
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.083
<v Speaker 3>The you know what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the biggest living thing on </v>

121
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next to this.</v>

122
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.503
<v Speaker 3>There's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A group of mushrooms in the Pacific </v>

123
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:23.711
<v Speaker 3>northwest that are all connected in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered to be one enormous life form.</v>

124
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get this Guy Paul stamets.</v>

125
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.083
<v Speaker 3>I think that's his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that's how you say his name </v>

126
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a guy who studies mushrooms,</v>

127
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 3>some mushroom scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating studies,</v>

128
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.590
<v Speaker 3>fascinating articles and stuff online in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Blue Mountains in Oregon.</v>

129
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

130
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More precisely.</v>

131
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:46.334
<v Speaker 3>A specific honeyfund gus measuring two </v>
<v Speaker 3>point four miles across in the Blue </v>

132
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.243
<v Speaker 3>Mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's known as the largest living </v>

133
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 3>organism on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Several species of fungi belong to the.</v>

134
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Try that word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our Mila Ria.</v>

135
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm Ellaria Janice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Janice or Jenice.</v>

136
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 3>How do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a read one.</v>

137
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 3>That's what I read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never say,</v>

138
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:07.623
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never used that in a conversation and </v>

139
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:09.494
<v Speaker 3>wanting to be a super pretentious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to be like a really high to be </v>

140
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 3>that pretentious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm A.</v>

141
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a malaria and malaria.</v>

142
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Malaria or malaria or malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jenise,</v>

143
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.203
<v Speaker 3>which is probably a properly rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>popularly known as honeyfund gus two </v>

144
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:29.264
<v Speaker 3>point four miles across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked how they give it to us in </v>

145
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 3>kilometers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you don't want to be stupid,</v>

146
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.833
<v Speaker 3>three point eight kilometers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be like the rest of the </v>

147
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:37.934
<v Speaker 3>world and do everything in tens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking idiots sticking a miles and </v>

148
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 3>inches.</v>

149
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do we do that?</v>

150
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Because we're gross parts of America </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are gross,</v>

151
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

152
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 3>we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

153
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 3>well we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We found a much better system.</v>

154
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 3>It makes more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all intends the whole world.</v>

155
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 3>Use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

156
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Good luck with that fucking stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

157
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 3>I'll take inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brow yards,</v>

158
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.893
<v Speaker 3>inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels good to when you're in like </v>

159
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 3>other countries and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you going 120 miles an hour?</v>

160
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a different.</v>

161
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.573
<v Speaker 3>So they're like 62 is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it's a hundred kilometers </v>

162
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.143
<v Speaker 3>an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's actually more than </v>

163
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:21.254
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say so always thinking it's </v>

164
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 3>half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's probably wrong.</v>

165
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.201
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

166
00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

167
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.570
<v Speaker 3>I honestly don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Sixty to 100 miles an hour?</v>

168
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.300
<v Speaker 3>100 kilometer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 kilometers rather 62 miles an hour.</v>

169
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.050
<v Speaker 3>100 sounds cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

170
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Speaker 3>kilometers or just they're better.</v>

171
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 3>We're using some old king shit inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be weird to change now though.</v>

172
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 3>Like we had to be born with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's cool dude.</v>

173
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:46.844
<v Speaker 3>When I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know about when you were </v>

174
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:50.120
<v Speaker 3>in high school but when I was in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school they were trying.</v>

175
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 3>There was a real push to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use the metric system that I don't think</v>

176
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 3>exists anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

177
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 3>but I mean maybe it was just the schools</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was in.</v>

178
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I would like to talk to other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are like my age that could remember</v>

179
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:05.304
<v Speaker 3>like the 19 eighties because of the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties I think that they were trying </v>

180
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:09.024
<v Speaker 3>to push the metric system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I kind of caught on the tail </v>

181
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember it at all from scratch.</v>

182
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 3>The United States is now the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>industrialized country in the world that</v>

183
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:21.831
<v Speaker 3>does not use the metric system and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>predominant system of measurement.</v>

184
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 3>Most Americans link,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that our involvement with metric</v>

185
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 3>measures measurement is relatively new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not right.</v>

186
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year did they try and do it?</v>

187
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.910
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 75.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the metric conversion act of 1975?</v>

188
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I remember.</v>

189
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>share Ford.</v>

190
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying that because maybe it </v>

191
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 3>wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I wasn't in high school.</v>

192
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was before high school.</v>

193
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.573
<v Speaker 4>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was looking something up the other </v>

194
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:49.674
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was when you asked are the </v>

195
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.110
<v Speaker 4>president's allowed to change the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

196
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 4>White House or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it was Ford that added solar</v>

197
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:57.714
<v Speaker 4>panels to the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was looking up and then the next </v>

198
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:02.100
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which might've been Nixon,</v>

199
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.383
<v Speaker 4>took them out and they didn't have them </v>
<v Speaker 4>re-installed and thick until Obama was </v>

200
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whatever,</v>

201
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.933
<v Speaker 4>five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was like 25 years of no solar </v>

202
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 4>panels when they already had them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were already headed that way.</v>

203
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Super Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is weird.</v>

204
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 3>You see the new apple campus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

205
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.190
<v Speaker 3>that they're gonna show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess next week,</v>

206
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 3>next Tuesday when they haven't seen much</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

207
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 3>But I know that it's supposed to be some</v>
<v Speaker 3>insanely impossible,</v>

208
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 3>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy place.</v>

209
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.080
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's now finished.</v>

210
00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 3>They have like drone footage that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can like just go round.</v>

211
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:40.190
<v Speaker 3>It looks just like a round donut </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaceship and the whole a roof.</v>

212
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 3>A solar collectors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that powers itself.</v>

213
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

214
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 3>That might be a computer image of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that is.</v>

215
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>

216
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Back in on the computer image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

217
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.773
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be so cool to have the kind of </v>

218
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 3>money where you could just build </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

219
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:02.390
<v Speaker 3>well you guys want to do some shit bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

220
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.230
<v Speaker 3>It's make a fucking giant apple </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaceship.</v>

221
00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:07.670
<v Speaker 3>She would make it the shape of an apple </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

222
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Colony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could.</v>

223
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 3>They could have easily made that thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>in apple,</v>

224
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.570
<v Speaker 3>but then they would have never been able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sell it yet.</v>

225
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

226
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.010
<v Speaker 3>It's going to go to like a tire company </v>
<v Speaker 3>next.</v>

227
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Never be able to sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

228
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they do,</v>

229
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 3>no one wants to buy your stupid apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't like the touch bar on your Mac</v>

230
00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:29.590
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've not even seen one in person yet.</v>

231
00:11:29.591 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I think.</v>

232
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:33.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's kind of cute,</v>

233
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.460
<v Speaker 3>but it does a lot of different stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I never use and um,</v>

234
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.400
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also there's like a Siri button that</v>

235
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:42.234
<v Speaker 3>I accidentally pressed all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>while I'm typing because I suck at </v>

236
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:46.640
<v Speaker 3>typing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

237
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:48.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

238
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:48.893
<v Speaker 3>I'm not very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really should practice and get better </v>

239
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 3>at it.</v>

240
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 3>I just have every time I get a chance to</v>
<v Speaker 3>write,</v>

241
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:55.510
<v Speaker 3>I just write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can turn it off,</v>

242
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The touch bar though.</v>

243
00:11:57.071 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could.</v>

244
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.370
<v Speaker 3>You can do stuff with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

245
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.213
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you could totally turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>it off because then you turn off the </v>

246
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:05.050
<v Speaker 3>volume control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the volume control is.</v>

247
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

248
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.530
<v Speaker 3>The brightness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the volume control everything.</v>

249
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is that fucking Siri </v>
<v Speaker 3>Button.</v>

250
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 3>It's right above the delete key with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>

251
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:14.884
<v Speaker 3>Stupid fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I touched that thing at least once a </v>

252
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can siri off.</v>

253
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 3>She's off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're off bitch.</v>

254
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:22.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

255
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't want Siri on my God damn laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

256
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.440
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just an accidental touch thing.</v>

257
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 3>It's an and it's not the best keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very shallow touch,</v>

258
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some people like that.</v>

259
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 3>It's very precise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give it that,</v>

260
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.860
<v Speaker 3>but I like the IBM over the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

261
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.860
<v Speaker 3>those think pants who's making those </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lenovo,</v>

262
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.753
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

263
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 3>They have a way better feel to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>keyboard,</v>

264
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.040
<v Speaker 3>mechanical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the apple's operating system.</v>

265
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:51.874
<v Speaker 3>To me it's just way better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say way better because </v>

266
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 3>windows 10 is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just more familiar.</v>

267
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.293
<v Speaker 3>Say at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was way better for a long time for </v>

268
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:01.200
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

269
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.540
<v Speaker 3>there's more options if you want to buy </v>
<v Speaker 3>a windows computer,</v>

270
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.510
<v Speaker 3>like you can get so many different kinds</v>
<v Speaker 3>of computers.</v>

271
00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:09.680
<v Speaker 3>You can get big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small ones.</v>

272
00:13:09.681 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 3>You get ones with interesting keyboards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get ones with keyboards,</v>

273
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:12.881
<v Speaker 3>they feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

274
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:14.980
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Mac book or you get other ones,</v>

275
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:18.390
<v Speaker 3>like a thinkpad that it feels almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a mechanical keyboard.</v>

276
00:13:18.391 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 3>It's got a lot more touch to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it seems stupid,</v>

277
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 3>but to me that like tactile feel is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very important part of writing.</v>

278
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.290
<v Speaker 3>It helps me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It helps.</v>

279
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.183
<v Speaker 3>Like I like to to get in a good groove </v>
<v Speaker 3>with where my fingers are growing and </v>

280
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Speaker 3>when I have actual physical keys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stick up a little bit more and they have</v>

281
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:41.380
<v Speaker 3>a little push to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My fingers find their way better.</v>

282
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.480
<v Speaker 3>It's hard when you're on this like very </v>
<v Speaker 3>thin keyboard.</v>

283
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Just me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I always upgraded my keyboard so I like </v>

285

<v Speaker 3>Her keyboards are really nice.</v>

286
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:52.204
<v Speaker 3>They make it a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a mechanical razer keyboard for </v>

287
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.930

306
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:39.484
<v Speaker 3>You know how deep you're going when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get three screens popped open because </v>

307
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.693
<v Speaker 3>we're all on porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three different movies going on at the </v>

308
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:46.054
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus you're playing a game in the </v>

309
00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:47.974
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you worry about like our devices </v>

310
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 3>listening</v>

311
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.080
<v Speaker 5>to us at all time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Alexa's and Siri's and it was.</v>

312
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.430
<v Speaker 5>They definitely are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh they are.</v>

313
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.130
<v Speaker 5>That's how they work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

314
00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:00.070
<v Speaker 5>Hey Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like this</v>

315
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.433
<v Speaker 3>inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like this is where it's all </v>

316
00:15:03.061 --> 00:15:04.080
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

317
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:09.180
<v Speaker 3>I think that you could fight it off if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want and you could probably stay out</v>

318
00:15:09.181 --> 00:15:10.014
<v Speaker 3>of it for a really long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately we are so much less </v>

319
00:15:14.821 --> 00:15:15.654
<v Speaker 3>private today than we were a decade ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think people really really </v>

320
00:15:20.281 --> 00:15:24.570
<v Speaker 3>feel it yet because a lot of the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are like 25 today,</v>

321
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.823
<v Speaker 3>you guys grew up with the Internet being</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this preeminent thing like Brian </v>

322
00:15:30.571 --> 00:15:31.404
<v Speaker 3>and I when we were kids there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing and then all the sudden it came </v>

323
00:15:35.431 --> 00:15:37.830
<v Speaker 3>about when we were in adulthood and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

324
00:15:37.831 --> 00:15:39.540
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is nuts.</v>

325
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.583
<v Speaker 3>Like this is all connected and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole world is learning a whole new </v>

326
00:15:45.421 --> 00:15:48.840
<v Speaker 3>style of being a person because of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection.</v>

327
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's changing everything</v>

328
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 5>and kids are born into that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they've had it since they were born</v>

329
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:56.330
<v Speaker 5>now for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're completely different.</v>

330
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.640

<v Speaker 5>Vegan.</v>

<v Speaker 3>All the fucking motorcycle accidents and</v>

347
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.243
<v Speaker 3>coyote attacks and just that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's never been a person like us in </v>

348
00:16:57.291 --> 00:17:00.380
<v Speaker 3>terms of like the person with that kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of access to information.</v>

349
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.820
<v Speaker 3>We're the first generation ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's never been anyone before us</v>

350
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.830
<v Speaker 3>and we're all figuring out as we go </v>
<v Speaker 3>along.</v>

351
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.550
<v Speaker 5>It's like we're at the library nonstop </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the card catalog,</v>

352
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:11.660
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at stuff,</v>

353
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 5>doing research papers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

354
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 5>nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nonstop,</v>

355
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:15.523
<v Speaker 5>on everything,</v>

356
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:20.820
<v Speaker 3>nonstop on everything you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you got all your factions.</v>

357
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:22.653
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we put group up the group by white </v>

358
00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:28.360
<v Speaker 3>supremacists factions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got flat earth factions.</v>

359
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.900
<v Speaker 3>You've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've got giant groups of people</v>

360
00:17:31.901 --> 00:17:32.734
<v Speaker 3>who chunk up together and they all like </v>
<v Speaker 3>share memes and they make fun of </v>

361
00:17:36.851 --> 00:17:41.350
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw one online,</v>

362
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.243
<v Speaker 3>it was a flat earth guy calling all </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who believe the earth is round </v>

363
00:17:47.711 --> 00:17:50.730
<v Speaker 3>globe heads and it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

364
00:17:50.731 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a whole series of them.</v>

365
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.560
<v Speaker 3>There's like hundreds of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

366
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.170
<v Speaker 3>where people are mocking the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth is round.</v>

367
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.600
<v Speaker 3>You could fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find Anything Online,</v>

368
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything,</v>

369
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.280
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any weird group you can find them.</v>

370
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.913
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I typed it in Google and there's just </v>

371
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:13.260
<v Speaker 3>like the first three things or videos </v>
<v Speaker 3>like another globe had theory debunked.</v>

372
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pissed off dude.</v>

373
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:20.190
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love those people now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to get upset at them.</v>

374
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.180
<v Speaker 3>Now I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents were glow peds.</v>

375
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:25.014
<v Speaker 3>Not Anymore to burn the house down </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the parents think the world is </v>

376
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:29.250
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the meme.</v>

377
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.503
<v Speaker 3>It's a child standing in front with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smile standing in front of a burning </v>

378
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:35.820
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since my parents were global heads.</v>

379
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.863
<v Speaker 3>Not Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is my point is it's the same </v>

380
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:41.550
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>

381
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.750
<v Speaker 3>it's all the same kind of mental illness</v>
<v Speaker 3>that drags you into this group Hook,</v>

382
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:46.620
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sinker.</v>

383
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 3>If the group doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>

384
00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:50.184
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegan bloggers try and take out other </v>

385
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:53.304
<v Speaker 3>vegan bloggers or whether it's this idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the world is round and that the </v>

386
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.300
<v Speaker 3>people think the world is round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should have their houses burnt down.</v>

387
00:19:01.301 --> 00:19:02.134
<v Speaker 3>A little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd be smiling even though it's their </v>

388
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:04.260
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>

389
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

390
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 3>this is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't,</v>

391
00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:09.850
<v Speaker 3>haven't talked to him too many flat </v>
<v Speaker 3>earthers but uh,</v>

392
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.851
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my,</v>

393
00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:12.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Pereira,</v>

394
00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:13.591
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

395
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:14.424
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attached a gopro camera to a weather </v>

396
00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:21.630
<v Speaker 3>balloon one time or a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when it goes up to a certain point,</v>

397
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.280
<v Speaker 3>it's around earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the cameras show.</v>

398
00:19:24.281 --> 00:19:26.000
<v Speaker 3>It can't live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it global?</v>

399
00:19:26.001 --> 00:19:28.740
<v Speaker 3>Is shill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know Shit,</v>

400
00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:30.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie.</v>

401
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Eddie does believe in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

402
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Like he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't,</v>

403
00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.160
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't say does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't,</v>

404
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.650
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't know about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He keeps an open mind with everything.</v>

405
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.580
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

406
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's actually saying maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

407
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's not saying that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

408
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fun for people too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's that.</v>

409
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.850
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to think that they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to the end is really,</v>

410
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.430
<v Speaker 3>it's fun to say you don't know and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

411
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

412
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

413
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.233
<v Speaker 3>That's the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's one thing that like if </v>

414
00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:01.380
<v Speaker 3>you're talking to flat earth people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

415
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 3>why are you so confident that the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>is round?</v>

416
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Like you got a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing any experiments.</v>

417
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.333
<v Speaker 3>I've never really looked at the data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at all those satellite </v>

418
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 3>images though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would assume that all those people</v>

419
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 3>who are making maps and flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcontinental flights,</v>

420
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.660
<v Speaker 3>pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people make satellites,</v>

421
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.580
<v Speaker 3>people have actually been to space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that not all in cahoots,</v>

422
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:27.873
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know might be the biggest </v>

423
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.630
<v Speaker 3>hoax pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine if we're really living</v>

424
00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:34.171
<v Speaker 3>until.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

425
00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:36.330
<v Speaker 3>what was that Jim Carrey movie the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Truman show?</v>

426
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Truman show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

427
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.083
<v Speaker 3>If we're really living in some bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 3>simulation and we are in a dome and </v>

428
00:20:43.621 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 3>we've been just trick some fake numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>science and images,</v>

429
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.903
<v Speaker 2>I continue to think that more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the point where that's my religion </v>

430
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.680
<v Speaker 2>where people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my flatter to the.</v>

431
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.420
<v Speaker 2>It's getting so weird the older you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much I believe in that kind of shit.</v>

432
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.700
<v Speaker 3>Like a simulation simulation stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's probably.</v>

433
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.013
<v Speaker 3>I think we probably have a deeper </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection that we can't measure and </v>

434
00:21:07.501 --> 00:21:10.980
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the reasons why it seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>like things could be fake.</v>

435
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.280
<v Speaker 3>I think we have a connection that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing too.</v>

436
00:21:14.281 --> 00:21:15.114
<v Speaker 3>I think our connection with our reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just because of information and </v>

437
00:21:18.991 --> 00:21:21.600
<v Speaker 3>technology that allows you to call each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and stuff like that.</v>

438
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:22.733
<v Speaker 3>I think the information that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting is allowing us to like almost </v>

439
00:21:26.641 --> 00:21:27.474
<v Speaker 3>like go through the world in a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>way and things are sinking up more and </v>

440
00:21:31.111 --> 00:21:33.470
<v Speaker 3>more with a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

441
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.840
<v Speaker 3>I hear that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like total horseshit though,</v>

442
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:42.570
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like what is the placebo effect,</v>

443
00:21:42.571 --> 00:21:43.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that</v>

444
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.840
<v Speaker 2>tricking your brain and to something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not there,</v>

445
00:21:47.841 --> 00:21:48.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

446
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.153
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you trick your body into thinking </v>

447
00:21:50.361 --> 00:21:52.670
<v Speaker 3>that it took medicine and your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>heals itself.</v>

448
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is that?</v>

449
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.600
<v Speaker 3>So there's some tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some tricks you keep.</v>

450
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.500
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even happen with like </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine.</v>

451
00:22:00.501 --> 00:22:04.250
<v Speaker 3>They music and wearing certain forms </v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets you pumped up.</v>

452
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.960
<v Speaker 3>Music is a perfect example right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's songs that,</v>

453
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.023
<v Speaker 3>there are songs that I hear when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>working out and I fucking workout </v>

454
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:12.583
<v Speaker 3>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they give me lecture more fucking </v>

455
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 3>more pep or energy and then there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of fucking movies that do that too.</v>

456
00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:21.464
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I saw rocky when I was a little </v>

457
00:22:22.761 --> 00:22:23.930
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran around the block,</v>

458
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I drank raw eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did the whole thing because I was just</v>

459
00:22:28.431 --> 00:22:32.180
<v Speaker 3>like so pumped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That movie literally gives you energy.</v>

460
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.960
<v Speaker 2>I think every kid ate raw eggs when that</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie came out.</v>

461
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.400
<v Speaker 2>I remember doing it with my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

462
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.420
<v Speaker 2>And then there's glitches in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation,</v>

463
00:22:41.421 --> 00:22:41.961
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

464
00:22:41.961 --> 00:22:42.794
<v Speaker 2>like Deja Vu and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or when you're walking down a sidewalk </v>

465
00:22:45.021 --> 00:22:47.210
<v Speaker 2>and you know how you just walk people </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking next to you,</v>

466
00:22:47.211 --> 00:22:48.044
<v Speaker 2>like no big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's that one guy where you </v>

467
00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.510
<v Speaker 2>try to go left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going left,</v>

468
00:22:51.511 --> 00:22:52.940
<v Speaker 2>you're going right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're just like,</v>

469
00:22:52.941 --> 00:22:54.470
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did we just sync up here?</v>

470
00:22:54.471 --> 00:22:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck happened there?</v>

471
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Just random randomness up at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

472
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.923
<v Speaker 2>I just made me think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw this article recently came </v>

473
00:23:02.391 --> 00:23:04.490
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>others a study about why music gives you</v>

474
00:23:04.491 --> 00:23:05.324
<v Speaker 2>goosebumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists studied 10 people that claim </v>

475
00:23:07.521 --> 00:23:08.354
<v Speaker 2>that they get chills when they hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain songs or certain things happen </v>

476
00:23:11.031 --> 00:23:12.410
<v Speaker 2>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>

477
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.273
<v Speaker 2>They did brain scans on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they found out is that their </v>

478
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.780
<v Speaker 2>auditory cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

479
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.630
<v Speaker 2>or if they have fibers in the auditory </v>
<v Speaker 2>cortex that are stronger,</v>

480
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I guess whatever the stronger than </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't feel that,</v>

481
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.493
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which leads to a stronger emotion </v>

482
00:23:26.931 --> 00:23:27.764
<v Speaker 2>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they think that it can be used to </v>

483
00:23:29.511 --> 00:23:30.344
<v Speaker 2>treat people with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get them to bring up feelings that </v>

484
00:23:32.181 --> 00:23:35.030
<v Speaker 2>they might not be able to access </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise.</v>

485
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously just a new study and it's</v>

486
00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.070
<v Speaker 2>lots of theory and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

487
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:42.783
<v Speaker 3>like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's another interesting way to look </v>

488
00:23:44.391 --> 00:23:45.224
<v Speaker 3>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it about a song that gets you like </v>

489
00:23:48.591 --> 00:23:49.940
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gives you that energy.</v>

490
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.870
<v Speaker 3>And part of it is like the novelty of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearing the song.</v>

491
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Not meaning that you don't want to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the song is about,</v>

492
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.560
<v Speaker 3>but you can't hear it too many times or </v>
<v Speaker 3>it loses impact.</v>

493
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like after awhile song becomes like flat</v>

494
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.110
<v Speaker 3>if you hear it too many times in a row.</v>

495
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.013
<v Speaker 4>I've tried to notice when it happens to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and more often not as from a live </v>

496
00:24:09.451 --> 00:24:10.830
<v Speaker 4>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think I've,</v>

497
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.793
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

498
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:12.863
<v Speaker 4>I'm feeling the emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person singing it has a little bit </v>

499
00:24:15.541 --> 00:24:16.374
<v Speaker 4>and I like I've noticed it's more often </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a real live or there that person's </v>

500
00:24:19.411 --> 00:24:21.870
<v Speaker 4>first time on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those kinds of things.</v>

501
00:24:21.871 --> 00:24:23.850
<v Speaker 4>It happens more than just like listen to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the radio or</v>

502
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.943
<v Speaker 3>it could probably get annoying too if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you heard it over and over and over </v>

503
00:24:27.371 --> 00:24:29.110
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Radio kills music.</v>

504
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember back in the day when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would hear a song over and over again on</v>

505
00:24:34.331 --> 00:24:36.010
<v Speaker 3>the radio and you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

506
00:24:36.011 --> 00:24:36.844
<v Speaker 3>This song again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually get annoyed if you go to </v>

507
00:24:39.041 --> 00:24:40.030
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

508
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.700
<v Speaker 3>any local radio station turn on or rocks</v>
<v Speaker 3>channel,</v>

509
00:24:42.701 --> 00:24:45.370
<v Speaker 3>you know you're going to hear like one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of three songs in an hour.</v>

510
00:24:45.371 --> 00:24:46.204
<v Speaker 3>At least like one metallica song they </v>
<v Speaker 3>enter Sandman is going to come on once </v>

511
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.380
<v Speaker 3>has to come on board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Metallica.</v>

512
00:24:50.381 --> 00:24:51.214
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

513
00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:52.690
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

514
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.803
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how fucking tough gig because </v>

515
00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:00.630
<v Speaker 3>those guys like know the Dj's never got </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the freedom anymore to go loose.</v>

516
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.003
<v Speaker 3>That just a roll up with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>records to start playing some shit that </v>

517
00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:07.390
<v Speaker 3>they like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they used to do.</v>

518
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

519
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.040
<v Speaker 3>but they always had program managers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

520
00:25:12.041 --> 00:25:12.874
<v Speaker 3>So the program manager would influence </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they would put on a little bit for </v>

521
00:25:15.971 --> 00:25:16.804
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when they would play a </v>

522
00:25:18.941 --> 00:25:19.774
<v Speaker 3>record?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could hear the record skip </v>

523
00:25:21.521 --> 00:25:22.354
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes sometimes it would skip </v>

524
00:25:24.881 --> 00:25:25.714
<v Speaker 3>though and they would have to like go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and like we're sorry about that </v>

525
00:25:28.661 --> 00:25:29.494
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some fucking dude is not paying </v>

526
00:25:31.001 --> 00:25:31.834
<v Speaker 3>attention and he's off often the </v>
<v Speaker 3>restroom or something like that or </v>

527
00:25:33.701 --> 00:25:36.790
<v Speaker 3>getting a cup of coffee while the songs </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing and he doesn't realize that it's</v>

528
00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:39.100
<v Speaker 3>been skipping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens all the time.</v>

529
00:25:39.101 --> 00:25:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a local Dj here in Los Angeles that</v>

530
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.873
<v Speaker 3>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He plays records and he's like a real </v>

531
00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:47.580
<v Speaker 3>djs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the last guys I think.</v>

532
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's been a year since I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to the radio,</v>

533
00:25:50.171 --> 00:25:51.004
<v Speaker 3>but he used to be really cool and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could hear the static of the record and </v>

534
00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:54.680
<v Speaker 3>it was cool.</v>

535
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what channel that was.</v>

536
00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that Christian slater </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie or Christian slater was a volume.</v>

537
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.790
<v Speaker 3>He had like a pirate radio station and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to get them.</v>

538
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.420
<v Speaker 3>The government was chasing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very,</v>

539
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like smokey and the bandit ask.</v>

540
00:26:09.071 --> 00:26:11.690
<v Speaker 3>It was so stupid the way they're chasing</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

541
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.520
<v Speaker 3>trying to get him because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcasting and you can't do that,</v>

542
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:16.853
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's wild and he's good luck </v>

543
00:26:18.521 --> 00:26:20.800
<v Speaker 3>in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's rebellious.</v>

544
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't he supposed to be in high school </v>
<v Speaker 3>too or something like that.</v>

545
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.750
<v Speaker 3>That was the weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The third year it was one of my favorite</v>

546
00:26:25.751 --> 00:26:27.280
<v Speaker 3>movies growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

547
00:26:27.281 --> 00:26:31.600
<v Speaker 3>That was a great dude at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a great movie for sure.</v>

548
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying like how weird was it?</v>

549
00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Like back then if you had like a pirate </v>
<v Speaker 3>radio station,</v>

550
00:26:36.851 --> 00:26:39.220
<v Speaker 3>you a rebel and people would be out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there in the woods listening.</v>

551
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.630
<v Speaker 3>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

552
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.120
<v Speaker 3>if you send me out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still.</v>

553
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

554
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 5>if you're still alive you could still </v>
<v Speaker 5>kick some ass.</v>

555
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:52.170
<v Speaker 5>Be Given these fucking corny pump them </v>
<v Speaker 5>up speeches to all the young kids.</v>

556
00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:53.250
<v Speaker 5>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>we gotta we gotta rise against like all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the old people were retarded.</v>

558
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.330
<v Speaker 5>Although none of the old people made any</v>
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>

559
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:04.050
<v Speaker 5>It was the young people that knew that </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything was wrong in the system.</v>

560
00:27:04.051 --> 00:27:06.640
<v Speaker 5>Man looks like Pre-internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

<v Speaker 5>because there's so many scenes where the</v>

<v Speaker 5>guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to contact Mary.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just listened to dragon.</v>

750
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.880
<v Speaker 1>The TAC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.</v>

751
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Have you made yourself to the Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got into your Max,</v>

752
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.810
<v Speaker 1>like you're not allowed to go any </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher,</v>

753
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.170
<v Speaker 1>longer in the free thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how it starts?</v>

754
00:36:09.171 --> 00:36:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like you going in more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than three minutes.</v>

755
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:12.683
<v Speaker 1>Three minutes is pretty much the Max,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I go in three minutes that I weighed </v>

756
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:16.440
<v Speaker 1>out for 10 minutes.</v>

757
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Then I go in for another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animal do it feels good.</v>

758
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.980
<v Speaker 1>It feels like when you come out like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slushy,</v>

759
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:26.040
<v Speaker 1>is it little ice or something different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do anything.</v>

760
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.110
<v Speaker 1>All it does is it makes your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce a lot of antiinflammatories,</v>

761
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.730
<v Speaker 1>like a heat shock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold shock proteins called cytokines.</v>

762
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:36.623
<v Speaker 1>Your body produces and when it freaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out and thinks it's going to </v>

763
00:36:38.281 --> 00:36:41.010
<v Speaker 1>die because it's so cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

764
00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:43.320
<v Speaker 1>just if you feel amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it free.</v>

765
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:45.450
<v Speaker 1>It really feels amazing when you come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of there,</v>

766
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.560
<v Speaker 1>like you feel like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

767
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.443
<v Speaker 1>Dr Rhonda Patrick explained it </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically when she did a podcast </v>

768
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:55.620
<v Speaker 1>about it and she was talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased.</v>

769
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm anti inflammatory markers in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood,</v>

770
00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:00.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing was that,</v>

771
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your norepinephrine,</v>

772
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brain chemicals,</v>

773
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.713
<v Speaker 1>a spike and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is just dealing with the </v>

774
00:37:09.091 --> 00:37:12.390
<v Speaker 1>fact that your body's been thrust into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this insane environment.</v>

775
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess I guess there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>

776
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.520
<v Speaker 1>you know what we're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo effect,</v>

777
00:37:17.521 --> 00:37:20.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a way through just thinking</v>

778
00:37:20.251 --> 00:37:21.084
<v Speaker 1>about something you can get your mind to</v>
<v Speaker 1>operate in a way where it fixes your </v>

779
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:26.850
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

780
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.133
<v Speaker 1>And that there's sort of some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something similar to in this respect </v>

781
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.750
<v Speaker 1>that like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

782
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.753
<v Speaker 1>your brain and your thoughts for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like a placebo effect or </v>

783
00:37:38.161 --> 00:37:40.830
<v Speaker 1>something like really trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

784
00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:44.650
<v Speaker 1>really trying to figure out how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interface with stuff.</v>

785
00:37:44.651 --> 00:37:45.484
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I really do think that there's </v>

786
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.633
<v Speaker 1>more to like how we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this idea that like there's a </v>

787
00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:54.040
<v Speaker 1>simulation theory that you keep bringing</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

788
00:37:54.041 --> 00:37:54.874
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people keep bringing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we interfaced with reality </v>

789
00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:00.910
<v Speaker 1>different than we ever did before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just slightly different.</v>

790
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Just slightly.</v>

791
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that like all the different ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hack your system,</v>

792
00:38:07.071 --> 00:38:07.904
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through like a cold shock </v>
<v Speaker 1>proteins from doing that or he chocked </v>

793
00:38:12.411 --> 00:38:15.800
<v Speaker 1>proteins from doing a sauna or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo effects,</v>

794
00:38:15.801 --> 00:38:18.620
<v Speaker 1>like it might be good to get tricked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be like,</v>

795
00:38:18.621 --> 00:38:22.150
<v Speaker 1>that's like probably like half of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why religion does a lot of people</v>

796
00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.690
<v Speaker 1>good because if you fucking believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really believe that Jesus is real</v>

797
00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.330
<v Speaker 1>and you read all the tenants of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible and you go,</v>

798
00:38:29.331 --> 00:38:30.980
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking what a great way to live</v>

799
00:38:30.981 --> 00:38:32.030
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whoa.</v>

800
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 1>You get almost like a bit of a placebo </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect and you can say,</v>

801
00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:38.021
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

802
00:38:38.021 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 1>It's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like the same way you could say</v>

803
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:42.250
<v Speaker 1>sugar pills are real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

804
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.510
<v Speaker 1>If you give a guy a placebo sugar pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does nothing really,</v>

805
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.610
<v Speaker 1>but all of a sudden it fixes what our </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim on the ad.</v>

806
00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.160
<v Speaker 1>It's all connected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

807
00:38:52.161 --> 00:38:55.370
<v Speaker 1>We can do shit with our brains and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do shit with our bodies.</v>

808
00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And in that Wim Hoff guys living proof </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

809
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:03.410
<v Speaker 1>you ever pay attention to him to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>had him on a couple of times.</v>

810
00:39:03.411 --> 00:39:04.244
<v Speaker 1>You've got to check out a shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy does marathons and his </v>

811
00:39:06.321 --> 00:39:07.760
<v Speaker 1>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

812
00:39:07.761 --> 00:39:08.594
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he runs to the top of everest in a pair </v>

813
00:39:11.751 --> 00:39:16.250
<v Speaker 1>of shorts with a ice like flip flops on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his sandals on.</v>

814
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck summit's Everest.</v>

815
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:20.720
<v Speaker 1>He says it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

816
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:21.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

817
00:39:21.511 --> 00:39:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he runs barefoot in the snow.</v>

818
00:39:24.111 --> 00:39:24.944
<v Speaker 1>He does marathons and all just by </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling his breathing and </v>

819
00:39:27.771 --> 00:39:30.350
<v Speaker 1>controlling his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So real freak men.</v>

820
00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating cat was like a yoga teacher </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of his life.</v>

821
00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Went through a bunch of hardships and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really started realizing that by jumping</v>

822
00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:43.130
<v Speaker 1>in cold water and controlling his </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing,</v>

823
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.143
<v Speaker 1>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really sort of changed his reality </v>

824
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.173
<v Speaker 1>and he does it all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy goes into glacial waters so it </v>

825
00:39:51.381 --> 00:39:56.381
<v Speaker 1>isn't like frostbite and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like physical things real like it is,</v>

826
00:39:56.661 --> 00:39:57.494
<v Speaker 1>but I think your body first of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>develops tolerances for stuff and I </v>

827
00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:03.740
<v Speaker 1>noticed that just from doing the Cryo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chamber,</v>

828
00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:06.470
<v Speaker 1>like if I don't do it for a few of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there doing yoga,</v>

829
00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:09.230
<v Speaker 1>barefoot in the snow on the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking mountain.</v>

830
00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Is there a more bad ass photo ever taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>a look at that?</v>

831
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:13.603
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sweet.</v>

832
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:15.963
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about hyperthermia and all that </v>

833
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:19.790
<v Speaker 1>crazy guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Controlling body?</v>

834
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I think your body adapts because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

835
00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:24.124
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do like cryotherapy and you've </v>

836
00:40:26.171 --> 00:40:27.820
<v Speaker 1>never done it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time you do it you're like,</v>

837
00:40:27.821 --> 00:40:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like first time they do it,</v>

838
00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:32.710
<v Speaker 1>they won't let you do more than a minute</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half.</v>

839
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.660
<v Speaker 1>They want you to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

840
00:40:34.661 --> 00:40:35.494
<v Speaker 1>like what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you take some time off and you </v>

841
00:40:37.781 --> 00:40:40.010
<v Speaker 1>get back in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you haven't gone in a few months</v>

842
00:40:40.011 --> 00:40:42.580
<v Speaker 1>and then you go back in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do feel way cold.</v>

843
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.593
<v Speaker 1>But if I go like three days in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just get right in there and stand </v>

844
00:40:46.001 --> 00:40:48.190
<v Speaker 1>there and it doesn't even freak me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

845
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just used to it.</v>

846
00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My body's adapted to it.</v>

847
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:53.913
<v Speaker 1>My body's accustomed to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine like how people live that are </v>

848
00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.790
<v Speaker 1>living in northeast Alaska or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

849
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:05.140
<v Speaker 1>like live in places where they hunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>seals and shed the inuits.</v>

850
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:07.090
<v Speaker 1>They don't even get frostbite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

851
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.780
<v Speaker 1>like their hands going to be out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed and ridiculous cold.</v>

852
00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:11.663
<v Speaker 1>They just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get the same sort of issues </v>

853
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:16.570
<v Speaker 1>with it that we do like their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies have adapted.</v>

854
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:17.943
<v Speaker 1>It's weird as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think your mind can make your body do </v>

855
00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:23.014
<v Speaker 1>a lot of shit it doesn't want to do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your mind can do it by forcing </v>

856
00:41:26.501 --> 00:41:28.920
<v Speaker 1>yourself new extreme physical conditions</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

857
00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:33.560
<v Speaker 1>like a cryo chamber or like a sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sauna is amazing for you.</v>

858
00:41:33.561 --> 00:41:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that Rhonda,</v>

859
00:41:35.601 --> 00:41:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Patrick Lady was saying that Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick,</v>

860
00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Rhonda Patrick was saying,</v>

861
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:41.803
<v Speaker 1>was that there is a 40 percent decrease </v>
<v Speaker 1>in mortality across all causes from </v>

862
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 1>everything that gets like heart attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strokes,</v>

863
00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:51.104
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 percent decrease in mortality across </v>

864
00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:57.350
<v Speaker 1>everything just from doing sauna like </v>
<v Speaker 1>four times a week.</v>

865
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:59.323
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking phenomenal for your </v>

866
00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:01.124
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sit there and just heat up and it </v>

867
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 1>just fires your system up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

868
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:09.910
<v Speaker 1>all those heat shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just act as an anti inflammatory.</v>

869
00:42:09.911 --> 00:42:11.510
<v Speaker 1>If your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your joints feel better,</v>

870
00:42:11.511 --> 00:42:12.344
<v Speaker 1>things move better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just get out of there too and you </v>

871
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:17.090
<v Speaker 1>cool off and you feel way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

872
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.493
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bunch of resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that that we don't take advantage </v>

873
00:42:20.301 --> 00:42:23.360
<v Speaker 1>of enough and I think everybody should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be signing all the time.</v>

874
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:24.263
<v Speaker 5>I'm just traumatized from being a child </v>
<v Speaker 5>and going with my dad and seeing all </v>

875
00:42:26.701 --> 00:42:31.701
<v Speaker 5>those dicks and balls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He told you not to look shit.</v>

876
00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:34.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think um,</v>

877
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:36.303
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of negative connotation </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards sauna in mma because a lot of </v>

878
00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:43.600
<v Speaker 1>people think of a sauna is like a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people go to cut weight,</v>

879
00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:48.250
<v Speaker 1>like a real painful process to cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight so they can make a weight class,</v>

880
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.950
<v Speaker 1>which is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do use it for that,</v>

881
00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.140
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the only use for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sauna.</v>

882
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Like you shouldn't just be using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sauna for that.</v>

883
00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.980
<v Speaker 1>You should be using the sauna for </v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

884
00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.173
<v Speaker 1>We should use it all the time I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a gigantic important step </v>

885
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:08.110
<v Speaker 1>in like a body maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a bunch of shit you have to do</v>

886
00:43:08.111 --> 00:43:10.390
<v Speaker 1>for body maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one.</v>

887
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.190
<v Speaker 5>Has there been any news updates on </v>
<v Speaker 5>there?</v>

888
00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:15.024
<v Speaker 5>John Jones situation and like I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 5>heard enough and that's so </v>

889
00:43:18.601 --> 00:43:20.700
<v Speaker 5>disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So makes me sad.</v>

890
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.050
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Abandoned sites on this one.</v>

891
00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:23.251
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

892
00:43:23.251 --> 00:43:24.084
<v Speaker 5>You called the Dick Pills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just like to state for the </v>

893
00:43:26.371 --> 00:43:27.204
<v Speaker 5>record,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian</v>

894
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.640
<v Speaker 1>banned completely called the Dick built </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

895
00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:31.210
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I paraphrase,</v>

896
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say he parties.</v>

897
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:34.470
<v Speaker 1>He does coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

898
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.351
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

899
00:43:35.351 --> 00:43:36.730
<v Speaker 1>he probably took some Dick Pills.</v>

900
00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:38.170
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

901
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:40.270
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it made so much sense.</v>

902
00:43:40.271 --> 00:43:42.730
<v Speaker 5>It was like how it was there right along</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole time.</v>

903
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:46.930
<v Speaker 5>I just remember the FDA dot Gov had </v>
<v Speaker 5>breakdowns of certain,</v>

904
00:43:46.931 --> 00:43:47.764
<v Speaker 5>like Rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a dick pills at gas stations and a lot </v>

905
00:43:49.541 --> 00:43:54.430
<v Speaker 5>of them had steroid type things in them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's so crazy.</v>

906
00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.470
<v Speaker 5>He was taking that stuff that is still </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking them.</v>

907
00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Well now I bet he would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean now that I always like fuck it,</v>

908
00:44:01.241 --> 00:44:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll just take everything.</v>

909
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.210
<v Speaker 5>You could get addicted to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was addicted to him for awhile.</v>

910
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's addicted to it.</v>

911
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.130
<v Speaker 1>The new thing that he tested positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>for has nothing to do with that.</v>

912
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:16.090
<v Speaker 1>They said the new thing that he tested </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive for his steroid,</v>

913
00:44:16.091 --> 00:44:16.924
<v Speaker 1>that the only test for in urine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to jail Sunnen it's like a </v>

914
00:44:20.921 --> 00:44:21.754
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a very common steroid and it's </v>

915
00:44:23.891 --> 00:44:24.724
<v Speaker 1>actually kind of old school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like something that used to do a </v>

916
00:44:26.081 --> 00:44:27.490
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

917
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.520
<v Speaker 1>it's his thought was that if somebody is</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them to do that,</v>

918
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.890
<v Speaker 1>that if that's not a tainted supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone's getting them to do that,</v>

919
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.440
<v Speaker 1>that person knows their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's some sneaky steroids now.</v>

920
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said it's usually combined with </v>

921
00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:43.890
<v Speaker 1>other things since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unfortunate man.</v>

922
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:45.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

923
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.180
<v Speaker 1>He could've got sabotaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's he saying?</v>

924
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Is he saying no one's saying anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no official statement.</v>

925
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't think like [inaudible] there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're trying to test other,</v>

926
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.900
<v Speaker 1>other samples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tested a blood sample and then they</v>

927
00:44:57.901 --> 00:44:59.610
<v Speaker 1>released the results of the blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>sample.</v>

928
00:44:59.611 --> 00:45:02.850
<v Speaker 1>They always do a blood and a urine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blood sample was negative,</v>

929
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.310
<v Speaker 1>but the blood sample didn't test for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

930
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:07.580
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

931
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:10.710
<v Speaker 1>you could speculate all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure as the facts come in,</v>

932
00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:11.544
<v Speaker 1>we'll get a better understanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it would be the most disappointing </v>

933
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:15.264
<v Speaker 1>thing ever if someone's spiked his shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost be less disappointing if he </v>

934
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:22.770
<v Speaker 1>took something and got caught that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be if somebody</v>

935
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.873
<v Speaker 2>did him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm saying it like he knows </v>

936
00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:26.274
<v Speaker 2>his past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems ridiculous to think that </v>

937
00:45:28.081 --> 00:45:31.140
<v Speaker 2>he would even try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's old school or stuff,</v>

938
00:45:31.141 --> 00:45:31.974
<v Speaker 2>they barely tasted like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like why would he even risk </v>

939
00:45:33.991 --> 00:45:35.310
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you already went through that.</v>

940
00:45:35.311 --> 00:45:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

941
00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:36.573
<v Speaker 1>But being a cage fighter is a ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to make a living and people who are </v>

942
00:45:42.131 --> 00:45:45.220
<v Speaker 1>cage fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like elite level,</v>

943
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:50.280
<v Speaker 1>like a guy like Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's that guy has like probably a belief</v>

944
00:45:51.581 --> 00:45:52.414
<v Speaker 1>in himself that you and I will never </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and completely impulsive and </v>

945
00:45:58.151 --> 00:46:01.150
<v Speaker 1>like what he decides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's why he's a wild motherfucker.</v>

946
00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.930
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he's smart and he's wild.</v>

947
00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Like he'll take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like legitimately wild.</v>

948
00:46:07.121 --> 00:46:07.954
<v Speaker 1>He's wild chances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I always talk about like when he </v>

949
00:46:09.971 --> 00:46:13.390
<v Speaker 1>fought shogun for the tile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fought shogun for the title,</v>

950
00:46:13.391 --> 00:46:15.610
<v Speaker 1>he opened up the fight with a flying </v>
<v Speaker 1>knee.</v>

951
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.190
<v Speaker 1>There was the first thing he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting a legend,</v>

952
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:20.920
<v Speaker 1>finding a UFC light heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

953
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was crazy talented and still </v>
<v Speaker 1>is right?</v>

954
00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.173
<v Speaker 1>And he's only 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a wild man and wild men </v>

955
00:46:28.781 --> 00:46:29.614
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do Shit that they don't even know why </v>

956
00:46:31.241 --> 00:46:32.380
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they're doing it.</v>

957
00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.150
<v Speaker 1>They're just doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

958
00:46:34.151 --> 00:46:38.310
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a guy that's that powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the garlic Jon Jones,</v>

959
00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.270
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try controlling him.</v>

960
00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck telling him he can't go out.</v>

961
00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Good luck telling him what he's gotTa do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

962
00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.153
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things about him in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past is that he hasn't trained hard for </v>

963
00:46:48.191 --> 00:46:51.430
<v Speaker 1>fights and they were way harder fights </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they should've been probably because</v>

964
00:46:51.431 --> 00:46:54.940
<v Speaker 1>he really wasn't in shape and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>around him kind of knew it,</v>

965
00:46:54.941 --> 00:46:55.774
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was that good that he could fight </v>

966
00:46:57.701 --> 00:47:02.701
<v Speaker 1>world class title challengers and beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in five round fights without really</v>

967
00:47:02.951 --> 00:47:05.410
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how God damn good.</v>

968
00:47:05.411 --> 00:47:07.270
<v Speaker 1>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you and I,</v>

969
00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:12.040
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how his brain even works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows what the fuck happened?</v>

970
00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:13.713
<v Speaker 1>I hope he didn't do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again that means that one of </v>

971
00:47:17.111 --> 00:47:17.770
<v Speaker 1>two things happened.</v>

972
00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:18.603
<v Speaker 1>Either he took a tainted supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is after awhile almost becomes a </v>

973
00:47:22.241 --> 00:47:23.074
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to keep people keep saying that he </v>

974
00:47:24.461 --> 00:47:27.520
<v Speaker 1>stopped taking supplements or even worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>at someone spiked him.</v>

975
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spiking thing because it seemed like</v>

976
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.260
<v Speaker 1>a pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

977
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 1>that would be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do that to somebody though for</v>

978
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:37.414
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if somebody is around someone </v>

979
00:47:40.631 --> 00:47:41.464
<v Speaker 1>with nefarious intentions or someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>around someone who's resentful and </v>

980
00:47:45.011 --> 00:47:45.844
<v Speaker 1>you're in some sort of pro fight camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone just decides to fuck this </v>

981
00:47:48.551 --> 00:47:52.360
<v Speaker 1>guy and just dumped some stuff on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken steroid cream in your hand.</v>

982
00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:53.194
<v Speaker 1>Cream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's things they could do to </v>

983
00:47:54.251 --> 00:47:56.120
<v Speaker 1>get it into your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably wouldn't even know what it,</v>

984
00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.120
<v Speaker 4>the tests that came up positive I guess </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the one that happened,</v>

985
00:48:00.121 --> 00:48:02.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was after the way in.</v>

986
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.033
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a urine test and tested at anytime </v>

987
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:05.693
<v Speaker 4>before that.</v>

988
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he was there.</v>

989
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.180
<v Speaker 1>They were tested multiple times in camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

990
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.153
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't have probably come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily because it's really </v>

991
00:48:14.671 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you know,</v>

992
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:17.794
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of time period they </v>

993
00:48:19.621 --> 00:48:23.630
<v Speaker 1>tested them in and I don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of half life this stuff has because</v>

994
00:48:23.631 --> 00:48:24.464
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently Chael Sonnen was telling </v>

995
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Brendan Schaub that it gets out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>system quite quick and that's one of the</v>

996
00:48:31.021 --> 00:48:33.180
<v Speaker 1>things that guys like about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>

997
00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:34.350
<v Speaker 1>So you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

998
00:48:34.351 --> 00:48:35.184
<v Speaker 1>it gets out of your system really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to find out like how much </v>

999
00:48:38.221 --> 00:48:39.054
<v Speaker 1>time do they usually have in between </v>
<v Speaker 1>visits by Usada and what are the odds </v>

1000
00:48:42.841 --> 00:48:45.030
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get busted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how much,</v>

1001
00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.490
<v Speaker 1>how many times during camp or they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to roll the dice,</v>

1002
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:52.020
<v Speaker 1>see if they have a 24 or 48 hour acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroid.</v>

1003
00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.200
<v Speaker 1>How many times can you roll the dice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sought a visited three times.</v>

1004
00:48:55.201 --> 00:48:56.910
<v Speaker 1>You got to roll the dice this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roll it.</v>

1005
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Come on when I have a hard workout </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thursday.</v>

1006
00:48:58.621 --> 00:48:59.910

<v Speaker 1>Let's roll the dice.</v>

1007
00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.220
<v Speaker 1>You roll the dice 27 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1010
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:07.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they come,</v>

1011
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:07.901
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1012
00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:08.734
<v Speaker 1>if they come you're fucking career's </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and they take away millions of </v>

1013
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.860
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 hours your pen.</v>

1015
00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:19.980
<v Speaker 1>the next day you saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking 52 hours.</v>

1016
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.110
<v Speaker 1>How many hours is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many has it been?</v>

1017
00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:22.771
<v Speaker 1>Pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1018
00:49:22.771 --> 00:49:24.390
<v Speaker 1>for 9:50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 1:50.</v>

1019
00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.313
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours.</v>

1020
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be gone.</v>

1021
00:49:27.301 --> 00:49:28.134
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got all begun and you give them </v>

1022
00:49:29.281 --> 00:49:30.114
<v Speaker 1>that pice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wondering whether it's in and I'm </v>

1023
00:49:32.011 --> 00:49:32.844
<v Speaker 1>sure there's stuff that you can take </v>
<v Speaker 1>that supposedly washes it out fast or </v>

1024
00:49:35.541 --> 00:49:38.160
<v Speaker 1>like any kind of drug tests you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean like we'd test.</v>

1025
00:49:38.161 --> 00:49:38.994
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like cranberry juice or </v>

1026
00:49:40.321 --> 00:49:41.940
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just constantly drained.</v>

1027
00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.350
<v Speaker 1>There's certain diuretics for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain diuretics can mask steroids.</v>

1028
00:49:46.351 --> 00:49:47.820
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

1029
00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at this article that came </v>
<v Speaker 4>out in about an hour ago.</v>

1030
00:49:50.931 --> 00:49:51.764
<v Speaker 4>It looks like on a bloody elbow at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not like any update of news or </v>

1031
00:49:55.371 --> 00:49:58.280
<v Speaker 4>anything really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a ped expert who's known,</v>

1032
00:49:58.660 --> 00:49:59.493
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the track and field world as known </v>

1033
00:50:01.401 --> 00:50:03.290
<v Speaker 4>for supplying performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enhancing drugs to them.</v>

1034
00:50:03.291 --> 00:50:06.140
<v Speaker 4>His name is Angel Hernandez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>also known as memo.</v>

1035
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:10.860
<v Speaker 4>Not that that matters a whole lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if anybody knows him a what</v>

1036
00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.850
<v Speaker 1>an angel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heredia Heredia Hernandez,</v>

1037
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:14.953
<v Speaker 1>but Angel Heredia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the same guy that used to train </v>

1038
00:50:16.611 --> 00:50:17.444
<v Speaker 1>manny Pacquiao or know who the fuck did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy that was a really </v>

1039
00:50:22.191 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>

1040
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I know I got his name wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a strength and conditioning.</v>

1041
00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that the test that they do</v>
<v Speaker 4>texts tests for six different.</v>

1042
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.133
<v Speaker 4>Our particular metabolites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those can last up to seven weeks </v>

1043
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:37.423
<v Speaker 4>and a dennis skipped down to here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says that one of those metabolites </v>

1044
00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:45.860
<v Speaker 4>can look like the same structure as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Toronto ball and it may or may not.</v>

1045
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:47.420
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that it's not Toronto </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bar,</v>

1046
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:48.263
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it could be from a bad supplement </v>

1047
00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:50.534
<v Speaker 4>that he took during the training period </v>
<v Speaker 4>that lasted in a system and ended up </v>

1048
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:54.860
<v Speaker 4>looking like it.</v>

1049
00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1050
00:50:56.051 --> 00:50:57.250
<v Speaker 1>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this quote,</v>

1051
00:50:57.251 --> 00:51:00.370
<v Speaker 1>listen to this quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he would have been using way before,</v>

1052
00:51:00.371 --> 00:51:03.620
<v Speaker 1>then he eventually would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive on the 21 days,</v>

1053
00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.950
<v Speaker 1>testing before the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was negative.</v>

1054
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Then he came out positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankly,</v>

1055
00:51:08.111 --> 00:51:08.944
<v Speaker 1>the testing itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lacks credibility for a lot of </v>

1056
00:51:11.621 --> 00:51:12.850
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

1057
00:51:12.851 --> 00:51:13.684
<v Speaker 1>we could go on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but and I could be very specific in </v>

1058
00:51:16.481 --> 00:51:17.314
<v Speaker 1>terms of chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to mislead the people </v>

1059
00:51:19.511 --> 00:51:20.344
<v Speaker 1>that listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the fact that they are </v>

1060
00:51:21.911 --> 00:51:22.744
<v Speaker 1>detecting six different metabolites in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them stays there longer than </v>

1061
00:51:27.041 --> 00:51:27.874
<v Speaker 1>seven weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most intriguing part is that </v>

1062
00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:30.333
<v Speaker 1>some of those metabolites are not really</v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmed that they are actually coming </v>

1063
00:51:34.241 --> 00:51:36.820
<v Speaker 1>from that to how do you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rentable,</v>

1064
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.120
<v Speaker 1>to rentable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ball structure.</v>

1065
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.060
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you sorta who's doing this,</v>

1066
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.030
<v Speaker 1>they know what the fuck they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not.</v>

1067
00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:51.010
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to come out with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>result unless they're super,</v>

1068
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:54.490
<v Speaker 1>super sure that that's what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>tested positive for.</v>

1069
00:51:54.491 --> 00:51:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is</v>

1070
00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.740
<v Speaker 4>skype right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just sort of speculating.</v>

1071
00:51:57.741 --> 00:51:58.700
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he.</v>

1072
00:51:58.701 --> 00:51:59.630
<v Speaker 4>If he wasn't there either.</v>

1073
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Jeff Novitsky offstage,</v>

1074
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:06.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean off mic on my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to him around the arena.</v>

1075
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.390
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's about as honest as it comes when it</v>

1076
00:52:11.391 --> 00:52:14.270
<v Speaker 1>comes to like handling these situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these athletes.</v>

1077
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.910
<v Speaker 1>They're catching people and the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're catching,</v>

1078
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:18.460
<v Speaker 1>we're using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1079
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:19.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they're doing it is very </v>

1080
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:22.034
<v Speaker 1>thorough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they're handling it is very </v>

1081
00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:24.194
<v Speaker 1>thorough and there hasn't been anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a credible story that came forth </v>

1082
00:52:28.041 --> 00:52:28.874
<v Speaker 1>that didn't have something in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that they weren't supposed to </v>

1083
00:52:31.551 --> 00:52:33.560
<v Speaker 1>have in their system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't had a case of that yet as far</v>

1084
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:34.394
<v Speaker 1>as I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think almost all cases have been </v>

1085
00:52:36.201 --> 00:52:39.590
<v Speaker 1>either 10 tainted supplements or someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting caught,</v>

1086
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.660
<v Speaker 1>whether it's taking a diuretic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1087
00:52:41.661 --> 00:52:43.250
<v Speaker 1>getting caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a steroid.</v>

1088
00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's got,</v>

1089
00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a team of people that are just</v>

1090
00:52:48.921 --> 00:52:52.760
<v Speaker 1>constantly checking people that might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheating.</v>

1091
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:55.580
<v Speaker 1>I guess you have to also say it's where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's smoke,</v>

1092
00:52:55.581 --> 00:52:57.110
<v Speaker 1>there's fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many fighters?</v>

1093
00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:00.290
<v Speaker 1>You never have a steroid in him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1094
00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:02.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1095
00:53:02.571 --> 00:53:04.840
<v Speaker 1>like Bj Penn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1096
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1097
00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.413
<v Speaker 1>I used to think it would be John Fitch </v>
<v Speaker 1>within John Fitch tested positive he </v>

1098
00:53:11.511 --> 00:53:12.344
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was getting older and he was </v>

1099
00:53:13.941 --> 00:53:18.690
<v Speaker 1>fighting and world series of fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't in the UFC anymore and you know,</v>

1100
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:20.660
<v Speaker 1>he might've been dealing with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious injuries.</v>

1101
00:53:20.661 --> 00:53:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Need to pay his bills for fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't begrudge anybody,</v>

1102
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:25.603
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're not even in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC and the testing that they do in a </v>

1103
00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 1>lot of these organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a lot of,</v>

1104
00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of organizations that have</v>

1105
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 1>guys that are pretty much openly using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they do is they have these guys</v>

1106
00:53:38.311 --> 00:53:39.144
<v Speaker 1>fight on Indian reservations or fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird states that have an athletic </v>

1107
00:53:43.921 --> 00:53:47.580
<v Speaker 1>commission that doesn't really adhere to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules or it doesn't have to.</v>

1108
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.770
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't restrict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>

1109
00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:53.310
<v Speaker 1>especially the Indian reservation thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>native American reservations,</v>

1110
00:53:53.311 --> 00:53:54.830
<v Speaker 1>they took whatever the fuck they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1111
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:58.080
<v Speaker 1>there are country inside our country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you sata,</v>

1112
00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.140
<v Speaker 1>they look up your ass man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look up your ass.</v>

1113
00:54:01.141 --> 00:54:03.290
<v Speaker 1>They come get you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come get you.</v>

1114
00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And they wake you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1115
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.240
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you doing?</v>

1116
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to look at your deck</v>

1117
00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:08.514
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to watch pis come out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your deck and it's going to go in this </v>

1118
00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:11.790
<v Speaker 1>cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can go back to sleep.</v>

1119
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.610
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1120
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.150
<v Speaker 1>it's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1121
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.770
<v Speaker 1>to see a guy like John was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular,</v>

1122
00:54:19.771 --> 00:54:21.690
<v Speaker 1>just spectacular comeback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

1123
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:22.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1124
00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:25.170
<v Speaker 1>like a Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rises from the ashes.</v>

1125
00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:28.620
<v Speaker 1>He gave this really classy post fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

1126
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:34.040
<v Speaker 1>He won by just overwhelming devastation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1127
00:54:35.311 --> 00:54:36.144
<v Speaker 1>it was a beautiful combination with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left high kick and then a series of </v>

1128
00:54:39.061 --> 00:54:39.894
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>

1129
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:40.733
<v Speaker 1>Daniel goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just beats him unconscious in a </v>

1130
00:54:42.421 --> 00:54:43.254
<v Speaker 1>spectacular performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to find out that it's tainted </v>

1131
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:51.051
<v Speaker 1>by some fucking gross steroid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

1132
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:55.500
<v Speaker 1>they were sneaking in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's either that or again,</v>

1133
00:54:55.501 --> 00:54:56.334
<v Speaker 1>the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is almost equally grows that </v>

1134
00:54:57.181 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 1>somebody gave it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody gave him some,</v>

1135
00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:01.350
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey champ.</v>

1136
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Have some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this gatorade,</v>

1137
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.170
<v Speaker 1>champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1138
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:07.440
<v Speaker 1>hey champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got your gatorade champ crack,</v>

1139
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're very assessable.</v>

1140
00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:10.740
<v Speaker 1>These fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1141
00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:13.410
<v Speaker 1>they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to the gyms you go to</v>

1142
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.440
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times and if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting John,</v>

1143
00:55:15.441 --> 00:55:16.440
<v Speaker 1>he's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.420
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And people love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1146
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1147
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.010
<v Speaker 1>we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1148
00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.700
<v Speaker 1>just makes me sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me sad.</v>

1149
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.180
<v Speaker 1>But one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:30.583
<v Speaker 1>when Dale they'll have it eradicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by then I think there's gonna be </v>

1151
00:55:32.521 --> 00:55:33.480
<v Speaker 1>some new methods.</v>

1152
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to have genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>methods.</v>

1153
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty,</v>

1154
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 1>not pretty close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

1155
00:55:40.021 --> 00:55:40.854
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty close to being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>alter embryos and to be able to change </v>

1156
00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:50.930
<v Speaker 1>like genes in people maybe even shut off</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous jeans,</v>

1157
00:55:50.971 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 1>like genes for Alzheimer's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

1158
00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:56.600
<v Speaker 1>different diseases that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be able to literally create,</v>

1159
00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.713
<v Speaker 1>create the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tools to edit that in the embryonic </v>

1160
00:56:01.141 --> 00:56:01.974
<v Speaker 1>stage to something called crispr and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that they're </v>

1161
00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:05.850
<v Speaker 1>using to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1162
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:08.400
<v Speaker 1>to alter genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Star C,</v>

1163
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.840
<v Speaker 1>R I s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>p,</v>

1164
00:56:09.841 --> 00:56:10.680
<v Speaker 1>r,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>

1165
00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:11.763
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the video of someone used it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make like neon green beer or </v>

1166
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:18.240
<v Speaker 1>something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use crispr to make neon green beer.</v>

1167
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Would they use like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they did something to the wheat.</v>

1168
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:22.853
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made a new color chocolate the </v>

1169
00:56:25.151 --> 00:56:26.650
<v Speaker 1>first time in like a hundred years.</v>

1170
00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:28.720
<v Speaker 1>They made a new chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1171
00:56:28.721 --> 00:56:29.554
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking around with nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why Hurricane Irma was going to </v>

1172
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.173
<v Speaker 1>eat Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also recently took the West Nile </v>

1173
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:41.200
<v Speaker 1>virus and pumped it into rats and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed the cancer,</v>

1174
00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:42.183
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're taking one crazy thing and </v>

1175
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:45.604
<v Speaker 1>killing another crazy thing with West </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nile virus cures cancer in mice or </v>

1176
00:56:51.881 --> 00:56:53.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1177
00:56:53.441 --> 00:56:54.630
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1178
00:56:54.631 --> 00:56:55.464
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a lot of shit that we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That animals can't even touch or they </v>

1179
00:56:58.061 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This biohacker.</v>

1180
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:00.700
<v Speaker 1>What does it say again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1181
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Wants to spur a genetic engineering </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution with glowing beer.</v>

1182
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:07.900
<v Speaker 1>That seems healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about aspartame.</v>

1183
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Engineered yeast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how bad your pee smells like.</v>

1184
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Think about how bad your pee smells when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you drink or you eat asparagus.</v>

1185
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Cutting edge genetic engineering </v>
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>

1186
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Crispr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they did it.</v>

1188
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.440
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1189
00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.830
<v Speaker 1>He sells the kits to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently that is so crazy.</v>

1190
00:57:29.831 --> 00:57:30.664
<v Speaker 1>You can buy a kit to genetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineer through Crispr your wheat to </v>

1191
00:57:35.651 --> 00:57:37.630
<v Speaker 1>glow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad ass.</v>

1192
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:39.580
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be bad for.</v>

1193
00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:44.590
<v Speaker 1>It's totally for good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How I'm waiting for one of these fucking</v>

1194
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:45.603
<v Speaker 1>problems that we have to turn us into </v>
<v Speaker 1>superheroes because that was what we </v>

1195
00:57:48.641 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 1>always saw in the comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1196
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Every time there was a nuclear spill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude came out of it with x Ray Vision.</v>

1197
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:55.563
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the government also immediately </v>

1198
00:57:56.381 --> 00:57:57.214
<v Speaker 1>found the guy and took him and hit him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and did tests on him so the public </v>

1199
00:57:59.501 --> 00:58:02.620
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tried to borrow pride to.</v>

1200
00:58:02.621 --> 00:58:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time they were afraid it </v>
<v Speaker 1>already happened.</v>

1201
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Autism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're like some of the best,</v>

1202
00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like navy coders and.</v>

1203
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>

1204
00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.420
<v Speaker 1>there's without a doubt some super </v>
<v Speaker 1>genius.</v>

1205
00:58:16.421 --> 00:58:19.450
<v Speaker 1>People with autism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's people that are on that</v>

1206
00:58:19.451 --> 00:58:20.290
<v Speaker 1>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1207
00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:21.483
<v Speaker 1>autism and also asperger's and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different disorders that allows them to </v>

1208
00:58:26.981 --> 00:58:29.920
<v Speaker 1>like focus on stuff with laser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like precision.</v>

1209
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.260
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their brains work different.</v>

1210
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:34.023
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of thought to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the next style of person </v>

1211
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:38.913
<v Speaker 1>that like we're so connected to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices and to the Internet and to do </v>

1212
00:58:44.801 --> 00:58:45.634
<v Speaker 1>this we're going to lose our interaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other and lose our emotions </v>

1213
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.253
<v Speaker 1>and that it might manifest itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a series of like weird errors </v>

1214
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:54.753
<v Speaker 1>like a disease or a disorder and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>disordered becomes favorable and that </v>

1215
00:58:57.961 --> 00:59:00.610
<v Speaker 1>favorable disorder of just not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting attached to things.</v>

1216
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Just focus on your work like a drone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1217
00:59:02.801 --> 00:59:05.960
<v Speaker 1>some sort of crazy robot number </v>
<v Speaker 1>crunching robot.</v>

1218
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a 100 percent possible that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1219
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>We know there are some people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1220
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:14.860
<v Speaker 1>So if there are some people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just super genius coders,</v>

1221
00:59:14.861 --> 00:59:15.694
<v Speaker 1>they're just zone out and can code like </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and they're kind of on the </v>

1222
00:59:17.861 --> 00:59:18.694
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's one of those that could be a </v>

1223
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:23.241
<v Speaker 1>thousand thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be a million.</v>

1224
00:59:23.241 --> 00:59:24.074
<v Speaker 1>If there's a million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could start breeding and making a </v>

1225
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:26.834
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other ones like that and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something to pass on and Eugene's </v>

1226
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe pass on more than in our genes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know.</v>

1227
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know you got robot people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we slowly but surely integrate with</v>

1228
00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:42.440
<v Speaker 1>our chips and fucking different qualcomm</v>
<v Speaker 1>chips in your brain.</v>

1229
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Your phone is now part of your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>robot.</v>

1230
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:46.094
<v Speaker 1>People with abilities to call each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and connect online and like what if </v>

1231
00:59:50.031 --> 00:59:54.680
<v Speaker 1>that's like nature's trying to engineer </v>
<v Speaker 1>our humanness out of us.</v>

1232
00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Slowly morphing change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may get more compatible to staying in</v>

1233
00:59:59.001 --> 01:00:02.090
<v Speaker 1>front of computer screens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constantly crunching numbers.</v>

1234
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:04.483
<v Speaker 1>People's hands start growing different </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they went to a holding cell </v>

1235
01:00:07.161 --> 01:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>phones their whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their eyes get farther apart,</v>

1236
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:10.783
<v Speaker 1>like chance the rapper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what fascinates me when people </v>

1237
01:00:13.491 --> 01:00:14.324
<v Speaker 1>have autistic kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the kids show massive improvement </v>

1238
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:18.283
<v Speaker 1>from a change of diet or from cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cannabis oil for for a lot of kids is a </v>

1239
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.280
<v Speaker 1>massive improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop their seizures.</v>

1240
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Makes them start interacting with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

1241
01:00:27.201 --> 01:00:28.034
<v Speaker 1>Better wonder if that is what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they know like a specific </v>

1242
01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>cause for autism or any of the spectrum </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorders right now.</v>

1243
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:37.483
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always just blamed cell phones and </v>

1244
01:00:38.211 --> 01:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also heard it could be right.</v>

1245
01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I've also heard gut bacteria be blamed </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a bunch of them.</v>

1246
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extensure's.</v>

1247
01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were saying that um,</v>

1248
01:00:47.091 --> 01:00:47.924
<v Speaker 1>a lack of probiotics and the Diet poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>gut bacteria can be blamed for certain </v>

1249
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>issues and disorders that some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have found neurons in the gut.</v>

1250
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If those two things are true,</v>

1251
01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:00.111
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1252
01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:02.200
<v Speaker 1>if your gut bacteria is essentially like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1253
01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>like a community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1254
01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:04.664
<v Speaker 1>You have like a community of flora </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside your stomach and the more bad </v>

1255
01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:08.204
<v Speaker 1>stuff you put in there and then it also </v>
<v Speaker 1>like other people would be way more </v>

1256
01:01:11.691 --> 01:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>susceptible than some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1257
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.513
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like today there's people that can </v>

1258
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:16.783
<v Speaker 1>eat things that maybe have mild </v>
<v Speaker 1>allergies and then there's someone like </v>

1259
01:01:19.821 --> 01:01:20.654
<v Speaker 1>you or I that we could eat the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing and have no issue with it </v>

1260
01:01:22.491 --> 01:01:23.324
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be the same with gut </v>

1261
01:01:24.531 --> 01:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>flora.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be the same with.</v>

1262
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so biologically variable,</v>

1263
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:34.870
<v Speaker 1>but if just imagine if that's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>step in a long process of peep.</v>

1264
01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean like you look at like a super </v>
<v Speaker 1>genius autistic people.</v>

1265
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>We as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they might've existed hundreds of</v>

1266
01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:45.920
<v Speaker 1>years ago but we don't know of them.</v>

1267
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just guessing.</v>

1268
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:48.943
<v Speaker 1>This is a fairly recent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it becomes something even </v>

1269
01:01:51.861 --> 01:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>different than 100 years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it's these,</v>

1270
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:55.303
<v Speaker 1>these people that know how to read each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other's minds and only they can do it </v>

1271
01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>and they can all read each other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>

1272
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.333
<v Speaker 1>They can probably read our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can never read theirs and they just </v>

1273
01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:04.364
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just talking to each other and </v>

1274
01:02:05.211 --> 01:02:05.631
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1275
01:02:05.631 --> 01:02:07.640
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you guys talking about?</v>

1276
01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:08.623
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be left behind like our </v>

1277
01:02:09.921 --> 01:02:10.754
<v Speaker 1>stupid genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be left behind and these </v>

1278
01:02:12.411 --> 01:02:13.244
<v Speaker 1>people without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if like war just stops because </v>

1279
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>autistic people just have no desire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to war.</v>

1280
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Like not just rather sit around here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>code,</v>

1281
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the next stage is.</v>

1282
01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:30.321
<v Speaker 1>Like if if autism or asperger's or any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these things are a new thing,</v>

1283
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they are a new thing,</v>

1284
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:33.863
<v Speaker 1>just imagine what another new thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be that takes it to another place </v>

1285
01:02:37.351 --> 01:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>and the next level.</v>

1286
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>People that don't keep their vr helmets </v>
<v Speaker 1>on all the time that you've lived in the</v>

1287
01:02:42.571 --> 01:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>railroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with you?</v>

1288
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta think man,</v>

1289
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>if evolution is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm assuming it is.</v>

1290
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>We used to be super primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1291
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>We used to be some sort of primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>primate thing and then there was a bunch</v>

1292
01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:56.604
<v Speaker 1>of different versions of us and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>branched out and we were the most </v>

1293
01:02:58.411 --> 01:03:02.550
<v Speaker 1>successful and we made it to today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means we changed.</v>

1294
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.520
<v Speaker 1>So why would we assume we're done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1295
01:03:05.521 --> 01:03:09.000
<v Speaker 1>We're getting more input now than ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and we're assuming we're done.</v>

1296
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.570
<v Speaker 1>We're not even the same people from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 fifties.</v>

1297
01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:14.520
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>

1298
01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.690
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're totally different.</v>

1299
01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.053
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if our brains are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start using more because we are more or </v>

1300
01:03:20.151 --> 01:03:22.940
<v Speaker 2>less or less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean we're pretty much like,</v>

1301
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:23.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're using our brains way more than we </v>

1302
01:03:24.831 --> 01:03:27.110
<v Speaker 2>were 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago.</v>

1303
01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Instead of like researching and reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>and reading,</v>

1304
01:03:30.441 --> 01:03:33.470
<v Speaker 2>pretty much we're just probably sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>there looking at colors,</v>

1305
01:03:33.471 --> 01:03:34.304
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something</v>

1306
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.850
<v Speaker 1>to who would have been way easier back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then to be a con man.</v>

1307
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could do any research on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1308
01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Well I was reading on the town and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1309
01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1310
01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:45.643
<v Speaker 1>raising a Buddhist monastery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie had the greatest fucking story </v>

1311
01:03:47.581 --> 01:03:51.390
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo was taking karate or Kung Fu</v>

1312
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:55.350
<v Speaker 1>from this dude that said he had to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>China to learn,</v>

1313
01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:56.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1314
01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Kung Fu masters and Eddie was like </v>

1315
01:03:59.521 --> 01:04:00.420
<v Speaker 1>so proud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1316
01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:01.880
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my instructors,</v>

1317
01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:04.440
<v Speaker 1>like one of the greatest churches in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is going to go to China,</v>

1318
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:05.483
<v Speaker 1>learn from some Kung Fu master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he saw him like a supermarket </v>

1319
01:04:09.121 --> 01:04:09.954
<v Speaker 1>or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dude's car was like parked in front </v>

1320
01:04:11.671 --> 01:04:12.590
<v Speaker 1>of China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1321
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.250
<v Speaker 1>that can't be him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got in the car,</v>

1322
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:15.660
<v Speaker 1>he drove off like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1323
01:04:15.661 --> 01:04:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I thought that deal was in China.</v>

1324
01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:19.920
<v Speaker 1>He just totally lied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only did he lie,</v>

1325
01:04:19.921 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 1>but he was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stayed around the neighborhood.</v>

1326
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1327
01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:26.130
<v Speaker 1>On vacation for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just lied to.</v>

1328
01:04:26.131 --> 01:04:29.550
<v Speaker 1>The students was pretending he was off </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering knowledge from the masters.</v>

1329
01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:33.600
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man that had like fake karate classes.</v>

1330
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.733
<v Speaker 1>They'd like fake martial arts schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were teaching like nonsense and </v>

1331
01:04:38.281 --> 01:04:40.860
<v Speaker 1>they would have this crazy background on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall,</v>

1332
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven time undefeated,</v>

1333
01:04:42.901 --> 01:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>marine corps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bare knuckle,</v>

1334
01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.820
<v Speaker 1>no holds bar champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would make up a bunch of shit.</v>

1335
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1336
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.250
<v Speaker 1>My favorite youtube videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1337
01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:55.530
<v Speaker 1>So many of them are just so many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1338
01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like the religious people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

1339
01:04:58.551 --> 01:05:01.100
<v Speaker 2>if people falling on the ground are </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting thrown by the room,</v>

1340
01:05:01.101 --> 01:05:03.230
<v Speaker 2>by the pet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pastor and stuff.</v>

1341
01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:04.580
<v Speaker 2>It's the same kind of shit.</v>

1342
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of ways.</v>

1343
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>But that's like the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo effect.</v>

1344
01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's the other side,</v>

1345
01:05:11.711 --> 01:05:12.544
<v Speaker 1>like those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that guy got does that thing and </v>

1346
01:05:14.891 --> 01:05:16.840
<v Speaker 1>they go flying through the air and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start their body starts,</v>

1347
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>do you think they feel something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is going on?</v>

1348
01:05:21.191 --> 01:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Are they just totally faking it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's done on this guy.</v>

1349
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.753
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all dumb people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's low watt brains that just </v>

1350
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.440
<v Speaker 1>they're easy to trick and to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1351
01:05:29.441 --> 01:05:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at look at half the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1352
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a possibility,</v>

1353
01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>but I want to know like are they doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

1354
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Are they conscious of what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>

1355
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:40.263
<v Speaker 1>Like are they willfully giving into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want the guy to like them </v>

1356
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>and like he comes up to you.</v>

1357
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

1358
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Or are they really feeling it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1359
01:05:49.511 --> 01:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>are they convincing the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a placebo effect?</v>

1360
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Are they convincing themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1361
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:55.863
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1362
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.033
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the like dumb people can really </v>

1363
01:05:59.111 --> 01:06:03.130
<v Speaker 1>do a lot that we can't even fathom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were saying,</v>

1364
01:06:03.131 --> 01:06:07.630
<v Speaker 1>if you really believe that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>know makeup,</v>

1365
01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:09.850
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't even have to be Jesus or </v>
<v Speaker 1>are gods,</v>

1366
01:06:09.851 --> 01:06:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to offend anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you really,</v>

1367
01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.713
<v Speaker 1>if somebody really believed that Odin </v>
<v Speaker 1>had carved his path in eternity and </v>

1368
01:06:17.771 --> 01:06:18.221
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1369
01:06:18.221 --> 01:06:19.054
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his destiny was chosen for him by the </v>

1370
01:06:20.771 --> 01:06:23.860
<v Speaker 1>cards and he would go forth with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of confidence.</v>

1371
01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Like if you really believed that Odin </v>
<v Speaker 1>has carved a path for you to destiny and</v>

1372
01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:32.920
<v Speaker 1>you really believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's got to be a powerful weapon.</v>

1373
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just having that belief.</v>

1374
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.510
<v Speaker 1>There's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's real or not,</v>

1375
01:06:37.511 --> 01:06:40.180
<v Speaker 1>it might become real because you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

1376
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Like the placebo effect is just one </v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

1377
01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:44.913
<v Speaker 1>one little sliver of this weird puzzle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of managing the mind and managing the </v>

1378
01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:53.500
<v Speaker 1>way you interface with reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people,</v>

1379
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:55.570
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with life itself,</v>

1380
01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:56.413
<v Speaker 1>with different choices that you make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we understand it 100 </v>

1381
01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:00.970
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1382
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:02.023
<v Speaker 1>I think we just assume that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical acts or like all that's going </v>

1383
01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:06.880
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1384
01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 1>like he picked up that box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He moved it over there,</v>

1385
01:07:10.061 --> 01:07:12.220
<v Speaker 1>like physical acts are all that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1386
01:07:12.221 --> 01:07:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1387
01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:14.164
<v Speaker 1>I think there's like there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some weird connection that we're all </v>

1388
01:07:16.211 --> 01:07:18.370
<v Speaker 1>sharing that's getting closer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer.</v>

1389
01:07:18.371 --> 01:07:23.371
<v Speaker 1>It's getting weirder and weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People Getting Shittier and nicer at the</v>

1390
01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:27.560
<v Speaker 1>same time it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a boiling point of.</v>

1391
01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I think people are way nicer than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever were before.</v>

1392
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:34.480
<v Speaker 1>You know what we use as an example?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bro Hug.</v>

1393
01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.453
<v Speaker 1>People didn't bro Hug back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shook hands when we were talking </v>

1394
01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:42.430
<v Speaker 1>about that new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a standup show on showtime.</v>

1395
01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm dying up here and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things Bill Burns said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nobody hugged back then he goes,</v>

1401
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:56.230
<v Speaker 1>they would do like a low five or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1402
01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:58.320

1404

<v Speaker 1>They didn't hug like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still,</v>

1405
01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:02.843
<v Speaker 1>they did like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the knuckle thing back them though </v>

01:08:23.151 --> 01:08:25.340
<v Speaker 1>friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this has got some fun to it.</v>

1415
01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.470
<v Speaker 1>When's the last time you did a low five?</v>

1447
01:09:22.211 --> 01:09:25.030
<v Speaker 5>like the little container where you pull</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wipes out.</v>

<v Speaker 5>around the thing where you're grabbing </v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

1454
01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:38.980

01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:41.160
<v Speaker 5>I just used the packs.</v>

1456
01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:43.420
<v Speaker 1>and you got to be careful with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things too because you don't want to get</v>

1457
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:46.960
<v Speaker 1>antibacterial wipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want to use antibacterial</v>

1458
01:09:46.961 --> 01:09:50.830
<v Speaker 1>stuff on your body unless it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural stuff like that.</v>

1459
01:09:50.831 --> 01:09:51.664
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do Jujitsu with this dude who </v>

1460
01:09:53.651 --> 01:09:54.484
<v Speaker 1>got ringworm and after he got ringworm </v>
<v Speaker 1>he started putting antibacterial soap </v>

1461
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.970
<v Speaker 1>all over his body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that killed all of his,</v>

1462
01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:05.380
<v Speaker 1>his natural skin flora and then he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>it everywhere.</v>

1463
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It was</v>

1464
01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.350
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much did he use [inaudible]?</v>

1465
01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.120
<v Speaker 5>I use that,</v>

1466
01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:13.310
<v Speaker 1>the anti bacterial soap that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore stuff.</v>

1467
01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:18.820
<v Speaker 1>It looks amber and say this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they extract the insects DNA on Jurassic</v>

1468
01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1469
01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.540
<v Speaker 1>that stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stinks.</v>

1470
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:24.520
<v Speaker 1>It smells like chemicals on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1471
01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:25.693
<v Speaker 1>That's hand antibacterial soap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people like that would get </v>

1472
01:10:28.841 --> 01:10:31.300
<v Speaker 1>like ringworm or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would use that on their whole body.</v>

1473
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.670
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that stuff is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>kills everything.</v>

1474
01:10:33.671 --> 01:10:36.610
<v Speaker 1>It kills all the stuff that's fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the ringworm to kills everything.</v>

1475

<v Speaker 3>boyfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1601
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So creepy.</v>

1602
01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:34.570
<v Speaker 3>Their boyfriends and they were that </v>
<v Speaker 3>close to each other.</v>

1603
01:16:34.571 --> 01:16:35.404
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird thing to have laying </v>

1604
01:16:36.101 --> 01:16:37.300
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they eat?</v>

1605
01:16:37.890 --> 01:16:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think just algae.</v>

1606
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:42.423
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so is this like a go fund me or some </v>

1607
01:16:43.361 --> 01:16:45.000
<v Speaker 3>shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1608
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:51.030
<v Speaker 3>I think the one they had at Mandalay bay</v>
<v Speaker 3>was bad ass because it was this big like</v>

1609
01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:53.163
<v Speaker 3>acrylic cylinder and they were all </v>
<v Speaker 3>swimming around it and they changed the </v>

1610
01:16:56.231 --> 01:17:00.130
<v Speaker 3>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that'd be cool to have that</v>

1611
01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.330
<v Speaker 3>they're alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1612
01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:04.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're alive.</v>

1613
01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:06.920
<v Speaker 3>But is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1614
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:09.560
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

1615
01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember them having.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1616
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:17.960
<v Speaker 3>that's the one in Mandalay bay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably conflating it with one from</v>

1617
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 3>one of the aquariums that I've been to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fuck,</v>

1618
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:22.520
<v Speaker 3>that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How pretty they are.</v>

1619
01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine doing mushrooms and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at that shit.</v>

1620
01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.253
<v Speaker 3>They're so pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems Kinda fucked to have them </v>

1621
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:34.061
<v Speaker 3>trapped in a tube just swimming around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't go anywhere.</v>

1622
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:35.953
<v Speaker 3>Like isn't part of the magic of being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>jellyfish is the fact that you're a </v>

1623
01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:40.154
<v Speaker 3>jelly fish in the ocean and you just are</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly moving through the ocean or </v>

1624
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:50.230
<v Speaker 3>have we decided that the jelly fishes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>primitive for it to truly experience the</v>

1625
01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:55.070
<v Speaker 3>majesty of the ocean and fuck him </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the tube and gamblers just gonna</v>

1626
01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:55.904
<v Speaker 3>Stare at you.</v>

1627
01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:58.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's essentially what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided.</v>

1628
01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:01.810
<v Speaker 3>Feed feed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feed.</v>

1629
01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:06.290
<v Speaker 3>They feed at least once a day is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to the same baby brine shrimp,</v>

1630
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.700
<v Speaker 3>so like sea monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight.</v>

1631
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:09.880
<v Speaker 3>See My god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so weird looking.</v>

1632
01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:13.190
<v Speaker 3>You know what's interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we found,</v>

1633
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.923
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have like a separate tank </v>

1634
01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.690
<v Speaker 3>for all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like you have two tanks.</v>

1635
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.210
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the baby brine shrimp.</v>

1636
01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

1637
01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.750
<v Speaker 3>That's how bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1638
01:18:23.751 --> 01:18:24.584
<v Speaker 3>they're in this little sheets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Snap into strain and you have to put it </v>

1639
01:18:28.101 --> 01:18:30.020
<v Speaker 3>in a base there and squeeze it in there </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

1640
01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

1641
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 3>The size and number of jellies would </v>
<v Speaker 3>determine how much to feed.</v>

1642
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be like really specific.</v>

1643
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:42.630
<v Speaker 3>Fuck feet and get some fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jelly Fish.</v>

1644
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.843
<v Speaker 3>Die Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they're going to get out into their </v>

1645
01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:46.670
<v Speaker 3>toilets and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1646
01:18:46.671 --> 01:18:47.510
<v Speaker 3>look how they feed them.</v>

1647
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1648
01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:50.660
<v Speaker 3>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just squirt it out there.</v>

1649
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:53.420
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they came back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the out?</v>

1650
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll figure it out.</v>

1651
01:18:56.001 --> 01:18:57.290
<v Speaker 3>I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do the right thing.</v>

1652
01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:01.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a dead jellyfish looks just the</v>

1653
01:19:01.041 --> 01:19:02.120
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1654
01:19:02.121 --> 01:19:04.400
<v Speaker 3>it's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not moving enough though.</v>

1655
01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:06.440
<v Speaker 3>You want to move and man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1656
01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:08.340
<v Speaker 3>look who's pouring in there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking at them all.</v>

1657
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Heating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1658
01:19:10.581 --> 01:19:11.960
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're actually reacting.</v>

1659
01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1660
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:14.743
<v Speaker 3>they're so primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We probably don't feel that bad when </v>

1661
01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:19.010
<v Speaker 3>they die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1662
01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a goldfish dies,</v>

1663
01:19:20.601 --> 01:19:21.600
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1664
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:23.220
<v Speaker 3>poor little dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because eyeballs,</v>

1665
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.780
<v Speaker 3>eyeballs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1666
01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.220
<v Speaker 3>their faces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1667
01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Like people I've heard people say don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat anything with a face,</v>

1668
01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:36.640
<v Speaker 3>but they usually don't eat oysters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people gotta eat oysters.</v>

1669
01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:40.060
<v Speaker 3>I love oysters until you have bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>oysters.</v>

1670
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.970
<v Speaker 3>Had some bad ways.</v>

1671
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:42.770
<v Speaker 3>There's the other day I definitely have </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1672
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:44.240
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1673
01:19:44.241 --> 01:19:45.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1674
01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:46.950
<v Speaker 3>You're eating something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1675
01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.073
<v Speaker 3>Did you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different kinds of </v>

1676
01:19:49.191 --> 01:19:50.024
<v Speaker 3>oysters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I never knew that there was like </v>

1677
01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.810
<v Speaker 3>tons of different kinds of oysters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1678
01:19:53.811 --> 01:19:56.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know a lot about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1679
01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.280
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1680
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:59.330
<v Speaker 3>if you go to a place they give you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>variety,</v>

1681
01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:01.370
<v Speaker 3>you get like a dozen year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three of each.</v>

1682
01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:01.811
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 3>lot in the Pacific northwest.</v>

1684

<v Speaker 3>I know people like around the Seattle </v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1687
01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:11.503
<v Speaker 5>There's a certain kind that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to eat anymore because of some </v>

1688
01:20:13.641 --> 01:20:15.560
<v Speaker 5>kind of pollution levels or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>these underground cages and they lift </v>
<v Speaker 5>them up and.</v>

1700
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.813
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you just pick them and eat them and </v>

<v Speaker 5>that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hm.</v>

1702
01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.220
<v Speaker 5>Wonder how much they're affected by </v>
<v Speaker 5>pollution.</v>

1703
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:53.700
<v Speaker 5>Think it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's up?</v>

<v Speaker 5>I thought that's what they're.</v>

1707
01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:04.260
<v Speaker 5>They're kinda like the ocean filters.</v>

1708
01:21:04.410 --> 01:21:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what lobsters are,</v>

1709
01:21:06.841 --> 01:21:08.220

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.590
<v Speaker 1>isn't it interesting that they're so God</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn delicious.</v>

1712
01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.710
<v Speaker 1>All they eat is rotten shit all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1713

<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lobsters are so delicious.</v>

1714
01:21:19.891 --> 01:21:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes you forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you forget and you get a,</v>

1715
01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:27.420
<v Speaker 1>like a Maine lobster when you dip them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in butter and you're like,</v>

1716
01:21:27.421 --> 01:21:29.700
<v Speaker 1>good God this is fucking delicious.</v>

1717
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:30.703
<v Speaker 5>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's a timelapse of oysters filtering </v>

1718
01:21:34.551 --> 01:21:37.120
<v Speaker 5>water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

1719
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:40.790
<v Speaker 5>It's super dirty water here and then a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple hours go by.</v>

1720
01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:42.590
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1721
01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:46.370
<v Speaker 5>Did they just poop them out though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The oysters bitch.</v>

1722
01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.240
<v Speaker 5>Just throw a bunch of sand in that way.</v>

1723
01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.290
<v Speaker 1>See what the fuck goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1724
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:52.900
<v Speaker 1>It seems like their filter in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>waters.</v>

1725
01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:54.560
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There sense.</v>

1726
01:21:55.150 --> 01:21:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature has a plan for all.</v>

1727
01:21:57.701 --> 01:22:01.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a little weird things and I bet </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all sorts of.</v>

1728
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need plants for oxygen,</v>

1729
01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:07.253
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plants actually create oxygen and we </v>

1730
01:22:09.401 --> 01:22:13.270
<v Speaker 1>create carbon dioxide and plants live </v>
<v Speaker 1>off carbon dioxide.</v>

1731
01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:14.723
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how there's all these like </v>
<v Speaker 1>little relationships that all these </v>

1732
01:22:18.611 --> 01:22:22.030
<v Speaker 1>different beings have like back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth all over,</v>

1733
01:22:22.031 --> 01:22:22.864
<v Speaker 1>all over nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many of them in so somebody weird </v>

1734
01:22:25.421 --> 01:22:26.254
<v Speaker 1>parasites and symbiotic relationships </v>
<v Speaker 1>that animals have with each other to </v>

1735
01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.710
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dome,</v>

1736
01:22:32.711 --> 01:22:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flat to dome,</v>

1737
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:35.860
<v Speaker 1>so all simulation.</v>

1738
01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:37.403
<v Speaker 5>I'm blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just got a dehumidifier the other day </v>

1739
01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:43.890
<v Speaker 5>yesterday and how much water you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>pull out of your air like I've already.</v>

1740
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000
<v Speaker 5>It's a 70 gallon drum or a tank and I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>already emptied it three times 70,</v>

1741
01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.540
<v Speaker 5>70 pint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>70 pint,</v>

1742
01:22:51.541 --> 01:22:52.374
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not counting 70 70 pint a gallon of </v>

1743
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:56.443
<v Speaker 5>milk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1744
01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:01.820
<v Speaker 5>Biggest 77 got swimming pools the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>are you doing in your house man?</v>

1745
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 5>But it's a pretty huge bucket of water </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just like four that's just pulled</v>

1746
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:07.870
<v Speaker 3>out of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1747
01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1748
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:13.000
<v Speaker 3>it's just like from your body notes from</v>
<v Speaker 3>any aridity I see.</v>

1749
01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:14.680
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been using our air conditioning so</v>

1750
01:23:14.681 --> 01:23:18.110
<v Speaker 3>much lately that mine started leaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere if it.</v>

1751
01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:23.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's making the house wet you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's making my floors fucked.</v>

1752
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.360
<v Speaker 3>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1753
01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:26.800
<v Speaker 3>So I'm trying to suck all the water out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

1754
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:27.663
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it just pulls it from the air and </v>

1755
01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:32.950
<v Speaker 3>humidity and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird because La is pretty dry.</v>

1756
01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:34.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But not lately.</v>

1757
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.390
<v Speaker 3>It's been pretty shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not shitty.</v>

1758
01:23:37.391 --> 01:23:39.050
<v Speaker 3>We need watermelon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1759
01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.000
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1760
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.970
<v Speaker 3>we barely got away with what we got last</v>
<v Speaker 3>winter,</v>

1761
01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:43.983
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of brought everything back </v>

1762
01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:46.540
<v Speaker 3>to pretty normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

1763
01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.650
<v Speaker 3>like lake to hone to hone ranch still </v>
<v Speaker 3>half full of water.</v>

1764
01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:51.990
<v Speaker 3>That's what my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1765
01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:53.503
<v Speaker 3>from my personal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I can see about how weird the </v>

1766
01:23:56.201 --> 01:23:57.034
<v Speaker 3>drought was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lake that we used to drop </v>

1767
01:23:58.511 --> 01:24:00.940
<v Speaker 3>people out of helicopters into a fear </v>
<v Speaker 3>factor.</v>

1768
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:04.390
<v Speaker 3>And it went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the lake didn't exist anymore.</v>

1769
01:24:04.391 --> 01:24:06.700
<v Speaker 3>There was no lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the fish died.</v>

1770
01:24:06.850 --> 01:24:08.290
<v Speaker 3>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1771
01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.330
<v Speaker 3>there were huge fish in that lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like big,</v>

1772
01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:12.790
<v Speaker 3>large mouth bass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were all over the place.</v>

1773
01:24:12.791 --> 01:24:13.624
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would go from miles around to go </v>

1774
01:24:15.191 --> 01:24:18.190
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're dead still dead today.</v>

1775
01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:19.600
<v Speaker 3>Just nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1776
01:24:19.630 --> 01:24:21.970
<v Speaker 3>So little bit of water now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of water,</v>

1777
01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.133
<v Speaker 3>like maybe like last time I was there </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to go see it again to get a </v>

1778
01:24:26.681 --> 01:24:28.570
<v Speaker 3>good read on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1779
01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:30.550
<v Speaker 3>the last time I talked to somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was there,</v>

1780
01:24:30.551 --> 01:24:32.140
<v Speaker 3>it was like half full,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1781
01:24:32.141 --> 01:24:34.180
<v Speaker 3>it'd be interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means it's really shallow.</v>

1782
01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.940
<v Speaker 3>If it gets rained and it comes back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1783
01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:38.163
<v Speaker 3>if how long it would take for the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish to find its way there due to </v>

1784
01:24:41.171 --> 01:24:44.320
<v Speaker 3>probably be a million years or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologist accidentally drops one in.</v>

1785
01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:48.190
<v Speaker 3>The thing about these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that cost tech?</v>

1786
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:49.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a steak.</v>

1787
01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:53.410
<v Speaker 3>So Lik is take in 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looks pretty good.</v>

1788
01:24:53.411 --> 01:24:55.270
<v Speaker 3>It's back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>

1789
01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:56.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another place where we used to </v>

1790
01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.040
<v Speaker 3>draw people out of helicopters that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about to Holland Lake though.</v>

1791
01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 3>And this is what came up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's pretty close.</v>

1792
01:25:05.441 --> 01:25:07.540
<v Speaker 3>It's on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1793
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:08.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1794
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:13.350
<v Speaker 3>that place has giant striped bass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the stuntman on fear factor.</v>

1795
01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:14.493
<v Speaker 3>They would go fishing like in between </v>
<v Speaker 3>stents that had like a lunch break and </v>

1796
01:25:17.861 --> 01:25:18.694
<v Speaker 3>these guys caught these like in like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes caught these giant ass striped </v>

1797
01:25:21.431 --> 01:25:23.380
<v Speaker 3>bass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That place is awesome.</v>

1798
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:25.800
<v Speaker 3>But that was half gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1799
01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:26.643
<v Speaker 3>So you got to see it with our own eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like places like drying up and just </v>

1800
01:25:31.511 --> 01:25:32.344
<v Speaker 3>because it caught it and it turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>around because the weather changed </v>

1801
01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:36.880
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean it can't happen instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

1802
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:37.750
<v Speaker 3>four years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

1803
01:25:37.751 --> 01:25:38.530
<v Speaker 3>six years.</v>

1804
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:41.260
<v Speaker 3>How about 30 years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty years of no rain.</v>

1805
01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Go Fuck Yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1806
01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:45.880
<v Speaker 3>That can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be the opposite.</v>

1807
01:25:45.881 --> 01:25:46.714
<v Speaker 3>I think just how bad of a rain that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had last year and I think this winter I </v>

1808
01:25:51.251 --> 01:25:55.540
<v Speaker 3>think we're just going to get pounded I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think and like all the Burbank mountains</v>

1809
01:25:55.570 --> 01:25:56.403
<v Speaker 3>that with all the fires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to get flooded now </v>

1810
01:25:58.421 --> 01:26:00.850
<v Speaker 3>from all the mud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mudslides that that's going to cause.</v>

1811
01:26:00.851 --> 01:26:05.690
<v Speaker 3>Because I think this end of the road </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit's just continuing to go on.</v>

1812
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:06.583
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it really is the end of </v>

1813
01:26:07.491 --> 01:26:09.350
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even the end of us.</v>

1814
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:10.393
<v Speaker 3>It's just that what we thought was </v>
<v Speaker 3>permanent was very fragile and that Fox </v>

1815
01:26:14.601 --> 01:26:15.434
<v Speaker 3>of their head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you just got to go into it knowing </v>

1816
01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:21.350
<v Speaker 3>that you can't think that those hills </v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to stay up to slide.</v>

1817
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Those houses are going to slide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1818
01:26:23.711 --> 01:26:24.544
<v Speaker 3>it's just like there's some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that built their houses like </v>

1819
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:27.283
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hanging off the side of a cliff </v>

1820
01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:31.400
<v Speaker 3>with like spikes into the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hill.</v>

1821
01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.380
<v Speaker 3>You've seen those houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of those,</v>

1822
01:26:33.381 --> 01:26:34.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like on Laurel,</v>

1823
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:35.930
<v Speaker 3>you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that house.</v>

1824
01:26:35.931 --> 01:26:37.340
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's that one going to go?</v>

1825
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:38.743
<v Speaker 3>That's going to slide down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember they shut down Laurel Canyon </v>

1826
01:26:40.761 --> 01:26:43.220
<v Speaker 3>like a few months back because one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the porches,</v>

1827
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:45.380
<v Speaker 3>back porch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 9,000</v>

1828
01:26:45.381 --> 01:26:48.260
<v Speaker 3>fucking pounds slid down the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all concrete and shit.</v>

01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:42.270
<v Speaker 5>You can actually control the outbreak </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the lever a little bit.</v>

1945
01:31:42.271 --> 01:31:44.190
<v Speaker 5>You can get yourself to go sideways with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that thing.</v>

1946
01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:48.480
<v Speaker 5>My car has a bug lot of it probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1947
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:51.120
<v Speaker 5>they probably don't have it filled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My car is a bug though.</v>

1948
01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:51.983
<v Speaker 5>If like you plug in your iphone before </v>
<v Speaker 5>like too early and you don't hit the </v>

1949
01:31:57.061 --> 01:31:58.270
<v Speaker 5>button that says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1950
01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:00.600
<v Speaker 5>agree to like the maps or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:32:00.601 --> 01:32:01.131
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1952
01:32:01.131 --> 01:32:01.964
<v Speaker 5>it's okay if that goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then like if you have your air </v>

1953
01:32:04.781 --> 01:32:07.270
<v Speaker 5>conditioning on and other things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't turn them off.</v>

1954
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:09.940
<v Speaker 5>So like the other day my stereo was like</v>
<v Speaker 5>on full blast.</v>

1955
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:10.774
<v Speaker 5>My air conditioning is on full blast and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to turn it all off while </v>

1956
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:16.690
<v Speaker 5>driving and it couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was your Honda?</v>

1957
01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:17.573
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>police,</v>

1959
01:32:22.290 --> 01:32:23.123
<v Speaker 5>car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you disconnected your phone when </v>

1960
01:32:24.371 --> 01:32:25.540
<v Speaker 5>it stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how I did it.</v>

1961
01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:26.374
<v Speaker 5>But I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At first I couldn't figure out what was </v>

1962
01:32:26.951 --> 01:32:29.710
<v Speaker 5>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard of that before.</v>

1963
01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:31.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of happened.</v>

1964
01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a dope car though.</v>

1965
01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:33.851
<v Speaker 5>I like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

01:32:33.851 --> 01:32:35.220
<v Speaker 5>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

1967
01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.390
<v Speaker 5>it's a technological tour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>De Force.</v>

1968
01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:40.720
<v Speaker 5>I could hook up androids or it has like </v>
<v Speaker 5>android play on it.</v>

1969
01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:42.970
<v Speaker 5>Also new.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of them didn't have it,</v>

1970
01:32:42.971 --> 01:32:43.804
<v Speaker 5>which is kind of fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't believe that they were </v>

1971
01:32:45.191 --> 01:32:46.024
<v Speaker 5>getting away with going with apple </v>
<v Speaker 5>carplay only because there's a lot of </v>

1972
01:32:48.371 --> 01:32:51.130
<v Speaker 5>people that would buy like Chevy's and </v>
<v Speaker 5>GM cars,</v>

1973
01:32:51.670 --> 01:32:54.410
<v Speaker 5>like cadillacs in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have that apple carplay.</v>

1974
01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:58.030
<v Speaker 5>Porsches have that apple carplay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like it though the texting.</v>

1975
01:32:58.210 --> 01:32:59.043
<v Speaker 5>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never text while driving anymore </v>

1976
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:02.500

1989
01:33:32.651 --> 01:33:33.484
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1990
01:33:34.001 --> 01:33:36.040
<v Speaker 5>thought about cars in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what they would look like.</v>

1991
01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.910
<v Speaker 5>This car looks like a future car GC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first flying car.</v>

1992
01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.900
<v Speaker 5>I saw it yesterday on the news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I think it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1995
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:50.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it looks like.</v>

1996
01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:52.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure that will be something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that thing.</v>

1997
01:33:52.450 --> 01:33:55.210
<v Speaker 5>We'll look at that car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful.</v>

1998
01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.850
<v Speaker 5>That's a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that thing.</v>

1999
01:33:58.380 --> 01:33:59.213
<v Speaker 5>I mean that looks like some Sylvester </v>
<v Speaker 5>stallone movie from Nineteen Ninety </v>

2000
01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:03.730
<v Speaker 5>Eight.</v>

2002
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially in atomic silver.</v>

2003
01:34:07.121 --> 01:34:10.510
<v Speaker 5>There's something about that silver </v>
<v Speaker 5>color that looks that's a rendering,</v>

2004
01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:15.820
<v Speaker 5>but that's a ridiculous looking car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cars are so sexy nowadays.</v>

2005
01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:18.310
<v Speaker 5>I really liked them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well they can do so much now.</v>

2006
01:34:18.311 --> 01:34:21.040
<v Speaker 5>They break for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They recognize objects in the side.</v>

2007
01:34:21.041 --> 01:34:23.050
<v Speaker 5>They give you warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2008
01:34:23.051 --> 01:34:23.884
<v Speaker 5>Mine has the lane departure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like if I'm texting and not paying </v>

2009
01:34:26.741 --> 01:34:29.710
<v Speaker 5>attention and I go out of my lane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it pushes you back in.</v>

2010
01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:33.790
<v Speaker 5>Or if somebody stops in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>slams on the brakes.</v>

2011
01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2012
01:34:34.811 --> 01:34:35.644
<v Speaker 5>Which that kind of freaks me out because</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if there isn't something there and </v>

2013
01:34:38.111 --> 01:34:40.570
<v Speaker 5>it just malfunctions and slammed on my </v>
<v Speaker 5>brakes,</v>

2014
01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:42.970
<v Speaker 5>know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it probably can happen.</v>

2015
01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:47.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean anything that's automated can </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck up.</v>

2016
01:34:47.201 --> 01:34:49.600
<v Speaker 5>Just like a person fucks up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this the flying car?</v>

2017
01:34:50.050 --> 01:34:52.750
<v Speaker 5>It's called the what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The lilium jet jet.</v>

2018
01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:56.290
<v Speaker 5>We believe in a world in which everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>can fly anywhere.</v>

2019
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:57.710
<v Speaker 5>Anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus.</v>

<v Speaker 1>terrible joke.</v>

2022
01:35:00.930 --> 01:35:04.130
<v Speaker 1>But you're going to fly across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and I don't trust that guy.</v>

2023
01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Looks a little wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's on adderall.</v>

2024
01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Sell me a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vision becomes a reality.</v>

2025
01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Now this is like the beginning of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction movie.</v>

2026
01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:16.093
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you bringing in an organism from </v>

2027
01:35:18.291 --> 01:35:19.124
<v Speaker 1>space?</v>

2028
01:35:19.290 --> 01:35:21.600
<v Speaker 2>So this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it real?</v>

2029
01:35:22.170 --> 01:35:25.170
<v Speaker 2>This is the first test flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says it's probably slow as fuck.</v>

2030
01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:29.490
<v Speaker 2>Like a balloon just floats through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

2031
01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:34.710
<v Speaker 2>It might the onion.</v>

2032
01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:47.180
<v Speaker 7>Why do I.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't seem real to questionable.</v>

2033
01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.153
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred kilometers an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did we decide that is somewhere </v>

2034
01:35:51.561 --> 01:35:53.270
<v Speaker 1>around 150,</v>
<v Speaker 1>150.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's got that look in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that?</v>

2038
01:36:01.891 --> 01:36:02.724
<v Speaker 2>Look when a guy's done a lot of extra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it doesn't look like he's just </v>

2039
01:36:04.561 --> 01:36:06.480
<v Speaker 2>shooting party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't look real.</v>

2051
01:36:39.791 --> 01:36:42.970
<v Speaker 2>about that because I just assumed it was</v>

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:45.190
<v Speaker 1>We've only ever used fresh beef since we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were founded in 1969.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wendy says you don't have to bring them </v>
<v Speaker 1>into us just because you forgot </v>

2078
01:38:03.871 --> 01:38:08.871
<v Speaker 1>refrigerators existed for a second and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it do this for a couple of strong.</v>

2079
01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.740

<v Speaker 1>Like when I go to in and out,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I feel like an asshole,</v>

2102
01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:18.180
<v Speaker 1>but with Wendy's it's like it's right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in and out.</v>

2103
01:39:18.181 --> 01:39:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking for some shit that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even exist on their menu supposedly.</v>

2104
01:39:21.670 --> 01:39:23.430

01:39:28.711 --> 01:39:31.740
<v Speaker 1>this is such a preposterous sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At Fat Burger.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They have all the pictures on the wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everyone that's finished the giant </v>

2109
01:39:34.801 --> 01:39:35.710
<v Speaker 1>fucking trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2110
01:39:35.890 --> 01:39:37.350
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a big thing.</v>

2111
01:39:37.351 --> 01:39:39.150
<v Speaker 1>It's as big as people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's giant.</v>

2112
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:40.343
<v Speaker 1>It's like speaking a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that fucking guy that had a </v>

2113
01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:48.510
<v Speaker 1>bladder stone that was the size of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ostrich egg and he get it.</v>

2114
01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:51.720
<v Speaker 1>He had to get it removed from his body </v>
<v Speaker 1>was sued.</v>

2115
01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:53.910
<v Speaker 1>That is the craziest thing I've seen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

2116
01:39:53.911 --> 01:39:54.744
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy had a rock inside of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>body that his own body made look at the </v>

2117
01:39:59.431 --> 01:40:02.310
<v Speaker 1>size of that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we get the guy having it in his hand.</v>

2118
01:40:02.610 --> 01:40:03.780
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That all right.</v>

2119
01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:07.770
<v Speaker 1>What is in your question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

2120
01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she tasted it.</v>

2121
01:40:10.281 --> 01:40:11.740
<v Speaker 1>No God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hey is.</v>

2122
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:14.310
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it would taste like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salt it salt?</v>

2123
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:15.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that any weirder than licking </v>

2124
01:40:15.951 --> 01:40:16.784
<v Speaker 1>salt that came out of the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take that you grind it up and put it </v>

2125
01:40:18.601 --> 01:40:19.740
<v Speaker 1>under state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cares.</v>

2126
01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I would lick my own stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else's.</v>

2127
01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Find out ct scans of the man's abdomen </v>
<v Speaker 1>also revealed another much smaller stone</v>

2128
01:40:26.801 --> 01:40:31.620
<v Speaker 1>in the man's left ureter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the tube that carries the urine</v>

2129
01:40:31.621 --> 01:40:32.454
<v Speaker 1>from the kidneys to the bladder </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the report which is </v>

2130
01:40:34.891 --> 01:40:35.940
<v Speaker 1>published today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2131
01:40:35.941 --> 01:40:36.774
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2132
01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:41.840
<v Speaker 1>The doctors treated them and noted that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had invasive bladder cancer more than</v>

2133
01:40:42.150 --> 01:40:44.640
<v Speaker 1>a decade before he developed the stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2134
01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.980
<v Speaker 1>wonder how long it took them to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>these stones.</v>

2135
01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if they just keep making them.</v>

2136
01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>You have to make up fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to build a door into</v>

2137
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.903
<v Speaker 3>his body where they could reach in once </v>
<v Speaker 3>a month and pull out an ostrich egg </v>

2138
01:40:57.131 --> 01:41:00.280
<v Speaker 3>sized rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how often does it,</v>

2139
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:02.020
<v Speaker 3>one of those things cook up inside your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

2140
01:41:02.021 --> 01:41:03.010
<v Speaker 3>It's got a years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2141
01:41:04.330 --> 01:41:05.163
<v Speaker 3>That's an issue with not that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular with kidney stones or an </v>

2142
01:41:08.021 --> 01:41:10.630
<v Speaker 3>issue with a fight or sometimes a cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of weight.</v>

2143
01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:12.550
<v Speaker 3>It becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2144
01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unwanted side effect,</v>

2145
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:17.500
<v Speaker 3>real bad to men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kidney stones are brutal.</v>

2146
01:41:17.670 --> 01:41:21.100
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys have canceled flights </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of kidney stones and actually,</v>

2147
01:41:21.101 --> 01:41:21.934
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never had them.</v>

2148
01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:25.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm Matt Metro and actually had them </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

2149
01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:27.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his fate or fight and they had to cancel</v>

2150
01:41:27.341 --> 01:41:29.830
<v Speaker 3>the first time they were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>meet because kidney stones,</v>

2151
01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.690
<v Speaker 3>super competent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matzoh heavyweight,</v>

2152
01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:32.524
<v Speaker 3>which is even weirder because </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweights don't have to drive </v>

2153
01:41:33.971 --> 01:41:37.600
<v Speaker 3>themselves out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somehow some people just genetically</v>

2154
01:41:37.601 --> 01:41:40.000
<v Speaker 3>are predisposed to getting them and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody gets him.</v>

2155
01:41:40.330 --> 01:41:41.163
<v Speaker 3>That's when you tap it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gets it like maybe every six months </v>

2156
01:41:44.861 --> 01:41:46.660
<v Speaker 3>she has god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's horrible.</v>

2157
01:41:46.690 --> 01:41:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

2158
01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:52.570
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it's like a diet thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a little bit of that.</v>

2159
01:41:52.630 --> 01:41:57.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also just some people just </v>
<v Speaker 3>know get 'em all the time.</v>

2160
01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:59.950
<v Speaker 3>It's also like the Diet thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so not fair.</v>

2161
01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:02.070
<v Speaker 3>Some people could just scarf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2162
01:42:02.071 --> 01:42:04.100
<v Speaker 3>they could just chow down pizza and </v>
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>

2163
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:08.680
<v Speaker 3>They do it right in front of everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they look like Tb.</v>

2164
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:12.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never gained any with his clay.</v>

2165
01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:13.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2166
01:42:13.001 --> 01:42:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Well don't eat pizza every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He works out a lot though.</v>

2167
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:17.560
<v Speaker 3>It just does work out a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

2168

<v Speaker 3>Tony Heart.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Tony has.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>going to do with this other lady.</v>

2188
01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we barely did.</v>

2189
01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:11.830
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to wrap it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to finish this.</v>

2190
01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:13.270
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2191
01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:18.300
<v Speaker 3>we came to one idea which was a a </v>
<v Speaker 3>contest gene Sigora burt,</v>

2192
01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.930

<v Speaker 3>October.</v>

01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:26.260
<v Speaker 3>No booze and you have to do 15 yoga </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes.</v>

2194
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.370
<v Speaker 3>We all agreed on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 hot yoga classes,</v>

2195
01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:31.060
<v Speaker 3>90 minute classes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no breaks.</v>

2196
01:43:31.061 --> 01:43:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or something like no breaks.</v>

2197
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to take breaks like a bitch.</v>

2198
01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:35.573
<v Speaker 3>I was going to lose anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's one of the reasons </v>

2199
01:43:37.421 --> 01:43:37.961
<v Speaker 3>why we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>pig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Jew.</v>

2202
01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:45.580
<v Speaker 3>Jews need to pick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody said that I go right here.</v>

2203
01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:48.310
<v Speaker 3>That didn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He peed twice during the show.</v>

2204
01:43:48.730 --> 01:43:50.980
<v Speaker 3>He pulls his dick out and pisses into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kombucha jar.</v>

2205
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:53.110
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's he doing that shit a lot.</v>

2206
01:43:53.250 --> 01:43:54.720
<v Speaker 3>A lot of this is wild man.</v>

2207
01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:58.030
<v Speaker 3>He lives in the jungle for months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lived with a,</v>

2208
01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:59.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like natives and shit.</v>

2209
01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's out there in the forest.</v>

2210
01:44:01.730 --> 01:44:03.350
<v Speaker 3>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2211
01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:06.710
<v Speaker 3>so he's basically backing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like a kid drew a kid,</v>

2212
01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 3>started living out of suitcase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2213
01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:10.490
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were in Asia for four months,</v>

2214
01:44:10.491 --> 01:44:12.650
<v Speaker 3>living out of a backpack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeping in hostels.</v>

2215
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Now all of a sudden you're back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to taste the good life.</v>

2216
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Didn't he also bet already walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>around naked?</v>

2217
01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:22.190
<v Speaker 3>Why is he walking around naked?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went to the desert last night.</v>

2218
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:23.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do mushrooms.</v>

2219
01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:26.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So ours just wandering around.</v>

2220
01:44:26.271 --> 01:44:27.860
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

2221
01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:32.510
<v Speaker 3>There's a place next to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a new kind of yoga used to try out.</v>

2222
01:44:32.511 --> 01:44:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I want to try it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2223
01:44:33.650 --> 01:44:34.483
<v Speaker 3>it's outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a baby goat yoga and it's pretty </v>

2224
01:44:37.821 --> 01:44:38.654
<v Speaker 3>much you do all this yoga and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this baby goats that will climb </v>

2225
01:44:41.571 --> 01:44:44.270
<v Speaker 3>on you while you're doing it and run </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and stuff like that.</v>

2226
01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is supposed to like the baby goats.</v>

2227
01:44:46.251 --> 01:44:47.084
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel good.</v>

2228
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.080

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2229
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.863
<v Speaker 3>And it's hilarious right next to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>house I needed to do that is fucking </v>

2230
01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:58.500
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they let these goats,</v>

2231
01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.830
<v Speaker 3>they were literally shit in your face </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're down there.</v>

2232
01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:01.843
<v Speaker 3>They don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people are doing their yoga </v>

2233
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:06.980
<v Speaker 3>while they're doing yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to do it around these goats.</v>

2234
01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Goats just climbing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy's probably like,</v>

2235
01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why I decided to up for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this to go.</v>

2236
01:45:15.531 --> 01:45:17.900
<v Speaker 3>So fucking incredible balance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2237
01:45:17.901 --> 01:45:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Like from the box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right out of snatch.</v>

2238
01:45:21.230 --> 01:45:24.400
<v Speaker 3>They can climb a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you should have baby goats.</v>

2239
01:45:24.401 --> 01:45:25.310
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

2240
01:45:25.311 --> 01:45:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who had goats.</v>

2241
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:30.140
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who got goats because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>has a big piece of land in Topanga.</v>

2242
01:45:30.710 --> 01:45:33.110
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goats ate everything.</v>

2243
01:45:33.710 --> 01:45:35.030
<v Speaker 3>They don't stop eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2244
01:45:35.210 --> 01:45:36.770
<v Speaker 3>They don't just eat the hay either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2245
01:45:36.771 --> 01:45:39.110
<v Speaker 3>fuck your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just start wandering through.</v>

2246
01:45:39.111 --> 01:45:39.944
<v Speaker 3>You look at the goat climate treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that happen to fucking palm </v>

2247
01:45:43.611 --> 01:45:45.560
<v Speaker 3>tree?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just can do.</v>

2248
01:45:45.610 --> 01:45:46.910
<v Speaker 3>That's the crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's it going?</v>

2249
01:45:46.911 --> 01:45:48.380
<v Speaker 3>And get down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They calm down,</v>

2250
01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:49.970
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2251
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I am so amazed by baby goats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want one so bad.</v>

2252
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2253
01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:58.010
<v Speaker 3>These things are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it fall out here?</v>

2254
01:45:58.250 --> 01:46:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Didn't receive videos that eagles coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

2255
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Super Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's different.</v>

2256
01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:04.280
<v Speaker 3>They grabbed me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They definitely fall.</v>

2257
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:08.330
<v Speaker 3>They have fallen in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They definitely fall and animals.</v>

2258
01:46:08.331 --> 01:46:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes like bears in particular,</v>

2259
01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:14.540
<v Speaker 3>if you see a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm eating a mountain goat.</v>

2260
01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.600
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times it's because the mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>gold fell like bears most of the time or</v>

2261
01:46:20.811 --> 01:46:21.644
<v Speaker 3>not catching mountain goats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why they have </v>

2262
01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:25.213
<v Speaker 3>adapted to live in these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>environments is because predators can't </v>

2263
01:46:28.341 --> 01:46:29.840
<v Speaker 3>get to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2264
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:32.180
<v Speaker 3>this is what they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They figured out a way to exist.</v>

2265
01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:34.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how keep that thing there,</v>

2266
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:35.840
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on Jesus Christ.</v>

2267
01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:39.830
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what the fuck happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at what it's doing.</v>

2268
01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Like trying to figure out how to turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

2269
01:46:41.690 --> 01:46:42.523
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is on the side of a cliff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also it knows not to do anything stupid </v>

2270
01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:49.200
<v Speaker 3>and it's not freaking out.</v>

2271
01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:51.253
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like the brains don't have </v>

2272
01:46:52.801 --> 01:46:54.720
<v Speaker 3>the ability to look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2273
01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm freaking out.</v>

2274
01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:02.130
<v Speaker 3>Like the way those things can catch </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and the way I can walk on the</v>

2275
01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:03.820
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Christ.</v>

2276
01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're not scared of heights at all</v>

2277
01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:09.220
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't have that in them.</v>

2278
01:47:09.690 --> 01:47:11.910
<v Speaker 3>He's young too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one looks young.</v>

2279
01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:15.390
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what you saw like that slip</v>

2280
01:47:15.391 --> 01:47:16.224
<v Speaker 3>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could definitely slipped to it's </v>

2281
01:47:17.251 --> 01:47:18.660
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It definitely could.</v>

2282
01:47:19.170 --> 01:47:21.830
<v Speaker 3>It must happen every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody.</v>

2283
01:47:21.831 --> 01:47:22.664
<v Speaker 3>I attached a Gopro to an eagle recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they live streamed it on periscope </v>

2284
01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.210
<v Speaker 3>and it was one of the most fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2285
01:47:30.211 --> 01:47:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Just seeing an eagle fly around and look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2286
01:47:33.690 --> 01:47:34.523
<v Speaker 3>look to the right and see like a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>dot moves and so then we'll get closer </v>

2287
01:47:37.051 --> 01:47:37.850
<v Speaker 3>and then.</v>

2288
01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:41.430
<v Speaker 3>And it was a cool camera view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know if it's on youtube now,</v>

2289
01:47:41.431 --> 01:47:45.510
<v Speaker 3>but very interesting to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy that you can do that now,</v>

2290
01:47:45.511 --> 01:47:46.344
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To a camera on an eagle and see things </v>

2291
01:47:47.761 --> 01:47:51.300
<v Speaker 3>from his perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see that photo?</v>

2292
01:47:51.301 --> 01:47:52.134
<v Speaker 3>A series of photos where a mountain lion</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to kill a goat and they both fell </v>

2293
01:47:57.601 --> 01:47:59.250
<v Speaker 3>to their death?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2294
01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:01.260
<v Speaker 3>A mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A mountain goat.</v>

2295
01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Was it a mountain goat or was it a sheep</v>
<v Speaker 3>made a mountain sheep.</v>

2296
01:48:04.951 --> 01:48:07.380
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a big horn sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2297
01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.473
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a mountain lion and the big </v>

2298
01:48:10.261 --> 01:48:13.080
<v Speaker 3>horn sheep and they were both splattered</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the fucking highway.</v>

2299
01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:14.220
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2300
01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:17.760
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing series of images.</v>

2301
01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2302
01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:22.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a cruel person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not me being cruel,</v>

2303
01:48:22.201 --> 01:48:23.034
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's something beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that and this is what I think is </v>

2304
01:48:25.441 --> 01:48:26.274
<v Speaker 3>beautiful about that.</v>

2305
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:29.560
<v Speaker 3>Go to like fullscreen with that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Full series.</v>

2306
01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:31.093
<v Speaker 3>Just go it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I printed that one picture that you had </v>

2307
01:48:31.971 --> 01:48:33.630
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

2308
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Go look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2309
01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.950
<v Speaker 3>they're both gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're both next to a cliff.</v>

2310
01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:44.540
<v Speaker 3>And the only way this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2311
01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:51.340
<v Speaker 3>You see the horn off to the left that </v>
<v Speaker 3>says other horn off.</v>

2312
01:48:52.530 --> 01:48:53.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I blew off.</v>

2313
01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably felt a long way.</v>

2314
01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Go to the series now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

2315
01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:07.220
<v Speaker 3>it's what's crazy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It represents how hard that life is.</v>

2316
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.481
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2317
01:49:08.481 --> 01:49:12.500
<v Speaker 3>it's just blood's pouring out of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>head sets nuts.</v>

2318
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:14.750
<v Speaker 3>That is nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2319
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the horn blew off.</v>

2320
01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:22.120
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn Dude.</v>

2321
01:49:22.121 --> 01:49:23.840
<v Speaker 3>Look at that mountain lion tree to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2322
01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:28.860
<v Speaker 3>to tweak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got a mouthful of furrowed brow.</v>

2323
01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Never let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so powerful.</v>

2324
01:49:32.630 --> 01:49:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is so powerful.</v>

2325
01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:38.360
<v Speaker 3>It probably had it in its mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As they went down.</v>

2326
01:49:38.361 --> 01:49:40.780
<v Speaker 3>They both went down together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2327
01:49:40.781 --> 01:49:44.230
<v Speaker 3>this is a daddy is a goddamn powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>series of images.</v>

2328
01:49:44.231 --> 01:49:46.330
<v Speaker 3>Look at that backup and see the height </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that cliff.</v>

2329
01:49:46.690 --> 01:49:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Holy Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Banga surprise.</v>

2330
01:49:52.901 --> 01:49:57.280
<v Speaker 3>He didn't land on his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably held on that goat the entire</v>

2331
01:49:57.281 --> 01:49:58.840
<v Speaker 3>way down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fucking murderer.</v>

2332
01:49:59.490 --> 01:50:01.600
<v Speaker 3>It fell from somewhere up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

2333
01:50:01.601 --> 01:50:02.440
<v Speaker 3>How high that is</v>

2334
01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.570
<v Speaker 3>found on a closed road near glacier </v>
<v Speaker 3>national park.</v>

2335
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

2336
01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:10.173
<v Speaker 8>dude.</v>

2337
01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:13.250
<v Speaker 3>We got to get those images for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>studio.</v>

2338
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.000
<v Speaker 3>We have to see if those are for sale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find out if those are for sale.</v>

2339
01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I have a poster printer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just send them to me.</v>

2340
01:50:21.111 --> 01:50:23.600
<v Speaker 3>I'll print them out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're supposed to buy those.</v>

2341
01:50:24.210 --> 01:50:25.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are like,</v>

2342
01:50:25.161 --> 01:50:25.994
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something powerful about it </v>

2343
01:50:27.771 --> 01:50:29.690
<v Speaker 3>that's not like just a picture of a kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a balloon.</v>

2344
01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know something about that.</v>

2345
01:50:31.221 --> 01:50:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody had to be there to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>that picture.</v>

2346
01:50:33.021 --> 01:50:34.070
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does she get some money?</v>

2347
01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:35.550
<v Speaker 3>Printers are pretty amazing nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2348
01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.410
<v Speaker 3>I got this poster printer for like $200,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$300 and it,</v>

2349
01:50:40.450 --> 01:50:44.870
<v Speaker 3>it prints like pretty decent size </v>
<v Speaker 3>posters and so like you can just go,</v>

2350
01:50:45.050 --> 01:50:45.650
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2351
01:50:45.650 --> 01:50:48.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always wanted a werewolf poster and</v>

2352
01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:51.170
<v Speaker 3>you just printed out and it's like go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the store,</v>

2353
01:50:51.171 --> 01:50:52.850
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have it framed a big.</v>

2354
01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:54.193
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably say like maybe 31 by 20 or </v>

2355
01:50:58.401 --> 01:50:59.234
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2356
01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:05.000
<v Speaker 3>I've been seeing a lot of stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 3>special effects guys like Rick Baker are</v>

2357
01:51:05.001 --> 01:51:09.290
<v Speaker 3>doing with three d printing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're making all these masks and heads</v>

2358
01:51:09.291 --> 01:51:13.610
<v Speaker 3>and shit with three d printing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you could just make something</v>

2359
01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:17.570
<v Speaker 3>in a computer and then go over to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>three d printer and print that bitch out</v>

2360
01:51:18.110 --> 01:51:19.280
<v Speaker 3>for some things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's perfect.</v>

2361
01:51:19.281 --> 01:51:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I just lost like a little battery </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover to one of my remotes the other day</v>

2362
01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:24.733
<v Speaker 3>and I bet I if I had a three d printer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could find the model of the battery </v>

2363
01:51:27.051 --> 01:51:29.560
<v Speaker 3>cover and just print it out or make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a fun.</v>

2364
01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:31.700
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2365
01:51:31.770 --> 01:51:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you really think that,</v>

2366
01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:37.370
<v Speaker 3>how much of that is going to be like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future of objects,</v>

2367
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:39.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future of things,</v>

2368
01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:40.393
<v Speaker 3>like how much less shit would you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sell people if you could just sell </v>

2369
01:51:43.311 --> 01:51:44.740
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh whoa.</v>

2370
01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:45.733
<v Speaker 3>I would print that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that Rick Baker's Popeye makerbot </v>

2371
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:50.360
<v Speaker 3>three d printer I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2372
01:51:50.361 --> 01:51:52.690
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing arts.</v>

2373
01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Then he paints it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2374
01:51:55.130 --> 01:51:58.640
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that one right above it.</v>

2375
01:51:58.730 --> 01:52:01.310
<v Speaker 3>That's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2376
01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Go back to that other one that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>had with that whole.</v>

2377
01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:07.360
<v Speaker 3>The whole series of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the Benito Doterra Werewolf A.</v>

2378
01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of.</v>

2379
01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Pretty close to it in the middle.</v>

2380
01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:13.240
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

2381
01:52:13.241 --> 01:52:15.280
<v Speaker 3>That'd be fun to paint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2382
01:52:15.281 --> 01:52:17.740
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once it's three d printed out.</v>

2383
01:52:17.770 --> 01:52:18.603
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2384
01:52:19.630 --> 01:52:22.810
<v Speaker 3>These guys have so many tools at their </v>
<v Speaker 3>disposal now,</v>

2385
01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:24.513
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder how much of that is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be lost like all the special effects </v>

2386
01:52:27.491 --> 01:52:28.324
<v Speaker 3>makeup stuff in the transition to cgi </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it seems like it's just </v>

2387
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:32.494
<v Speaker 3>inevitable that CGI keeps getting better</v>
<v Speaker 3>and better and better arguments for </v>

2388
01:52:36.701 --> 01:52:37.534
<v Speaker 3>having a mix of this and using practical</v>
<v Speaker 3>effects and I saw a clip of that gay </v>

2389
01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 3>American Werewolf actually moving in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>back while they were testing it out.</v>

2390
01:52:46.101 --> 01:52:48.920
<v Speaker 3>It looks obviously fake as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't.</v>

2391
01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:50.953
<v Speaker 3>We know what to look for now in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake stuff and it really is catching us </v>

2392
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.823
<v Speaker 3>off guard all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like when I saw that video right </v>

2393
01:52:55.971 --> 01:52:56.900
<v Speaker 3>away were like fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake,</v>

2394
01:52:56.901 --> 01:52:58.700
<v Speaker 3>fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even when it looks good,</v>

2395
01:52:58.701 --> 01:53:00.800
<v Speaker 3>10 years later you look back at </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and you're like,</v>

2396
01:53:00.801 --> 01:53:01.910
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks horrible.</v>

2397
01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:04.580
<v Speaker 3>White Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played King Kong,</v>

2398
01:53:04.610 --> 01:53:05.443
<v Speaker 3>the original King Kong for my kids a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of years back and they were </v>

2399
01:53:09.921 --> 01:53:10.754
<v Speaker 3>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were so scared at first and I was </v>

2400
01:53:12.741 --> 01:53:13.401
<v Speaker 3>telling him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2401
01:53:13.401 --> 01:53:14.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not showing you anything scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2402
01:53:14.961 --> 01:53:17.990
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so silly.</v>

2403
01:53:18.410 --> 01:53:20.840
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem real at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

2404
01:53:20.841 --> 01:53:22.160
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the monster.</v>

2405
01:53:22.161 --> 01:53:22.641
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2406
01:53:22.641 --> 01:53:24.170
<v Speaker 3>that's the monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2407
01:53:24.171 --> 01:53:26.320
<v Speaker 3>because they're little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they overlap.</v>

2408
01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:32.450
<v Speaker 3>Fell down and they're being so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really funny.</v>

2409
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:35.360
<v Speaker 3>I really wished that nuke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that King Kong Island was better.</v>

2410
01:53:35.361 --> 01:53:37.340
<v Speaker 3>I hated that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swamp man.</v>

2411
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:40.550
<v Speaker 3>How many times can tell a stupid story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so racist story.</v>

2412
01:53:40.551 --> 01:53:41.384
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>King Kong surrounded by black chicks </v>

2413
01:53:43.851 --> 01:53:46.040
<v Speaker 3>never cares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One white chick shows up.</v>

2414
01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:49.160
<v Speaker 3>He loses his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's climbing buildings.</v>

2415
01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:52.070
<v Speaker 3>Bring them into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He breaks out of chains.</v>

2416
01:53:52.071 --> 01:53:54.500
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look how big he is.</v>

2417
01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty big.</v>

2418
01:53:57.590 --> 01:54:00.530
<v Speaker 3>They changed a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Different versions.</v>

2419
01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:03.170
<v Speaker 3>They have a graph that shows all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sizes from all the past.</v>

2420
01:54:03.171 --> 01:54:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he said him and Godzilla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2421
01:54:05.151 --> 01:54:05.984
<v Speaker 3>the Japanese movie was a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made him like 500 feet tall or </v>

2422
01:54:09.321 --> 01:54:11.960
<v Speaker 3>something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think he was supposed to be like 50</v>

2423
01:54:11.961 --> 01:54:16.040
<v Speaker 3>feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the first one is that over there.</v>

2424
01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:20.750
<v Speaker 3>King Kong escapes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 67.</v>

2425
01:54:20.751 --> 01:54:22.520
<v Speaker 3>That's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>18 foot,</v>

2426
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:25.550
<v Speaker 3>12 foot tall in the 1933 one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2427
01:54:25.610 --> 01:54:26.271
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2428
01:54:26.271 --> 01:54:28.400
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was saying that he looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>so small compared to like.</v>

2429
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he was 12 feet tall.</v>

2430
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:32.210
<v Speaker 3>The son of Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2431
01:54:32.211 --> 01:54:35.400
<v Speaker 3>that's the little one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2432
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:36.680
<v Speaker 3>King Kong lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my fear.</v>

2433
01:54:36.681 --> 01:54:39.830
<v Speaker 3>I saw that in theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was pretty God damn big.</v>

2434
01:54:40.730 --> 01:54:43.670
<v Speaker 3>He was a thousand feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>King Kong Godzilla.</v>

2435
01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Godzilla was gonna fuck him up period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how much bigger is.</v>

2436
01:54:47.511 --> 01:54:50.150
<v Speaker 3>How has that even not even close the new</v>
<v Speaker 3>Godzilla.</v>

01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Super Fuck them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new Godzilla has goddamn terrifying.</v>

2438
01:54:53.301 --> 01:54:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Seems to be thinking you can't make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good one of these.</v>

2439
01:54:58.310 --> 01:55:02.480
<v Speaker 3>That was a which years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skull island one is the newer one.</v>

2440
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:03.343

<v Speaker 3>I mean you can only make so many of </v>

2441
01:55:05.751 --> 01:55:08.300
<v Speaker 3>these God damn things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2442
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:09.643
<v Speaker 3>after awhile it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me guess know the girl is going to </v>

2443
01:55:12.551 --> 01:55:14.610

<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be real excited when she go</v>

<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to be okay.</v>

2447
01:55:23.250 --> 01:55:24.083
<v Speaker 3>He won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's stomping on black chicks left and </v>

2448
01:55:26.151 --> 01:55:29.900
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's the most racist movie of all time.</v>

2451
01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:40.610
<v Speaker 3>Like the first time King Kong sees a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white chick,</v>

2452
01:55:40.611 --> 01:55:44.040

<v Speaker 5>down a rabbit hole the other day </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching that one gorilla that you know </v>

<v Speaker 1>but they're like you.</v>

2460

<v Speaker 1>This is not like a gopher or groundhog </v>

2461
01:56:09.010 --> 01:56:09.843
<v Speaker 1>or something like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're on a completely different level </v>

2462
01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:15.190
<v Speaker 1>than most other mammals besides us.</v>

2463
01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:19.760
<v Speaker 5>Coco recently got some new kittens and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's watching.</v>

2464
01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:22.210

<v Speaker 5>kittens.</v>

2465
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:23.260
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a girl,</v>

2470
01:56:30.990 --> 01:56:32.980

2471
01:56:32.981 --> 01:56:35.440
<v Speaker 5>I considered them guys and cats girls </v>

2472
01:56:35.441 --> 01:56:36.274
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because she could smash your fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>They're vegetarians to their sweeties.</v>

2476
01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:48.780

<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

2477
01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:53.670

01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 5>Boobs are back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They</v>

2514
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.500
<v Speaker 1>went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the fuck did go away,</v>

2515
01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:46.960
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just like people run out of shit</v>

2516
01:58:46.961 --> 01:58:49.330
<v Speaker 1>to talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

2517
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:51.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like half the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed in this podcast,</v>

2518
01:58:51.761 --> 01:58:53.260
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>

2519
01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:56.150
<v Speaker 1>We're just shooting the Shit folks </v>
<v Speaker 1>concrete.</v>

2520
01:58:56.190 --> 01:58:58.090
<v Speaker 1>They're printing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations on that.</v>

2521
01:58:58.130 --> 01:58:58.963
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2522
01:58:59.170 --> 01:59:00.003
<v Speaker 1>A New York Times a retraction that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much cause that was pretty </v>

2523
01:59:04.901 --> 01:59:05.734
<v Speaker 1>beautiful watching that go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a guy who wrote it and it </v>

2524
01:59:09.491 --> 01:59:11.440
<v Speaker 1>was printed in the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2525
01:59:11.770 --> 01:59:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the New York Times,</v>

2526
01:59:13.181 --> 01:59:14.014
<v Speaker 1>but it's an individual's choice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe an editor's choice to embellish </v>

2527
01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:20.560
<v Speaker 1>the reality of what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said that Connor's,</v>

2528
01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:21.453
<v Speaker 1>it was about the boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said that his face was covered in </v>

2529
01:59:24.521 --> 01:59:25.354
<v Speaker 1>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely covered in blood and that he </v>

2530
01:59:27.011 --> 01:59:28.840
<v Speaker 1>was rescued before he fell through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ropes.</v>

2531
01:59:28.841 --> 01:59:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Neither one of those things are true.</v>

2532
01:59:30.130 --> 01:59:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His face wasn't bloody at all.</v>

2533
01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:34.173
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a little bit of a swelling under </v>

2534
01:59:34.961 --> 01:59:36.490
<v Speaker 1>his left eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2535
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:37.623
<v Speaker 1>he was definitely getting punched in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face and I definitely agree with the </v>

2536
01:59:40.391 --> 01:59:44.470
<v Speaker 1>stoppage of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was exhausted and he was a fallen all</v>

2537
01:59:44.471 --> 01:59:45.304
<v Speaker 1>over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was more that floyd was just </v>

2538
01:59:47.381 --> 01:59:49.690
<v Speaker 1>teeing off on him and he wasn't firing </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2539
01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:53.380
<v Speaker 1>There was no blood and he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't gonna fall through the ropes.</v>

2540
01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:54.243
<v Speaker 1>He might've went down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've went down at one point in the </v>

2541
01:59:56.141 --> 01:59:56.741
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2542
01:59:56.741 --> 01:59:58.300
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if floyd kept punching him,</v>

2543
01:59:58.301 --> 02:00:01.240
<v Speaker 1>that might be actually a smart move for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to catch 10 seconds,</v>

2544
02:00:01.241 --> 02:00:03.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a standing eight count,</v>

2545
02:00:03.640 --> 02:00:04.473
<v Speaker 1>get up at the counter or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do go down to a knee rather get up at </v>

2546
02:00:06.521 --> 02:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>the count of Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2547
02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>they brush your gloves off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a second or two there,</v>

2548
02:00:10.490 --> 02:00:11.323
<v Speaker 1>then you go back in.</v>

2549
02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that had been enough for him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get through the round,</v>

2550
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was for sure having a real </v>

2551
02:00:16.751 --> 02:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>hard time recovering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with the New York Times where it was</v>

2552
02:00:19.091 --> 02:00:19.924
<v Speaker 1>just not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what it was was just as juicy what </v>

2553
02:00:23.771 --> 02:00:24.604
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His 40 year old boxer comes out of </v>

2554
02:00:26.711 --> 02:00:27.544
<v Speaker 1>retirement and schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one most popular MMA fighter </v>

2555
02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:33.033
<v Speaker 1>in the world in a boxing match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proving what a lot of experts already </v>

2556
02:00:35.891 --> 02:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>knew that a specialist someone is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest specialists of all time when it</v>

2557
02:00:39.671 --> 02:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>comes to boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's pretty arguable.</v>

2558
02:00:41.981 --> 02:00:42.814
<v Speaker 1>Floyd's in like the two or three people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could argue like the greatest </v>

2559
02:00:45.461 --> 02:00:46.510
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>

2560
02:00:46.511 --> 02:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>floyd is the number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he beat conor mcgregor in a way that</v>

2561
02:00:51.431 --> 02:00:52.264
<v Speaker 1>you would expect a real specialist to </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat someone who's just pretty good at </v>

2562
02:00:55.661 --> 02:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was masterful.</v>

2563
02:00:57.310 --> 02:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Fucking awesome to watch and what Connor</v>
<v Speaker 1>said afterwards,</v>

2564
02:01:00.521 --> 02:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>hilarious too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turned them into a Mexican.</v>

2565
02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:05.260
<v Speaker 1>He fought like a Mexican because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what people love about.</v>

2566
02:01:05.261 --> 02:01:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Mexican fighters at Mexican fighters are</v>
<v Speaker 1>known for coming straight at you.</v>

2567
02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Like Mexican fighters aren't dancers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not dancing around and you know,</v>

2568
02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:15.580
<v Speaker 1>doing the Ali shuffle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like Julio Cesar Chavez.</v>

2569
02:01:15.581 --> 02:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>If moving forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2570
02:01:17.351 --> 02:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>they're like Marco Antonio Berrera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're moving forward Mexican boxers or</v>

2571
02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:24.340
<v Speaker 1>like some of the proudest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most rugged warriors ever.</v>

2572
02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>That's how floyd fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fought really?</v>

2573
02:01:27.611 --> 02:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Did fight like a super technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive brawling style.</v>

2574
02:01:31.641 --> 02:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>He tired connor out that beat his ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2575
02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful for boxing.</v>

2576
02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2577
02:01:39.110 --> 02:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>for the overall art of fighting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to see these things.</v>

2578
02:01:45.681 --> 02:01:50.681
<v Speaker 1>I think this thing that we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in eat fans of of MMA,</v>

2579
02:01:50.751 --> 02:01:51.584
<v Speaker 1>practitioners of MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that we're all participating </v>

2580
02:01:53.931 --> 02:01:58.931
<v Speaker 1>in is trying to figure out what style is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very best style for fighting period.</v>

2581
02:02:00.110 --> 02:02:02.210
<v Speaker 1>And then we found along the way that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>varies.</v>

2582
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>It varies on the individual styles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make fights,</v>

2583
02:02:05.211 --> 02:02:07.520
<v Speaker 1>and then sometimes one guy can beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>another guy,</v>

2584
02:02:07.521 --> 02:02:09.230
<v Speaker 1>but that guy can beat someone who could </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat him.</v>

2585
02:02:09.231 --> 02:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>And it gets real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like mma.</v>

2586
02:02:11.121 --> 02:02:11.954
<v Speaker 1>Math is one of the squirrel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earliest fucking predictors of who's </v>

2587
02:02:14.931 --> 02:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>going to win a fight ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're finding out like what?</v>

2588
02:02:18.741 --> 02:02:19.574
<v Speaker 1>What's fucking real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you got all the belief in </v>

2589
02:02:22.641 --> 02:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've got knockout power,</v>

2590
02:02:25.191 --> 02:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>when you really believe you could beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest boxer of all time,</v>

2591
02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:29.210
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2592
02:02:29.211 --> 02:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2593
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:32.450
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to learn.</v>

2594
02:02:32.690 --> 02:02:33.523
<v Speaker 1>It's good to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to learn that even though he </v>

2595
02:02:35.031 --> 02:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>lands it lands a few shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it a real interesting contest.</v>

2596
02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Good to learn that the best specialists </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all time is that for a reason.</v>

2597
02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>This isn't bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is floyd mayweather.</v>

2598
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:47.660
<v Speaker 1>He's 49 and now now he's 50 and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's.</v>

2599
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>That's good for combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for everybody.</v>

2600
02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:53.960
<v Speaker 1>That's what's so stupid about this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing versus mma feud.</v>

2601
02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:55.333
<v Speaker 1>It's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets everybody excited about fights </v>

2602
02:02:57.590 --> 02:03:02.510
<v Speaker 1>and this inter competition thing between</v>
<v Speaker 1>a an MMA fighter coming over to boxing.</v>

2603
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:03.583
<v Speaker 1>That's even more fun because then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets like everything excited on both </v>

2604
02:03:06.741 --> 02:03:07.574
<v Speaker 1>sides and I think it's gotten a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people super excited about Canelo </v>

2605
02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Alvarez and triple g,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is next weekend.</v>

2606
02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:16.010
<v Speaker 1>People are super pumped up about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

2607
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:18.680
<v Speaker 1>particularly because we're just past </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2608
02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Connor Floyd Mayweather fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd mayweather has his way with connor</v>

2609
02:03:23.301 --> 02:03:24.134
<v Speaker 1>just puts on a display and now we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get to see instead of the </v>

2610
02:03:27.351 --> 02:03:30.200
<v Speaker 1>master versus a guy who really wasn't on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his level.</v>

2611
02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to get to say to guys in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their prime,</v>

2612
02:03:33.441 --> 02:03:36.470
<v Speaker 1>at the top of the food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the top three,</v>

2613
02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:39.020
<v Speaker 1>top four pound for pound fighters in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

2614
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:41.030
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to go at it so it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for everybody.</v>

2615
02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:42.470
<v Speaker 1>They just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

2616
02:03:42.471 --> 02:03:46.370
<v Speaker 1>These guys are so old school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They understand social media in a sense.</v>

2617
02:03:46.371 --> 02:03:47.960
<v Speaker 1>They know they can use it to promote </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

2618
02:03:48.110 --> 02:03:52.100
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that it's changed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole community and that instead of like</v>

2619
02:03:52.101 --> 02:03:57.101
<v Speaker 1>having some stupid rivalry with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other like sport mma,</v>

2620
02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:00.350
<v Speaker 1>instead of having that just accept each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

2621
02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:01.393
<v Speaker 1>accept each other and talk highly of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best examples in both sports and </v>

2622
02:04:05.781 --> 02:04:06.614
<v Speaker 1>everybody will be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what you're seeing with </v>

2623
02:04:08.151 --> 02:04:10.130
<v Speaker 1>this conor mcgregor floyd mayweather </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2624
02:04:10.131 --> 02:04:12.680
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're to see with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>triple g Canelo Alvarez fight.</v>

2625
02:04:12.681 --> 02:04:15.230
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be one or the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the boxing.</v>

2626
02:04:15.231 --> 02:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>People don't have to not like MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love boxing and I work in MMA.</v>

2627
02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I love boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch all the big fights.</v>

2628
02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm always gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

2629
02:04:23.601 --> 02:04:24.434
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to know who the real </v>

2630
02:04:26.331 --> 02:04:27.890
<v Speaker 1>specialists are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2631
02:04:27.891 --> 02:04:29.720
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love kickboxing.</v>

2632
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Big Fan of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to know a lot.</v>

2633
02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I love Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know.</v>

2634
02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how good are the best guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen?</v>

2635
02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:37.633
<v Speaker 1>The best guy in the UFC fought the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy in Jujitsu in a straight up Jujitsu </v>

2636
02:04:41.311 --> 02:04:42.210
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see,</v>

2637
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:43.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are.</v>

2638
02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Those things are interesting.</v>

2639
02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I went to see a box or go to the UFC and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how it's going to happen eventually.</v>

2640
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had James,</v>

2641
02:04:52.891 --> 02:04:53.611
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

2642
02:04:53.611 --> 02:04:54.444
<v Speaker 1>but James was way past his prime and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even look like he trained for </v>

2643
02:04:57.781 --> 02:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think James just took a payday.</v>

2644
02:05:00.150 --> 02:05:01.350
<v Speaker 1>If I had a gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2645
02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>and randy just hit them with a low ankle</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick.</v>

2646
02:05:04.170 --> 02:05:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Took them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe hit a low single.</v>

2647
02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he went way low,</v>

2648
02:05:10.110 --> 02:05:10.943
<v Speaker 1>but either way there's not a chance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell that James Tony was ever going to </v>

2649
02:05:13.651 --> 02:05:16.230
<v Speaker 1>stop randy coture from taking them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to happen.</v>

2650
02:05:16.231 --> 02:05:18.600
<v Speaker 1>He would have to catch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely perfect.</v>

2651
02:05:18.601 --> 02:05:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Coming in for the very first punch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't,</v>

2652
02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:23.900
<v Speaker 1>randy was going to molest him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have his way with them.</v>

2653
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Excited about GSP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2654
02:05:28.150 --> 02:05:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested to see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite honestly,</v>

2655
02:05:30.991 --> 02:05:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see him at 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>

2656
02:05:33.490 --> 02:05:34.323
<v Speaker 1>I think him versus Woodley is the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Woodley's had two fights in a row </v>

2657
02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:40.433
<v Speaker 1>where people were booing him and three </v>
<v Speaker 1>really because they had to fight with </v>

2658
02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:46.800
<v Speaker 1>wonderboy that will like chess matches </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then one fight with Damien Maia,</v>

2659
02:05:47.370 --> 02:05:49.740
<v Speaker 1>which was also like just not the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting fight,</v>

2660
02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:52.950
<v Speaker 1>but I think him versus GSP would be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting fight.</v>

2661
02:05:52.951 --> 02:05:56.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the real fight because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's GSPS real weight class to,</v>

2662
02:05:56.430 --> 02:05:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in that,</v>

2663
02:05:57.870 --> 02:06:01.440
<v Speaker 1>but I'm interested in the bisping fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>too because I think it's a tough fight.</v>

2664
02:06:01.530 --> 02:06:04.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough fight for GSP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bisping is a handful.</v>

2665
02:06:04.111 --> 02:06:06.490
<v Speaker 1>He's a big fella to fought at two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>

2666
02:06:06.491 --> 02:06:08.700
<v Speaker 1>And the ultimate fighter fights in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>85 in the UFC.</v>

2667
02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>He's way bigger than George and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten fucking tough man.</v>

2668
02:06:12.450 --> 02:06:14.760
<v Speaker 1>He's real good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legitimately real good.</v>

2669
02:06:14.761 --> 02:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>And George has been out for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2670
02:06:16.930 --> 02:06:18.270
<v Speaker 1>What's he been doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2671
02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:21.210
<v Speaker 1>he's been training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely stayed in shape.</v>

2672
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:23.820
<v Speaker 1>He did a lot of gymnastics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a lot of exercise,</v>

2673
02:06:23.821 --> 02:06:24.654
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made a shit ton of money when he was </v>

2674
02:06:25.891 --> 02:06:26.724
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had contracts with Nike and he had </v>

2675
02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a.</v>

2676
02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:32.130
<v Speaker 1>was it Nike or was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2677
02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I think he had something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew we had something with Gatorade,</v>

2678
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:37.620
<v Speaker 1>but I want to say George had something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's under armour.</v>

2679
02:06:37.850 --> 02:06:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got something with under </v>
<v Speaker 1>armour.</v>

2680
02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:40.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's at a bunch of big endorsements </v>

2681
02:06:41.611 --> 02:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>and he's at a giant hero in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2682
02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:46.500
<v Speaker 1>just giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2683
02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:48.840
<v Speaker 1>So I think for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2684
02:06:49.290 --> 02:06:52.350
<v Speaker 1>a while he just recovering and then all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those wars,</v>

2685
02:06:52.351 --> 02:06:53.184
<v Speaker 1>all those years of getting brawls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then finally got to a point where his </v>

2686
02:06:56.131 --> 02:06:57.720
<v Speaker 1>body started feeling real good again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2687
02:06:57.721 --> 02:06:59.070
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get back in there.</v>

2688
02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if the aliens are still around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the len to come to me.</v>

2689
02:07:02.830 --> 02:07:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I think red light.</v>

2690
02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:05.833
<v Speaker 2>I refuse to drink a gatorade anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to drink a gatorade every single </v>

2691
02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:13.640
<v Speaker 2>day for the last 20 years and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day busted wine open,</v>

2692
02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:15.013
<v Speaker 2>drank it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and something that felt like a raw egg </v>

2693
02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:22.120
<v Speaker 2>went into my mouth and spit it back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just this low lob just shot a</v>

2694
02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:28.080
<v Speaker 2>this video on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's apparently a thing like this.</v>

2695
02:07:28.170 --> 02:07:29.870
<v Speaker 2>The gatorade gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2696
02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:31.370
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the only one.</v>

2697
02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:32.840
<v Speaker 2>There's Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>

2698
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:34.450
<v Speaker 2>That was in my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2699
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 2>top</v>

2700
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:39.670
<v Speaker 3>119 complaints and reviews about </v>
<v Speaker 3>gatorade from consumer affairs.</v>

2701
02:07:39.671 --> 02:07:40.504
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got one of these brands in my </v>

2702
02:07:42.401 --> 02:07:43.234
<v Speaker 3>mouth and I saved it up until about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week ago because I was going to just </v>

2703
02:07:46.450 --> 02:07:47.980
<v Speaker 3>call them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

2704
02:07:47.981 --> 02:07:49.180
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares about this hub?</v>

2705
02:07:49.450 --> 02:07:51.190
<v Speaker 3>What are they saying it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2706
02:07:51.191 --> 02:07:52.540
<v Speaker 3>There's a load.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much data loading there.</v>

2707
02:07:54.130 --> 02:07:56.710
<v Speaker 3>It was the grossest thing ever in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>

2708
02:07:56.711 --> 02:07:58.990
<v Speaker 3>I have like flashbacks and I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

2709
02:07:59.020 --> 02:07:59.853
<v Speaker 3>I will never ever drink a gatorade for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of my life and look at this </v>

2710
02:08:02.411 --> 02:08:04.660
<v Speaker 3>crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a wow.</v>

2711
02:08:04.661 --> 02:08:06.700
<v Speaker 3>That's just molded though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's mold.</v>

2712
02:08:06.890 --> 02:08:07.723
<v Speaker 3>Mold is sugar or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who knows how long that's been </v>

2713
02:08:09.971 --> 02:08:11.410
<v Speaker 3>sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing.</v>

2714
02:08:11.411 --> 02:08:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you go to a gas station or </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

2715
02:08:13.730 --> 02:08:15.850
<v Speaker 3>always look at the bottom of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>container,</v>

2716
02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:17.740
<v Speaker 3>like if you're buying like a plastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottle,</v>

2717
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:18.970
<v Speaker 3>like apple juice or something.</v>

2718
02:08:19.210 --> 02:08:20.043
<v Speaker 3>Because I've noticed that ever since </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm so paranoid about anything and </v>

2719
02:08:24.041 --> 02:08:24.874
<v Speaker 3>I tell you half the times I'm looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom like that does not look </v>

2720
02:08:27.131 --> 02:08:27.964
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This looks like it's been mold or </v>

2721
02:08:30.251 --> 02:08:31.084
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things that are go traveled around like </v>

2722
02:08:32.171 --> 02:08:33.004
<v Speaker 3>a Mcdonald's or the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dude who was worried about Wendy's </v>

2723
02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:36.753
<v Speaker 3>with the hot trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are things that are travel around </v>

2724
02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:40.240
<v Speaker 3>in hot trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2725
02:08:40.270 --> 02:08:41.103
<v Speaker 3>like for real [inaudible] I wonder if </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what temperature gatorade has to </v>

2726
02:08:46.871 --> 02:08:49.240
<v Speaker 3>get to before shit starts growing in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>

2727
02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean I did buy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought my gatorade from Amazon,</v>

2728
02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:54.153
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was probably sitting in some hot </v>

2729
02:08:55.481 --> 02:08:57.310
<v Speaker 3>warehouse somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just cooking.</v>

2730
02:08:57.960 --> 02:08:59.320
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it's sealed,</v>

2731
02:08:59.470 --> 02:09:02.050
<v Speaker 3>I wonder like what does that mean when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they seal it,</v>

2732
02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:03.153
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like obviously air's not get into it </v>

2733
02:09:04.721 --> 02:09:06.820
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some air in there.</v>

2734
02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:08.680
<v Speaker 3>What happens to that air?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2735
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:11.110
<v Speaker 3>How's that era effect his shit growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that area?</v>

2736
02:09:11.111 --> 02:09:11.944
<v Speaker 3>Know how much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's chemicals in there to </v>

2737
02:09:14.290 --> 02:09:17.320
<v Speaker 3>make sure that nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they found some 6,000</v>

2738
02:09:17.321 --> 02:09:19.570
<v Speaker 3>year old bottle of wine recently to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2739
02:09:20.290 --> 02:09:22.420

<v Speaker 3>I think absolutely what they found was a</v>

2740
02:09:22.421 --> 02:09:23.254
<v Speaker 3>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old vessel that contained residue </v>

2741
02:09:25.781 --> 02:09:29.020
<v Speaker 3>of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they found like 6,000</v>

2742
02:09:29.021 --> 02:09:32.170
<v Speaker 3>year old bottle that you can just get </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up on.</v>

02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:33.753
<v Speaker 3>Imagine traces of 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old wine discovered in Sicilian </v>

<v Speaker 3>year old pots.</v>

2760
02:10:18.610 --> 02:10:22.600
<v Speaker 3>I want to look at this for a second that</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trips me out that those big vessels</v>

2761
02:10:22.601 --> 02:10:24.010
<v Speaker 3>or 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

2762
02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:26.050
<v Speaker 3>That is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2763
02:10:27.550 --> 02:10:32.550
<v Speaker 3>That is so fucking long ago to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretend what life was like 2000 years</v>

2764
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:34.933
<v Speaker 1>before Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially what you're looking </v>

2765
02:10:36.771 --> 02:10:39.980
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or fourth that yeah,</v>

2766
02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:41.580
<v Speaker 1>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years before Christ.</v>

2767
02:10:41.581 --> 02:10:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 6,000</v>

2768
02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:44.420
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Christ was zero,</v>

2769
02:10:44.421 --> 02:10:47.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's 2017.</v>

2770
02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand years past Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2771
02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:52.333
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say current era bce be enough </v>

2772
02:10:54.751 --> 02:10:58.310
<v Speaker 1>fooling everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know what it is before Jesus.</v>

2773
02:10:58.311 --> 02:11:01.330
<v Speaker 1>You Fuck Keith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you.</v>

2774
02:11:01.390 --> 02:11:02.181
<v Speaker 1>What'd you have it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2775
02:11:02.181 --> 02:11:06.500
<v Speaker 1>just a coincidence that before current </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever era just happens to land.</v>

2776
02:11:06.501 --> 02:11:07.334
<v Speaker 1>Exactly on when Jesus came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up assholes with their bce before </v>

2777
02:11:14.121 --> 02:11:15.770
<v Speaker 1>current era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that even mean?</v>

2778
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we just start it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't.</v>

2779
02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Can we go back and agree with zero is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rewrite history.</v>

2780
02:11:22.130 --> 02:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean we decided that this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2781
02:11:24.930 --> 02:11:27.980
<v Speaker 1>the BC 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC,</v>

2782
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.843
<v Speaker 1>they made the pyramids like what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck does that even mean you're going </v>

2783
02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:35.510
<v Speaker 1>backwards?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 6,000</v>

2784
02:11:35.511 --> 02:11:39.230
<v Speaker 1>BC is actually earlier than 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

2785
02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:42.770
<v Speaker 1>You guys are retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a stupid way of measuring shit.</v>

2786
02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:45.260
<v Speaker 1>How about you go all the way back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make that zero.</v>

2787
02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:50.340
<v Speaker 1>You start from scratch because the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know what year we're in.</v>

2788
02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:54.290
<v Speaker 1>The earth has no idea what year were </v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding it in to do,</v>

2789
02:11:54.291 --> 02:11:58.220
<v Speaker 1>make some arbitrary number and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything before that.</v>

2790
02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Start with a low number and build high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a like a flat line between</v>

2791
02:12:04.191 --> 02:12:07.760
<v Speaker 1>reality and some new dimension or like </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and air.</v>

2792
02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a hot number.</v>

2793
02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:15.440
<v Speaker 4>When Mr Software created zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One's a Christian monk.</v>

2794
02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:18.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked up the other day,</v>

2795
02:12:18.151 --> 02:12:18.984
<v Speaker 4>were alphabetical order came from and </v>
<v Speaker 4>who got to decide why it was that and </v>

2796
02:12:23.851 --> 02:12:26.730
<v Speaker 4>what made a before b or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it was.</v>

2797
02:12:26.731 --> 02:12:28.450
<v Speaker 4>Some scholars back that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2798
02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:30.660
<v Speaker 4>when people couldn't write,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were the only ones that could write</v>

2799
02:12:30.661 --> 02:12:32.370
<v Speaker 4>and read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they made it up,</v>

2800
02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:35.830
<v Speaker 1>you know what the craziest trip is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2801
02:12:36.130 --> 02:12:39.580
<v Speaker 1>when people were writing an ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew,</v>

2802
02:12:39.581 --> 02:12:42.280
<v Speaker 1>they wrote with letters that also meant </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

2803
02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:47.850
<v Speaker 1>like a word also had a numerical value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was no numbers.</v>

2804
02:12:47.851 --> 02:12:51.060
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have like numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a and a's.</v>

2805
02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol also won the bees also too.</v>

2806
02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:57.020
<v Speaker 4>I just thought of that time period and </v>
<v Speaker 4>no one else knew how to read.</v>

2807
02:12:57.021 --> 02:12:59.450
<v Speaker 4>So if you got a letter or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say if you got one.</v>

2808
02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:01.730
<v Speaker 4>Is that true though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have no one knew no one.</v>

2809
02:13:01.731 --> 02:13:03.650
<v Speaker 4>But I would say most people probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't.</v>

2810
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:06.590
<v Speaker 4>You might not think you have to read for</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2811
02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:09.190
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to trust their translation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all is great.</v>

2812
02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Your race and they were making pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could all read amazing.</v>

2813
02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:14.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be right.</v>

2814
02:13:14.761 --> 02:13:15.594
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was the whole Martin Luther </v>

2815
02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:16.980
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2816
02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Lutherism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2817
02:13:18.750 --> 02:13:23.750
<v Speaker 1>He had figured out how to make the Bible</v>
<v Speaker 1>and translated into A.</v>

2818
02:13:23.970 --> 02:13:24.803
<v Speaker 1>I think it was German into phonetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that people could understand </v>

2819
02:13:28.410 --> 02:13:31.830
<v Speaker 1>because before they had to like trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>the priests or learn</v>

2820
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm Lutheran or you really,</v>

2821
02:13:35.970 --> 02:13:38.730
<v Speaker 3>those are the super people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They figured it out,</v>

2822
02:13:38.731 --> 02:13:39.564
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You who were the ones that are </v>

2823

<v Speaker 3>the heat and you just decided to start </v>

<v Speaker 3>out of him because he was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to beat the gay away.</v>

2851
02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much of that going on.</v>

2852
02:15:14.970 --> 02:15:15.803
<v Speaker 3>So much that pray the gay away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this mother accused of having </v>

2853
02:15:19.381 --> 02:15:22.200
<v Speaker 3>Sun beat the gay away could face hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime charges?</v>

2854
02:15:22.230 --> 02:15:24.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at her.</v>

2855

<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2856
02:15:27.690 --> 02:15:30.960
<v Speaker 3>What is she going to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should probably hear her talk.</v>

2857
02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Do you think we could get yanked a </v>
<v Speaker 3>report?</v>

2858
02:15:34.890 --> 02:15:35.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's hear what she has to say about </v>

2859
02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.740
<v Speaker 3>beating the shit out of her son.</v>

2860
02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.190
<v Speaker 9>I.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>

2861
02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:47.780
<v Speaker 9>I think that you was going to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but like I said,</v>

2862
02:15:47.781 --> 02:15:50.330
<v Speaker 9>I reported the water bed and another was</v>
<v Speaker 9>nothing.</v>

2863
02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:51.920
<v Speaker 9>Nothing was done.</v>

2864
02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:54.070
<v Speaker 3>And does it bother you if he does come </v>
<v Speaker 3>out to be gay?</v>

2865
02:15:54.071 --> 02:15:54.904
<v Speaker 3>Does that bother you?</v>

2866
02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:58.410
<v Speaker 9>It bothered me because he's.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's a young age.</v>

2867
02:15:59.250 --> 02:16:04.250
<v Speaker 9>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He do not know right from wrong.</v>

2868
02:16:05.730 --> 02:16:07.140
<v Speaker 9>So yes he do.</v>

2869
02:16:08.050 --> 02:16:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2870
02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:13.033
<v Speaker 3>Is that her mugshot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And right below the one that looks like </v>

2871
02:16:14.641 --> 02:16:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Katt Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like James Brown,</v>

2872
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:19.330
<v Speaker 3>Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get up,</v>

2873
02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:22.170
<v Speaker 3>get up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

2874
02:16:22.350 --> 02:16:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's from Whiteville,</v>

2875
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:26.670
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She lives in Whiteville.</v>

2876
02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:28.320
<v Speaker 3>Simulation theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

2877
02:16:28.321 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina.</v>

2878
02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:34.420
<v Speaker 5>She's currently being charged with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>misdemeanor child abuse.</v>

2879
02:16:34.450 --> 02:16:36.370
<v Speaker 5>That's all you get for beating the </v>
<v Speaker 5>gateway.</v>

2880
02:16:36.430 --> 02:16:39.670
<v Speaker 5>Get misdemeanor child abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's 15 man.</v>

2881
02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:45.260
<v Speaker 5>That's Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God Damn it man.</v>

2882
02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:50.380
<v Speaker 5>So a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>check this out.</v>

2883
02:16:51.540 --> 02:16:52.373
<v Speaker 5>That's even crazier right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hurricane Irma holds about twice the </v>

2884
02:16:55.871 --> 02:17:00.190
<v Speaker 5>destructive energy of all bombs used in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the second world war.</v>

2885
02:17:00.670 --> 02:17:03.460
<v Speaker 5>Just 7 trillion watts of power in it </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

2886
02:17:03.490 --> 02:17:07.600
<v Speaker 5>So why can't we get like some kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>windmill up there?</v>

2887
02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:08.493
<v Speaker 5>He can't collect it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would have to have a big one and </v>

2888
02:17:10.241 --> 02:17:12.310
<v Speaker 5>then it will become the biggest weapon </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

2889
02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:13.333
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why don't we design that instead of the </v>

2890
02:17:14.891 --> 02:17:17.420
<v Speaker 5>galaxy note eight that no one wants to </v>
<v Speaker 5>buy it.</v>

2891
02:17:18.350 --> 02:17:19.183
<v Speaker 5>How about you buy a giant when windmill </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and put it up there and make all </v>

2892
02:17:24.131 --> 02:17:24.600
<v Speaker 5>the power.</v>

2893
02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:27.000
<v Speaker 4>I have some friends that are in Florida </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now and uh,</v>

2894
02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:27.873
<v Speaker 4>the unforeseen problem that being out </v>
<v Speaker 4>here not knowing what to why and what </v>

2895
02:17:31.541 --> 02:17:32.374
<v Speaker 4>people are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're outside of an uncle in Orlando </v>

2896
02:17:33.551 --> 02:17:34.384
<v Speaker 4>who was telling me he's not leaving </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now because the roads are </v>

2897
02:17:36.341 --> 02:17:38.590
<v Speaker 4>gridlocked and the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nowhere to go.</v>

2898
02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:42.040
<v Speaker 4>My friends who left Tampa yesterday got </v>
<v Speaker 4>up at like nine in the morning,</v>

2899
02:17:42.041 --> 02:17:43.960
<v Speaker 4>packed all their shit up and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2900
02:17:43.961 --> 02:17:45.010
<v Speaker 4>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are we going to go?</v>

2901
02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:46.293
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's take side roads because it's </v>

2902
02:17:47.381 --> 02:17:50.460
<v Speaker 4>probably going to be busy everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they did for awhile,</v>

2903
02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:51.453
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four hours of side roads and then </v>

2904
02:17:52.211 --> 02:17:55.690
<v Speaker 4>eventually you're gonna run out of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta go get gas first place.</v>

2905
02:17:55.691 --> 02:17:58.060
<v Speaker 4>They stopped no gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all out.</v>

2906
02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:03.490
<v Speaker 4>So they continue on to the next one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>waiting a gigantic line to fill up.</v>

2907
02:18:03.550 --> 02:18:04.383
<v Speaker 4>But now it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hopefully we can live off of this </v>

2908
02:18:06.731 --> 02:18:09.880
<v Speaker 4>tank of gas for the next lesson until we</v>
<v Speaker 4>get where we're going.</v>

2909
02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:11.253
<v Speaker 4>And everybody has to leave right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the whole state could be </v>

2910
02:18:13.541 --> 02:18:16.470
<v Speaker 4>potentially under 10 feet of water the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole days.</v>

2911
02:18:17.470 --> 02:18:18.303
<v Speaker 4>10 foot storm surge is coming and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>won't make it all the way to the middle </v>

2912
02:18:21.701 --> 02:18:23.560
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it might fucking gigantic.</v>

2913
02:18:23.590 --> 02:18:24.100
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

2914
02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:24.933
<v Speaker 5>Obviously the only positive if there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>any positive thing compared to the last </v>

2915
02:18:28.031 --> 02:18:30.880
<v Speaker 5>hurricane is that it's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>stall over Florida.</v>

2916
02:18:30.881 --> 02:18:33.900
<v Speaker 5>It's going to keep on going and losing </v>
<v Speaker 5>energy the higher it gets.</v>

2917
02:18:33.930 --> 02:18:37.450
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Orlando should be,</v>

2918
02:18:37.810 --> 02:18:40.240
<v Speaker 5>might get really fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's Disneyworld.</v>

2919
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:43.270
<v Speaker 5>Disneyworld might be gone this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2920
02:18:43.271 --> 02:18:44.860
<v Speaker 5>And they just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2921
02:18:44.861 --> 02:18:47.410
<v Speaker 5>they just rebuild it all or all this new</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff too.</v>

2922
02:18:47.411 --> 02:18:48.640
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

2923
02:18:50.030 --> 02:18:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's that.</v>

2924
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:54.050
<v Speaker 4>Ninety percent of this island of Barbuda</v>
<v Speaker 4>is gone,</v>

2925
02:18:54.090 --> 02:18:56.600
<v Speaker 4>gone habitable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>habitable,</v>

2926
02:18:56.650 --> 02:18:58.460
<v Speaker 4>Shawnee daily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though some of the shit too,</v>

2927
02:18:58.490 --> 02:19:00.530
<v Speaker 4>because they can't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all happening last night.</v>

2928
02:19:00.710 --> 02:19:03.560
<v Speaker 4>That can't get over to find out what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get reports of it even.</v>

2929
02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:06.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know if the people are dead,</v>

2930
02:19:06.461 --> 02:19:07.430
<v Speaker 5>they don't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2931
02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:09.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean those islands are so small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2932
02:19:09.251 --> 02:19:11.890
<v Speaker 5>what is this the size of like Texas or </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ohio or something like that?</v>

2933
02:19:11.950 --> 02:19:13.140
<v Speaker 5>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2934
02:19:13.150 --> 02:19:15.610
<v Speaker 5>it's the size of Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The storm is 400 miles across.</v>

2935
02:19:17.450 --> 02:19:22.450
<v Speaker 5>It's how wide is Florida?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Florida's not 400 miles across.</v>

2936
02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:25.120
<v Speaker 5>I don't know exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's probably.</v>

2937
02:19:25.121 --> 02:19:26.550
<v Speaker 5>I would go $300,</v>
<v Speaker 5>$200,</v>

2938
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 5>so it's going to be</v>

2939
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:32.390
<v Speaker 3>like a giant eraser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just rolls up Florida</v>

2940
02:19:33.170 --> 02:19:35.710
<v Speaker 2>and they're still not sure it could turn</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2941
02:19:35.810 --> 02:19:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Things can always turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could go back and turn left and go to</v>

2942
02:19:38.691 --> 02:19:39.524
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

2943
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:44.490
<v Speaker 3>Grossest people that have ever lived </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking for the people that go,</v>

2944
02:19:45.210 --> 02:19:48.450
<v Speaker 3>they miss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stay and they survive and the storm</v>

2945
02:19:48.451 --> 02:19:50.790
<v Speaker 3>miraculously turns now like I fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew it.</v>

2946
02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:52.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't.</v>

2947
02:19:52.081 --> 02:19:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't know it.</v>

2948
02:19:53.941 --> 02:19:55.920
<v Speaker 3>You're no better than the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>get killed by it.</v>

2949
02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:56.940
<v Speaker 3>You just got lucky.</v>

2950
02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:59.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of people in Houston.</v>

2951
02:19:59.761 --> 02:20:01.770
<v Speaker 2>That's how they feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can make it a party.</v>

2952
02:20:01.870 --> 02:20:05.130
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have hurricane parties and this one</v>

2953
02:20:05.131 --> 02:20:08.400
<v Speaker 2>really caught him off guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know catch them off guard?</v>

2954
02:20:08.401 --> 02:20:11.310
<v Speaker 2>They saw it coming from days away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2955
02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:14.030
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they in their heads think,</v>

2956
02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:15.660
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fine.</v>

2957

<v Speaker 2>there was an episode I was on,</v>

2965
02:20:33.141 --> 02:20:34.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was the last time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was on or whatever,</v>

2966
02:20:34.761 --> 02:20:38.240
<v Speaker 2>but we were talking about floods in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Houston and I showed you that,</v>

2967
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:39.103
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2968
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:42.890
<v Speaker 2>that concrete or concrete pavement that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks up water.</v>

2969
02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:44.313
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that would have been any </v>
<v Speaker 2>help if they had implemented that like </v>

2970
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.970
<v Speaker 2>all over the place.</v>

2971
02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:51.513
<v Speaker 3>Maybe because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think the amount of water that </v>

2972
02:20:54.551 --> 02:20:56.680
<v Speaker 3>we're dealing with just so </v>
<v Speaker 3>unprecedented.</v>

2973
02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:59.890
<v Speaker 3>They showed the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Harvey.</v>

2974
02:20:59.891 --> 02:21:02.290
<v Speaker 3>Like the sheer amount of volume of </v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

2975
02:21:02.530 --> 02:21:06.610
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this was such a big,</v>

2976
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:09.100
<v Speaker 3>big hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just.</v>

2977
02:21:10.470 --> 02:21:11.303
<v Speaker 3>I wish there was a definitive answer as </v>
<v Speaker 3>to if all this is a direct result of </v>

2978
02:21:17.381 --> 02:21:21.430
<v Speaker 3>like human behavior industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>car exhaust.</v>

2979
02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:24.400
<v Speaker 3>I wished it was a definitive result </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you could see it like,</v>

2980
02:21:24.401 --> 02:21:27.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the number that you can show.</v>

2981
02:21:27.580 --> 02:21:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Will you show me here that concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2982
02:21:29.771 --> 02:21:33.070
<v Speaker 3>the water drinking concrete where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>as I do that,</v>

2983
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:35.383
<v Speaker 3>it's mad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy absorbed runoff from fast floods </v>

2984
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:41.060
<v Speaker 3>if you're watching it folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that are just listening to it</v>

2985
02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:41.913
<v Speaker 3>doesn't even seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they have this giant water </v>

2986
02:21:43.241 --> 02:21:44.074
<v Speaker 3>truck and it's fucking pouring water all</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the concrete and it's just </v>

2987
02:21:47.921 --> 02:21:51.130
<v Speaker 3>dissipating almost instantaneously into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the concrete.</v>

2988
02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:52.660
<v Speaker 3>It's super weird.</v>

2989
02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:53.593
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it has like a basement and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it does is it goes through like </v>

2990
02:21:56.151 --> 02:21:58.730
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a concrete filter it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes underneath.</v>

2991
02:21:58.731 --> 02:22:00.820
<v Speaker 2>So the actual water is just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath.</v>

2992
02:22:01.050 --> 02:22:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck does.</v>

2993
02:22:02.911 --> 02:22:03.744
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a scene in the terminator </v>

2994
02:22:05.770 --> 02:22:07.350
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2995
02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:10.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well either way,</v>

2996
02:22:10.051 --> 02:22:12.840
<v Speaker 3>like what they dealt with in Houston is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much water.</v>

2997
02:22:12.841 --> 02:22:14.130
<v Speaker 3>I just doubt that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2998
02:22:14.131 --> 02:22:14.964
<v Speaker 3>maybe that would have helped a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that they're dealing with </v>

2999
02:22:17.251 --> 02:22:20.340
<v Speaker 3>just some insane amount of water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that it shows what it is,</v>

3000
02:22:20.341 --> 02:22:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like some sort of filtration system</v>

3001
02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:24.593
<v Speaker 3>so it allows the water to go through it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it can tell you that for us it was </v>

3002
02:22:28.381 --> 02:22:30.330
<v Speaker 3>probably too much water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3003
02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:31.253
<v Speaker 3>That harvey was a monster hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crazy thing is how much bigger Irma </v>

3004
02:22:35.131 --> 02:22:37.440
<v Speaker 3>is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're numb to it.</v>

3005
02:22:37.530 --> 02:22:40.230
<v Speaker 3>I think we look at it and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sense to us.</v>

3006
02:22:40.270 --> 02:22:41.103
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 185 miles sustained winds for over a </v>

3007
02:22:44.431 --> 02:22:45.330
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3008
02:22:45.340 --> 02:22:46.173
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3009
02:22:46.290 --> 02:22:47.123
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just going to start rolling like a </v>

3010
02:22:49.410 --> 02:22:51.740
<v Speaker 5>cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3011
02:22:52.900 --> 02:22:53.920
<v Speaker 5>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3012
02:22:54.010 --> 02:22:56.430
<v Speaker 5>Is this the strongest they can get?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No thing.</v>

3013
02:22:56.431 --> 02:22:59.910
<v Speaker 5>It's stronger than the category that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they attract.</v>

3014
02:22:59.950 --> 02:23:00.783
<v Speaker 5>This was the highest stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gone and now this one is the new bar to </v>

3015
02:23:03.041 --> 02:23:03.874
<v Speaker 5>be basically a delta airline </v>
<v Speaker 5>accidentally flew through it yesterday </v>

3016
02:23:08.591 --> 02:23:11.290
<v Speaker 5>by mistake and it got out at the last </v>
<v Speaker 5>minute.</v>

3017
02:23:11.950 --> 02:23:14.320
<v Speaker 5>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read that this morning when I woke up.</v>

3018
02:23:14.590 --> 02:23:15.401
<v Speaker 5>Got Out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3019
02:23:15.401 --> 02:23:16.234
<v Speaker 5>I guess it accidentally was flew into it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was in somehow it got out of the </v>

3020
02:23:19.810 --> 02:23:22.210
<v Speaker 5>hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is the pilot piloted his way out?</v>

3021
02:23:22.211 --> 02:23:22.471
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3022
02:23:22.471 --> 02:23:22.810
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3023
02:23:22.810 --> 02:23:23.531
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought you meant it.</v>

3024
02:23:23.531 --> 02:23:27.970
<v Speaker 5>Got Out the pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did delta pilot flew through Irma,</v>

3025
02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:30.570
<v Speaker 5>one of those powerful hurricanes </v>
<v Speaker 5>recording all 170,000</v>

3026
02:23:30.571 --> 02:23:32.410
<v Speaker 5>factories are safe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would they do that?</v>

3027
02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:33.293
<v Speaker 5>A No</v>

3028
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:35.570
<v Speaker 3>on the fly to Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3029
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:37.330
<v Speaker 3>they had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to fly through it.</v>

3030
02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Did they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they fucking judge it wrong?</v>

3031
02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:44.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went through 185,000</v>

3032
02:23:44.650 --> 02:23:47.530
<v Speaker 3>mile an hour winds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He imagined that turbulence.</v>

3033
02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:51.130
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 187 miles an hour.</v>

3034
02:23:51.131 --> 02:23:51.964
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3035
02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing is giant man.</v>

3036
02:23:54.490 --> 02:23:56.070
<v Speaker 3>When you see it on the ground or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3037
02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:58.450
<v Speaker 3>in one of those overhead maps and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize how big it is.</v>

3038
02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so crazy.</v>

3039
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:06.510
<v Speaker 3>So they flew through part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it show trying to figure it out.</v>

3040
02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:08.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3041
02:24:08.890 --> 02:24:09.723
<v Speaker 3>it's going right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty five mile an hour winds gusting </v>

3042
02:24:12.941 --> 02:24:13.870
<v Speaker 3>for 40.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3043
02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:14.870
<v Speaker 3>look at it.</v>

3044
02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:19.430
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

3045
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.903
<v Speaker 10>Hmm.</v>

3046
02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:23.180
<v Speaker 5>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they were,</v>

3047
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:27.610
<v Speaker 5>they were following realtime,</v>
<v Speaker 5>falling on a flight tracker.</v>

3048
02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:29.900
<v Speaker 5>Got Stuck in the actual.</v>

3049
02:24:30.730 --> 02:24:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flew through the hurricane.</v>

3050
02:24:33.450 --> 02:24:36.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is insane.</v>

3051
02:24:37.220 --> 02:24:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They landed.</v>

3052
02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:38.953
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty two minutes on the ground in San </v>

3053
02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:42.330
<v Speaker 3>Juan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They landed and turned around.</v>

3054
02:24:43.650 --> 02:24:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tried to make it back out of sin.</v>

3055
02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:48.173
<v Speaker 3>This is the airport has to climb out sj </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and they're doing so between the </v>

3056
02:24:50.401 --> 02:24:52.470
<v Speaker 3>outer band of Irma and the core of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>storm.</v>

3057
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:54.090
<v Speaker 3>They went in between the bands.</v>

3058
02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:58.440
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need needs to be hugged by everybody.</v>

3059
02:24:59.010 --> 02:25:00.150
<v Speaker 5>So he went in between</v>

3060
02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:02.510
<v Speaker 3>bands and in doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3061
02:25:02.511 --> 02:25:04.640
<v Speaker 3>That's the most incredible thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>weather satellites.</v>

3062
02:25:04.641 --> 02:25:05.474
<v Speaker 3>They can literally navigate this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>through those bands and tell them like </v>

3063
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:10.960
<v Speaker 3>where the storm is ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3064
02:25:10.970 --> 02:25:11.803
<v Speaker 3>They haven't</v>

3065
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:12.663
<v Speaker 5>a portable dopplers here now in Los </v>
<v Speaker 5>Angeles to the where it's so accurate </v>

3066
02:25:16.041 --> 02:25:19.840
<v Speaker 5>now that you can just see your street </v>
<v Speaker 5>level of law,</v>

3067
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:23.970
<v Speaker 5>like if there's a clouded in from above,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look</v>

3068
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:24.813
<v Speaker 1>at this while it looks terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delta maintains that their pilots had </v>

3069
02:25:27.521 --> 02:25:28.354
<v Speaker 1>everything under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our meteorology team is the best in the </v>

3070
02:25:31.481 --> 02:25:33.190
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric's Snell,</v>

3071
02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:35.940
<v Speaker 1>vice president for Delta operations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>customer centered,</v>

3072
02:25:35.941 --> 02:25:38.650
<v Speaker 1>told The Washington Post dl three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3073
02:25:38.651 --> 02:25:39.484
<v Speaker 1>two departed San Juan with 173 </v>
<v Speaker 1>passengers on board according to Delta </v>

3074
02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

3075
02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:48.230
<v Speaker 3>Pr for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

3076
02:25:48.290 --> 02:25:51.200
<v Speaker 3>being on that airplane probably was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst flight you'll ever have.</v>

3077
02:25:51.201 --> 02:25:52.034
<v Speaker 3>Any really take a hard look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weather data and the track of the storm </v>

3078
02:25:55.221 --> 02:25:56.054
<v Speaker 3>and work with the flight crew and </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispatcher to agree it was safe to </v>

3079
02:26:00.141 --> 02:26:02.510
<v Speaker 3>operate the flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you do?</v>

3080
02:26:02.511 --> 02:26:03.344
<v Speaker 3>If you're about to get on that plane and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're telling you what they're going </v>

3081
02:26:04.801 --> 02:26:06.110
<v Speaker 3>to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

3082
02:26:06.170 --> 02:26:07.003
<v Speaker 3>All over myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably say I'll stay at the airport </v>

3083
02:26:09.941 --> 02:26:11.580
<v Speaker 3>and risk it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3084
02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:13.580
<v Speaker 3>fuck this man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sleep.</v>

3085
02:26:14.100 --> 02:26:15.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take my backpack.</v>

3086
02:26:15.951 --> 02:26:16.784
<v Speaker 3>I'm sleeping on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assumed that you guys turn this thing </v>

3087
02:26:19.611 --> 02:26:20.444
<v Speaker 3>into some sort of a hurricane shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been to the airport in Puerto </v>

3088
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:23.421
<v Speaker 3>Rico?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3089
02:26:23.421 --> 02:26:24.254
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been to the San Juan one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was at s one on the other side of </v>

3090
02:26:26.331 --> 02:26:27.670
<v Speaker 3>the island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's made of cardboard.</v>

3091
02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:29.620
<v Speaker 3>Not One of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

3092
02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:32.710
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting the plane.</v>

3093
02:26:32.711 --> 02:26:34.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like a rundown Burbank airport,</v>

3094
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:37.450
<v Speaker 1>but they got away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico didn't get totally hit.</v>

3095
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:39.940
<v Speaker 1>They only got like a little piece of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3096
02:26:40.210 --> 02:26:41.043
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing about these kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of storms so you could just get unlucky </v>

3097
02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:44.913
<v Speaker 1>and it just runs right over your spot or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be right next to that and go </v>

3098
02:26:48.581 --> 02:26:50.770
<v Speaker 1>lord was looking out for us like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3099
02:26:50.830 --> 02:26:53.140
<v Speaker 1>you sure are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't get lucky.</v>

3100
02:26:53.650 --> 02:26:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Like we're dealing with impossible </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>

3101
02:26:57.310 --> 02:27:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Like a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The size of Ohio is an impossible for us</v>

3102
02:27:01.751 --> 02:27:02.584
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we really understand what </v>

3103
02:27:05.291 --> 02:27:06.124
<v Speaker 1>the fuck that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of those things that </v>

3104
02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:09.210
<v Speaker 1>when someone says a trillion billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

3105
02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:10.240
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot,</v>

3106
02:27:10.410 --> 02:27:12.040
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3107
02:27:12.041 --> 02:27:12.874
<v Speaker 1>you don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really understand what that means </v>

3108
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:17.380
<v Speaker 1>because too much the size of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe too much.</v>

3109
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:20.300
<v Speaker 1>The power that that thing has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just too much.</v>

3110
02:27:20.301 --> 02:27:22.600
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to see it.</v>

3111
02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:23.560
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be there.</v>

3112
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's real either,</v>

3113
02:27:27.290 --> 02:27:28.123
<v Speaker 3>but the video of A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was today's </v>

3114
02:27:30.051 --> 02:27:33.200
<v Speaker 3>hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's trying to hold his truck,</v>

3115
02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:34.333
<v Speaker 3>like he had like a pickup truck trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hold it so it doesn't tip over and </v>

3116
02:27:38.570 --> 02:27:39.403
<v Speaker 3>the winds were so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just gets squished by hard to see </v>

3117
02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:44.600
<v Speaker 3>because it was raining so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's got to be crazy.</v>

3118
02:27:44.601 --> 02:27:45.434
<v Speaker 3>Why would he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A truck is about to flip and you think </v>

3119
02:27:48.531 --> 02:27:51.170
<v Speaker 3>you've got to stop it with your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He watched too many movies.</v>

3120
02:27:51.171 --> 02:27:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker can pick up a truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you pick up a truck?</v>

3121
02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:56.570
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then get the fuck out of there.</v>

3122
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Put this on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can watch it.</v>

3123
02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:00.410
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3124
02:28:00.411 --> 02:28:01.820
<v Speaker 3>this is the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

3125
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a wrap.</v>

3126
02:28:04.650 --> 02:28:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3127
02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:08.190
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's crazy.</v>

3128
02:28:08.610 --> 02:28:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking in the breeze.</v>

3129
02:28:10.861 --> 02:28:12.420
<v Speaker 1>You should've got outta there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3130
02:28:14.190 --> 02:28:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Just sandwiched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3131
02:28:15.541 --> 02:28:17.130
<v Speaker 1>He got crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't handle it.</v>

3132
02:28:17.131 --> 02:28:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you can't get out from under that.</v>

3133
02:28:19.411 --> 02:28:20.730
<v Speaker 1>That's too much weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dead.</v>

3134
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

3135
02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:26.590
<v Speaker 3>It says fast ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get me like that guy.</v>

3136
02:28:26.591 --> 02:28:29.280
<v Speaker 3>I probably just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well my trucks and about boom,</v>

3137
02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:30.471
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3138
02:28:30.471 --> 02:28:31.304
<v Speaker 3>the thing about these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurricanes are how many of them can you </v>

3139
02:28:34.401 --> 02:28:39.120
<v Speaker 3>get in a row because if they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two more in a row behind Irma,</v>

3140
02:28:40.850 --> 02:28:45.770
<v Speaker 3>2005,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was they got hit for like for</v>

3141
02:28:45.771 --> 02:28:46.604
<v Speaker 3>Florida got hit like four times in a row</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like do you have a decent every </v>

3142
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:51.340
<v Speaker 3>week?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were like twos and threes.</v>

3143
02:28:51.341 --> 02:28:56.270
<v Speaker 3>These are fives and you know Jose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jose is going right for Washington DC.</v>

3144
02:28:57.310 --> 02:29:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Hurricane Jose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jose is going gonna be a big one.</v>

3145
02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Do you think so we're going to do or </v>
<v Speaker 3>what have you been hit?</v>

3146
02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:06.260
<v Speaker 3>United States I'm worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all man.</v>

3147
02:29:06.261 --> 02:29:08.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about asteroids.</v>

3148
02:29:08.661 --> 02:29:09.494
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about super volcanoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're dealing with a small amount of </v>

3149
02:29:13.701 --> 02:29:14.030
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

3150
02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:14.863
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean especially when it comes to </v>

3151
02:29:16.341 --> 02:29:18.590
<v Speaker 3>whether or history or the weather's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3152
02:29:18.690 --> 02:29:20.460
<v Speaker 3>Couple hundred years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's,</v>

3153
02:29:20.490 --> 02:29:23.000
<v Speaker 3>what's our recorded history of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weather.</v>

3154
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:27.710
<v Speaker 3>But if you had to guess what's our </v>
<v Speaker 3>recorded history of the weather?</v>

3155
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:29.900
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>78.</v>

3156
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:32.660
<v Speaker 3>That sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying something like that.</v>

3157
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:34.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying somewhere around like 200 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

3158
02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.740
<v Speaker 3>They started figuring it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

3159
02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight stuffed down around Columbus where</v>

3160
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:44.270
<v Speaker 3>they said 300 years and eight slash 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 16.</v>

3161
02:29:44.470 --> 02:29:45.303
<v Speaker 3>I wonder when that can measure though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when they knew they knew when they </v>

3162
02:29:47.301 --> 02:29:48.380
<v Speaker 3>were cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fuck,</v>

3163
02:29:48.381 --> 02:29:50.990
<v Speaker 3>it's cold out one the one they knew what</v>
<v Speaker 3>that meant though.</v>

3164
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.943
<v Speaker 3>Like if there was a number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess we needed tools also to track </v>

3165
02:29:54.231 --> 02:29:55.064
<v Speaker 3>that rafter I've now seen in the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes way more sense what I just </v>

3166
02:29:57.171 --> 02:29:58.070
<v Speaker 3>found.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3167
02:29:58.650 --> 02:30:01.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the invention of the thermometer.</v>

3168
02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:03.510
<v Speaker 3>When was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3169
02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll look that up too.</v>

3170
02:30:05.090 --> 02:30:07.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm a guest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventeen 55.</v>

3171
02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:10.850
<v Speaker 3>That's good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say eight.</v>

3172
02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:12.110
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12,</v>

3173
02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:13.033
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12.</v>

3174
02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:16.370
<v Speaker 3>You're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably more a more recent than we</v>

3175
02:30:16.371 --> 02:30:20.150
<v Speaker 3>think of mercury on the Fahrenheit </v>
<v Speaker 3>scale.</v>

3176
02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:23.390
<v Speaker 3>17 and 24.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the first recorded temperature,</v>

3177
02:30:23.391 --> 02:30:28.300
<v Speaker 3>it says here was 1880.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

3178
02:30:28.420 --> 02:30:29.690
<v Speaker 3>In 78.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was two years off.</v>

3179
02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:32.600
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She probably had to have something,</v>

3180
02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:33.493
<v Speaker 3>touch it back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Touch the mercury and how they figured </v>

3181
02:30:35.961 --> 02:30:36.651
<v Speaker 3>out what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3182
02:30:36.651 --> 02:30:39.110
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't even agree on the metric system</v>

3183
02:30:39.140 --> 02:30:39.973
<v Speaker 3>versus inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting there then if that </v>

3184
02:30:41.391 --> 02:30:45.110
<v Speaker 3>was the first time they get ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually calculate the degrees.</v>

3185
02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Did they have measurement for degrees </v>
<v Speaker 3>before that?</v>

3186
02:30:48.951 --> 02:30:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Did they have like temperature </v>
<v Speaker 3>measurements before that?</v>

3187
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:53.023
<v Speaker 3>Like what did they use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when they were talking about like </v>

3188
02:30:54.810 --> 02:30:56.870
<v Speaker 3>how hot is a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what did they use?</v>

3189
02:30:58.190 --> 02:31:03.190
<v Speaker 3>They have no idea how they touched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's super hot.</v>

3190
02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh that ice is cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like did they have any idea?</v>

3191
02:31:06.261 --> 02:31:08.810
<v Speaker 3>Like did they even describe it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>measurement and eight.</v>

3192
02:31:08.910 --> 02:31:13.760
<v Speaker 3>The clinical thermometer wasn't invented</v>
<v Speaker 3>until 18.</v>

3193
02:31:13.820 --> 02:31:15.440
<v Speaker 3>80 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>66.</v>

3194
02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:18.050
<v Speaker 3>It was probably some dude with a regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>thermometer just stuck it up his ass.</v>

3195
02:31:18.350 --> 02:31:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Somebody caught him and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably just making sure that this</v>

3196
02:31:21.031 --> 02:31:21.864
<v Speaker 3>thing works on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said five minutes instead of 20 </v>

3197
02:31:24.270 --> 02:31:27.270
<v Speaker 3>because it was up his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heated it up.</v>

3198
02:31:28.650 --> 02:31:29.483
<v Speaker 3>That's a 99.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started in 1999 is when the </v>

3199
02:31:32.701 --> 02:31:36.180
<v Speaker 3>forehead thermometer came out and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>1999.</v>

3200
02:31:36.210 --> 02:31:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

3201
02:31:38.190 --> 02:31:40.560
<v Speaker 3>I like this first temporal artery </v>
<v Speaker 3>thermometer.</v>

3202
02:31:40.650 --> 02:31:41.483
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 99.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one you put it on your </v>

3203
02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:43.910
<v Speaker 3>forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3204
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:45.900
<v Speaker 3>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just happened.</v>

3205
02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:48.210
<v Speaker 3>The crazy thing is</v>

3206
02:31:48.210 --> 02:31:51.990
<v Speaker 1>the idea that before the thermometer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really have a number.</v>

3207
02:31:52.290 --> 02:31:54.450
<v Speaker 1>When they were talking about things </v>
<v Speaker 1>being cold or hot,</v>

3208
02:31:55.320 --> 02:31:56.153
<v Speaker 1>like did they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did they invent units of </v>

3209
02:31:58.981 --> 02:32:02.310
<v Speaker 1>measurement for temperature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was that invented?</v>

3210
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.943
<v Speaker 1>Right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously there's more than one </v>

3211
02:32:05.250 --> 02:32:06.083
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celsius and there's Fahrenheit and </v>

3212
02:32:08.430 --> 02:32:09.263
<v Speaker 1>Celsius is the one that's based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>metric system that's used by almost </v>

3213
02:32:11.701 --> 02:32:15.450
<v Speaker 1>everybody except for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fucking assholes,</v>

3214
02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:17.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

3215
02:32:17.430 --> 02:32:18.450
<v Speaker 1>they'll say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3216
02:32:18.451 --> 02:32:19.710
<v Speaker 1>it's 35 degrees out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

3217
02:32:19.711 --> 02:32:21.060
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not hot.</v>

3218
02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:22.171
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3219
02:32:22.171 --> 02:32:24.430
<v Speaker 1>your Celsius is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that like 80</v>

3220
02:32:25.600 --> 02:32:27.320
<v Speaker 3>and 35 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hot as fuck.</v>

3221
02:32:27.321 --> 02:32:28.154
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be cool if we all had the same </v>

3222
02:32:28.971 --> 02:32:30.800
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like currency also.</v>

3223
02:32:30.980 --> 02:32:32.940
<v Speaker 3>It just costs more in different places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

3224
02:32:32.941 --> 02:32:33.774
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we just make everything </v>

3225
02:32:34.701 --> 02:32:35.534
<v Speaker 3>easier?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm everything because everybody's </v>

3226
02:32:36.951 --> 02:32:37.784
<v Speaker 3>corrupt and if we were all together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone would fuck us up and we would </v>

3227
02:32:42.411 --> 02:32:45.350
<v Speaker 3>lose all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone would siphon all the money up.</v>

3228
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:46.583
<v Speaker 3>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would weasel their way through the </v>

3229
02:32:47.481 --> 02:32:50.330
<v Speaker 3>whole batch of it if we have a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different factions,</v>

3230
02:32:50.470 --> 02:32:53.340
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's sort of keeps peace.</v>

3231
02:32:53.341 --> 02:32:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and know like super wizard,</v>

3232
02:32:56.770 --> 02:32:57.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a despicable me character comes along </v>

3233
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:02.583
<v Speaker 1>and hijacks the entire system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest recorded system of weights </v>

3234
02:33:05.441 --> 02:33:07.840
<v Speaker 1>and measurements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say about temperature?</v>

3235
02:33:08.290 --> 02:33:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean Ted temperature take awhile.</v>

3236
02:33:10.170 --> 02:33:11.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But history of measurement is not what </v>

3237
02:33:11.641 --> 02:33:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking because I know that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>had scales for a long time,</v>

3238
02:33:14.711 --> 02:33:19.711
<v Speaker 1>but like what about when was the unit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>measurement for temperature invented?</v>

3239
02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Got Length,</v>
<v Speaker 3>typographical math time.</v>

3240
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:24.743
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't say temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well somebody had been like not have it </v>

3241
02:33:28.861 --> 02:33:32.130
<v Speaker 3>and then they had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be a day.</v>

3242
02:33:32.170 --> 02:33:33.003
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it probably would have started like </v>

3243
02:33:34.890 --> 02:33:37.590
<v Speaker 3>this is the temperature of red dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>raven or something like that.</v>

3244
02:33:37.591 --> 02:33:41.250
<v Speaker 3>And this is a snake in 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>59.</v>

3245
02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>England temperature.</v>

3246
02:33:43.730 --> 02:33:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did they use to measure it?</v>

3247
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:49.880
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did they use to measure it</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they didn't have thermometers?</v>

3248
02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.460
<v Speaker 3>God Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Freaky,</v>

3249
02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:54.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3250
02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:57.530
<v Speaker 3>imagine not having a thermometer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to measure the heat.</v>

3251
02:33:58.260 --> 02:33:59.093
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like your inner dialogue of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>at night at three in the morning I got </v>

3252
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:05.380
<v Speaker 3>fucking problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3253
02:34:05.450 --> 02:34:06.283
<v Speaker 3>Especially if I smoke a joint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy how normal life can seem and </v>

3254
02:34:09.441 --> 02:34:10.550
<v Speaker 3>then you smoke a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3255
02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:12.420
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not normal at all.</v>

3256
02:34:12.421 --> 02:34:17.421
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A hundred percent life seems so normal.</v>

3257
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:19.300
<v Speaker 3>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3258
02:34:19.301 --> 02:34:20.170
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up neighbor?</v>

3259
02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:21.033
<v Speaker 3>How's everybody doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you smoke a joint and just </v>

3260
02:34:22.931 --> 02:34:23.764
<v Speaker 3>watch a little bit of news about aroma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about any of these things are more </v>

3261
02:34:28.930 --> 02:34:29.980
<v Speaker 3>freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other night,</v>

3262
02:34:29.981 --> 02:34:31.750
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made one of them 2:00</v>

3263
02:34:31.751 --> 02:34:32.584
<v Speaker 3>in the morning instagram posts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just going online and looking at </v>

3264
02:34:35.651 --> 02:34:36.640
<v Speaker 3>storm footage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3265
02:34:36.641 --> 02:34:39.910
<v Speaker 3>what are these?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just keep hitting over and over and over</v>

3266
02:34:39.911 --> 02:34:40.930
<v Speaker 3>and over and over.</v>

3267
02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:42.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched a documentary about our coral </v>

3268
02:34:43.690 --> 02:34:44.523
<v Speaker 2>and our oceans dying recently and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaked me the fuck out and it's all </v>

3269
02:34:47.641 --> 02:34:49.940
<v Speaker 2>based on like two degrees of temperature</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3270
02:34:49.950 --> 02:34:50.783
<v Speaker 2>that it's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the oceans are two degrees hotter </v>

3271
02:34:52.690 --> 02:34:53.640
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

3272
02:34:53.700 --> 02:34:57.420
<v Speaker 2>there's like 8 billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we just all throw ice into the ocean</v>

3273
02:34:57.421 --> 02:34:58.590
<v Speaker 2>at the same time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would probably.</v>

3274
02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:01.610
<v Speaker 2>It thought that through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said that last night it was a job.</v>

3275
02:35:01.650 --> 02:35:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Somebody,</v>

3276
02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:05.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we could do though for real is um,</v>

3277
02:35:05.850 --> 02:35:10.850
<v Speaker 3>apparently wearing sunscreen and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>water is fucking terrible for coral and,</v>

3278
02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:13.560
<v Speaker 3>and people don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3279
02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:15.300
<v Speaker 3>it's like an oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never thought about that.</v>

3280
02:35:15.570 --> 02:35:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Chemical Sunscreen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that stuff is,</v>

3281
02:35:19.310 --> 02:35:20.150
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

3282
02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:21.193
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the face beats scrubs that we </v>

3283
02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:24.920
<v Speaker 2>can't destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3284
02:35:25.170 --> 02:35:26.001
<v Speaker 3>There's a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3285
02:35:26.001 --> 02:35:28.340
<v Speaker 3>those things it get stuck in your drain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3286
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:32.450
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff that they use for sunscreen,</v>

3287
02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:37.520
<v Speaker 3>like how good is that for your skin to </v>
<v Speaker 3>spray that chemical on there?</v>

3288
02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:38.473
<v Speaker 3>I never use sunscreen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to use it because of my vitol I </v>

3289
02:35:41.211 --> 02:35:44.030
<v Speaker 3>go because of the different colors in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>

3290
02:35:44.060 --> 02:35:44.893
<v Speaker 3>Like if otherwise it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you're a white guy that a </v>

3291
02:35:47.251 --> 02:35:50.070
<v Speaker 3>logo is not nearly as obvious as if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a black guy,</v>

3292
02:35:50.100 --> 02:35:51.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black people have it.</v>

3293
02:35:51.291 --> 02:35:52.124
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Contrast and if I don't do it also like </v>

3294
02:35:55.580 --> 02:35:59.060
<v Speaker 3>I wore this pigment in those areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if I don't have pigment like where my</v>

3295
02:35:59.061 --> 02:36:01.370
<v Speaker 3>fingers are like and that shit gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>

3296
02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:04.760
<v Speaker 3>you don't have anything that's blocking </v>
<v Speaker 3>skin cancer.</v>

3297
02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:09.830
<v Speaker 2>So we're like backwards dice gloves to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson gloves.</v>

3298
02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:14.270
<v Speaker 2>The conclusion from the media is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunscreen is killing the world's coral.</v>

3299
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:15.543
<v Speaker 2>That's laughable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it says right here that 10 percent </v>

3300
02:36:17.871 --> 02:36:18.704
<v Speaker 2>of the global reefs are at at least only</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 percent and many of them are remote </v>

3301
02:36:22.761 --> 02:36:24.950
<v Speaker 2>and without tourists that even getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>near them.</v>

3302
02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:28.490
<v Speaker 2>And that study was done with artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>seawater.</v>

3303
02:36:28.850 --> 02:36:32.090
<v Speaker 2>So that study is bullshit maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was also a mashable.</v>

3304
02:36:32.091 --> 02:36:32.924
<v Speaker 2>So man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read stuff like that and the Eddie </v>

3305
02:36:35.271 --> 02:36:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones comes out,</v>

3306
02:36:36.711 --> 02:36:37.544
<v Speaker 2>me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is paying for that article </v>

3307

<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

3325
02:37:27.170 --> 02:37:30.710

<v Speaker 3>like a mental issue and then took a drug</v>

3331
02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:52.550
<v Speaker 3>and then had that episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3332
02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:53.713
<v Speaker 3>people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're reality's already slippery for </v>

3333
02:37:55.641 --> 02:37:56.474
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like really strong psychedelics not </v>

3334
02:37:58.431 --> 02:37:59.700
<v Speaker 3>recommended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3335
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:02.060

<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3336
02:38:02.090 --> 02:38:04.910

<v Speaker 3>of you.</v>

3337
02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:05.773
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had been that fucked where I could </v>

3338
02:38:07.090 --> 02:38:09.620
<v Speaker 3>have thought that I was running into ice</v>
<v Speaker 3>cream or something.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3340
02:38:10.701 --> 02:38:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem with psychedelics.</v>

3341
02:38:12.570 --> 02:38:15.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also the problem with a look.</v>

3342
02:38:16.130 --> 02:38:20.170
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's reactions to these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to be like elite,</v>

3343
02:38:20.210 --> 02:38:21.410
<v Speaker 3>slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3344
02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:22.573
<v Speaker 3>And some people just aren't designed for</v>
<v Speaker 3>them for maybe one style of </v>

3345
02:38:25.911 --> 02:38:26.744
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like some people aren't designed </v>

3346
02:38:27.501 --> 02:38:28.334
<v Speaker 3>for alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people did just dish it and drink </v>

3347
02:38:30.410 --> 02:38:33.710
<v Speaker 3>doesn't work with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what happened,</v>

3348
02:38:33.711 --> 02:38:34.760
<v Speaker 3>but that's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

3349
02:38:34.761 --> 02:38:35.594
<v Speaker 3>Imagined being there and watching that </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid running into the fire and just be </v>

3350
02:38:38.571 --> 02:38:39.950
<v Speaker 3>thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this real?</v>

3351
02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:43.600
<v Speaker 3>Is it really running into the fire?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're all fucked up anyway.</v>

3352
02:38:43.810 --> 02:38:45.650
<v Speaker 3>You're not sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not.</v>

3353
02:38:45.651 --> 02:38:46.484
<v Speaker 3>Even if you were sober,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably feel like you were on </v>

3354
02:38:48.111 --> 02:38:48.944
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're around all these people that are </v>

3355
02:38:50.061 --> 02:38:50.894
<v Speaker 3>tripping balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're watching this thing burst into </v>

3356
02:38:52.971 --> 02:38:54.830
<v Speaker 3>fire and then you watch a guy run into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fire.</v>

3357
02:38:54.831 --> 02:38:55.910
<v Speaker 3>You're probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

3358
02:38:56.570 --> 02:38:57.530
<v Speaker 3>Is this a movie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3359
02:38:57.531 --> 02:38:58.364
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever there's like an extraordinary </v>

3360
02:39:02.061 --> 02:39:03.920
<v Speaker 3>event like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always feel like it's not real.</v>

3361
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3362
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:08.400
<v Speaker 3>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't expect this guy to run into</v>

3363
02:39:08.401 --> 02:39:09.980
<v Speaker 3>the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see someone running the fire.</v>

3364
02:39:09.981 --> 02:39:13.490
<v Speaker 3>Did he run into the fire?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like your brain is scrambling so hard to</v>

3365
02:39:13.491 --> 02:39:15.710
<v Speaker 3>process it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they say that.</v>

3366
02:39:15.711 --> 02:39:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3367
02:39:17.070 --> 02:39:18.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3368
02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:21.440
<v Speaker 3>when they see something fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened through eyewitness accounts are</v>

3369
02:39:21.441 --> 02:39:22.274
<v Speaker 3>so bad because so many people like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even remember what the hell </v>

3370
02:39:24.351 --> 02:39:26.540
<v Speaker 3>happened there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so shattered by it all.</v>

3371
02:39:26.541 --> 02:39:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3372
02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:34.140
<v Speaker 4>saw a story about a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's in the,</v>

3373
02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:37.170
<v Speaker 4>like the juvenile penal system in New </v>
<v Speaker 4>York or something,</v>

3374
02:39:37.171 --> 02:39:41.520
<v Speaker 4>but he's been used by the system to </v>
<v Speaker 4>convict like 35 people or something that</v>

3375
02:39:41.521 --> 02:39:42.354
<v Speaker 4>didn't do anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like the article was about the shit </v>

3376
02:39:45.331 --> 02:39:46.260
<v Speaker 4>he's dealing with.</v>

3377
02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:48.360
<v Speaker 3>He's being used how</v>

3378
02:39:48.510 --> 02:39:49.343
<v Speaker 4>I'll pull it up real quick because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's done something in like probably </v>

3379
02:39:52.021 --> 02:39:54.270
<v Speaker 4>they're using him to get his sentence </v>
<v Speaker 4>reduced.</v>

3380
02:39:54.500 --> 02:39:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he sets other people up.</v>

3381
02:39:56.570 --> 02:39:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

3382
02:39:58.550 --> 02:39:59.383
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird one that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to have fake crime and arrest </v>

3383
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.983
<v Speaker 3>you for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the FBI has done that with people </v>

3384
02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:05.173
<v Speaker 3>like talk someone into making a bomb and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they give them the parts and then </v>

3385
02:40:08.691 --> 02:40:09.524
<v Speaker 3>they give them the bomb and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>like tell them to go somewhere and blow </v>

3386
02:40:11.361 --> 02:40:12.220
<v Speaker 3>it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they do it.</v>

3387
02:40:12.221 --> 02:40:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Then they arrest them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to do that.</v>

3388
02:40:14.341 --> 02:40:15.174
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how are you allowed to fish </v>

3389

<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

3395
02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:29.580
<v Speaker 3>But they're allowed to do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like it used to be.</v>

3396
02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:31.350
<v Speaker 3>What does that term that I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>for?</v>

3397

3405
02:40:45.781 --> 02:40:48.420
<v Speaker 3>in the wrong direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're allowed to.</v>
