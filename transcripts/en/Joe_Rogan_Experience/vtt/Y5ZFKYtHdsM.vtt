<v 1>three,</v>

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.333

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.903
<v 0>one.</v>

<v 1>And we're live Mr. Roth as live,</v>

6
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:17.660
as live will ever possibly get on the intergrade international.

7
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.531
Good to see you man.

8
00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:19.610
You really do look great.

9
00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:20.331
You look healthy,

10
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:21.440
you look vibrant.

11
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.790
You look surprised.

12
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.250
No surprise.

13
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.680
You know,

14
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.910
I've,

15
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.930
I haven't been to sleep since the late eighties.

16
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.010
I didn't miss a thing,

17
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:29.840
but I'm a little groggy,

18
00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:31.490
but I'm good to go in my job.

19
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:34.670
You expect Desta dissipation and illness rights,

20
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:35.001
you know,

21
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.900
kind of goes along with you.

22
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:41.901
You expect a disintegration in my kind of job and Lemmy from Motorhead style.

23
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.003
Um,

24
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.770
do you know the term Wabisabi do you know what that is?

25
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:46.370
No.

26
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.110
Wabisabi he's Japanese term.

27
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:51.710
That succinctly put means that which is perfect cause it's a little fucked up.

28
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.693
Uh,

29
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.380
your favorite jeans very well.

30
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.900
The a Patina on an old car.

31
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.630
The Guitar player in the rolling stones.

32
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.281
Very,

33
00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:00.451
oh,

34
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:00.980
of us up.

35
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.791
Yes.

36
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:02.211
Yes.

37
00:01:02.211 --> 00:01:03.360
He's very Wasabi.

38
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.990
Yeah.

39
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.310
In New York City for example,

40
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.190
the old that starts to fall apart right next to the new,

41
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:11.360
that's part of the beauty.

42
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:13.250
They're your favorite leather jacket.

43
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.541
Is that,

44
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.060
can you expect that to increase?

45
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:17.541
But,

46
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:18.374
uh,

47
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.980
I dunno,

48
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.210
I'm not really an athlete.

49
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.070
I don't really train 'em kind of a singer who always traded his celebrity to,

50
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.730
you know,

51
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.971
hey,

52
00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:29.000
show me how you do that and how many times should I lift this?

53
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:29.380
And,

54
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.930
uh,

55
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.480
what happens if I fall off of this going this fast?

56
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.860
But you used to train,

57
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:34.041
right?

58
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:34.371
You used to,

59
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:36.380
didn't you train with Benny or Kitezh oh yeah.

60
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.890
I went through a martial arts the first time.

61
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.563
Um,

62
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.063
let me go back.

63
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.520
Okay.

64
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.670
I lived in student housing up until I was just about a teenager.

65
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:47.151
Okay.

66
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.420
And it was a time when you bought one paint brush at a time.

67
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.000
Okay.

68
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.300
And most of my values come from that public library.

69
00:01:55.301 --> 00:02:00.301
I learned to swim at a public swimming pool and my dad finished medical school.

70
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.150
Okay.

71
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.871
I happened,

72
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.960
I wasn't planned in the 50s that happened a lot.

73
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.840
And uh,

74
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.100
so we had a lot,

75
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:13.960
a lot of patients who were kind of on the periphery of Pasadena,

76
00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:14.681
California,

77
00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:15.670
which is where we came.

78
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.361
Okay.

79
00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:17.470
I was born in Indiana,

80
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:18.610
lived in Massachusetts.

81
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:21.400
He was a resident grow up around the hospitals.

82
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:22.870
Dinner meant going to the hospital,

83
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.763
meet Dad,

84
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.140
and when we came out to la,

85
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.380
the Japanese were kind of peripheral Spanish speaking people.

86
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.400
Curiously enough,

87
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.750
you know the running story was that there were six Spanish speaking people at

88
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:39.910
Ucla and three of them were in gardening.

89
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.621
No,

90
00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:42.190
really?

91
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.830
That went back in the 60s that was the case today.

92
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.693
Easily,

93
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.570
you know,

94
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.210
massive amounts of percentages.

95
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.980
A Uab most officiant is Tom.

96
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.190
He okay.

97
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.990
It's not a second language.

98
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.670
It's kind of the first in half now.

99
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.780
Things have really changed a mental and grew up in those neighborhoods.

100
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.330
Okay.

101
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.980
So I can gang sign the whole alphabet.

102
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.880
Can you really?

103
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.480
Yeah.

104
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.770
I have two low riders.

105
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.870
I've got a really,

106
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.430
well I got a 51 mercury that's Jap.

107
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.720
Drop low and slow.

108
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.710
Do you drive it?

109
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.220
Oh yeah.

110
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.430
I got a 66 v Dub bug with a Chevy engine.

111
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.510
A three 83 up in the front or Denali is he and I couldn't.

112
00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:19.360
Oh my gosh,

113
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.711
you gotta roll.

114
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:22.590
Your rs is the whole Allie,

115
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.480
what did he drive those things?

116
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:25.660
No,

117
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.560
we drive them all around,

118
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:26.970
you know,

119
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.240
it's,

120
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.580
it's southern California of course is different.

121
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.890
A lot of you are listening in with five layers and gone,

122
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:33.580
hey fuck,

123
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.660
I'm not driving anywhere for the next three days according to the weather map,

124
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.470
you know.

125
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.303
But uh,

126
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.210
here for example,

127
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:40.781
it's tee shirt,

128
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:41.530
weather.

129
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.490
So you know,

130
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.020
the great outdoors means,

131
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.080
how's that sound over the headphones?

132
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.060
It sounds like an engine.

133
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.950
Yup.

134
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.380
Yeah.

135
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.020
But I always treat the first time I ever,

136
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.720
we were just playing with a sword there.

137
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.640
And that's not a summarized story.

138
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.980
That's like calling a nine millimeter a police gun.

139
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.061
Yeah,

140
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:03.240
it kind of is because they used,

141
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:05.010
but that's a Katon Huh?

142
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.770
Right.

143
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.470
And we were playing with that a little bit.

144
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:10.090
First Time somebody handed me those,

145
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:13.110
we were at the Buddhist temple in Pasadena 19.

146
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:13.511
You Bet.

147
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:18.511
I remember 1965 and there was a demonstration of the Japanese culture.

148
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.463
Thank you.

149
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.490
And a fella came out and demonstrated,

150
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.970
I thought,

151
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.211
oh,

152
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:26.044
and you know,

153
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.550
there's of arts and stuff.

154
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.890
And then he,

155
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.421
she said,

156
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.250
I'm going to take somebody from the audience.

157
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.490
And my dad pushed me and I walked out in the middle of that floor and held it

158
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.341
here.

159
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:37.230
Hold that sort.

160
00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:38.170
It just like you said,

161
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:38.441
wow.

162
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:43.441
That's what does that 100 year olds or 15 hundreds years whammo mood maci or

163
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:45.460
something like this.

164
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.950
First Time I held that story,

165
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.820
it was like out of a graphic novel,

166
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:49.654
lightning.

167
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.480
And as a ma,

168
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.720
that's Japanese for lightening.

169
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.410
Careful what you show your kids.

170
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:57.244
Joe,

171
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.770
you went and lived in like last time I talked to you,

172
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:02.890
you were living in Japan who are doing Kendo over there.

173
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.340
Yes.

174
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.940
Uh,

175
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.190
well you pitch up awesome.

176
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:05.410
Dan.

177
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.430
I'm going to play for the Yankees.

178
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.264
Joe.

179
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.380
I love the Uracil and grapple and someday I'm going to get in the middle of the

180
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:13.360
ring and Joe Rogan's going to saint my name

181
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.810
and I'm working my way up through Ed Parker's American Kampo system and someday

182
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.120
I'm going to Jay Payne.

183
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.120
Fine.

184
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.740
I'm going to learn from the guys who invented this stuff.

185
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:28.360
Now I'm putting on a pork barrel,

186
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.070
acts it to make it entertaining.

187
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.143
But it did.

188
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.970
And I started exactly like I did.

189
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.050
You know,

190
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.230
Barham Boulevard making rock and roll with the Mighty v Mighty van Halen in the

191
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.980
late seventies,

192
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.550
uh,

193
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.210
at the Oakwood Garden apartment in midtown Tokyo.

194
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.950
I did not know a single person.

195
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.500
I didn't know a syllable of Japanese.

196
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.160
I had no idea where I was and no,

197
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.140
I can't drive on the left side of the street.

198
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:57.410
I barely carry a cell phone.

199
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:57.710
Karen,

200
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.543
come on.

201
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.200
And uh,

202
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.130
uh,

203
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.810
I suspect that a lifetime of adventure you do all the traveling come on artists

204
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.471
to artists,

205
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:07.550
your home everywhere now,

206
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:08.180
aren't you?

207
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.581
Yeah.

208
00:06:08.581 --> 00:06:12.080
And a lot of ways you are the comfortable one in the room,

209
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.030
especially if there's conflict,

210
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.160
which there always is.

211
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:17.990
And that's what's the most unsettling to the,

212
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.050
to the tourists.

213
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.883
Travelers,

214
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.220
you're at home when you first start learning Japanese comes in three stages.

215
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.320
First you watch kids shows on television because they pronounce everything and

216
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:31.280
nobody interrupts.

217
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.960
Then you watched the news.

218
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.170
Everybody speaks with a perfect accent,

219
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.670
bigger words,

220
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.810
nobody interrupts.

221
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.010
And then you start going with me to the movies in the middle of the day on

222
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.611
Tuesday and Tokyo,

223
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:46.880
it Ginza and you're the only pale face in the room.

224
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.820
It's all in Japanese and it's the movies.

225
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.170
Everybody's interrupting,

226
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.190
everybody's shooting,

227
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:52.971
screaming,

228
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:53.810
sirens,

229
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:55.130
airplanes going by,

230
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:58.100
and if you can begin to decipher even one character,

231
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.080
then you'll develop yours.

232
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:00.760
Maybe.

233
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.890
Why do you know how to write it while you practice that?

234
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:04.820
Certainly,

235
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.460
and think of it is cross training.

236
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.900
All right?

237
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.130
There are a lot of schools,

238
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:10.970
for example,

239
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.350
a Hebrew school,

240
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.100
you always hear about Hebrew school before you go to bar Mitzvah class.

241
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.690
It's an ancient way of,

242
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.530
wait a minute.

243
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.580
You got to develop the side of your brain by correlating designs with language,

244
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:25.520
with meaning that may not actually be in English.

245
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.300
Nobody's walking around speaking Hebrew after all the only four summers of why,

246
00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:35.960
but you develop that side of your brain to where you start to have a capacity to

247
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:38.030
learn in an accelerated way.

248
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:40.820
So all your best musicians speak a couple languages.

249
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.380
We are best politicians.

250
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.300
Speak a couple of all your best artists,

251
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.200
architects,

252
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.370
all your best,

253
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:46.670
uh,

254
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.050
design folks and still speak a couple of language.

255
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:53.360
It's no secret that you develop that side of your brain.

256
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.340
If your kids don't speak Spanish,

257
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.174
get after it.

258
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.520
I had to learn a language that's the,

259
00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.630
it's never too late.

260
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.010
You'll see the difference.

261
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.113
You don't,

262
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.100
I did every single day,

263
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.550
every of,

264
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.550
I called it Roth University in Tokyo every morning for two hours.

265
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:11.780
Japanese class.

266
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.051
You know,

267
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:13.160
speaking the language.

268
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.080
I can get things done for you,

269
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.880
but I'm not conversant.

270
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.173
You follow?

271
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.160
Uh,

272
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.140
the end result is that it's cross training.

273
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.873
Alright.

274
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.050
Longterm memory.

275
00:08:24.051 --> 00:08:29.051
My short term memory is a little too short and getting shorter,

276
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.110
but you'll see the difference in your ability to remember what you read.

277
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.940
They'll start remembering everything you see sometimes as dangerous because of

278
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:39.440
the fact that you're learning this new thing.

279
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:41.300
So you're activating this part of your brain.

280
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.193
Oh yeah.

281
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.860
You'll start it off with little kids in art class for example,

282
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.560
where you take a pencil and you got this just a pencil.

283
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.140
But what else could it be?

284
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.540
Well in this environment is a stick shift.

285
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.550
Pla.

286
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:56.491
<v 2>No,</v>

287
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:56.851
it's not.

288
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:57.690
It's a Kubo ton.

289
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.840
He's got Joe's risk.

290
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.320
No,

291
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.153
I'm a little girls go.

292
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.090
It's a bode dad.

293
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.011
Me,

294
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.020
I'm a hero also end of the day.

295
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.150
And you can start to think in those terms using actual language movement.

296
00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:13.984
Same thing.

297
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.880
At this point in your career with Jujitsu and grappling,

298
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:20.820
you have a vocabulary that starts to expand,

299
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:23.700
expand by having to learn and challenge and challenge

300
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.471
people.

301
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:28.140
Marvel at Anthony Bordain gun blessing.

302
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:29.490
Uh,

303
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.010
one is biggest talent was to be at home everywhere.

304
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.210
No matter what somebody might say or a posture or present,

305
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.130
he was able to let it go by when later or no,

306
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:42.060
we'll Duke it out right here.

307
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.710
And he had the capacity to stay cool in the middle of all of it.

308
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.410
So maybe it's stay cool school when you think,

309
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.841
well,

310
00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:54.841
he just had a fascinating mind for travel and food and culture and he just

311
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:58.740
wanted to know everything about how these people thought about the world and saw

312
00:09:58.741 --> 00:09:59.640
things differently.

313
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.990
And if I feel,

314
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:03.330
I kind of feel bad now for people that don't travel,

315
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.471
I really do.

316
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:04.801
It's just,

317
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:08.640
I feel like you're missing so much of what a human being is.

318
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.380
Travel is a little bit perhaps like music or looking at art on the wall.

319
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.060
You kind of have to have somebody teach you how to do it a little bit.

320
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:19.830
Like the fight game.

321
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:20.730
He,

322
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:21.150
Oh,

323
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.601
you know,

324
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:21.990
you could,

325
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.520
somebody could sit with you and,

326
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.100
and get really bored with technical boxing and it might be the best you've ever

327
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:29.581
seen.

328
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:31.460
And it's not a slug faster or Braun,

329
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:32.340
you have to explain,

330
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:33.060
well,

331
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.170
see some jazz,

332
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.700
some jazz bitches,

333
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:43.701
brew Conor Mcgregor's bitches brew arguably one of the smell several.

334
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:48.711
It's all over the place and lists and some is very contained.

335
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:49.921
Look,

336
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:51.120
the disc jockeys voice.

337
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.153
Yeah,

338
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.790
we've a very mechanized,

339
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.660
the jazz thing is a really good analogy because you're either into jazz,

340
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.590
are you not into jazz?

341
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.423
And I,

342
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.743
I've never,

343
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.610
I liked electronics background music,

344
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:03.301
but I have a good friend.

345
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:08.301
My friend Alonzo Boden is a jazz efficient natto and he like host jazz tours and

346
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:09.391
stuff.

347
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:11.090
And he's a standup comic,

348
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:14.010
so he'll do like comedy on these things and he just loves it.

349
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.281
I mean,

350
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:15.330
he like lives for it.

351
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.230
Well I,

352
00:11:16.231 --> 00:11:20.400
she look on your face just because nobody taught you how to taste beer.

353
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.170
Beer works in three parts and like it says in the Pickwick papers,

354
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:27.210
you don't taste it with a sep wait.

355
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.073
Tastes.

356
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.870
Yeah.

357
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:29.550
Gotta go.

358
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.300
You gotta go off.

359
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.500
You gotta hit something.

360
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:32.550
And when you describe,

361
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:35.460
well there's the finish to the taste of a Cuban cigar.

362
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.941
They go,

363
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:37.660
you mean when it's finished in the APP?

364
00:11:37.661 --> 00:11:38.494
No,

365
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.110
the finish.

366
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.041
Okay.

367
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:43.230
Somebody explain these things to me.

368
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:43.711
All right.

369
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:46.960
What's the difference between Scotch whiskey and Tennessee Bourbon?

370
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.211
Well,

371
00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:51.210
there's an e in the word and Bourbon whiskey.

372
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:51.961
There's an e in,

373
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.010
there is no e in the,

374
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.040
in whiskey for

375
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.581
<v 1>Scotch.</v>

376
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.414
Okay.

377
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.780
That simple sort of starts it jazz music.

378
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.860
Somebody explains it to you in very simple,

379
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:03.641
digestible,

380
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:05.830
now lofty necktie terms,

381
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.730
you begin to understand a little bit of what's going on.

382
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:10.390
How do you,

383
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.171
how do you explain it to them?

384
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:11.740
Okay.

385
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.690
How would you explain jazz?

386
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.220
I'm gonna,

387
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.430
I'll really tighten up for you.

388
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.440
Um,

389
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.273
excuse me.

390
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:17.771
Wow.

391
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:18.521
At least I got my health.

392
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:19.354
Go for me.

393
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.993
Um,

394
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.230
we'll do it in the Beatles style.

395
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:27.550
Here's the best way to go for somebody new and interested the McCartney note and

396
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:28.384
that Lennon note.

397
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.170
Okay.

398
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.630
The McCartney node is always kind of happy.

399
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.930
I've actually bumped into Sir Paul over at Henson Studios and he's really happy.

400
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.080
Okay.

401
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.150
And here's now note we go,

402
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.180
<v 3>Nah,</v>

403
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.710
Nah,

404
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:41.220
Nah,

405
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.130
Nah,

406
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.790
Nah,

407
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.643
Nah.

408
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:44.981
<v 1>Here.</v>

409
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:45.860
How pretty that sounds.

410
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.733
Sounds pretty.

411
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.650
I'll do it again.

412
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:52.650
<v 3>Bad Ass Lennon.</v>

413
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.260
<v 1>He's the salt and the caramel baby.</v>

414
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.843
He's got,

415
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.990
there's a darkness.

416
00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.621
There's an edge.

417
00:12:58.621 --> 00:12:59.490
There's a shadow.

418
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.140
Listen to the last three notes.

419
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.360
<v 3>Ah,</v>

420
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.120
AH,

421
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.050
<v 1>and there's a little darkness.</v>

422
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:11.160
It,

423
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.740
both of those last three notes is where you'd get that little,

424
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.720
just a little bit of pepper in the chocolate,

425
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.563
yo.

426
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.500
<v 3>Ah,</v>

427
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.770
uh,

428
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.860
<v 1>and it's a little wistful,</v>

429
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.420
is a little melancholy.

430
00:13:26.421 --> 00:13:27.650
And he lifelike that.

431
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.390
And when you put them together,

432
00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.100
it doesn't sound like they do.

433
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.231
But if I could,

434
00:13:33.231 --> 00:13:34.220
I'd sing both parts in,

435
00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:35.210
it goes together and you go,

436
00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:35.540
wow.

437
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.373
Bittersweet.

438
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.930
Like my fucking career.

439
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.060
Like my last three [inaudible] and there we go.

440
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.480
So you kind of have to listen to jazz like you would taste wine k the best for

441
00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:51.800
this felonious monk,

442
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.910
you know,

443
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:53.570
same thing.

444
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.380
The right hand is Paul left his job and he's working these days.

445
00:13:57.381 --> 00:13:59.120
You can't tell is it happy or sad?

446
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.380
I Dunno.

447
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.670
How was dinner last night?

448
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:02.563
Same.

449
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.460
We get it.

450
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:09.440
It is a indicative if that's what's around you cause snatches tappy that's

451
00:14:09.441 --> 00:14:10.790
Disney snatches.

452
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.683
Sad.

453
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.500
You know,

454
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.333
think of something.

455
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.690
Somebody who's always tuning his guitar to sad.

456
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.880
There are some folks who,

457
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.233
Leonard Cohen,

458
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.370
who since passed as well,

459
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.530
that sounded more like Bowie,

460
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.020
but I don't know what you mean.

461
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:28.640
Getting Tattoos.

462
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.163
Two sleeves.

463
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:31.050
Yeah,

464
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:31.830
both of my arms.

465
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.630
Same here.

466
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.160
I rarely show.

467
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.300
Okay.

468
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.900
Then maybe that's a baby boomer thing from the elbow up.

469
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.610
Yeah.

470
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:40.443
I'm a,

471
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.380
I have this all Japanese style,

472
00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:42.680
right?

473
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.150
Traditional tap style.

474
00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:48.590
Did you have all my colors were tapped in and in front is Horiyoshi I have the

475
00:14:48.591 --> 00:14:49.310
Tuxedo.

476
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.300
Damn you do?

477
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:50.631
Yeah.

478
00:14:50.631 --> 00:14:52.280
The whole butt cheeks and everything.

479
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.580
Yeah,

480
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.413
the whole thing.

481
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.600
The interpreter had to sit on me and hold me down.

482
00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.430
I'm not going to kid you.

483
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.490
It was a trial.

484
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.643
You know what I imagined.

485
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.400
Is it much more painful to do at that top way?

486
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:05.960
No,

487
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.793
it should.

488
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.331
Overall,

489
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:11.180
I think what happens is tattoo,

490
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.060
when you get something that stings,

491
00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:15.440
you can take it for a while.

492
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.050
It's the distance that counts.

493
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.000
It can take the cold for 30 seconds.

494
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:21.560
You can take a measurable cold.

495
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.480
Are you doing the Cryo Dunk?

496
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:24.411
Okay,

497
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:25.040
boom.

498
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.870
You can take anything for 30 seconds.

499
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:27.973
You're in show Biz,

500
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:39.070
but man trial and that out in front of you for 15 seconds.

501
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.180
Kind of a that your suit.

502
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.080
Yeah.

503
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.441
Wow.

504
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:42.891
Look at that.

505
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:44.330
So there's some photos of it up.

506
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:45.411
Yeah,

507
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:48.580
because you never really do a show your tattoos anywhere.

508
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.180
That's not part of the show.

509
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.410
It's not part of,

510
00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:53.000
but behind the scenes,

511
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:53.931
my mom,

512
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:57.830
who was an art teacher was the,

513
00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.610
the,

514
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.060
the healing happy side of my family came from my dad.

515
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.010
I learned a box from mom.

516
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.810
Really?

517
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:05.643
Oh yeah.

518
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.573
Bad Dave.

519
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.460
Like my sisters call it comes from civil Roth.

520
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:11.803
Okay.

521
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.020
If you,

522
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.300
if you ha you competed for the magnet for the refrigerator.

523
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.530
Okay.

524
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.460
And Mom would be doing something and you'd come up with your new drawing and

525
00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:23.294
she'd say,

526
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.360
should I go get the magnet and not look at it?

527
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.483
Wow.

528
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.230
And you wouldn't look and go,

529
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.400
you're right.

530
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.233
Stay here.

531
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.613
Yes.

532
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:37.820
Harsh.

533
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.630
Yeah.

534
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.550
And then before you would look at it,

535
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.050
go clean up your paint box.

536
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.613
We shear brushes.

537
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.553
Okay.

538
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.633
Ah,

539
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.230
we're on family.

540
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.440
And when I got my Tuxedo,

541
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.590
first thing mom shed was I really liked the colors.

542
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.880
What do you do when you're outdoors?

543
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:56.714
Playing Ball.

544
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.043
Okay.

545
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.070
And that's part of what compels what we're doing here.

546
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:06.770
I invented inc the original.

547
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:07.760
Okay.

548
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.450
And this is a whole series of things that didn't exist before.

549
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.380
So products to protect your,

550
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.283
your tattoo.

551
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:14.950
Oh yeah.

552
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.270
You know,

553
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.103
I just,

554
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.350
whenever I go anywhere outside,

555
00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:20.720
I sprayed down with sunscreen and people are like,

556
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:21.321
why are you doing that?

557
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:21.681
And I was like,

558
00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:23.360
cause I don't want my tattoos to fade away.

559
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.830
I have artwork on my body.

560
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.281
You have a,

561
00:17:25.281 --> 00:17:29.420
Rembrandt was probably more expensive than the paint job on your car.

562
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.130
Driving a ranger series for sure.

563
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.540
Yeah,

564
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.250
I'm serious.

565
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:33.710
Yeah.

566
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.630
And you won't think twice about it.

567
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.530
Okay.

568
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.730
Cause it's forever.

569
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.960
All right.

570
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.793
It's forever.

571
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.250
I'm 64 doctor says 64 is the new 90 for me.

572
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.160
Take my word for him a little farther down range then Aladdin.

573
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.710
I can tell you what I see from here.

574
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:56.760
You look great.

575
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.910
If you wait until you're 55 to start hitting the weight stack,

576
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.330
you will look like a 55 year old who trains three times a week.

577
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.230
Right?

578
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.070
If you start when you're two digits old,

579
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.700
you'll fool yo full.

580
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:12.840
Yeah.

581
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.950
And that's Canada fun.

582
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.420
You just gotta keep moving.

583
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.050
Oh yeah.

584
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.490
You start way early.

585
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.900
When did you start the tattoos?

586
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.621
Uh,

587
00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:23.220
I got my first one in 1977.

588
00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.553
All right.

589
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.120
Came back from a delirious,

590
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.640
a trip to the West indies.

591
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.480
Uh,

592
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.330
and a handful of folks that were camping out on the beach.

593
00:18:36.331 --> 00:18:37.350
I'm a combat hippie.

594
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.071
Okay.

595
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:38.341
Peace,

596
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:41.170
love and heavy weapons case.

597
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:41.580
You know,

598
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.090
they don't want to feel the love and a camping commune style somewhere in the,

599
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.320
it was in Martinique and the West indies and we all came back and got a sea

600
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:51.360
horse on the,

601
00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:51.571
uh,

602
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:52.470
on the ankle.

603
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.280
Oh boy.

604
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:53.970
How Feminine.

605
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.720
Yeah.

606
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.690
And then from there I waited,

607
00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:58.801
you know,

608
00:18:58.801 --> 00:18:59.251
most,

609
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:00.084
uh,

610
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:00.571
today,

611
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:01.500
what's popular,

612
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:02.671
for example,

613
00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:03.570
Hispanic style,

614
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:04.140
you,

615
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.610
you use the badges plot,

616
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.640
you document something.

617
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.011
Here's a,

618
00:19:09.011 --> 00:19:09.960
here's a name,

619
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.740
here's something we got when we went on spring break or something when we got

620
00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:18.741
married and you build like a mural and I waited to do the whole thing in one

621
00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:20.604
sweep,

622
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.391
you know,

623
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:22.470
thinking in terms of planning.

624
00:19:22.471 --> 00:19:23.700
So I waited until,

625
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:24.380
you know,

626
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.640
I was well past that.

627
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.020
I just celebrated my 60th birthday,

628
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:33.021
but I get about 300 hours in on it and uh,

629
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.620
I'm still outdoors.

630
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.910
I'm still bouncing around and there was nothing out there.

631
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:39.721
I've been climbing.

632
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:44.460
I started off at Joshua tree and climbing out at Taco kits in the 70s.

633
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:48.030
Didn't now how I wasn't Alex Honnold just on the show here.

634
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.860
Okay.

635
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.410
Well.

636
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.350
Same circuit from camp four to studio 54.

637
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:52.980
I was on,

638
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.731
I was in both.

639
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:58.320
I was flavor of the week the first time when studio 54 was that happening?

640
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:59.543
Okay.

641
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.480
At the same time I had just bought a Winnebago that looked like something from a

642
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.113
breaking bad.

643
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.100
It's the same Winnebago.

644
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.050
I saw it as did I used to own that?

645
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.180
That was for nothing but going to Yosemite.

646
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.223
Really?

647
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.200
You just know how Al and the documentary is,

648
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.860
is living in his van?

649
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.991
Pardon me?

650
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:20.520
Always looks back at that.

651
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:21.870
It's wow.

652
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.780
Sleeping in the back of Bobby hatches,

653
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.790
pickup truck parked out in the middle of nowhere in Joshua Tree 1973 and you

654
00:20:29.611 --> 00:20:31.140
would be climbing even back then.

655
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:31.790
Oh yeah.

656
00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:32.001
What it,

657
00:20:32.001 --> 00:20:34.900
what kind of equipment did you guys use back then today?

658
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.730
No,

659
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.750
not nothing like it.

660
00:20:36.751 --> 00:20:39.180
We used webbing for are harnessing.

661
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.220
And you used a 11 millimeter Kern mantle or Manila rope.

662
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.213
All right.

663
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:49.180
And I remember the first time was in 1972 you'll see his name,

664
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:50.014
John Ball.

665
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.363
Uh,

666
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.510
uh,

667
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.620
as pioneering a lot of the routes in Joshua Tree.

668
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.540
First Time we watched him as seniors in highschool go flagging,

669
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:01.811
you know,

670
00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:02.950
are you pressure with,

671
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:03.741
can you see this?

672
00:21:03.741 --> 00:21:08.080
And the a screen there where you pull with your hands and push with your feet

673
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.440
will flagging all the way up the corner of a handball court at mere highschool

674
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.010
in Pasadena,

675
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.900
all the way up to the top and then stood on the top and looked down showing

676
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.913
incredible.

677
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.850
Wow.

678
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.650
Well nine incredible talents.

679
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.020
We'd never seen such a thing.

680
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.580
And from that point,

681
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.773
uh,

682
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:29.471
you know,

683
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:33.130
we just Florida because living in a,

684
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:36.370
up in Yosemite in the various parts was something new.

685
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.980
Traveling to Joshua tree Takut down to the beaches and such.

686
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.660
That was a constant for me.

687
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.790
I've always tried to follow some thing as opposed to thinking of his training.

688
00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:49.720
Even the,

689
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.570
even the word training tastes like homework,

690
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:53.830
right?

691
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.030
So I've always tried to,

692
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:59.340
I was running for a long period of time,

693
00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:04.060
about seven years when I jogged and ran and I decided on the road,

694
00:22:04.061 --> 00:22:07.300
I'll run across every bridge in America that we tour through.

695
00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:10.180
So I probably 1520 different bridges.

696
00:22:10.181 --> 00:22:11.700
Golden Gate Brooklyn's.

697
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.050
That's where I rent now.

698
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:17.050
I did smoke a joint and run the New York City Marathon

699
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.310
and I came in right behind the wheelchairs in the back.

700
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.073
Okay,

701
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.560
well some folks need the ribbon and they need to see the clock and everybody

702
00:22:26.561 --> 00:22:27.394
clapping.

703
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.750
And then there's some folks,

704
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:31.660
you know who just [inaudible] it did okay.

705
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:33.100
And they had took down the clock,

706
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:35.640
but the line was still there on the sea,

707
00:22:35.641 --> 00:22:37.060
meant in central park,

708
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:38.920
hopped over the line,

709
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:40.270
got the picture airborne,

710
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.681
went home,

711
00:22:41.681 --> 00:22:42.514
took a nap,

712
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.890
and that night I went out and got drunk on Tequila.

713
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.870
How long did it take you to finish the marathon?

714
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.150
And about five and a half hours.

715
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.940
That's not bad.

716
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.571
That's very good.

717
00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:50.404
It's better than Berkshire.

718
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.550
Now let's come on.

719
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:52.660
Let's be complimentary.

720
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:53.650
It's the worst.

721
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.533
It's definitely,

722
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:56.381
yes.

723
00:22:56.381 --> 00:22:58.240
That's about the absolute worst that you,

724
00:22:58.241 --> 00:23:02.650
it was the winter do it our 20 I think they get it in a round two hours,

725
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.690
like two hours in seven.

726
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.550
Seventh sac is,

727
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.480
I think they're trying to break two hours.

728
00:23:07.481 --> 00:23:08.314
Isn't that what's going on?

729
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.790
Someone's trying to break two hours.

730
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:10.743
So,

731
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.740
but that's what I did for a period of time,

732
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.580
you know,

733
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.210
keep going,

734
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.043
kayaking,

735
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.280
you know.

736
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.240
So you just always been involved in physical activities that were fun in the

737
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:22.241
early nineties.

738
00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:23.950
Kayaking was illegal in Manhattan.

739
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.540
Okay.

740
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.540
Because it was dirty water and people would get trundled over under the ferry

741
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:31.210
boats.

742
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.043
Oh God.

743
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.400
So what we did is we cut a hole in the fence next to the 14th street sanitation

744
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.600
department over by the,

745
00:23:40.601 --> 00:23:41.410
uh,

746
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.280
west side highway.

747
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.570
Y'All know what I'm talking about?

748
00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:44.404
If you're from there.

749
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.000
And we did it exactly like movie style,

750
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:52.001
like a great escape where we fitted the fence back with duck tape and we would

751
00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:56.510
drag our kayaks from union square west all the way down 14th street.

752
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.770
Okay.

753
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.510
And you pick up your provisions for it.

754
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.530
All right?

755
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.390
You got to get your bagels,

756
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:03.680
she got to get shit done.

757
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.010
But you know,

758
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:05.843
like this,

759
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.250
you got to get something to drink,

760
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:08.390
get some Gatorade,

761
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:09.440
you know,

762
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.430
not to drink the gate array so you have something to Wiz in serious.

763
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:14.683
And um,

764
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.090
we'd get the girlfriends okay.

765
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.050
To wait up is in the meatpacking district right there.

766
00:24:20.051 --> 00:24:20.871
It's dead silent.

767
00:24:20.871 --> 00:24:21.621
It was a ghost town.

768
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:22.880
Then there was not hip hop.

769
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:23.714
It was not going,

770
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.300
which is what it's doing now.

771
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:30.770
And he'd go to shopping with your old lady had said Stella Mccartney down there

772
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:32.090
now at Benton is a ghost town.

773
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.050
It was crazy,

774
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:33.590
scary,

775
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:34.423
dangerous.

776
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.170
And one girlfriend,

777
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.870
which I gotta be careful of names.

778
00:24:38.871 --> 00:24:39.830
They're all married now.

779
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.001
How'd you manage it?

780
00:24:43.001 --> 00:24:43.700
The mine,

781
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.533
Karen

782
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.280
would always go north and wait around because if the cops come,

783
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.660
they would step out.

784
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.530
We would see them or whatever and we would sneak our bolts through the hole in

785
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:57.410
the fence into the river,

786
00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.720
right where solely landed his plane,

787
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:00.920
uh,

788
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.730
right there.

789
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.563
All right.

790
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:03.623
And,

791
00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.850
and girls would come and jump in a boat and we would take off more than two or

792
00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:08.684
three times.

793
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.780
Local PD would show going,

794
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.120
hey,

795
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:11.530
what do,

796
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:11.661
what?

797
00:25:11.661 --> 00:25:13.730
Are you going to touch that water back then?

798
00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:14.060
No,

799
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:14.480
that was,

800
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.350
that was death.

801
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.030
Inky black horror death.

802
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.890
Did you ever Dunkin it accident?

803
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.350
No,

804
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.771
not in,

805
00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:23.300
not in that river particular,

806
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.380
but we started a number of the trips today.

807
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.580
You,

808
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.270
there's probably six different kayak clubs that you can jump.

809
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:32.811
Manhattan,

810
00:25:32.811 --> 00:25:35.090
Kayak Club and Brooklyn,

811
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:36.201
many,

812
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.370
many now the boomers.

813
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.560
What senses of humor figured it all out.

814
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:40.683
All right.

815
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.290
And we would go,

816
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:42.591
Geez,

817
00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:43.381
we started trips.

818
00:25:43.381 --> 00:25:48.140
We'd go at midnight under the Verrazano Bridge in the winter.

819
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.173
All right.

820
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.410
And you were dry suits or something.

821
00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:51.681
You know,

822
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:53.360
you're a long,

823
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.640
long Johns inside of a dry sheet like this.

824
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:56.810
And don't get me wrong,

825
00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.640
I would be the DJ,

826
00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.211
I have a,

827
00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:00.044
um,

828
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.251
a,

829
00:26:01.251 --> 00:26:05.600
a tape player and I would bungee to take player like this and everybody would

830
00:26:05.601 --> 00:26:06.200
have,

831
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.370
this is a primitive times,

832
00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:07.511
you know,

833
00:26:07.511 --> 00:26:08.181
it's 19,

834
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:09.020
early nineties.

835
00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:09.261
You know,

836
00:26:09.261 --> 00:26:09.830
I just,

837
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:13.790
and we would have a little microphones in the earpieces that you use on

838
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:14.960
motorcycles back then.

839
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.630
So you have communications from boat to boat.

840
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:18.260
Oh Wow.

841
00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.420
And I would put mine on the tape player and I'd be the Tj.

842
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:24.140
Oh yeah.

843
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.520
And we'd listen to the ballgame late at night sometimes you know,

844
00:26:26.521 --> 00:26:27.950
and you hear laughing all,

845
00:26:27.951 --> 00:26:31.970
you couldn't see anybody in the swells and we'd go under the same bridge that

846
00:26:31.971 --> 00:26:35.390
John Travolta sits and looks at with the girlfriend in Saturday.

847
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:36.224
Night fever,

848
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.381
same bridge,

849
00:26:37.381 --> 00:26:39.560
you know that a woody Allen in Manhattan,

850
00:26:39.561 --> 00:26:40.394
it looks,

851
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.030
you know,

852
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:44.280
you have a wonderful us on the other side is terrible imitation of either of

853
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:47.850
them and we'd float under their full moon,

854
00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.130
midnight February,

855
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.960
snow drifting like this.

856
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.570
And since it was illegal to do it,

857
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:59.430
we had a buddy who owned a plumbing company in Brooklyn and he would bring his

858
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.710
truck and park it right off a Coney island.

859
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:05.910
You're still well avenue where the Ferris wheel is and he would blink his

860
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:06.360
lights,

861
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.530
allied forces style blink,

862
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:10.080
blink like that.

863
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:14.250
And we'd be about a quarter mile off having come from under the Verrazano

864
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:14.280
Bridge.

865
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.760
And whenever we'd see those lights blink,

866
00:27:15.761 --> 00:27:16.710
nowhere to turn left.

867
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.170
He started,

868
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.430
do you even want to hear this?

869
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.323
Yes.

870
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:24.540
Okay.

871
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.180
We'd have to make the left and we'd wait for the swells.

872
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:27.361
Like,

873
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:28.500
can you give us another blank?

874
00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:31.500
When all was clear and jazz,

875
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.470
beat ass all a quarter mile of row,

876
00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:34.711
row,

877
00:27:34.711 --> 00:27:35.220
row,

878
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.060
catch the wave,

879
00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:37.870
get out of the boat and everyone,

880
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.250
you know,

881
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.550
silently drag it all the way up the beach.

882
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.150
Okay.

883
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.440
Like you see in every war movie.

884
00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:44.520
All right.

885
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.353
Otherwise just smashed it,

886
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:45.781
I don't know,

887
00:27:45.781 --> 00:27:47.580
$200 fine or something like this.

888
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.140
And we would put the boats big two person kayaks into the back of the plumbing

889
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:53.340
truck and onto the top of it,

890
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.210
drive it back to the coffee shop on Union Square West.

891
00:27:57.211 --> 00:28:00.960
It's very well known like that and get drunk with pretty girls and tell them

892
00:28:00.961 --> 00:28:02.190
about adventure stories.

893
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.800
And all this was going on while you were,

894
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.590
you were air quotes David Lee Roth.

895
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:07.921
I mean,

896
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:08.850
this is the nineties.

897
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:09.780
You were fucking huge.

898
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.650
You're still a rockstar and you're going through polluted water in a fucking

899
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:14.410
Kayak.

900
00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.630
Hide him from the cops,

901
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.190
but a tape player and uh,

902
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:18.810
and uh,

903
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.670
some sort of jury rigged,

904
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.420
uh,

905
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.051
microphones.

906
00:28:22.051 --> 00:28:24.900
So some of the best places that I went rock climbing.

907
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.760
Uh,

908
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.830
we're on walls of hotels in Europe.

909
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.323
We'd toss,

910
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.240
toss a rope out the third floor of a bed and breakfast in San Sebastian,

911
00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:35.731
Spain.

912
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:40.650
That's covered from flagstone with flagstone from the 14 hundreds like that.

913
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.491
And then Yo,

914
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:42.180
Yo,

915
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:42.990
you know,

916
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.980
one guy would stay up,

917
00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:47.730
watch TV and work the belay and you can climb up the outside,

918
00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:48.121
you know,

919
00:28:48.121 --> 00:28:49.200
it's Jesus Christ.

920
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:52.200
Hardcore jollies send you were doing this all around the same time?

921
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.663
Oh yeah.

922
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.990
My bicycles with me,

923
00:28:54.991 --> 00:28:55.221
I'm going to,

924
00:28:55.221 --> 00:28:58.470
it's outdoors is in the blood,

925
00:28:58.530 --> 00:28:58.981
you know,

926
00:28:58.981 --> 00:29:02.430
it's part of growing up without any real things.

927
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.540
My Dad was a student,

928
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:04.591
so,

929
00:29:04.591 --> 00:29:05.100
uh,

930
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.020
take this stick for you.

931
00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:08.700
It'll be a bow for me.

932
00:29:08.701 --> 00:29:09.534
It be a baton.

933
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.970
When did you start working as an EMT?

934
00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.170
That was around the same time,

935
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:17.004
wasn't it?

936
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.300
Emt was about 12 summers ago for me.

937
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:26.301
So I was turning 50 and I started going back to school for outdoor med response,

938
00:29:28.891 --> 00:29:29.461
camping,

939
00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:30.121
climbing.

940
00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:33.840
And what is it like when you go to one of those classes and they realized who

941
00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:34.230
you are?

942
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.220
How weird does it kid?

943
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:35.611
Ah,

944
00:29:35.611 --> 00:29:40.290
sometimes you can get a little bit uptight because I'm the oldest guy in the

945
00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:41.120
room,

946
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:41.380
right?

947
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.520
And I want to clarify something.

948
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.420
Okay.

949
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.680
When I became an EMT shield number three,

950
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:48.131
two seven,

951
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:50.260
four 66 47th precinct,

952
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:55.770
big shout out to all of you who taught me and tolerated me until I became an EMT

953
00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:57.010
and put on that uniform.

954
00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.810
I wasn't somebody,

955
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.230
somebody cleaned the fucking truck up

956
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:11.140
until I put on that uniform Gel after training for how many months?

957
00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:13.240
It's almost a year for me like this.

958
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.860
I wasn't someone,

959
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.410
someone clean up the track

960
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.820
and that was my job starting right off.

961
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:23.043
But uh,

962
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.630
I was also the somebody who dragged the oxygen box all 13 floors up in the

963
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.770
didn't walled projection artists to artists.

964
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.980
How many times have you driven past something,

965
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.220
whether it's a huge building or at tp

966
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.570
wonder what's in there and then you go live with him.

967
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:48.571
I wonder which in the frigerator I wonder what they listened to in there and I

968
00:30:49.031 --> 00:30:50.230
wonder who they are.

969
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.110
I have a fascination for that.

970
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:57.460
My pop had a big sprawling,

971
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.420
I think.

972
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.180
Is it simply empathy for people?

973
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.381
You know,

974
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:07.381
when the fellows started getting age in the early eighties he started treating

975
00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:07.840
him.

976
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.420
He's an eye surgeon and everybody,

977
00:31:10.421 --> 00:31:12.190
my sisters and stuff started saying,

978
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.270
but this is a time when you think you can catch that shift from breathing it pop

979
00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:16.841
and whatever.

980
00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:17.531
And he turned to me,

981
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:18.281
I'll never forget,

982
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:18.581
he said,

983
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:20.170
I don't get to choose my patients.

984
00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:22.483
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

985
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:23.170
<v 1>Wow.</v>

986
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.460
I don't get to choose my audience.

987
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.020
So what was the motivation to start doing that though?

988
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.240
We'll see what's in there.

989
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.440
Where's your rater Joe?

990
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:35.010
And you'll walk in first cause you're way stronger than me in case there's

991
00:31:35.011 --> 00:31:40.011
trouble and you'll go and be lunch and in case somebody comes at us you handle

992
00:31:40.381 --> 00:31:41.214
it.

993
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.151
Oh,

994
00:31:45.151 --> 00:31:45.750
I had a,

995
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:50.750
I had a mentor named Kesha who had the pile or dreadlocks up so high that it was

996
00:31:51.661 --> 00:31:54.090
as long as from her shoulders to the top of her head,

997
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.223
her haircut,

998
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.320
it was like she had to,

999
00:31:56.321 --> 00:31:58.950
she put her hat up on top and Kesha walk in that door.

1000
00:31:58.951 --> 00:31:59.784
First homie

1001
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.200
domestic disputes.

1002
00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.240
She dealt with the guys.

1003
00:32:06.241 --> 00:32:07.370
You had to be there for domestics.

1004
00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:08.300
Yeah.

1005
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:08.900
Oh,

1006
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:09.470
those girls.

1007
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.160
Gary is a very,

1008
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.260
and you get an eye on your audience.

1009
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:18.300
Stops being audience starts being the neighborhood.

1010
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:19.200
Yeah,

1011
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.500
and pretty soon you live in the neighborhood.

1012
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.640
I was under the train once in the Fulton Street station too.

1013
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:27.600
I can do a homeless,

1014
00:32:27.601 --> 00:32:29.310
valid quick briefing.

1015
00:32:29.311 --> 00:32:30.420
Act like nothing's wrong.

1016
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:32.250
She and get them to come out,

1017
00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.693
hi,

1018
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:36.503
you're hungry.

1019
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.610
Train breathes.

1020
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:39.620
Okay.

1021
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.190
Subway,

1022
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.991
Jame breeze.

1023
00:32:40.991 --> 00:32:42.410
It doesn't just sit there silently

1024
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.650
and he got to go real.

1025
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:49.484
Geez,

1026
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.270
I'm laughing now,

1027
00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:54.560
but that's a nervous laugh.

1028
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.940
Well and now every one of those folks is in my voice when I sing.

1029
00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.770
Oh,

1030
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:01.730
I liked that.

1031
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.190
I like that thought process.

1032
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.560
When you decided to do this,

1033
00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:07.970
was this a conscience?

1034
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.740
A conscious effort to try to just enrich your experiences.

1035
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:14.323
Cross training,

1036
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.343
cross training.

1037
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:19.070
I'll give it to quick rationale and I also know it's going to change me.

1038
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.360
Don't know how,

1039
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.270
but she got to get in it.

1040
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.270
And after a certain point in your life,

1041
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:31.271
maybe a go where there is no shallow and challenge yourself as just design.

1042
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.381
Move somewhere.

1043
00:33:33.381 --> 00:33:36.560
That's a foreign language as you can't even read the street signs.

1044
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:37.460
Uh,

1045
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.140
in Japan for example.

1046
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.100
Um,

1047
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.390
but you know,

1048
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:44.150
you start off on the bunny slopes.

1049
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.650
You don't surf 40 footers.

1050
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:46.070
Righto.

1051
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:49.760
At first you got to move to New York and go through that whole thing of what

1052
00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:50.594
have I done?

1053
00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.910
But what's so what's the thought process when you're like,

1054
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:54.140
I'm going to be an EMT,

1055
00:33:54.141 --> 00:33:55.170
I'm going to study for a year,

1056
00:33:55.171 --> 00:33:55.731
I'm going to train,

1057
00:33:55.731 --> 00:33:57.200
I'm going to go out there and I'm going to actually do it.

1058
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.500
I okay.

1059
00:34:00.501 --> 00:34:02.780
Sometimes when I go for a walk in the city,

1060
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.890
my plan is just follow where the sun is beaming.

1061
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:08.900
I get to an intersection,

1062
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:10.550
the sun is on that far corner.

1063
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:14.930
I'll cross over to that and then I'll look down the block and see where the sun

1064
00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:17.630
is and I walked down the block and get into that part.

1065
00:34:17.631 --> 00:34:19.100
And he's doing a lot of this by yourself.

1066
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.023
Oh yeah.

1067
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.240
I did the same thing with EMT training.

1068
00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:25.610
Jeez.

1069
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:26.690
My Dad was a doctor.

1070
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:30.170
The first and the merit badge I got as a boy scout was first date.

1071
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:35.180
I was that guy and I learned that for skinny guy like me.

1072
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.300
Real power probably came from being cool when everybody else is gone.

1073
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.023
Yeah.

1074
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:45.230
Because my dad had to do that.

1075
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:48.770
I assisted him in surgeries at a very early age.

1076
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.083
Oh yeah.

1077
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:54.100
And you know and stuff that made everybody else I this pop.

1078
00:34:54.101 --> 00:34:54.830
Good.

1079
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:55.970
I have a good ambulance voice.

1080
00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:56.510
You want to hear it?

1081
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.190
Let me do that.

1082
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.620
Okay,

1083
00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.453
hold on again.

1084
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.580
You're going to be just fine.

1085
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.051
Can you imagine,

1086
00:35:03.051 --> 00:35:03.440
you know,

1087
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.160
being in an ambulance and look up and it's motherfucking David Lee Roth telling

1088
00:35:07.161 --> 00:35:07.971
you you're going to be okay.

1089
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:08.240
You'd be like,

1090
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:08.361
Oh,

1091
00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:09.920
I'm dead and wants to be dead.

1092
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:15.020
I only twice has that actually happened cause I only worked in the hood.

1093
00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.910
Oh they worked around it at night.

1094
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.380
I only worked,

1095
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.801
she,

1096
00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:19.160
you know,

1097
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.160
you would never expect to see me once was after Oz fest football stadium.

1098
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:26.780
Yeah.

1099
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.460
Some unfortunate was uh,

1100
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.353
you know,

1101
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.333
uh,

1102
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.030
drank too much or whatever and he was out of sorts and you know,

1103
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.731
sitting in a corner,

1104
00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:38.100
somebody phoned him in from the local liquor store and

1105
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.933
<v 2>uh,</v>

1106
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.010
you could see that disbelief in his face,

1107
00:35:41.011 --> 00:35:41.400
you know,

1108
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.410
and I leaned over and said to him,

1109
00:35:43.411 --> 00:35:43.800
Hey,

1110
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.820
you're going to be just fine.

1111
00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:48.960
Like this is like the lyrics of an Ozzy song come to life.

1112
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:50.663
Yeah.

1113
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:53.963
But beyond that,

1114
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:55.830
no,

1115
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.210
nobody ever really did.

1116
00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.470
And uh,

1117
00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.420
you know,

1118
00:35:59.420 --> 00:35:59.790
Jesus,

1119
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.410
I weighed 15 more pounds.

1120
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:06.150
I was doing the Arnold routine at the wage stack because I was somebody,

1121
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:06.601
well,

1122
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:07.950
somebody help me lift this

1123
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.310
my fourth day.

1124
00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.190
I'm not in them.

1125
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.340
Not a pretentious about,

1126
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.410
you know what my fourth days work.

1127
00:36:16.411 --> 00:36:18.300
So you bulked up for the job?

1128
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:19.080
Oh yeah.

1129
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:19.711
And a,

1130
00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:23.220
I wait 15 more pounds and I lifted,

1131
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:24.054
man,

1132
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:24.893
I could lift.

1133
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:26.720
I lifted people out of bathtubs.

1134
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.080
I lifted him out of the ocean,

1135
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.090
I lifted him out of the projects,

1136
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.290
I lifted him out of the truck,

1137
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.110
I lifted him into the other truck as the first truck just broke down in the

1138
00:36:34.111 --> 00:36:34.710
snow.

1139
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.543
I live.

1140
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.493
And uh,

1141
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:38.790
just do this for all.

1142
00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:39.270
Sorry.

1143
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:40.110
How long did you do this for?

1144
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.690
I restarted once about four and a half summers.

1145
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.533
Four and a half years.

1146
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:44.460
Okay.

1147
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:44.880
And I,

1148
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.241
you know,

1149
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:46.170
in between,

1150
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.033
uh,

1151
00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:47.670
uh,

1152
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.080
playing and whatever,

1153
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.621
and again,

1154
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:51.780
a big shout out to all my teachers and mentors,

1155
00:36:51.781 --> 00:36:52.800
not a day goes by.

1156
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.120
I don't think about it.

1157
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.760
And not a day goes by that,

1158
00:36:56.761 --> 00:36:57.270
uh,

1159
00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:00.240
I don't use some skill including that,

1160
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.613
you know,

1161
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.210
that'll level your head a little bit.

1162
00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:03.840
Yeah.

1163
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.420
Somebody go make some coffee,

1164
00:37:06.421 --> 00:37:07.254
Joel.

1165
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:13.410
So you feel like for a guy like you who was such a gigantic superstar and you

1166
00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:17.010
just touring these huge arenas and people were freaking out every time they see

1167
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:17.520
you,

1168
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.150
for you,

1169
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.830
it was,

1170
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:19.590
um,

1171
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.340
maybe a good way to balance things out too because you're seeing people in a

1172
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.760
life or death situation and dire straits when they're unhealthy and they need

1173
00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:32.850
help and you're out there in the down and dirty and the nitty gritty,

1174
00:37:32.851 --> 00:37:33.570
like,

1175
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:33.990
you know,

1176
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.740
like you said,

1177
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.910
trucks breaking down,

1178
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.590
picking people up out of the bathtubs.

1179
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:37.921
Well,

1180
00:37:37.921 --> 00:37:41.820
a lot of what you just described is the first response team.

1181
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:42.540
Yes.

1182
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.330
We always describe our patients,

1183
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.400
our friends and clients.

1184
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:48.263
Okay.

1185
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.200
But the struggle for our,

1186
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.280
I'll call it the uniform starts with military police,

1187
00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:01.310
fire first response I'll throw in nursing or emergency room and those of us with

1188
00:38:02.461 --> 00:38:05.340
bells and whistles who she called the ambulance,

1189
00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:07.400
et Cetera.

1190
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:07.920
Um,

1191
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.570
you see that from the inside out.

1192
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:10.320
Yeah.

1193
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.950
And that really will sharpen your vision.

1194
00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:14.630
Mm.

1195
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.463
Okay.

1196
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:16.050
Um,

1197
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:16.950
for example,

1198
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.060
uh,

1199
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:18.960
right off the bat,

1200
00:38:18.961 --> 00:38:20.910
I pay 52% in taxes,

1201
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.410
just tear my dollar in half,

1202
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:23.551
half for many,

1203
00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:24.384
many years.

1204
00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:25.350
Um,

1205
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.660
I'm all for tripling police,

1206
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:28.440
fire,

1207
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.330
medical paramedic,

1208
00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:30.950
uh,

1209
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:35.950
emergency nursing Satra like that starting pay should be $2,500

1210
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.670
<v 1>a week and on I'm fine.</v>

1211
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.730
I would pay more tax happily.

1212
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.950
I would too if that case would be,

1213
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.670
and we would take what is a very,

1214
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.990
a set of very refined sciences and art forms.

1215
00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:54.460
Everything I just described,

1216
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:58.660
I call it the uniform because we put on a uniform and we go to work in there

1217
00:38:58.661 --> 00:39:03.661
like that on it's time to go digital and you can start making real demands in

1218
00:39:05.651 --> 00:39:06.670
terms of,

1219
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:07.923
uh,

1220
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.900
just the preparation you follow,

1221
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.190
uh,

1222
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.440
today being on the beat,

1223
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:15.640
uh,

1224
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:16.870
taking care of people,

1225
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:21.670
whether you're in first response medical or answering fire causes on par these

1226
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.671
days,

1227
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:25.930
you have to make the decisions of a seal team or where same training,

1228
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.160
where's the same gear?

1229
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.050
I went to a,

1230
00:39:29.051 --> 00:39:34.051
I was out in palm springs at the International School for tactical medicine out

1231
00:39:34.061 --> 00:39:35.560
there and the Fella's,

1232
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:37.570
we've had game wardens from Alaska.

1233
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.580
We had heavy rescue from Cleveland.

1234
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:43.880
We had all manner of folks coming through there and they all discuss,

1235
00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:45.940
well sometimes we have to share one helmet,

1236
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.670
what sometimes we don't have enough guys to do this and that.

1237
00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:54.280
So we just parked the car and let them think.

1238
00:39:54.281 --> 00:39:59.281
There's these kinds of stories follow and if you start paying people what

1239
00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:05.431
they're worth and start paying people according to what your expectations then a

1240
00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:07.391
lot of things,

1241
00:40:07.391 --> 00:40:08.290
I don't go political.

1242
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:12.720
Didn't nonsense like Charlottesville in what's happening in a lot of areas are

1243
00:40:12.721 --> 00:40:17.721
any states we'll go by the wayside as moved from no qualifications necessary to

1244
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:20.103
hey man,

1245
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:25.270
you guys work just as hard and you endanger yourself way more than a trial

1246
00:40:25.271 --> 00:40:25.870
attorney.

1247
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:26.500
Yes.

1248
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.430
I personally got out of jury duty recently by saying,

1249
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.040
uh,

1250
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.800
I didn't want to get out of jury duty.

1251
00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:33.551
In fact,

1252
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:37.390
I raised my hand when the judge says anybody here think they can do jury duty.

1253
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:38.530
You're all trying to get out of it.

1254
00:40:38.531 --> 00:40:41.050
And I raise my hand and she said,

1255
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:41.351
why?

1256
00:40:41.351 --> 00:40:41.620
I said,

1257
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:46.270
because I now can see that there are neighborhoods where everybody is.

1258
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.050
I know of neighborhoods where everybody's a liar,

1259
00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:50.920
a cheat,

1260
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.753
a cripple.

1261
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:52.541
And if they're not,

1262
00:40:52.541 --> 00:40:53.800
they're covering for somebody.

1263
00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:54.161
And she said,

1264
00:40:54.161 --> 00:40:55.180
what neighborhood is that?

1265
00:40:55.181 --> 00:40:55.630
I said,

1266
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.910
me go community in Beverly Hills.

1267
00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:03.910
The fail of almost dropped his gun.

1268
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.010
Everybody was laughing.

1269
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.380
They dismissed me too.

1270
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:09.214
Opinionated.

1271
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.210
Mr. Roth,

1272
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.920
you've had too much life experience.

1273
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.980
Actually don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.

1274
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:15.963
Yep.

1275
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.280
Have you ever done jury duty?

1276
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.611
No,

1277
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:19.444
I have not.

1278
00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:21.791
If I,

1279
00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:22.330
uh,

1280
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:25.810
if I did get in there I'd probably just tell them I think everyone's guilty.

1281
00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:27.360
Well,

1282
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.280
you have cops eyes.

1283
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:30.550
It's when you walk into the room and you know,

1284
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:31.390
everybody's lying.

1285
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.020
Nah,

1286
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:33.561
not really.

1287
00:41:33.561 --> 00:41:33.861
I mean,

1288
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:33.961
I,

1289
00:41:33.961 --> 00:41:34.310
I

1290
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.510
<v 4>probably should do it soon.</v>

1291
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:36.770
Probably be good experience for me.

1292
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:37.970
Do they ask you to do it?

1293
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.863
I'm sure it's happened.

1294
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.780
<v 1>I keep showing up.</v>

1295
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.350
The last time I actually showed up a fella,

1296
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:46.460
uh,

1297
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.630
I think it was a drive is two guys who were being accused of shooting.

1298
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:52.190
Somebody walks up,

1299
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:53.060
he's last,

1300
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:53.751
I dunno,

1301
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:55.100
it looks faintly Slavic.

1302
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:56.300
If you grew up with James Bond

1303
00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:56.771
<v 4>movies,</v>

1304
00:41:56.771 --> 00:42:00.280
everybody will know who you are.

1305
00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:04.380
You are very popular in new FIDESSA.

1306
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:05.223
Is the cough

1307
00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.540
kind of a thing?

1308
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.070
Where are you playing next?

1309
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:09.970
You're in Pasadena.

1310
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:11.581
Yeah.

1311
00:42:11.581 --> 00:42:13.090
Tell me his house all the time.

1312
00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.613
Constantly there.

1313
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.830
Do you have a vibe about the ice house?

1314
00:42:17.831 --> 00:42:19.810
Is there a Mojo to it?

1315
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:20.530
Oh yeah,

1316
00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:24.880
please explain all this comedy club in the known universe that that place has

1317
00:42:24.881 --> 00:42:29.881
been in operation since the 1960s it was originally an actual ice house where

1318
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.600
back before there was refrigeration.

1319
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:34.360
They would bring in ice and people would go to buy ice.

1320
00:42:34.361 --> 00:42:35.560
They'd have a gigantic,

1321
00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.071
you know,

1322
00:42:36.071 --> 00:42:37.960
freezer type room was insulated,

1323
00:42:37.961 --> 00:42:39.460
so it keeps the ice for a long time.

1324
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.760
Then it became like a variety type place and then somewhere in the 60s it became

1325
00:42:44.891 --> 00:42:47.290
a comedy club and it is now the oldest,

1326
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:49.210
longest running comedy club in the world.

1327
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.320
<v 1>1973</v>

1328
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:59.150
I was working as a janitor slash tech in surgery at a hospital,

1329
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.300
Pasadena.

1330
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.120
Oh,

1331
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.180
so it was night shift.

1332
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.810
Okay.

1333
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:04.643
Wow.

1334
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.020
They're early seventies we did everything.

1335
00:43:07.021 --> 00:43:11.970
It was the stepping stone to going to medical school and I was playing Acoustic

1336
00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:12.720
Guitar.

1337
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.020
Can I still take lessons playing acoustic guitar.

1338
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:17.323
Okay.

1339
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.440
And on Sunday nights,

1340
00:43:19.441 --> 00:43:20.370
audition night,

1341
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:26.120
you would sign up for audition at the ice house at six 30 they'd opened the

1342
00:43:26.341 --> 00:43:28.290
window and you would sign up.

1343
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:33.830
So I'd take my dinner break and drive my opal cadet station wagon up to the Ice

1344
00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:36.240
House,

1345
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.820
get there at about six 15 wait,

1346
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.650
they pop the window,

1347
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:45.950
sign up so that I would be one of the first three to audition after the last act

1348
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:47.911
on Sunday night,

1349
00:43:47.911 --> 00:43:51.930
which would happen right around 10 o'clock if you weren't one of the first three

1350
00:43:51.931 --> 00:43:53.100
during audition night.

1351
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:58.020
Nobody was there and they shut it down and I would sign up and go back to work

1352
00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.083
and then come,

1353
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:01.320
you know,

1354
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.400
drive myself back.

1355
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:05.070
Change Adam I and hospital stuff,

1356
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:06.223
you know,

1357
00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.840
put on the right clothes for my jeans if it ever,

1358
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.600
and I auditioned there probably 15 times.

1359
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:14.123
Wow.

1360
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:19.610
Bob Stain who owned and ran the place was just a voice over the intercom and he

1361
00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.953
was unforgiving.

1362
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.750
Bob was a famous non smiler.

1363
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.810
<v 4>What's funny is there's a Bob that owns it now,</v>

1364
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.651
Bob Fisher.

1365
00:44:30.651 --> 00:44:31.800
It couldn't be more different.

1366
00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.600
<v 2>The nicest guy on the planet earth.</v>

1367
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:34.680
Always smiling,

1368
00:44:34.681 --> 00:44:35.700
hugging everybody.

1369
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.140
Super Sweetheart of a guy.

1370
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.153
Okay,

1371
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.800
well Bob Stein was a voiceover,

1372
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:41.610
the intercom.

1373
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.050
He was hardcore,

1374
00:44:43.051 --> 00:44:43.531
you know,

1375
00:44:43.531 --> 00:44:44.070
have a,

1376
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:44.371
you go,

1377
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:44.461
well,

1378
00:44:44.461 --> 00:44:45.540
here's a little song.

1379
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:46.710
And the voice would say,

1380
00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:49.020
hopefully it's a littler than the one preceding it.

1381
00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.013
Yeah.

1382
00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.350
And you worked your chops.

1383
00:44:55.351 --> 00:44:56.184
Of course he and Bob,

1384
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.023
he was your,

1385
00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.320
he was your Ike Turner will boy.

1386
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:01.950
Yeah.

1387
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:02.850
He was unforgiving.

1388
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:08.210
And you learn quick of about timing in between transition segway,

1389
00:45:08.431 --> 00:45:12.270
you were allowed to do three songs and if he felt your song was too long or

1390
00:45:12.271 --> 00:45:12.580
your,

1391
00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.860
your riff in between,

1392
00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:14.101
is he,

1393
00:45:14.101 --> 00:45:14.251
oh,

1394
00:45:14.251 --> 00:45:15.010
he called you out.

1395
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:15.930
If you didn't like your shoes,

1396
00:45:15.931 --> 00:45:16.764
he talked about it.

1397
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:17.610
You never saw him,

1398
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.170
you heard it over the PA.

1399
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.093
Oh Wow.

1400
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:25.400
He was in the back is quite a ritual and I learned a tremendous amount about how

1401
00:45:26.731 --> 00:45:28.500
you communicate with it with a crowd.

1402
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.150
How do you talk to people as one,

1403
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.130
how do you make eye contact?

1404
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:35.160
What in fact are the wrong shoes?

1405
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.900
What are the wrong shoes?

1406
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:37.763
Platforms?

1407
00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.500
Back in the day they were platforms.

1408
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.393
Right?

1409
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.071
Okay.

1410
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:45.120
David Leibow eat.

1411
00:45:45.121 --> 00:45:49.170
We'll be singing as hopefully a shorter song than the last one.

1412
00:45:49.171 --> 00:45:50.220
He's saying last Sunday.

1413
00:45:50.221 --> 00:45:50.881
Are you the same?

1414
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:51.240
David?

1415
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:55.620
[inaudible] you would hear this over the guy over the PA system.

1416
00:45:55.621 --> 00:45:57.150
When kiss performs today,

1417
00:45:57.151 --> 00:45:58.650
do they still wear platforms?

1418
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.460
I think it's in the contract.

1419
00:46:01.461 --> 00:46:01.631
You know,

1420
00:46:01.631 --> 00:46:04.780
it's part of the outfit and Mcenroe has to yell.

1421
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.780
You gotta be fucking Keddie they for kiss.

1422
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:09.810
I had never thought of that.

1423
00:46:09.811 --> 00:46:13.350
Like they might be the last band that's wearing platforms until it.

1424
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.213
Wow.

1425
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.130
Everybody likes to make fun of platforms,

1426
00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:17.910
Bell Bottoms,

1427
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.730
sideburns till they come back around they,

1428
00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:22.800
oh there's where there was something there.

1429
00:46:22.801 --> 00:46:23.634
Sorry,

1430
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.370
I don't know about platforms on guys,

1431
00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:31.230
but on the right girl on the right you the head.

1432
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.831
Yeah,

1433
00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:32.850
I'm fine with high heels.

1434
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:33.930
Right?

1435
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:37.590
Girls in platforms do you know under the rag like oh wow.

1436
00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:39.280
That suggests different timeframes.

1437
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:40.530
I think that's the 20s.

1438
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.490
That's the 30s.

1439
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:42.870
That could be the 70s.

1440
00:46:42.871 --> 00:46:43.590
You know,

1441
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.450
there's something about those kiss ones though.

1442
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:47.970
That was like their inexorable right.

1443
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.080
They're a part of the GIG.

1444
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.610
Like with Gene Simmons,

1445
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.230
he's got demon boots like that.

1446
00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:53.870
They're still rocking him at,

1447
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:56.150
at those are new and improved costumes too.

1448
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.353
Those are digital.

1449
00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.100
They're definitely new and improved.

1450
00:46:59.370 --> 00:46:59.611
Uh,

1451
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:00.690
I like the boots.

1452
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:01.973
I like it,

1453
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:02.281
man.

1454
00:47:02.281 --> 00:47:04.320
That has gotta be fucking hell on your knees though.

1455
00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.660
That's got to be hell on your lower back.

1456
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.460
All of the above.

1457
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:10.320
I'm going to leap ahead,

1458
00:47:10.321 --> 00:47:11.154
but look,

1459
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.350
Stanley's still in shape.

1460
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:14.430
Oh He's,

1461
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:15.270
he looks great.

1462
00:47:15.271 --> 00:47:16.470
He was here a couple of years ago.

1463
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.750
You know,

1464
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:17.880
this is where I failed.

1465
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.810
I should've gone kiss blue man group years ago.

1466
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.170
To those of you who are my age lassie,

1467
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:26.400
there should be four of me.

1468
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:27.451
Oh,

1469
00:47:27.451 --> 00:47:28.141
that's the move,

1470
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:28.381
right?

1471
00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:29.920
Because yeah,

1472
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:31.780
no one could tell.

1473
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.020
Right.

1474
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:32.471
That's the thing.

1475
00:47:32.471 --> 00:47:36.580
Like you could replace a lot of those guys and if you didn't tell anybody,

1476
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:39.730
and as long as someone's w have you ever heard the Japanese gentlemen that's a,

1477
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:42.430
he does a Steve Perry impression.

1478
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:44.440
He's the new lead singer for journey.

1479
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:44.861
Oh,

1480
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:45.250
he's,

1481
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:46.750
I think he's from Philippines.

1482
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:47.081
Oh,

1483
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:48.490
is he Japanese?

1484
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.210
Eighth Way.

1485
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:51.400
Fucking phenomenal from the guy.

1486
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:53.920
Sounds exactly like Steve Perry.

1487
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.210
Alright,

1488
00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:57.760
well this solicit an interesting subject.

1489
00:47:57.761 --> 00:47:58.810
Perhaps compels it,

1490
00:47:59.310 --> 00:47:59.860
um,

1491
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:04.860
are some bands like west side story where you can continually revitalize the

1492
00:48:05.201 --> 00:48:06.100
production,

1493
00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:06.431
right?

1494
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:07.270
With different actors.

1495
00:48:07.271 --> 00:48:08.890
It with different actors.

1496
00:48:08.891 --> 00:48:09.340
Okay.

1497
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.140
A whole lot of Shakespeare going on.

1498
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:11.610
Yeah.

1499
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:12.420
Okay.

1500
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.253
Um,

1501
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.900
but you have to kind of replicate the initial sound,

1502
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:17.980
or do you,

1503
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:22.330
as I'm sure all of Beethoven's early orchestras or debt debt is fried chest,

1504
00:48:22.331 --> 00:48:27.250
because I don't think you can say this because this was a part of my youth van

1505
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:28.990
Halen was a part of my youth.

1506
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:29.471
I mean,

1507
00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:30.490
we used to have to chew the,

1508
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.490
the van Halen logo on our notebooks in high school,

1509
00:48:33.491 --> 00:48:37.400
along with the rolling stones like the mouth and you know,

1510
00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:42.010
I'll kiss logo when it switched over to Sammy Hagar.

1511
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.020
It became a different thing.

1512
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:45.370
It was a different thing.

1513
00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:46.330
There's a whole different pivot.

1514
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:46.691
I mean,

1515
00:48:46.691 --> 00:48:47.470
it wasn't,

1516
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:48.670
it wasn't a bad thing.

1517
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:48.870
No,

1518
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:49.190
no.

1519
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:50.620
But it was a thing.

1520
00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:50.980
Shane,

1521
00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:53.530
all of Shams lyrics contained love.

1522
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:54.220
Yes.

1523
00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:54.580
Okay.

1524
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.930
Why can't this be love?

1525
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.360
And I ain't talking about lovely,

1526
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:01.780
right back with more fighting after this.

1527
00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:03.570
Yeah.

1528
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:04.403
We can come on.

1529
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.080
Who Do I jog with?

1530
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:06.511
I don't,

1531
00:49:06.511 --> 00:49:08.380
I run who's my running partner?

1532
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:11.051
Yeah.

1533
00:49:11.051 --> 00:49:11.771
Running with the devil.

1534
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:12.130
Hello.

1535
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:12.460
Okay.

1536
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.240
You want to keep going?

1537
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:13.540
Yeah,

1538
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.140
keep going.

1539
00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:14.973
Should I jump?

1540
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:15.980
I jump.

1541
00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:16.661
Might as well jump.

1542
00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:17.494
Thank you.

1543
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.261
Yeah.

1544
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:23.561
I mean,

1545
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:24.394
come on.

1546
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:26.860
It's a questions in love Ra.

1547
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:27.694
Great.

1548
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.593
Uh,

1549
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.910
classically that's [inaudible].

1550
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:31.840
Yeah.

1551
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.530
Okay.

1552
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:32.980
Um,

1553
00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:33.760
but I'm,

1554
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.080
I'm not well adjusted.

1555
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.750
Nobody in my job ever was much less,

1556
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:40.060
kept it this long and I faced it.

1557
00:49:40.061 --> 00:49:40.894
Embraced it.

1558
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:41.993
Where's

1559
00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:44.183
your phone?

1560
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:44.951
Oh No,

1561
00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:46.300
it's all right there in the lyrics.

1562
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:46.750
Yeah.

1563
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:50.830
Even using what are considered classic music parlor tricks,

1564
00:49:50.831 --> 00:49:55.831
taking a very shad lyric and positioning it against a very happy piece of music.

1565
00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.540
The music is romping itch,

1566
00:49:58.570 --> 00:49:59.050
itch,

1567
00:49:59.050 --> 00:49:59.411
itch,

1568
00:49:59.411 --> 00:50:00.130
uh,

1569
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:00.311
uh,

1570
00:50:00.311 --> 00:50:01.001
heavy metal,

1571
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:01.510
Rumba,

1572
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.990
booboo,

1573
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:06.070
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo doop in the lyric is she's crying.

1574
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.210
Yeah.

1575
00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:08.043
Jamie's crime.

1576
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.180
You didn't notice that.

1577
00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:11.890
Yeah.

1578
00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:12.720
It's,

1579
00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:13.130
it's,

1580
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.530
it.

1581
00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:18.530
There's a sense there's a sense of larceny does chaos to him in the lyric.

1582
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:24.150
There's this sense of a itch music for after midnight when we're all guilty.

1583
00:50:24.581 --> 00:50:25.060
Joan.

1584
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:25.893
Yeah.

1585
00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.033
Whereas,

1586
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.130
and again,

1587
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.020
<v 4>nothing wrong with the Sammy Hagar thing,</v>

1588
00:50:30.021 --> 00:50:31.820
but it moved into a mall crowd.

1589
00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:33.470
It was a different sort of a vibe.

1590
00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:33.780
It was,

1591
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.750
it was a good vibe for a lot of folks.

1592
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.190
But it was a different vibe.

1593
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.390
Um,

1594
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:40.370
I mean I don't have anything against Sammy Hagar.

1595
00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:41.210
I think he's wonderful.

1596
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:42.260
I always loved that song.

1597
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:44.720
Can't drive 55 he's got some great shit,

1598
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:48.260
but I never listened to the van Halen with Van Hagar.

1599
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:49.250
I just didn't listen to it.

1600
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:51.260
To me it was like I was an end of an era.

1601
00:50:51.261 --> 00:50:53.390
For me it's true dear for folks.

1602
00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:53.780
Yes,

1603
00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.330
I wanted to be the art project,

1604
00:50:56.331 --> 00:50:57.210
not just where one

1605
00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.270
show by placing everything we've discussed.

1606
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:04.370
If you think of it as cross training,

1607
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:05.720
that's a great rationale.

1608
00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.640
Why did you do that and then you did this and why it's crossed,

1609
00:51:09.641 --> 00:51:09.920
trained.

1610
00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.210
He's got to reinform your shower.

1611
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:14.930
It's going to reinforce the way your stagecraft,

1612
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:19.400
how you even walk out on stage and your choice of what to wear,

1613
00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:22.790
who follow your sense of humor especially.

1614
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:25.970
Well that's a great way to look at what you were talking about with the west

1615
00:51:25.971 --> 00:51:26.240
side,

1616
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:31.240
west side story analogy because it kind of went on but it Kinda didn't.

1617
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.430
It's like if you took west side story in the change the story,

1618
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.200
you can't change the story.

1619
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:37.730
But you can change the voices.

1620
00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:38.301
Okay.

1621
00:51:38.301 --> 00:51:40.190
But it would be a different story.

1622
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:44.180
Like the van Halen story became a different story.

1623
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.421
All right.

1624
00:51:44.421 --> 00:51:44.631
Here,

1625
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:45.560
I'll venture this.

1626
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:46.160
Okay.

1627
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:46.401
Uh,

1628
00:51:46.401 --> 00:51:50.450
one of my favorite freeze dried bands in history is toto.

1629
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.910
The last why freeze dried.

1630
00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:53.331
Well,

1631
00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:54.890
all freeze dried coffee looks the same

1632
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:57.763
and it's great.

1633
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.590
I've been camping and man,

1634
00:52:00.591 --> 00:52:03.470
there's nothing better than just a cup of fresh freeze dried.

1635
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:04.141
Get it in the rural,

1636
00:52:04.141 --> 00:52:05.360
in the wrongest places.

1637
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:06.301
That's fun.

1638
00:52:06.301 --> 00:52:07.490
Some context.

1639
00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:10.050
It's the best thing you could ever hear that after those songs.

1640
00:52:10.051 --> 00:52:10.760
A good song.

1641
00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.910
It's an amazing Smithsonian level.

1642
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:14.340
Yes.

1643
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.173
Song.

1644
00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:15.591
Okay.

1645
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:16.940
Rosanna and so forth.

1646
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:18.140
Amazing.

1647
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.890
Any of the fellows could walk up to me and I wouldn't recognize him.

1648
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.610
No.

1649
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:22.930
You know,

1650
00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:24.830
I said would not recognize them.

1651
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:28.520
Fairly say is the greatest genius in all of music in that regard.

1652
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:29.413
Steve Miller,

1653
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.430
nobody knows who the fuck Steve Miller is.

1654
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.400
Steve Olds.

1655
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:33.240
Yeah.

1656
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.220
But mean he had some,

1657
00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.650
every Hammond knows those songs.

1658
00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:37.480
If you stay,

1659
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.480
if you even,

1660
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:39.713
uh,

1661
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:41.440
start to play Du,

1662
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:41.830
Du,

1663
00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:41.990
Du,

1664
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.110
Du,

1665
00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:42.231
Du,

1666
00:52:42.231 --> 00:52:43.010
Du,

1667
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.590
Du,

1668
00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:43.910
Du,

1669
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:44.041
Du,

1670
00:52:44.041 --> 00:52:44.260
Du,

1671
00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:44.591
Du,

1672
00:52:44.591 --> 00:52:49.190
and everybody was getting ready to Sing Tanga love God damn.

1673
00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:51.590
He had some jams and that guy could go anywhere.

1674
00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:56.200
And then there are artists where you just can't replace it.

1675
00:52:56.210 --> 00:53:01.210
Rod Stewart arguably one of the best vocals in history of any genre all

1676
00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:02.150
together.

1677
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.780
Oh yeah.

1678
00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.940
That's a no weight division thing and yeah,

1679
00:53:04.941 --> 00:53:06.110
one of the all time greats.

1680
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.180
The Ali is probably Rod Stewart.

1681
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.720
Yeah.

1682
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:09.553
Okay.

1683
00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:09.940
Um,

1684
00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:10.880
his songs,

1685
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:12.590
you can have other people sing them,

1686
00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:17.591
but in a comes something other now journey I would recognize the guitar player,

1687
00:53:18.711 --> 00:53:21.710
but that's just because I listened to that kind of,

1688
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.000
that part of the band.

1689
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:23.953
Okay.

1690
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:26.280
My favorite part of the orchestra is the Gong.

1691
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:29.040
<v 1>Just want to clarify that.</v>

1692
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.983
But uh,

1693
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:32.580
uh,

1694
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:34.500
Steve Perry who sang for journey.

1695
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:35.363
Okay.

1696
00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:36.060
Um,

1697
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.640
was not so much a personality as an eloquent sound.

1698
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:39.390
Yes.

1699
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:39.900
All right.

1700
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.110
So it's a universal sound and if you even get close to it,

1701
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.740
it is part of every prom,

1702
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:48.120
every wedding,

1703
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:51.300
every going in and coming out party.

1704
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:52.163
Okay.

1705
00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.170
If you're going into the engine,

1706
00:53:55.171 --> 00:53:55.920
the army,

1707
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.830
that's the last song the band's going to apply.

1708
00:53:57.850 --> 00:53:58.980
You're coming out of jail.

1709
00:53:59.130 --> 00:53:59.520
They're going to,

1710
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.660
your girlfriend's going to pull it.

1711
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:04.110
You throw your bag to the side and run.

1712
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.010
You've seen the movie.

1713
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:05.580
Yes.

1714
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.210
Okay.

1715
00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:07.470
Even Tony Soprano,

1716
00:54:07.471 --> 00:54:08.550
we're not sure what happened,

1717
00:54:08.551 --> 00:54:09.660
but it happened to journey.

1718
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:10.350
Yes,

1719
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:11.070
true.

1720
00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:11.903
That's right.

1721
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:12.660
Yeah.

1722
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.493
Right.

1723
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:14.101
Okay.

1724
00:54:14.101 --> 00:54:15.600
That's very significant.

1725
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:20.340
You can't play a David Lee Roth Hassan and still worry about Tony Soprano.

1726
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.433
That's true.

1727
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.930
Your half of your mind is going to go,

1728
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.531
wait a minute.

1729
00:54:25.531 --> 00:54:28.490
The long ranger just walked in to the same diner that Tony is.

1730
00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:31.260
It's why I have no acting career.

1731
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:33.840
I'm already a character.

1732
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:37.020
Lone ranger sits down next to you,

1733
00:54:37.021 --> 00:54:37.890
says Joe,

1734
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:39.570
there's a forest.

1735
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:42.990
It's a dark forest and you're not getting lost in any story.

1736
00:54:42.991 --> 00:54:43.741
You're sitting in your legs.

1737
00:54:43.741 --> 00:54:45.180
You go in is the fucking lone ranger.

1738
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.990
Right,

1739
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.381
right,

1740
00:54:49.381 --> 00:54:50.214
right,

1741
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:51.390
right.

1742
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:55.800
A good actor and sit down and go a dark forest and you're fucking scared.

1743
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:56.743
Right.

1744
00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:59.310
Some people can become that other person.

1745
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.270
Oh yeah,

1746
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.280
and then some people are stuck being David Lee Roth.

1747
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:03.170
Exactly.

1748
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.541
You know,

1749
00:55:03.541 --> 00:55:05.630
Denzel walks out and then it's face and he go,

1750
00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:05.851
wow,

1751
00:55:05.851 --> 00:55:06.720
that's an astronaut.

1752
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:07.590
He can be anything.

1753
00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:08.280
And he's going to have,

1754
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:08.630
you know,

1755
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:09.463
either

1756
00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:12.020
Dave Roth comes,

1757
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:12.331
he goes,

1758
00:55:12.331 --> 00:55:13.650
what's Dave doing in a space suit?

1759
00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.240
Right,

1760
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.073
exactly.

1761
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.770
Yeah.

1762
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:17.603
We're not buying it.

1763
00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:18.453
Yeah.

1764
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.190
I'm already a kind of a,

1765
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:22.040
uh,

1766
00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.880
a cultural yeah,

1767
00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:24.723
you're already,

1768
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:25.860
you're already a thing.

1769
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:27.480
Yeah.

1770
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:27.850
That's a,

1771
00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:28.441
that's a,

1772
00:55:28.441 --> 00:55:33.180
that's really interesting how there's all these great bands with great sounds

1773
00:55:33.181 --> 00:55:35.280
and great vibes and they're all different.

1774
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.660
Well,

1775
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:36.931
you,

1776
00:55:36.931 --> 00:55:40.020
if you think in terms of the personality,

1777
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.160
let's think of a band.

1778
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:41.581
Oh,

1779
00:55:41.581 --> 00:55:43.050
I just saw John Mayer.

1780
00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.550
Great show.

1781
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.390
All right.

1782
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.130
And when you think of John,

1783
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:52.850
you think of who that is and the neighborhood and the vibe and the mood before

1784
00:55:53.581 --> 00:55:55.620
perhaps you even think of a specific song.

1785
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.353
Okay.

1786
00:55:57.490 --> 00:55:57.810
Um,

1787
00:55:57.810 --> 00:55:58.950
as soon as you know,

1788
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.570
well I know his heads,

1789
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:01.650
I know his songs,

1790
00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:06.240
but it was the same thing that the fellows in the grateful dead who said they're

1791
00:56:06.241 --> 00:56:09.570
identifying that vibe is what's more important.

1792
00:56:09.571 --> 00:56:11.010
The jokes or the person.

1793
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.460
What's more important you or specific jokes?

1794
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:19.740
Cause some of your jokes are bound to have a go flat.

1795
00:56:19.741 --> 00:56:20.131
I don't care.

1796
00:56:20.131 --> 00:56:20.964
It's chow.

1797
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:21.811
Yeah.

1798
00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:22.644
But some of the Joe,

1799
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:23.470
the only way they,

1800
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.921
some of them,

1801
00:56:23.921 --> 00:56:24.010
the

1802
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.690
<v 4>only way they work is with you.</v>

1803
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:28.840
Like there's some people like Mitch Hedberg is perfect example.

1804
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:32.560
Like you couldn't separate Mitch Hedberg from the jokes cause he was the jokes.

1805
00:56:32.561 --> 00:56:34.330
He was part of what made it funny.

1806
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:36.663
You're right.

1807
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:38.890
I ran into Geoffrey rush the other day.

1808
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:39.551
Okay.

1809
00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:40.031
And he did.

1810
00:56:40.031 --> 00:56:41.260
Mike bumps in Italian.

1811
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:42.303
Yeah.

1812
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:43.780
Who's managing them?

1813
00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:46.060
That's a movie happening.

1814
00:56:46.061 --> 00:56:46.631
Those two.

1815
00:56:46.631 --> 00:56:46.931
Right.

1816
00:56:46.931 --> 00:56:47.410
That's wild.

1817
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:49.800
That's math al lemon fortune cookie.

1818
00:56:49.801 --> 00:56:50.530
Yes.

1819
00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:50.831
Okay.

1820
00:56:50.831 --> 00:56:51.101
Judge.

1821
00:56:51.101 --> 00:56:53.380
Only a billion dollar fucking franchises.

1822
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.900
Bernie Brillstein stole alive.

1823
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:55.743
Get after this.

1824
00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:56.451
Bernie's a lot.

1825
00:56:56.451 --> 00:56:57.284
When you get an agent,

1826
00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.020
it's stellar.

1827
00:56:59.020 --> 00:56:59.890
Yes it is.

1828
00:56:59.891 --> 00:57:00.320
It is.

1829
00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:04.060
If they were walking around in the park doing warmup for their routine,

1830
00:57:04.061 --> 00:57:04.391
you know,

1831
00:57:04.391 --> 00:57:06.280
and the Netflix special and I'm going,

1832
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.990
uh,

1833
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.823
uh,

1834
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:10.190
I expect the clapboard,

1835
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.680
woody Allen to walk out and go.

1836
00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:12.880
I think that's a take.

1837
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.060
I think though that with guys like that,

1838
00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:19.780
especially those two guys eat the best product is them on stage.

1839
00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:20.831
Them fucking around.

1840
00:57:20.831 --> 00:57:22.040
You really don't want to make a movie.

1841
00:57:22.041 --> 00:57:23.830
You just want to keep doing what they're doing with Netflix.

1842
00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:24.520
Well this is the,

1843
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.300
this is the vibe.

1844
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.130
You have them be theirs.

1845
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:30.980
There's some folks like a Jason straighten them.

1846
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:32.711
She always just shame.

1847
00:57:32.711 --> 00:57:33.160
So shame.

1848
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:33.580
Haircut.

1849
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:34.413
Yeah.

1850
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:36.700
He's always Jason.

1851
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.160
Yes.

1852
00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:37.420
Right.

1853
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.030
But this Jason in a different time period,

1854
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:41.320
right.

1855
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.850
Jason in a fast cars.

1856
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:44.050
Jason on a horse.

1857
00:57:44.051 --> 00:57:44.884
I don't know.

1858
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.930
He's,

1859
00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:47.500
he's always that.

1860
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:49.390
And this is what compels me.

1861
00:57:49.391 --> 00:57:52.690
Some folks are very joked dependent now take my wife please.

1862
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:53.460
Yeah.

1863
00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:54.293
That kind of thing.

1864
00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:55.493
Um,

1865
00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:56.510
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1866
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:57.343
<v 4>Yourself</v>

1867
00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:03.650
is the audience that you see when it's like at the comedy club I've seen yet the

1868
00:58:05.221 --> 00:58:06.054
comedy club.

1869
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:07.320
Um,

1870
00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.230
it's just same audience.

1871
00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:09.064
Just fight night.

1872
00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:09.780
No,

1873
00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:10.740
I was sometimes,

1874
00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:11.520
yeah.

1875
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:11.731
Yeah.

1876
00:58:11.731 --> 00:58:13.350
It's real similar in a weird way.

1877
00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:14.131
Why was it weird?

1878
00:58:14.131 --> 00:58:14.761
I see the eye.

1879
00:58:14.761 --> 00:58:15.121
She,

1880
00:58:15.121 --> 00:58:15.300
uh,

1881
00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:16.640
George Michael eyebrows like,

1882
00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:19.020
cause I'm always trying to figure it out.

1883
00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.150
Um,

1884
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.331
yeah,

1885
00:58:20.331 --> 00:58:20.630
they're,

1886
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:21.540
they're real similar.

1887
00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:22.170
You know,

1888
00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:23.370
it's a weird crossover,

1889
00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.200
but what makes it weird?

1890
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:29.220
It's weird that I do cage fighting commentary and standup comedy in the first

1891
00:58:29.221 --> 00:58:29.521
place.

1892
00:58:29.521 --> 00:58:31.470
It's weird that those two things work together.

1893
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:31.621
Oh,

1894
00:58:31.621 --> 00:58:32.280
that doesn't,

1895
00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:33.060
that doesn't,

1896
00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.720
uh,

1897
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:33.901
no,

1898
00:58:33.901 --> 00:58:34.830
that makes perfect chef for,

1899
00:58:34.831 --> 00:58:35.980
you know,

1900
00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:36.740
you're,

1901
00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.040
I just shared with somebody.

1902
00:58:38.041 --> 00:58:38.611
I'm funny.

1903
00:58:38.611 --> 00:58:39.444
Not Happy.

1904
00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:40.923
Yes.

1905
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:41.761
Funny.

1906
00:58:41.761 --> 00:58:42.594
You ain't happy.

1907
00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:46.710
There's a big difference in the more unhappy you,

1908
00:58:46.711 --> 00:58:47.460
you are,

1909
00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:47.941
the better.

1910
00:58:47.941 --> 00:58:48.570
The funny.

1911
00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:49.410
Really think so.

1912
00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:50.370
Absolutely.

1913
00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:50.820
Really?

1914
00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:52.620
If you know how to channel it,

1915
00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.000
well,

1916
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.040
it's certainly the case in some situations.

1917
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.200
Uh,

1918
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:56.520
I'm,

1919
00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:59.610
I'm open to all possibilities when it comes to comedy.

1920
00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:03.150
I know people that are really happy and really funny and I know people that are

1921
00:59:03.151 --> 00:59:04.620
really dark and also really funny.

1922
00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:05.630
Like,

1923
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:06.270
I don't know,

1924
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.601
it's just,

1925
00:59:06.601 --> 00:59:07.650
it's different.

1926
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.910
It's different with different people.

1927
00:59:08.911 --> 00:59:13.911
Just like music is different with different bands and different singers existed.

1928
00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.300
He either works or it doesn't.

1929
00:59:15.301 --> 00:59:19.830
It really depends upon how much time and effort you take working on yourself,

1930
00:59:19.831 --> 00:59:20.550
your act,

1931
00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:21.383
your,

1932
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:21.980
the

1933
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.880
<v 1>way you deliver it.</v>

1934
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.580
We always had to win in Van Halen.

1935
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:26.750
We had no choice.

1936
00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.460
We had to win the battle of the bands.

1937
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:29.660
It was competitive.

1938
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.120
We had to win over the club owner.

1939
00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.310
This was before there were dance system.

1940
00:59:34.311 --> 00:59:35.620
Cerwin Vega hadn't,

1941
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:38.660
hadn't figured out those base binge yet.

1942
00:59:38.661 --> 00:59:39.740
And you had to have a live band,

1943
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:42.160
five 45 minute sets a night place.

1944
00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:46.160
A motherfucker closer song where you knew a band couldn't go on.

1945
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:47.390
I have to you look ranch.

1946
00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.240
Yeah.

1947
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.073
Oh yeah.

1948
00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:51.983
Uh,

1949
00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:53.690
we were pretty good at anything.

1950
00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:55.130
We had no development phase.

1951
00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:56.143
Mm.

1952
00:59:56.350 --> 00:59:56.960
Um,

1953
00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.640
I have tapes of us at the Hilton Hotel in Pasadena in 1973.

1954
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:03.380
You would if I didn't tell Ya,

1955
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.060
you know,

1956
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.100
you would think it was three years ago.

1957
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:07.580
Wow.

1958
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.391
Kind of a sound.

1959
01:00:08.391 --> 01:00:10.040
There's virtually no development.

1960
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.971
How'd that happen?

1961
01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:11.930
How did it work that way?

1962
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:13.790
We had classical training.

1963
01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.510
Ah,

1964
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.870
right.

1965
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:19.610
And this kind of speaks to what we were discussing earlier in that a lot of my

1966
01:00:19.611 --> 01:00:24.611
colleagues are having a great time making music and they celebrate and it's,

1967
01:00:25.461 --> 01:00:26.120
uh,

1968
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.700
the word fun comes into it.

1969
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:33.200
And we grew up in classical music backgrounds where you had to challenge for

1970
01:00:33.201 --> 01:00:35.960
first chair saxophone every six,

1971
01:00:35.961 --> 01:00:36.501
eight months,

1972
01:00:36.501 --> 01:00:37.940
you gotta go to the conductor and say,

1973
01:00:37.941 --> 01:00:38.930
I want for his chair.

1974
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.410
And if you're first chair and he thinks I have a shy,

1975
01:00:42.411 --> 01:00:44.870
he's going to come over and Joyce's Roths talking bout you.

1976
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.213
Whoo.

1977
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:47.030
You both,

1978
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:50.630
you both going to play this piece in front of the orchestra next Wednesday,

1979
01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:52.160
you best practice.

1980
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:53.143
Ah,

1981
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:54.080
okay.

1982
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:59.080
And we'll both get up and we'll both play 18 bars of the same piece and there

1983
01:01:00.171 --> 01:01:03.200
just may be a switch in front of a 120 people.

1984
01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.400
All of them colleagues.

1985
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:06.283
All right.

1986
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.900
We learned from the music school,

1987
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:09.531
you know,

1988
01:01:09.531 --> 01:01:11.120
the racy stuff was big band.

1989
01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.613
All right.

1990
01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.450
If you're in terms of,

1991
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:14.981
you know,

1992
01:01:14.981 --> 01:01:15.470
uh,

1993
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:17.780
we played rocket role in parallel,

1994
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:19.790
but big band,

1995
01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:24.170
it's got a square vibe to it because it wound up in elevators in restaurants and

1996
01:01:24.171 --> 01:01:25.004
whatever.

1997
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.660
But they had cut and contests and there was nothing more cutting than Benny

1998
01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.710
Goodman versus chick Webb,

1999
01:01:30.711 --> 01:01:32.540
big band at Roseland ballroom.

2000
01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:33.374
That shit is on.

2001
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.180
People would bet on it.

2002
01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.460
They would play the same four songs.

2003
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:41.570
You play your version of it and we'll play ours.

2004
01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.213
Wow.

2005
01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.173
Yeah.

2006
01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:49.430
Wow.

2007
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:50.660
Throw down a big band.

2008
01:01:50.661 --> 01:01:51.271
Throw out.

2009
01:01:51.271 --> 01:01:52.104
Oh yeah.

2010
01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.020
And it was furious shit too.

2011
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:54.441
You know,

2012
01:01:54.441 --> 01:01:55.970
it wasn't like friendly.

2013
01:01:57.010 --> 01:02:00.650
The dancers would stand in the middle of those sparks and that's where you get

2014
01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:01.484
that.

2015
01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.151
Yeah.

2016
01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:05.690
He's postures that stuff like this.

2017
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:06.590
Okay.

2018
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.270
And the dancers were competing.

2019
01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:09.440
The Lindy hoppers could be,

2020
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.821
wow,

2021
01:02:10.821 --> 01:02:11.630
Frankie can,

2022
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:12.680
you know all these guys,

2023
01:02:12.681 --> 01:02:13.514
throw it.

2024
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:14.503
Um,

2025
01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.070
so it was competitive and we learn that's how you do it.

2026
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.310
You know,

2027
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:21.750
<v 2>my two mentors in,</v>

2028
01:02:21.751 --> 01:02:22.584
um,

2029
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:23.580
uh,

2030
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.750
music or,

2031
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:25.584
uh,

2032
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:27.240
first and second chair clarinet,

2033
01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.620
the La Philharmonic,

2034
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.650
and he comes from that

2035
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:34.111
also,

2036
01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:34.800
you know,

2037
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.630
you have a whole different vibe that,

2038
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:37.483
uh,

2039
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.720
I'll take a grateful dead approach,

2040
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.620
which is the complete opposite of that competition,

2041
01:02:43.621 --> 01:02:43.920
man.

2042
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.860
Leave that at home.

2043
01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:45.570
Yeah.

2044
01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:46.230
You know,

2045
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.561
well,

2046
01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:48.000
we're here to celebrate and so,

2047
01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:50.070
and I completely understand.

2048
01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:51.360
That's where I'll go.

2049
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:52.500
Aft Work,

2050
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:55.920
take my vest off.

2051
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.400
But my goodness,

2052
01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.570
it took a totally different turn.

2053
01:03:00.571 --> 01:03:00.811
Right?

2054
01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:01.111
They said,

2055
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:01.610
go ahead,

2056
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:02.910
take all of our shows.

2057
01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.970
Come sell food in the parking lot,

2058
01:03:05.971 --> 01:03:06.570
man.

2059
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:10.590
We had to when we or we didn't eat boxing for money,

2060
01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.390
it's different than boxing for fun.

2061
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.990
Right?

2062
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:13.380
Right.

2063
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.090
Learned that very early and uh,

2064
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.190
we learned it through music.

2065
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:17.911
Yeah.

2066
01:03:17.911 --> 01:03:18.121
You know,

2067
01:03:18.121 --> 01:03:19.640
some of the folks learn it in the rank.

2068
01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:25.130
Other folks learn it in their first few days in a law firm or,

2069
01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.670
and they join a team.

2070
01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.710
It's interesting the way you described it with music,

2071
01:03:28.711 --> 01:03:30.510
because I try to explain that to comedians.

2072
01:03:30.511 --> 01:03:34.980
I say think about how much time a musician has to spend practicing and how

2073
01:03:34.981 --> 01:03:36.390
little we spend practicing.

2074
01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:37.050
We were,

2075
01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:39.570
our practice is in front of the audience for the most part.

2076
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:43.620
It's just simplified version of the 10 big apartment.

2077
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:47.460
A simplified version of the,

2078
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:51.810
how many hours rule is the 10,000 hours you've heard about it.

2079
01:03:51.811 --> 01:03:52.470
Yes.

2080
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:54.030
That's a very simplified version.

2081
01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:54.750
Okay.

2082
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.130
That's digestible.

2083
01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:57.630
10,000 hours.

2084
01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.230
I Dunno,

2085
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:59.070
you break that down.

2086
01:03:59.071 --> 01:04:02.520
Was it take a six years maybe something like this.

2087
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:08.040
The True Asian paradigm is 10 hours a day.

2088
01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:10.590
Every single day for 10 years.

2089
01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:13.960
If you have a little,

2090
01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.210
a little kid and he's got to have heart surgery,

2091
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:18.570
you want that guy,

2092
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:19.050
right?

2093
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:20.760
It's right around 30,000 hours.

2094
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:25.700
If you're going to go flying in a helicopter over New York,

2095
01:04:25.701 --> 01:04:26.534
Shitty,

2096
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.690
you want captain Paulie Trim on Todd,

2097
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.230
it's about 40,000 hours.

2098
01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.053
Okay?

2099
01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.373
Uh,

2100
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:34.371
my dentist,

2101
01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:39.010
Doctor Glassman who teaches is a 40,000 hour man.

2102
01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.053
Okay?

2103
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:44.450
So if you ever crash or get pelted gimme call,

2104
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:49.820
I will hook you up.

2105
01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.750
It's about 30,000 hours in,

2106
01:04:53.751 --> 01:04:55.010
that's 10 hours a day,

2107
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:57.620
every single day for 10 years.

2108
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.330
And that's what creates,

2109
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.400
uh,

2110
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.400
a jet pilot,

2111
01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:02.990
a great surgeon,

2112
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:04.683
a great writer.

2113
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:06.181
Yeah.

2114
01:05:06.181 --> 01:05:06.920
Well,

2115
01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.120
anything in the arts and letters,

2116
01:05:08.121 --> 01:05:08.301
that's,

2117
01:05:08.301 --> 01:05:09.320
that's the architect.

2118
01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.440
Unless you're a prodigy and you feel bungle that and typing it's tragedy very

2119
01:05:15.651 --> 01:05:16.484
easily.

2120
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:18.040
So yeah,

2121
01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:20.440
pride and joys and tragedies often go hand in hand.

2122
01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:23.470
There's something about people that get things very easily that for whatever

2123
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:23.771
reason,

2124
01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:25.840
it slips through their fingers more quickly as well.

2125
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:29.560
When my shifts or my dad was an eye surgeon.

2126
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:30.250
Okay.

2127
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:32.050
Did well and uh,

2128
01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:33.340
uh,

2129
01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.330
when my sisters,

2130
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.320
uh,

2131
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:36.610
wanting to go to college,

2132
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:37.031
he should,

2133
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:39.190
I think that's a great idea and made her pay for it.

2134
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.103
Oh,

2135
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.450
she wouldn't value it if she didn't pay for it herself.

2136
01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:45.100
That's probably right.

2137
01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:50.100
I signed my first contract when I was $1,350 stereo and a three records.

2138
01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:56.560
I worked all summer shoveling shit at the local a horse stable.

2139
01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.490
It's where I learned Spanish.

2140
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.730
I don't know that you got it.

2141
01:06:00.731 --> 01:06:01.564
Do that.

2142
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:04.710
You learned the same thing from sports.

2143
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.530
Yeah.

2144
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:06.050
Yeah.

2145
01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:07.020
Your kids do sports.

2146
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:07.560
Yeah.

2147
01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.393
Which ones?

2148
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:09.390
Um,

2149
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:12.630
martial arts and a one of them is really into gymnastics.

2150
01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.170
Yeah.

2151
01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:13.830
Yeah.

2152
01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:15.900
Are they competitive in it or are they,

2153
01:06:15.901 --> 01:06:17.400
do they enjoy themselves?

2154
01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:18.211
Are they on team?

2155
01:06:18.211 --> 01:06:21.900
Like there are tournaments or,

2156
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:24.180
and is that something that

2157
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:26.543
the get y'all here,

2158
01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.141
I'll back up.

2159
01:06:28.141 --> 01:06:29.220
I'm leading up to something.

2160
01:06:29.221 --> 01:06:30.054
Can you get,

2161
01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.130
I think you always are folks.

2162
01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:38.030
Folks are starting to recognize certain traits in me as in I really like the

2163
01:06:39.271 --> 01:06:41.340
getting ready more than the actual show.

2164
01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.070
Really.

2165
01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:44.220
You actual show.

2166
01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.860
I'm making fun here and be being poetic,

2167
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:48.630
but the monitor blows.

2168
01:06:48.631 --> 01:06:49.830
The guitar players pissed

2169
01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.360
the spotlights on the wrong guy.

2170
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:57.760
I have a cold but that six months,

2171
01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.490
six weeks leading up to it,

2172
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.630
I remember the rehearsal,

2173
01:07:00.631 --> 01:07:02.390
we did it if it's a thing and hey,

2174
01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:05.880
when we recorded the track over that they remember when we got measured for the

2175
01:07:05.881 --> 01:07:06.930
shoes that fucking,

2176
01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:07.381
oh,

2177
01:07:07.381 --> 01:07:08.840
it was great and it's,

2178
01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:10.260
where did we eat after that?

2179
01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.180
I got to go back there and Andy,

2180
01:07:12.181 --> 01:07:12.601
Andy,

2181
01:07:12.601 --> 01:07:13.080
Andy,

2182
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:13.830
yeah.

2183
01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:18.830
I always shot to make those rehearsals and whatever as memorable as possible

2184
01:07:19.411 --> 01:07:23.970
because you can do a whole lot more getting ready then are throwing the punch.

2185
01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:24.600
Yeah.

2186
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.340
Ask anybody on one of your shows.

2187
01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:27.390
Yes.

2188
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:28.223
Yeah.

2189
01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:29.623
Yeah.

2190
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:32.070
You have such a great insight for that though.

2191
01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.450
You know some people they,

2192
01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:35.340
even if they're aware of it,

2193
01:07:35.341 --> 01:07:37.380
they're not consciously aware of it.

2194
01:07:37.381 --> 01:07:39.300
They're not focusing on all these details.

2195
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:41.190
The getting ready.

2196
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:45.310
He's as much of a,

2197
01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:49.060
if the band says they don't like rehearsing,

2198
01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:49.894
you're doing it wrong.

2199
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.581
Hey Man.

2200
01:07:51.581 --> 01:07:53.830
It's like if you're sitting on your laurels,

2201
01:07:53.831 --> 01:07:54.341
you're wearing them.

2202
01:07:54.341 --> 01:07:55.570
On the wrong part of your body.

2203
01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.141
First off,

2204
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:03.220
where are you rehearsing?

2205
01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:04.210
Right?

2206
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:05.710
As in Miami?

2207
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.030
No.

2208
01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.240
Where are you training?

2209
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:11.680
Hawaii.

2210
01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.191
Cleveland.

2211
01:08:12.191 --> 01:08:12.700
Okay.

2212
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:13.533
Let's talk,

2213
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.190
cause even in Cleveland

2214
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:19.730
<v 1>you can turn it into your place.</v>

2215
01:08:19.731 --> 01:08:20.481
Do you follow?

2216
01:08:20.481 --> 01:08:21.350
What is your routine?

2217
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:22.221
If all,

2218
01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:23.990
what music did you listen to?

2219
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.951
You dig?

2220
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:25.940
How did you warm up?

2221
01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:26.901
Simple,

2222
01:08:26.901 --> 01:08:27.800
simple things.

2223
01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:28.071
You know,

2224
01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:29.690
most people are feared,

2225
01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.930
terrified of singing when they go in to sing it.

2226
01:08:32.931 --> 01:08:34.730
Now I don't care who it is.

2227
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.770
The first verse is always a little tight in the second versus a little better.

2228
01:08:39.771 --> 01:08:40.604
Why?

2229
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:42.170
Because they didn't warm up.

2230
01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:42.830
Right.

2231
01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:43.580
All right,

2232
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.580
and the idea of we'll go in and sing along with a dozen of your favorite songs.

2233
01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:51.980
Put your head gear on.

2234
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:54.260
Get the reverb to Santa for me.

2235
01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:55.640
That starts with Motown.

2236
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:57.640
I'm a sole growler.

2237
01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:58.700
I'm the,

2238
01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.470
I'm closer to Wilson Pickett.

2239
01:09:00.471 --> 01:09:02.120
Then the guy in the rolling stones,

2240
01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:03.960
that is bad.

2241
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.640
I don't know what that sounds like on the headphones,

2242
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:08.840
you know,

2243
01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:10.063
that's,

2244
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:10.971
I spent many.

2245
01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:12.590
I'm going to put the headphones on here that,

2246
01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:14.183
there we go.

2247
01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:16.070
Lao Bag.

2248
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:17.211
Yeah,

2249
01:09:17.211 --> 01:09:18.044
that's right.

2250
01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.500
I started sounding like that when I was 12.

2251
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:25.760
I started practicing that when I was 12.

2252
01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:28.370
I started imitating the persuasions,

2253
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:29.660
Jerry Butler to singer,

2254
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:30.913
um,

2255
01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.353
let us 13,

2256
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.150
much to the cantors,

2257
01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.850
Chagrin in Hebrew school.

2258
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.960
Okay.

2259
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.351
Again,

2260
01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:41.900
parallel existences.

2261
01:09:41.901 --> 01:09:42.734
You know,

2262
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:43.933
I'm Jewish,

2263
01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.370
but we always walked around with little buttons.

2264
01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:47.930
Back then it said never again.

2265
01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:50.030
I'm a combat hippie.

2266
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.261
Peace,

2267
01:09:51.261 --> 01:09:52.340
love and heavy weapons.

2268
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:54.710
Some people don't believe you.

2269
01:09:54.711 --> 01:09:56.150
Sometimes you got to get an assistant.

2270
01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:58.873
Did you ever

2271
01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:00.550
<v 5>realize while you were,</v>

2272
01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:02.230
while you were in the middle of this,

2273
01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:03.900
especially in the beginning,

2274
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.840
the early days,

2275
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.733
<v 1>that</v>

2276
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:07.623
<v 5>this was,</v>

2277
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:09.220
that you guys had,

2278
01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:11.560
especially with van Halen in the early days,

2279
01:10:11.561 --> 01:10:14.200
you guys had a massive impact on culture.

2280
01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:15.670
Where you guys aware of that?

2281
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:17.110
Like while it was happening,

2282
01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:17.771
how,

2283
01:10:17.771 --> 01:10:18.381
I mean you,

2284
01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:18.790
you,

2285
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:20.080
when I was in high school,

2286
01:10:20.081 --> 01:10:20.221
I went,

2287
01:10:20.221 --> 01:10:23.860
I graduated in 1985 and you guys were the shit.

2288
01:10:23.861 --> 01:10:24.940
My girlfriend might,

2289
01:10:24.941 --> 01:10:26.710
my sister's rather boyfriends,

2290
01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:27.520
uh,

2291
01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.990
my sister's boyfriend's licensing.

2292
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:30.370
<v 1>I am the soundtrack.</v>

2293
01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.170
The soundtrack to your okay.

2294
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.581
I get it.

2295
01:10:32.581 --> 01:10:33.110
Yes,

2296
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.943
absolutely.

2297
01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:34.670
I mean,

2298
01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:35.720
what was that?

2299
01:10:35.721 --> 01:10:37.190
That the gym was intentional.

2300
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:38.450
It was intentional.

2301
01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.410
I can tell you now,

2302
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:42.230
the heelan's knew it,

2303
01:10:42.231 --> 01:10:43.550
but can't articulate it.

2304
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:45.140
But right there instrumentalists.

2305
01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:48.350
Here comes the funny joke words M my thing,

2306
01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:49.490
right?

2307
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:51.860
You understood the words in my thing.

2308
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:53.690
So you realized that while it was happening.

2309
01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:54.553
Well,

2310
01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.500
your end game depends on how you started.

2311
01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:58.940
It's like chess.

2312
01:10:59.060 --> 01:10:59.570
Right.

2313
01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:04.570
And we began very early on identifying that there's a whole lot of different

2314
01:11:05.421 --> 01:11:07.010
neighborhoods and southern California.

2315
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:09.860
I knew this from being with my dad,

2316
01:11:09.861 --> 01:11:10.910
all of his patients.

2317
01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:12.990
Whereas like a Benetton ad com.

2318
01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.233
Yeah.

2319
01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:15.410
Right.

2320
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.720
You know,

2321
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.370
that's part of the beauty of passive data.

2322
01:11:17.371 --> 01:11:18.600
You got everybody.

2323
01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:19.523
Okay.

2324
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:22.270
Okay.

2325
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:27.060
What you play at the birthday party in the Spanish speaking neighborhood.

2326
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:27.950
Oh,

2327
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:28.411
rally.

2328
01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:29.244
Santana.

2329
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:33.030
You got to change [inaudible] Bro.

2330
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.640
Yeah.

2331
01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:40.290
Is Different than what we're going to play for the surfers out of Venice beach.

2332
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.580
That's Aerosmith stuff.

2333
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:42.563
Uh,

2334
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.590
you know,

2335
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:45.750
and do like this.

2336
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.170
And then you have the working man.

2337
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:50.213
Okay.

2338
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:55.340
Out in San Bernardino and that Zz top double d two too subtle but important

2339
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.880
geniuses in the details and how you interact with that crowd in between.

2340
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:09.450
We would play out in Pomona at a biker bar.

2341
01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.530
Guy got killed right in front of us and we finished the song.

2342
01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:14.483
What happened?

2343
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.620
A couple of buying a bike.

2344
01:12:16.621 --> 01:12:19.650
Gangs went at it and uh,

2345
01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:22.290
there was a scrap and when everybody cleared out,

2346
01:12:22.291 --> 01:12:24.450
there was a fellow right in the middle of the floor.

2347
01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.400
Next night we came back,

2348
01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:28.050
vengeance had been sworn,

2349
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.310
there were police everywhere.

2350
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:32.830
We've pulled the amps out from the wall so we could hide behind the amps and

2351
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.011
seventies,

2352
01:12:35.011 --> 01:12:36.090
and it was a mighty task.

2353
01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:37.050
Wow.

2354
01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:41.490
And we played on the Queen Elizabeth for remotely fancy.

2355
01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:42.301
Oh my God.

2356
01:12:42.301 --> 01:12:45.720
I remember sitting in that ballroom at four in the morning in the days when we

2357
01:12:45.721 --> 01:12:49.770
carried our own equipment and stuff and thinking of all the people who had been

2358
01:12:49.771 --> 01:12:53.550
in there and everybody to perform there and so forth,

2359
01:12:53.551 --> 01:12:56.070
and dozens and dozens of places,

2360
01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:56.904
you know,

2361
01:12:57.150 --> 01:12:59.580
that we're all a little bit different.

2362
01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:00.370
And our,

2363
01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:04.920
our thing was that we could play anywhere we had to otherwise,

2364
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.793
uh,

2365
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:06.930
we had feed ourselves.

2366
01:13:06.931 --> 01:13:07.680
All right.

2367
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.440
And that meant five 45 minutes.

2368
01:13:09.441 --> 01:13:10.274
That's a night.

2369
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:10.861
Five,

2370
01:13:10.861 --> 01:13:11.401
six nights.

2371
01:13:11.401 --> 01:13:16.350
If you could get it and we would ping pong all over the Southland anywhere.

2372
01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:17.610
We could drive for two hours,

2373
01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:18.451
two hours north,

2374
01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:23.100
south or east is how we would do in every neighborhood was a little different.

2375
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.850
And that shows up in the music,

2376
01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:28.261
you know,

2377
01:13:28.261 --> 01:13:31.680
now you can take a look at something like dancing the night away or Jamie's

2378
01:13:31.681 --> 01:13:32.514
crying.

2379
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.540
There's a,

2380
01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.430
there's a Latino influence in that.

2381
01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:36.450
Okay.

2382
01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:37.440
We do do,

2383
01:13:37.441 --> 01:13:37.681
do,

2384
01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:37.921
do,

2385
01:13:37.921 --> 01:13:38.220
do,

2386
01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.300
that's Ricky Ricardo.

2387
01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:40.630
People say,

2388
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:43.590
what's your favorite Cuban expecting me to name his cigars?

2389
01:13:43.591 --> 01:13:43.740
I,

2390
01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:44.573
Ricky Ricardo,

2391
01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.860
[inaudible] ditch Rumba,

2392
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.453
Rumba,

2393
01:13:50.650 --> 01:13:51.130
Du,

2394
01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:51.840
Du,

2395
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.673
Du,

2396
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:53.670
du Du.

2397
01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:54.540
Now you're thinking about it,

2398
01:13:54.541 --> 01:13:55.050
you go,

2399
01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:55.381
yeah,

2400
01:13:55.381 --> 01:13:56.214
and kid.

2401
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.020
And if he was in a dance the night away,

2402
01:13:58.021 --> 01:13:59.970
the middle break is all Cha-cha.

2403
01:13:59.971 --> 01:14:01.300
Chatchki is definitely a,

2404
01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:02.760
because here,

2405
01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:04.231
this is,

2406
01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:05.064
you know,

2407
01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:10.760
you're surrounded by Hispanic culture here and we had heavy metal.

2408
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:12.520
Okay.

2409
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.990
<v 2>We had a super wealthy stuff.</v>

2410
01:14:16.991 --> 01:14:20.890
So you have to be able to move to acoustic.

2411
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:24.760
You gotta be able to ease up if you get hired for a wedding.

2412
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:27.280
And more importantly perhaps,

2413
01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:27.940
you know,

2414
01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:29.020
artists to artists.

2415
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:33.130
I Dunno Springsteen better during the song or in between.

2416
01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:36.610
Careful we're going to the Broadway show.

2417
01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:38.420
Yeah,

2418
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:42.070
that's about a $12,000 ticket now.

2419
01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:43.540
And I'm guessing,

2420
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.840
I'm guessing before t shirt and I'm guessing that uh,

2421
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:51.040
I haven't seen the whole show.

2422
01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:56.041
I saw some of it on Netflix and the very pivot of it is the in between songs.

2423
01:14:56.650 --> 01:14:57.483
Yeah.

2424
01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:59.920
The songs are almost secondary.

2425
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:01.143
You know,

2426
01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:06.150
they're almost peripheral to his narration in his descriptions and his poetry

2427
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:09.040
when he sets a deep guy,

2428
01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:11.020
like you have to hear the in between stuff.

2429
01:15:11.021 --> 01:15:12.370
You want to hear him brewed,

2430
01:15:12.371 --> 01:15:13.570
you want to hear him talk,

2431
01:15:13.571 --> 01:15:15.280
you want to hear him think about things.

2432
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:16.263
Yes.

2433
01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.910
And where do you learn that or dealing that

2434
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:22.290
already?

2435
01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:27.290
I'm going to count to 30,000 Joe hours and hours and hours and when we're done

2436
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:29.740
you'll be able to,

2437
01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:30.641
you know,

2438
01:15:30.641 --> 01:15:31.474
Joe,

2439
01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:32.770
that's not a good Springsteen.

2440
01:15:32.771 --> 01:15:33.430
You know,

2441
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:34.220
you're a good man.

2442
01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:35.053
Jo.

2443
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:37.600
What I was trying to get at was like,

2444
01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:38.830
does it ever freak you out?

2445
01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:42.190
Like when you ever alone and you think about what you guys did and what you've

2446
01:15:42.191 --> 01:15:43.270
done in your career,

2447
01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.350
does it ever freak you out?

2448
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:48.400
But the impact that you've had that if you looked at the amount of human beings

2449
01:15:48.401 --> 01:15:50.050
that have had the kind of impact that you've had,

2450
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:52.180
it's the tiniest,

2451
01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:53.950
tiniest fraction of a percent.

2452
01:15:53.951 --> 01:15:58.120
Like the amount of human beings that can relate to your personal life

2453
01:15:58.121 --> 01:15:58.601
experience.

2454
01:15:58.601 --> 01:16:00.730
I'll paraphrase the James Brown movie.

2455
01:16:00.731 --> 01:16:01.660
There's two of them.

2456
01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.180
Both of them were helpful to helpfully produced by Jagger.

2457
01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:05.493
Okay.

2458
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.460
And he does an interview.

2459
01:16:07.461 --> 01:16:10.830
He goes down a little bit of me in every record you hear.

2460
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.333
Oh

2461
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:14.140
yeah,

2462
01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:15.430
he's in the DNA.

2463
01:16:15.431 --> 01:16:16.030
Yeah.

2464
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:19.480
He's a little bit of David Lee Roth in there.

2465
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:21.880
There's a little bit,

2466
01:16:21.881 --> 01:16:23.710
whenever you see videos today,

2467
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.540
doesn't matter if it's hip hop,

2468
01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:27.040
doesn't matter if it's rock and roll.

2469
01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:30.340
It doesn't matter if it's classic or pit bull.

2470
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:31.383
Can you dig?

2471
01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:32.260
There's a lead.

2472
01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:34.780
You can trace it back if follow,

2473
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:36.100
and it's not a,

2474
01:16:36.101 --> 01:16:38.050
I don't think of it as impact.

2475
01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:39.400
That's a result.

2476
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:40.870
What's the verb?

2477
01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.033
Contribution.

2478
01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:43.023
Yeah,

2479
01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:45.610
at family reunions,

2480
01:16:45.611 --> 01:16:46.091
whatever.

2481
01:16:46.091 --> 01:16:47.110
We go around,

2482
01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:49.540
everybody picks a word and uh,

2483
01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.840
my favorite word ever was to contribution.

2484
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:54.783
Did you try,

2485
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:56.020
you know,

2486
01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:57.130
go climb the tree.

2487
01:16:57.131 --> 01:16:58.180
Here's my favorite poem.

2488
01:16:58.181 --> 01:17:01.840
I saw it inscribed on a rock by an anonymous poet at the base.

2489
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:03.970
Just short of base camp at Everest.

2490
01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:06.580
Go climbed the treasure mountain.

2491
01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:09.100
Do not return empty handed.

2492
01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:10.610
Where are you now?

2493
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.180
Hmm.

2494
01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:13.750
Ooh,

2495
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:14.320
Ooh,

2496
01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:14.680
Ooh.

2497
01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:15.101
Yeah.

2498
01:17:15.101 --> 01:17:16.450
That's some gps shit.

2499
01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:20.800
What's interesting about music that's different than anything else to is it

2500
01:17:20.801 --> 01:17:24.970
brings you back to the moment where you heard it or when it was significant to

2501
01:17:24.971 --> 01:17:25.804
you or were,

2502
01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:26.261
you know,

2503
01:17:26.261 --> 01:17:27.820
like if I hear dance the night away,

2504
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.920
if I'm in my car and dancing hideaway comes on,

2505
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:31.061
it's just like,

2506
01:17:31.061 --> 01:17:31.800
God,

2507
01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.870
you get goosebumps.

2508
01:17:32.871 --> 01:17:33.310
She's just,

2509
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:34.210
you have this feeling.

2510
01:17:34.211 --> 01:17:35.950
You feel like you're back in Newton,

2511
01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:37.600
Massachusetts in high school.

2512
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:42.190
My favorite audience is disbelieving nonbelievers.

2513
01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:43.330
Non smilers.

2514
01:17:43.331 --> 01:17:48.331
Give me a room in North Korea who hate everything about the trip.

2515
01:17:48.681 --> 01:17:50.140
Starting with the airport.

2516
01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:51.200
Get Disney.

2517
01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.370
Like why those they hate rock and roll.

2518
01:17:54.371 --> 01:17:55.750
You give me two choruses.

2519
01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:57.400
Sato Ah,

2520
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:59.590
first we're going to drive away the evil spirits.

2521
01:17:59.591 --> 01:18:02.830
You might use a little volume to do that show and then I use a little of this.

2522
01:18:02.831 --> 01:18:03.620
Here we go.

2523
01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:08.170
Just drive with evil spirits and then I'm going to make you feel young as kitty.

2524
01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.370
How much is that worth for the nest?

2525
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:14.303
Nesta.

2526
01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:15.813
Inestimable.

2527
01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:16.060
Yeah,

2528
01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:16.241
that,

2529
01:18:16.241 --> 01:18:18.400
that's the thing about music that's different than anything else.

2530
01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:18.560
It,

2531
01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.200
it really does change your mood.

2532
01:18:20.201 --> 01:18:20.930
It elevates.

2533
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:22.210
You can do that.

2534
01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.073
It gives you the juice.

2535
01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.410
It's also we have like like a big glass bowl.

2536
01:18:26.411 --> 01:18:30.760
Are you whole history and we and no movies don't do that.

2537
01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:32.860
Books will,

2538
01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.450
if you used a paper back and you open it up and the pages are still dried from

2539
01:18:37.451 --> 01:18:38.920
the vacation son,

2540
01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.740
you know you were reading it at the beach and the salt air made the pages kind

2541
01:18:42.741 --> 01:18:45.970
of old and dry and crackly and some sand comes out and he'd get the memory.

2542
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.660
Yeah.

2543
01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:47.493
All right.

2544
01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.633
Music,

2545
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:49.810
we'll take you right back.

2546
01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:50.590
Right back,

2547
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:51.610
right back.

2548
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:54.010
The women will feel desirable.

2549
01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:55.480
You will feel invulnerable.

2550
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:59.620
You guys are making songs like saying running with the devil,

2551
01:18:59.830 --> 01:19:00.461
something like that.

2552
01:19:00.461 --> 01:19:01.600
How do you know when you're done?

2553
01:19:02.670 --> 01:19:02.851
No,

2554
01:19:02.851 --> 01:19:03.340
it's not.

2555
01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:05.440
When you're done itch,

2556
01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.760
how'd you get there?

2557
01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:08.013
Right.

2558
01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.610
That informs the whole thing.

2559
01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:10.623
Okay.

2560
01:19:10.810 --> 01:19:11.643
Um,

2561
01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:13.870
somebody asked me once,

2562
01:19:14.170 --> 01:19:15.220
uh,

2563
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:18.490
how long did it take you to write running with the devil?

2564
01:19:18.491 --> 01:19:19.870
And that's an astute question.

2565
01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:21.791
I should.

2566
01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:25.270
Well the true answer is

2567
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:29.700
if you watch a thousand movies,

2568
01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:32.400
many of the multiple times,

2569
01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.640
if you've played thousands and thousands of hours in clubs and bars,

2570
01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:40.460
<v 0>okay.</v>

2571
01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.990
<v 2>If you've read,</v>

2572
01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:42.913
I don't know,

2573
01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:44.960
500 books,

2574
01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.990
tried to memorize all the good parts,

2575
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:54.280
take about 18 minutes.

2576
01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:57.960
Write the song.

2577
01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.070
So you guys wrote running with the devil and 18 minutes.

2578
01:20:00.071 --> 01:20:00.580
Yeah.

2579
01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:01.060
Really?

2580
01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:01.660
Yes.

2581
01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:02.620
Jesus Christ.

2582
01:20:02.650 --> 01:20:03.370
Okay,

2583
01:20:03.370 --> 01:20:05.290
but doesn't rhapsody in blue,

2584
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:06.110
right?

2585
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:07.310
Duh.

2586
01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.140
Right.

2587
01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:12.540
It took 22 minutes to come up with the basic theme in the rest of it's

2588
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:13.380
improvisation.

2589
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:15.100
How would you guys,

2590
01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:15.690
right,

2591
01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:16.870
how would you guys get together and do it?

2592
01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.680
The whole point is not the 18 minutes.

2593
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.280
It's the whole lifetime before it.

2594
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:24.480
It's everything that led up to that.

2595
01:20:24.481 --> 01:20:24.661
Now,

2596
01:20:24.661 --> 01:20:25.494
Van Halen,

2597
01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:29.100
we never took a demo tape around cause we didn't get lost in the stack.

2598
01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:29.581
We should have.

2599
01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:30.990
We're as good as we think we are,

2600
01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:32.400
they'll come find us.

2601
01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:33.661
And if they don't,

2602
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:34.494
we're not.

2603
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:35.410
Wow.

2604
01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:39.390
So I'm forgiving instead of the requisite two and a half,

2605
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:41.430
three years it takes for most acts.

2606
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.570
We spent five and a half years working the clubs and the bars and everything

2607
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:46.404
like that.

2608
01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:51.860
So we came in with scars and stars.

2609
01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:55.771
We'd been,

2610
01:20:55.771 --> 01:20:57.510
we'd done the state fair circuit

2611
01:20:59.040 --> 01:20:59.701
like that.

2612
01:20:59.701 --> 01:21:00.930
I wasn't exactly new.

2613
01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:02.130
Same thing for Springsteen.

2614
01:21:02.131 --> 01:21:06.240
He'd done 10 years in the clubs and bars before.

2615
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.470
Yeah.

2616
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:08.010
You know,

2617
01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:09.690
thunder road and whatnot.

2618
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.750
And you'll see this routinely.

2619
01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:17.160
I think the Beatles did four or five years of working in the red light district.

2620
01:21:17.161 --> 01:21:20.040
Reeperbahn and all the club shows and stuff like that.

2621
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:21.480
And they're adding up.

2622
01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:26.460
They're getting that 10,000 and then ultimately that 30,000 hour mark.

2623
01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:27.580
Yeah.

2624
01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:28.001
<v 5>Beatles.</v>

2625
01:21:28.001 --> 01:21:28.650
There's a thing,

2626
01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:31.030
it's Malcolm Gladwell's book where he's talking about,

2627
01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:31.360
uh,

2628
01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.630
the Beatles and they're there when they came up,

2629
01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:38.000
when they were performing in Germany and they were doing these shows where they

2630
01:21:38.001 --> 01:21:40.870
were doing multiple sets at night every night of the week.

2631
01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:44.960
And that this is really what made them so good is this constant performing,

2632
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:49.840
that they were doing it so much and so often that they just became this smoothly

2633
01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:51.370
oiled machine.

2634
01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:56.340
<v 2>If you have a team that you're working together,</v>

2635
01:21:58.410 --> 01:21:58.771
again,

2636
01:21:58.771 --> 01:22:03.771
this is another kind of thing I learned along the way on 40 hours a week is

2637
01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:07.020
about your minimum.

2638
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:08.220
If there's a team,

2639
01:22:08.221 --> 01:22:11.100
like we're a rugby team or a Swat team or uh,

2640
01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.590
uh,

2641
01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:14.610
emergency room,

2642
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:17.940
kind of a c block kind of,

2643
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.870
you know,

2644
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:21.870
intensive like that inner city intensive,

2645
01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:22.681
we call it Vietnam.

2646
01:22:22.681 --> 01:22:25.830
Sometimes it'd take like that 40 hours a week,

2647
01:22:25.831 --> 01:22:30.480
his bachelor minimum that you need to train together in order to be going

2648
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.070
without looking at each other.

2649
01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:33.930
When the lights go out,

2650
01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:34.830
you're,

2651
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:36.390
you don't lose velocity,

2652
01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:37.830
so to speak.

2653
01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.713
All right?

2654
01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:40.003
Um,

2655
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:42.120
ultimately you'll start to look like each other.

2656
01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.740
This is the nature of things.

2657
01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:45.480
The Beatles look like each other.

2658
01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.501
Van Halen,

2659
01:22:46.501 --> 01:22:47.430
we looked like each other.

2660
01:22:47.431 --> 01:22:48.660
We all have the same haircut.

2661
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:51.690
We wear the same leather jackets to say fairs.

2662
01:22:51.691 --> 01:22:52.620
We became a team.

2663
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:54.510
It was the golden times.

2664
01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:55.500
You know,

2665
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:58.410
these are the golden years that most people look back on before.

2666
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:59.760
The friction of time,

2667
01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.170
uh,

2668
01:23:01.170 --> 01:23:02.280
implicates itself.

2669
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:03.270
You get married,

2670
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:04.103
you have kids,

2671
01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.230
sure you bump your elbow.

2672
01:23:08.231 --> 01:23:10.120
Now I gotta get my elbow worked on.

2673
01:23:10.121 --> 01:23:11.160
And as you know,

2674
01:23:11.161 --> 01:23:12.460
and just the friction of time,

2675
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:16.120
the rent expands,

2676
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:16.721
you know,

2677
01:23:16.721 --> 01:23:17.554
contracts,

2678
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:18.393
et cetera.

2679
01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.630
Um,

2680
01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:20.463
and

2681
01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:25.560
people routinely look back on that as the golden years.

2682
01:23:25.561 --> 01:23:26.340
You know,

2683
01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:27.173
your gang,

2684
01:23:27.690 --> 01:23:30.330
everybody had one look back in,

2685
01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.680
in graphic arts,

2686
01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:32.461
you know,

2687
01:23:32.461 --> 01:23:36.750
the Picasso's and the dollies and everybody wandered around in gangs.

2688
01:23:36.751 --> 01:23:41.751
The great writers in New York all hung out together and they didn't get along.

2689
01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.930
You're always competing with each other.

2690
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:46.440
You're pretending to love each other.

2691
01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:51.620
It dig and just read in the New York magazine some advice from the uh,

2692
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.670
art critic Jerry Salts.

2693
01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:55.230
It says,

2694
01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.190
create gangs.

2695
01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.271
And remember,

2696
01:23:57.271 --> 01:24:00.810
always treat the weakest one is your best friend because there's somebody else

2697
01:24:00.811 --> 01:24:02.850
in the gang who thinks you're the weakest one.

2698
01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:04.920
And that's what you learn.

2699
01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:05.431
You know,

2700
01:24:05.431 --> 01:24:06.240
as you go,

2701
01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.030
what are you gonna learn from working the clubs and the bars and stuff?

2702
01:24:09.930 --> 01:24:10.763
Well,

2703
01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.360
my stringers broke,

2704
01:24:12.361 --> 01:24:13.440
my nose is running.

2705
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.633
I'm angry.

2706
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:18.690
My girlfriend just ran off with two and not one guy.

2707
01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.090
Should I keep going?

2708
01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.261
I'm underpaid.

2709
01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:26.580
Non respected late

2710
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:32.160
and now I'm starting to sound like double Dutch bus to top it off.

2711
01:24:32.161 --> 01:24:32.970
I'm late to work.

2712
01:24:32.970 --> 01:24:34.680
I got bad feet and McLarens hurt

2713
01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:37.110
and you're going to play.

2714
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:38.610
You will perform.

2715
01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:39.750
Okay.

2716
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:43.830
Just as you will expect that surgeon at four in the morning.

2717
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:45.990
This is my little baby girl.

2718
01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.710
That unforgiving.

2719
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:51.540
Apply that to your art.

2720
01:24:52.190 --> 01:24:53.023
Ooh.

2721
01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.540
See each words.

2722
01:24:55.770 --> 01:24:56.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2723
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.751
<v 2>Sage,</v>

2724
01:24:56.751 --> 01:24:57.710
words of advice.

2725
01:24:58.580 --> 01:24:59.750
You have expectations.

2726
01:24:59.751 --> 01:25:00.830
You may not have used them yet.

2727
01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:02.053
Yeah.

2728
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:03.423
Okay.

2729
01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.090
When you guys wrote songs,

2730
01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:06.670
how did you,

2731
01:25:06.670 --> 01:25:08.630
how did you put the lyrics to the music?

2732
01:25:08.631 --> 01:25:09.770
What was the process like?

2733
01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.330
How did you guys sort that out?

2734
01:25:11.331 --> 01:25:11.900
So you,

2735
01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.460
would you come to them with an idea?

2736
01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.170
Would they come to you with a riff?

2737
01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.040
Like how would,

2738
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:17.000
how would it work?

2739
01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:17.900
It'll work,

2740
01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:19.093
uh,

2741
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:21.410
a number of ways.

2742
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:26.470
But a mistake that a lot of young writers in my department,

2743
01:25:26.691 --> 01:25:30.110
the lyrics make is that they think of it as secondary.

2744
01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:31.283
Mm.

2745
01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:36.520
They wait for the music or the track first and then you'll walk into a studio

2746
01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:44.800
and hope that the hand of God will descend and grace you with a amazing

2747
01:25:46.791 --> 01:25:47.624
epiphany's.

2748
01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.370
I can't even spell amazing.

2749
01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.493
All right.

2750
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:52.703
Um,

2751
01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.090
and called upon to do it right away.

2752
01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:56.930
You know,

2753
01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:58.670
you'll work out a beat and go,

2754
01:25:58.671 --> 01:25:58.971
Dave,

2755
01:25:58.971 --> 01:25:59.840
you got some lyrics.

2756
01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:02.930
If I go walk into that room and try to create it right.

2757
01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:04.430
Nine Times out of 10,

2758
01:26:04.431 --> 01:26:05.540
it's going to be moon in June.

2759
01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:07.400
Right?

2760
01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.233
Moon in June.

2761
01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:09.710
Really?

2762
01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:10.130
When?

2763
01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:10.963
Sometime soon.

2764
01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:13.910
What time of day?

2765
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:18.970
I'm thinking noon and literally I'm going to put my hands in the air.

2766
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:20.870
Why?

2767
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:21.111
Well,

2768
01:26:21.111 --> 01:26:22.100
cause I just don't care.

2769
01:26:28.670 --> 01:26:32.180
You wind up there unless you're banking.

2770
01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:34.910
Think like debate.

2771
01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.770
If you're going to debate somebody,

2772
01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.870
you're banking your ideas,

2773
01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:39.650
right?

2774
01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:40.483
Alright.

2775
01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:44.090
And whatever the subject is,

2776
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:45.410
you can go,

2777
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:45.620
shh.

2778
01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:47.300
Don't even have to have a subject.

2779
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.950
It's okay.

2780
01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:50.120
I like what he just said.

2781
01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:52.700
I might even write that phrase.

2782
01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.020
I like what you just said.

2783
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:57.170
Could be a Drake lyric.

2784
01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:59.930
Dig any expressions,

2785
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.740
ideas,

2786
01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:01.910
slogans,

2787
01:27:02.230 --> 01:27:02.690
uh,

2788
01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:06.920
anything that comes from other tunes in terms of their lyrics and is everybody

2789
01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:07.754
contributing?

2790
01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:08.661
No,

2791
01:27:08.661 --> 01:27:09.494
that's just me.

2792
01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:13.340
Just to have volumes of that and those kinds of ideas,

2793
01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:14.990
ideas for songs,

2794
01:27:14.991 --> 01:27:15.920
storylines,

2795
01:27:15.921 --> 01:27:16.754
et Cetera.

2796
01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:17.510
Um,

2797
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:20.030
you would never go into a fight without doing that.

2798
01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:26.200
Collecting moves from every other film of every other fighter that you possibly

2799
01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:27.500
can,

2800
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.240
so that when somebody goes like this,

2801
01:27:29.241 --> 01:27:29.481
you go,

2802
01:27:29.481 --> 01:27:29.661
oh,

2803
01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:30.530
I know what to do.

2804
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.710
So and so from Muslims [inaudible] then I'm going to visit like this and

2805
01:27:33.711 --> 01:27:36.440
somebody says it's a song about they play a song.

2806
01:27:36.441 --> 01:27:36.740
I go,

2807
01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:36.951
wow,

2808
01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:38.660
it sounds kinda like cowboy music.

2809
01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:43.130
Let's write about back cowboys going through the banking.

2810
01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.010
Giddy up.

2811
01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:48.141
That's cool.

2812
01:27:48.141 --> 01:27:48.974
Title.

2813
01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.650
I heard a cowboy,

2814
01:27:51.651 --> 01:27:55.970
I say it on the TV set and I wrote it down literally.

2815
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.883
Okay.

2816
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:59.930
And you start bay,

2817
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:00.351
you get,

2818
01:28:00.351 --> 01:28:01.184
I see the lights

2819
01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:03.680
and you start banking.

2820
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:04.880
Okay.

2821
01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.460
Somebody says something you dig.

2822
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:08.343
Um,

2823
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:10.700
I heard somebody,

2824
01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.040
a waitress named pepper

2825
01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:16.400
with an unlit pall mall cigarette.

2826
01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:18.463
Tell me,

2827
01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:19.581
oh honey.

2828
01:28:19.581 --> 01:28:21.170
Nothing could have stopped us back then.

2829
01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:22.004
Anyway.

2830
01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:24.230
That's a title.

2831
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:25.391
That is a title.

2832
01:28:25.391 --> 01:28:26.224
I wrote a song to it.

2833
01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:26.860
Did you?

2834
01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:27.530
Oh yeah.

2835
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:30.200
Where was this waitress on the road?

2836
01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.390
Just to,

2837
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.591
well,

2838
01:28:32.591 --> 01:28:33.980
she also had something else to say.

2839
01:28:33.981 --> 01:28:34.731
She leaned over,

2840
01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:37.640
she showed me that that cleavage a little bit and she'd,

2841
01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:39.650
and she'd go keep your four county.

2842
01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.880
There's Pie,

2843
01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:44.141
excuse me,

2844
01:28:44.141 --> 01:28:44.974
I guess.

2845
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:53.330
And you're right it down.

2846
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:54.343
Yeah.

2847
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.903
Banking.

2848
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.241
Yeah.

2849
01:28:56.241 --> 01:28:58.010
I liked the term they use in debate.

2850
01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.113
Your banking,

2851
01:28:59.240 --> 01:28:59.691
banking,

2852
01:28:59.691 --> 01:29:00.440
your ideas.

2853
01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.640
So when you would on the road and someone say something that you would

2854
01:29:02.641 --> 01:29:03.670
physically write it down,

2855
01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:05.130
go home and write it down today.

2856
01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:05.760
Today.

2857
01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:06.510
All the time.

2858
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:06.721
Bank.

2859
01:29:06.721 --> 01:29:07.320
Yeah.

2860
01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:11.330
And it goes into the books and then when it's time to deal with a given,

2861
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:12.630
soon as you listen to music,

2862
01:29:12.631 --> 01:29:14.220
if the music came first and you

2863
01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:18.500
don't know what's just like,

2864
01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.380
remind yourself.

2865
01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:19.530
Oh,

2866
01:29:19.530 --> 01:29:20.311
that sounds like Kung Fu.

2867
01:29:20.311 --> 01:29:21.360
That sounds like country.

2868
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.661
Right.

2869
01:29:21.661 --> 01:29:25.020
That sounds like a engines are coming.

2870
01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:27.870
It's a and on and on.

2871
01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:28.631
It follows.

2872
01:29:28.631 --> 01:29:29.720
You might suggestion,

2873
01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:32.510
idea to write things down physically or do you type them?

2874
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:34.590
I sh I print.

2875
01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:35.430
Print,

2876
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:36.120
yeah.

2877
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:36.810
And I,

2878
01:29:36.810 --> 01:29:39.480
I paint and draw routinely.

2879
01:29:39.570 --> 01:29:40.403
Okay.

2880
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.091
As you know,

2881
01:29:41.091 --> 01:29:42.630
as part of the martial arts.

2882
01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:43.470
Okay,

2883
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:44.303
sure.

2884
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:44.990
Musashi.

2885
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.540
Yep.

2886
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.373
But uh,

2887
01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.000
when I was in Japan,

2888
01:29:48.150 --> 01:29:48.450
uh,

2889
01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:49.890
two and three nights a week,

2890
01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.113
I,

2891
01:29:51.210 --> 01:29:52.560
well we call it training.

2892
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:53.790
I did assume Yay.

2893
01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:59.580
With a Sumi eight teachers direct Sumia it's um,

2894
01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:00.570
like calligraphy,

2895
01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:03.000
pen and ink in,

2896
01:30:03.001 --> 01:30:05.010
in the world of the digital future.

2897
01:30:05.011 --> 01:30:09.540
I spent two years practicing four shades of gray and two shades of black.

2898
01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:11.850
Oh yeah.

2899
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:13.410
You want to see my lesson?

2900
01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:14.580
Can you do,

2901
01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:16.560
can you focus a camera if I stand up?

2902
01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:18.160
Can you,

2903
01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:18.540
you well,

2904
01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:19.310
here's my lesson.

2905
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.540
Okay.

2906
01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:20.040
Okay.

2907
01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.530
I'm going to walk from here to here.

2908
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:23.550
Okay.

2909
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:24.570
I'm here painting.

2910
01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:25.230
Okay.

2911
01:30:25.230 --> 01:30:26.370
I'm the only guy in the room.

2912
01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:27.120
Ready?

2913
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:27.750
Okay.

2914
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:28.583
Here we go.

2915
01:30:36.250 --> 01:30:37.083
No.

2916
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:43.743
Yeah.

2917
01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:44.673
Okay.

2918
01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:49.660
After six months I heard better Jesus Christ.

2919
01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:52.330
After almost 10 months a shit.

2920
01:30:52.331 --> 01:30:53.620
Then he goes,

2921
01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:56.883
Mr Rod,

2922
01:30:57.370 --> 01:31:00.160
I think you are my best student.

2923
01:31:00.730 --> 01:31:01.300
Oh,

2924
01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:02.890
I should not my painting.

2925
01:31:02.891 --> 01:31:03.180
He said,

2926
01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:03.311
no,

2927
01:31:03.311 --> 01:31:03.430
no,

2928
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:04.263
not your painting.

2929
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:06.303
You Shit.

2930
01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.470
You are most determined.

2931
01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:10.450
You are most sincere.

2932
01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:15.160
You really enjoy most like this.

2933
01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:16.211
Thank you sir.

2934
01:31:16.211 --> 01:31:16.571
He should.

2935
01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:19.900
I wish to invite you to director's meeting.

2936
01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.150
Show me a society.

2937
01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.313
Whoa,

2938
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.710
that's,

2939
01:31:23.710 --> 01:31:24.640
I made the same face.

2940
01:31:24.641 --> 01:31:24.941
I said,

2941
01:31:24.941 --> 01:31:25.774
whoa.

2942
01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:31.320
When his dad should right now we pulled out a bottle of Saki chew little cups,

2943
01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.410
became one of my best friends in Tokyo.

2944
01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:39.273
Wow.

2945
01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.530
First Shit for six seconds.

2946
01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:42.970
First six months,

2947
01:31:42.971 --> 01:31:44.310
I might've got some word.

2948
01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:45.850
Well,

2949
01:31:45.850 --> 01:31:47.050
for a guy like that,

2950
01:31:47.290 --> 01:31:48.430
in this day and age,

2951
01:31:48.431 --> 01:31:51.880
it must be insanely difficult to get someone to have that sort of appreciation

2952
01:31:51.881 --> 01:31:52.714
for commitment.

2953
01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:53.051
Well,

2954
01:31:53.051 --> 01:31:53.830
it's,

2955
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:55.570
it's a national thing.

2956
01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:56.260
Okay.

2957
01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:59.860
You learn that stuff in grade school and it's sorta like classes.

2958
01:31:59.861 --> 01:32:00.694
Okay.

2959
01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:05.170
Painting and calligraphy is as well known as perhaps piano lessons.

2960
01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:07.600
And what were you thinking while you were doing all this?

2961
01:32:07.601 --> 01:32:09.640
While you're learning this and spending months and months?

2962
01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.960
I focus on specifically that knowing that at the end of the term I'm going to be

2963
01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:17.734
a little,

2964
01:32:17.890 --> 01:32:18.101
I don't know.

2965
01:32:18.101 --> 01:32:22.500
I'm sharpening things a little bit and when I'm called upon even to have a

2966
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:23.920
discussion like this.

2967
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.903
Yeah.

2968
01:32:24.970 --> 01:32:25.803
I,

2969
01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:28.180
I can bring a little contribution to it.

2970
01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:28.600
Yeah.

2971
01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:32.980
It can be more entertaining for all of you listening to this.

2972
01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:33.820
It can,

2973
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:34.270
you know,

2974
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:36.220
that's an amazing recognition that you have though,

2975
01:32:36.221 --> 01:32:38.080
that you realized while you were doing this,

2976
01:32:38.081 --> 01:32:40.660
that even though consciously all you're doing is doing calligraphy,

2977
01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:43.120
you're working on other parts of your mind.

2978
01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:43.301
Oh,

2979
01:32:43.301 --> 01:32:45.070
I knew I was never going to pay for shit.

2980
01:32:47.230 --> 01:32:48.620
50 shades a Dave.

2981
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:54.750
But you were still focusing 100% of your energy on doing it while you're doing

2982
01:32:55.331 --> 01:32:55.470
it.

2983
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:56.140
Yeah.

2984
01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:56.710
Yeah.

2985
01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:57.740
And there's something to that.

2986
01:32:58.420 --> 01:32:59.253
Yeah,

2987
01:32:59.310 --> 01:33:00.460
it's the preparation.

2988
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:01.301
What are you doing now?

2989
01:33:01.301 --> 01:33:02.134
That's weird.

2990
01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:03.640
Oh,

2991
01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.960
well I went corporate.

2992
01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:06.010
You okay?

2993
01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:06.611
Oh yeah.

2994
01:33:06.611 --> 01:33:08.380
I got 34 employees.

2995
01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:08.951
You do it.

2996
01:33:08.951 --> 01:33:13.300
I have offices at one park avenue and you see a guy who might go off the grid

2997
01:33:13.301 --> 01:33:17.320
and be very difficult to find in the offices at the beach.

2998
01:33:17.321 --> 01:33:20.940
And My company is a GS words,

2999
01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:23.650
were about $8 million into it here.

3000
01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:28.600
Running that kind of a team and dealing with the people because it's art

3001
01:33:28.601 --> 01:33:29.434
centric.

3002
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:30.281
What does this team,

3003
01:33:30.281 --> 01:33:30.911
what's it about?

3004
01:33:30.911 --> 01:33:32.620
And it just is the attaches to the original.

3005
01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:33.940
This is my stuff.

3006
01:33:34.210 --> 01:33:38.200
And I didn't just hire a bunch of people to pass things in front of me.

3007
01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:42.340
I designed what that logo looks like.

3008
01:33:42.670 --> 01:33:45.130
I put together what the general everything.

3009
01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.330
Okay.

3010
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:47.230
The air all.

3011
01:33:47.231 --> 01:33:49.060
And then I hired the architect and said,

3012
01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:49.983
build this,

3013
01:33:50.230 --> 01:33:51.190
create this.

3014
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:56.550
So it's virtually everything that you know how to do as an artist because you

3015
01:33:56.681 --> 01:33:58.690
have to keep everybody entertained.

3016
01:33:58.930 --> 01:34:01.810
You have to be creative on levels.

3017
01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:07.420
Everything from Adobe Photoshop to social engineering in platforming dealing

3018
01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:08.111
with marketing,

3019
01:34:08.111 --> 01:34:08.741
publishing,

3020
01:34:08.741 --> 01:34:10.870
all the way that publishing is changing.

3021
01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:13.900
Magazines now make e digital.

3022
01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:18.130
Are you approaching this the same way you approach calligraphy?

3023
01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:18.371
Oh,

3024
01:34:18.371 --> 01:34:19.204
you bet.

3025
01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:20.621
Art centric,

3026
01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:23.530
singing and dancing paid every penny for the company.

3027
01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:27.610
And this is what I bring to it.

3028
01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:31.290
Mostly when you have a celeb get involved in something like that.

3029
01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:31.780
I don't know.

3030
01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:33.070
J Lo does fashion.

3031
01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:39.090
She's not really taking a pen and ink and drawing out doors and drawing out the

3032
01:34:39.121 --> 01:34:39.401
clothes.

3033
01:34:39.401 --> 01:34:42.070
Somebody passes things in front of her and she makes sounds,

3034
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:43.600
I'm assuming it goes like this.

3035
01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:53.830
I'm the guy who has to interpret those sounds.

3036
01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:55.661
And,

3037
01:34:55.661 --> 01:34:56.051
and,

3038
01:34:56.051 --> 01:34:58.250
and in cause there's gotta be a sense of humor,

3039
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.760
right?

3040
01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:03.760
Mixed in name of my company is laugh to win and it doesn't have anything to do

3041
01:35:04.521 --> 01:35:05.354
with mirth.

3042
01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:07.780
Hmm.

3043
01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:09.410
Well all the best pirates laugh,

3044
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:11.120
especially if it's the last one.

3045
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:12.183
Oof.

3046
01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:14.493
Um,

3047
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:18.900
few of these are going to detonate on the freeway home.

3048
01:35:19.190 --> 01:35:19.360
No.

3049
01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.193
Sure.

3050
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:21.291
And when you were,

3051
01:35:21.291 --> 01:35:22.124
when you were,

3052
01:35:24.230 --> 01:35:25.220
how much of your time,

3053
01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:27.260
how much time is involved in this?

3054
01:35:27.730 --> 01:35:30.680
No significant amount of time or back and forth.

3055
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:32.020
And uh,

3056
01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:34.730
so you're like a real professional now.

3057
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:36.740
Like over professional corporate dude.

3058
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:37.030
You look,

3059
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.850
you can do that.

3060
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:40.580
The 50 hour work week thing and no,

3061
01:35:40.581 --> 01:35:40.701
no,

3062
01:35:40.701 --> 01:35:41.534
no.

3063
01:35:42.230 --> 01:35:43.400
It's arch and trick.

3064
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:44.040
Okay.

3065
01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:44.873
Alright.

3066
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.883
Um,

3067
01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:50.950
it starts with what was the need,

3068
01:35:51.490 --> 01:35:52.150
what was the,

3069
01:35:52.150 --> 01:35:52.391
well,

3070
01:35:52.391 --> 01:35:55.270
the need that is like when Al Honnold goats climbing,

3071
01:35:55.271 --> 01:35:58.300
he's going to put on some sunblock and he doesn't want to touch that shit for

3072
01:35:58.301 --> 01:35:59.350
another four hours.

3073
01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.213
Right.

3074
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:01.420
So I built it for him.

3075
01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.153
Kay.

3076
01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:03.730
I,

3077
01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:08.320
I cracked my two Maulers and walked around for three years with no molders on

3078
01:36:08.321 --> 01:36:11.410
this side of my head when I caught Dang gay fever.

3079
01:36:11.490 --> 01:36:11.890
Whoa.

3080
01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:12.700
Okay.

3081
01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:17.080
Cause the sunblock and the stuff that had the mosquito shit and it washed off

3082
01:36:17.081 --> 01:36:18.340
when I got out of the Oh shit.

3083
01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:19.750
So I solved it.

3084
01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:26.100
And we are stripper friendly but we are not strippers so I don't want Shanie

3085
01:36:29.370 --> 01:36:30.210
so it's like I want,

3086
01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:32.270
I want satin.

3087
01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:33.573
Hello.

3088
01:36:33.730 --> 01:36:34.091
Okay.

3089
01:36:34.091 --> 01:36:35.380
I don't want to shiny.

3090
01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.090
There's room for shiny like,

3091
01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:37.331
you know,

3092
01:36:37.331 --> 01:36:38.110
Friday nights.

3093
01:36:38.110 --> 01:36:38.943
Sure.

3094
01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:41.380
And as far as fragrances,

3095
01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:42.810
thank you know.

3096
01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:43.600
Hmm.

3097
01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.433
Okay.

3098
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:45.783
Um,

3099
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:52.270
it took three years and more than you want a quote to solve that because every

3100
01:36:52.611 --> 01:36:54.740
time you go and you smell something,

3101
01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.810
you crack the jar of anything.

3102
01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:00.410
Somebody has played with that and probably in New Jersey.

3103
01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:02.203
Okay.

3104
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:03.163
Think like this.

3105
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:05.330
I'm already doing the pitch.

3106
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:06.230
You like ice cream.

3107
01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:06.800
You don't,

3108
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:09.950
your kids do gelato even better.

3109
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:11.203
Okay.

3110
01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:14.510
Suppose you want to make a coconut vanilla.

3111
01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:15.633
All right.

3112
01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:16.701
Well,

3113
01:37:16.701 --> 01:37:17.930
if you're buying most products,

3114
01:37:17.931 --> 01:37:20.720
you got to just go to one factory in New Jersey.

3115
01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:22.033
True Story.

3116
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:23.510
The L'Oreal's,

3117
01:37:23.511 --> 01:37:27.740
the neutrogenas is so forth and they're going to take the smell of coconut and

3118
01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:30.620
the smell of vanilla and it's in it makes it so forth.

3119
01:37:30.621 --> 01:37:31.454
This kind of a thing.

3120
01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:38.320
The fact is the cow lives in a very different place than the coconut lady who

3121
01:37:38.751 --> 01:37:42.260
grows coconuts and the guy who's going to sell you your vanilla lives in a whole

3122
01:37:42.261 --> 01:37:43.094
nother country.

3123
01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.590
The reason that ice cream taste so good as somebody got their ass on an airplane

3124
01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:52.160
and flew to all three places and that's what my staff does.

3125
01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:54.420
Our staff is artistic.

3126
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:55.530
It's like craft scotch

3127
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:58.410
<v 1>from the Carolinas.</v>

3128
01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.730
Which port puts your,

3129
01:37:59.731 --> 01:38:00.120
uh,

3130
01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:00.811
Pendleton on?

3131
01:38:00.811 --> 01:38:01.680
We're going to Portland

3132
01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:04.560
really?

3133
01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.560
And then we're going to go to Seattle because that's just one product.

3134
01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:12.720
It's my artists and all art thing that I do there.

3135
01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:18.050
And it came from a need behind the scenes started years ago when we'd be

3136
01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:22.470
climbing and stuff would get all over our hands and all over our ropes.

3137
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:26.400
We'd be kayaking and somebody keep dropping the yours cause something was

3138
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:27.234
slippery.

3139
01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:28.170
You follow?

3140
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:28.620
Yeah.

3141
01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:29.460
So okay,

3142
01:38:29.461 --> 01:38:30.660
someday I'm going to solve this.

3143
01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:32.340
Someday I'm going to solve this.

3144
01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.110
When you're in your 20s,

3145
01:38:34.111 --> 01:38:37.050
there's an Aha moment when you're my age,

3146
01:38:37.051 --> 01:38:37.920
there's more than one.

3147
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:42.300
And that's when we went out high again,

3148
01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:43.260
third time today.

3149
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:45.210
And we began to expand,

3150
01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:46.920
laugh to win,

3151
01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:49.170
make ink the original.

3152
01:38:49.171 --> 01:38:51.330
And we have 60 other products coming up.

3153
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:55.560
All of it developed for people who live in vans like Alex Honnold,

3154
01:38:56.190 --> 01:38:58.500
folks who live in transit at hotels,

3155
01:38:58.950 --> 01:39:03.390
people who live urban camping is what we do,

3156
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.820
especially me and my tour bus.

3157
01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:08.430
Everything I do is in the disco submarine.

3158
01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:13.380
We travel and you got to be familiar everywhere.

3159
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:14.790
Even Canada,

3160
01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:15.713
even Canada

3161
01:39:17.150 --> 01:39:17.551
and,

3162
01:39:17.551 --> 01:39:17.881
and,

3163
01:39:17.881 --> 01:39:21.270
and today we traveled the entire world with impunity.

3164
01:39:21.271 --> 01:39:22.560
You've got to South America,

3165
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:26.970
you go to Europe and something as simple.

3166
01:39:26.971 --> 01:39:28.260
When you go to Japan,

3167
01:39:30.190 --> 01:39:31.240
you're really going to go fine.

3168
01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.980
Dental floss on,

3169
01:39:32.981 --> 01:39:34.540
you're on now.

3170
01:39:34.541 --> 01:39:35.440
You're not pale face.

3171
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:38.200
You got to take me cause otherwise you're doing Pantha mine.

3172
01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:40.700
Yeah.

3173
01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:43.750
Wait until you get a bad stomach and you got a pan of mine that to the little

3174
01:39:43.751 --> 01:39:43.950
way.

3175
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:44.783
Yeah.

3176
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:47.103
Okay.

3177
01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:48.303
Um,

3178
01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.350
all of these things.

3179
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.461
Okay.

3180
01:39:51.461 --> 01:39:52.430
I gotta stay Bois.

3181
01:39:52.431 --> 01:39:54.010
She got to fit in my backpack.

3182
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:59.110
Every container has to be able to be sat on in a third world airport.

3183
01:39:59.590 --> 01:40:00.580
You gotta be able to,

3184
01:40:00.581 --> 01:40:03.010
Stevie wonder it in your backpack.

3185
01:40:03.550 --> 01:40:05.560
It's an insensitive illusion analogy,

3186
01:40:05.561 --> 01:40:10.561
but every one of our containers is such that you can stick your hand in the bag

3187
01:40:11.110 --> 01:40:13.000
while you're driving and find it.

3188
01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.650
I'm safety conscious.

3189
01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:15.640
What do you have kids in the car?

3190
01:40:15.650 --> 01:40:16.990
So was done by design.

3191
01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:20.100
The shape of the package is done by design so you could absolutely,

3192
01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.040
absolutely.

3193
01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:21.701
What does it look like?

3194
01:40:21.701 --> 01:40:22.361
She won't pull it up.

3195
01:40:22.361 --> 01:40:22.840
Jamie,

3196
01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:27.340
you can read our logos from across the Atlantic Ocean.

3197
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.863
Right?

3198
01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.580
Having worked and played Aaron the diner.

3199
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:34.423
Okay.

3200
01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:36.700
Suppose your granddaddy

3201
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:39.910
doesn't speak English.

3202
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:41.020
[inaudible] okay.

3203
01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.460
All of our products,

3204
01:40:42.461 --> 01:40:44.230
you have this kind of low going here.

3205
01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:45.160
All right,

3206
01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:48.530
so translate this to Granddad into Cambodia and Granddad.

3207
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:49.450
You're going to water,

3208
01:40:49.451 --> 01:40:50.284
exercise.

3209
01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:53.050
Everybody there is going to have their own.

3210
01:40:53.770 --> 01:40:54.520
Take Yours.

3211
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:58.720
Make sure grandma puts this one on and that works in 82 languages.

3212
01:40:58.780 --> 01:40:59.680
I like the logo.

3213
01:40:59.710 --> 01:41:00.280
Okay,

3214
01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:00.910
thank you.

3215
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:03.190
Cool looking little of sunscreen.

3216
01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:04.053
Thank you.

3217
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:05.650
You got hand grip and kiss,

3218
01:41:05.651 --> 01:41:07.690
you're wearing gloves at work in.

3219
01:41:07.691 --> 01:41:10.360
A lot of times when we're waiting in the projects.

3220
01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:11.171
Okay,

3221
01:41:11.171 --> 01:41:12.100
and the rainstorms,

3222
01:41:12.130 --> 01:41:12.970
you're wearing two gloves,

3223
01:41:12.971 --> 01:41:15.490
you got your rubber gloves and you got your duty gloves on.

3224
01:41:16.110 --> 01:41:16.720
Right?

3225
01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.330
You still got the no slip grip on the side.

3226
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:20.470
Fair enough.

3227
01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:23.230
And you got a daughter,

3228
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:23.740
right?

3229
01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.390
She's going to grow up to be somebody.

3230
01:41:25.391 --> 01:41:26.224
Right.

3231
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:30.160
And hanging around with guys and controlling guys.

3232
01:41:30.161 --> 01:41:33.880
My Dad worked in the prison system the last 20 years of his life.

3233
01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.010
K did eye surgeries up in Folsom,

3234
01:41:36.011 --> 01:41:36.940
San Quinten,

3235
01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:38.170
Norco,

3236
01:41:38.170 --> 01:41:39.070
Pelican Bay,

3237
01:41:39.190 --> 01:41:40.023
Cetera,

3238
01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:41.950
little skinny Jewish doctor.

3239
01:41:41.951 --> 01:41:46.540
How do you control level for violent lifers theater.

3240
01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.153
Okay.

3241
01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:49.510
You're going to tell your daughter,

3242
01:41:49.511 --> 01:41:52.120
don't pull anything pink out of your purse.

3243
01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:54.310
If you're sitting with a bunch of guys,

3244
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.080
pull that stuff out.

3245
01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:57.670
It's the right color,

3246
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:58.743
right?

3247
01:41:59.350 --> 01:42:01.000
If you're at a legal briefing,

3248
01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:02.500
you gotta be a boss.

3249
01:42:02.501 --> 01:42:05.020
Don't pull any Surillian blue,

3250
01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.590
especially if it's shiny vinyl out of your purse.

3251
01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:11.140
You can't have a purple that pull that.

3252
01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:11.950
Yeah.

3253
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:13.000
It says boss.

3254
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.720
Yeah.

3255
01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:14.710
In 22 lang,

3256
01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:15.573
what's in it?

3257
01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:15.790
Like,

3258
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:16.900
what's in it that makes it work?

3259
01:42:16.901 --> 01:42:17.310
Well,

3260
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.600
look,

3261
01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:21.580
that makes it waterproof and it's 100%,

3262
01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:23.313
uh,

3263
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:23.951
in the,

3264
01:42:23.951 --> 01:42:24.100
uh,

3265
01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.240
brightener for example,

3266
01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:26.530
it's organics.

3267
01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:27.393
Okay.

3268
01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:30.760
A brightener while it makes your tattoo shiny,

3269
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:31.623
you bet.

3270
01:42:31.690 --> 01:42:34.720
And it stays on just shorter forever.

3271
01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:37.330
It's days on when you go swimming,

3272
01:42:37.331 --> 01:42:37.990
so forth.

3273
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.823
Okay.

3274
01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:41.110
And what do you always do when somebody goes,

3275
01:42:41.111 --> 01:42:41.920
hey,

3276
01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:43.090
what's that new piece symbol?

3277
01:42:43.091 --> 01:42:44.140
You Lick your finger

3278
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:50.590
and you're of it and you show it before it dries out.

3279
01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:53.013
Okay,

3280
01:42:53.890 --> 01:42:56.260
I'm going to deal with the vanity's as guys.

3281
01:42:56.261 --> 01:42:57.850
You never want to say you give a shit.

3282
01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:58.630
Right.

3283
01:42:58.630 --> 01:43:00.610
I would teach my kid to say that if I add one,

3284
01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:03.911
hey,

3285
01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:05.770
your tattoos looking a little rusty.

3286
01:43:05.771 --> 01:43:06.550
I don't give a shit.

3287
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:08.140
Learn how to say that in a few languages.

3288
01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:08.993
Right?

3289
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:10.451
But you know,

3290
01:43:10.451 --> 01:43:11.240
you give a shit,

3291
01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.760
otherwise you wouldn't have gotten the paint job.

3292
01:43:12.850 --> 01:43:13.420
Right.

3293
01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:15.910
And you want the girls to know you've got a peace symbol anyways,

3294
01:43:15.911 --> 01:43:17.380
cause you look kind of me like me.

3295
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:19.630
Great.

3296
01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:20.560
Put your finger away.

3297
01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:21.394
Will you?

3298
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:22.703
We've got to clean up.

3299
01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.610
That's a bacterial thing.

3300
01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:26.320
So what's enough stuff?

3301
01:43:26.590 --> 01:43:28.270
You're going to make all the mistakes too.

3302
01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:31.900
You're going to go out and you're going to try and find cheap shit.

3303
01:43:31.901 --> 01:43:36.100
Moisturizers did you get to put on there and you're going to smear it all over

3304
01:43:36.101 --> 01:43:40.660
yourself and it's just going to look like that scene from something about Mary

3305
01:43:40.661 --> 01:43:41.830
when she puts that shit

3306
01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:48.420
and everybody's gonna think was as shit all over Bobby's arm like this and it's

3307
01:43:48.641 --> 01:43:52.790
going to get all over your tee shirt and your wife has a $600 tee shirt,

3308
01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:53.640
doesn't she Joe?

3309
01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:54.710
Okay,

3310
01:43:54.710 --> 01:43:57.920
so you got to consider all of this.

3311
01:43:58.190 --> 01:43:58.820
Okay.

3312
01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:00.350
I saw a nice car out there.

3313
01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:02.540
I'm guessing there's nice upholstery in it.

3314
01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:03.140
Yeah,

3315
01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:05.570
I took that into consideration and got you covered.

3316
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:06.290
Oh,

3317
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:07.123
okay.

3318
01:44:07.170 --> 01:44:08.003
And why not?

3319
01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:10.520
And it's the smell of victory there.

3320
01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:12.230
Nothing's vitamin C,

3321
01:44:12.231 --> 01:44:15.260
shea butter and coconut oil not tested on animals.

3322
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:16.820
Dermatologist reviews,

3323
01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:19.310
man were paraben-free petroleum free.

3324
01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:21.350
We aren't full list of ingredients.

3325
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:22.040
Here we go.

3326
01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:23.150
What is all this jazz?

3327
01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:28.300
We are one of the few products here that is reef safe allowable in Hawaii.

3328
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:31.610
Okay.

3329
01:44:31.610 --> 01:44:36.610
The limit of what's going into the oceans now and the tourist areas of world.

3330
01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:37.910
In Hawaii,

3331
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:42.140
you can count on one hand the products they're allowing to be used on the

3332
01:44:42.141 --> 01:44:44.900
beaches and even in the swimming pools and stuff now.

3333
01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:47.810
So that comes to us.

3334
01:44:47.811 --> 01:44:49.730
This is a whole a hundred percent organic stuff.

3335
01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:51.730
It's on waxes and butters.

3336
01:44:51.731 --> 01:44:52.564
Yep.

3337
01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:56.840
When people talk about miracle ingredients,

3338
01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.113
I don't know,

3339
01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:03.860
I think in terms of there's water and then there's Fiji,

3340
01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:06.710
uh,

3341
01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:07.543
butter,

3342
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:08.180
eggs,

3343
01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:08.900
sugar,

3344
01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:09.733
flour.

3345
01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:12.680
That's all that there is in the bakery.

3346
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.843
All right.

3347
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:15.620
We invented the cronut.

3348
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:17.690
Okay.

3349
01:45:17.690 --> 01:45:20.060
You take the best of this and the best of that.

3350
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:22.400
And the considerations again,

3351
01:45:22.401 --> 01:45:23.960
come from life experience.

3352
01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:26.990
I didn't just look at myself and go,

3353
01:45:26.991 --> 01:45:27.824
wow,

3354
01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:28.813
uh,

3355
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:30.560
here's an idea to make money.

3356
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.060
My fortune has been made.

3357
01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:35.810
What we did is fine.

3358
01:45:35.811 --> 01:45:38.510
What we can use when we're living out of backpacks,

3359
01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:41.720
what we can use when we go dancing.

3360
01:45:41.721 --> 01:45:45.080
I still go dancing and I don't leave that floor for four hours.

3361
01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:46.993
Where do you go dancing?

3362
01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:51.040
I'm not telling you no go.

3363
01:45:53.150 --> 01:45:53.983
Oh yeah.

3364
01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:55.063
Routine.

3365
01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:55.670
Really?

3366
01:45:55.670 --> 01:45:55.791
Oh,

3367
01:45:55.791 --> 01:45:56.570
you bet.

3368
01:45:56.570 --> 01:45:56.961
Where are you?

3369
01:45:56.961 --> 01:45:58.310
Where are you going to show that ink?

3370
01:45:58.720 --> 01:45:59.090
Right.

3371
01:45:59.090 --> 01:46:01.070
Follow up today.

3372
01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.830
I know in New York City for example,

3373
01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:08.300
Mr Chinn lives right next to Mr. Gomez.

3374
01:46:09.110 --> 01:46:09.950
They both live over.

3375
01:46:09.951 --> 01:46:10.970
Mr Katzenberg,

3376
01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.520
Mr Radda Covich owns the building.

3377
01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:15.380
None of them can speak to each other.

3378
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:17.180
They all speak a different language,

3379
01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:18.950
they're all different religions,

3380
01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:19.813
et cetera.

3381
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.950
So there's two ways we communicate.

3382
01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.570
First is swearing.

3383
01:46:24.650 --> 01:46:25.670
You know how to do that,

3384
01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:26.390
right?

3385
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:27.051
You learn seven,

3386
01:46:27.051 --> 01:46:28.040
eight words and swearing.

3387
01:46:28.041 --> 01:46:29.300
You can describe anything.

3388
01:46:30.110 --> 01:46:31.100
This shows the shit,

3389
01:46:31.290 --> 01:46:31.521
Joe,

3390
01:46:31.521 --> 01:46:32.354
you're the shit.

3391
01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:33.080
Thank you.

3392
01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.610
What kind of Shit are you doing lately?

3393
01:46:34.730 --> 01:46:35.780
That last fight?

3394
01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:37.033
That was the shit.

3395
01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.550
And we're having a conversation,

3396
01:46:40.551 --> 01:46:40.760
right?

3397
01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.061
Okay.

3398
01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:41.894
Legs Up.

3399
01:46:42.110 --> 01:46:44.560
And the next is inc uh,

3400
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:47.060
she got a chicken on one arm and a cleaver.

3401
01:46:47.061 --> 01:46:47.894
You butcher

3402
01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:50.100
and

3403
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:50.691
<v 2>the girl down there,</v>

3404
01:46:50.691 --> 01:46:52.530
he's got cupcakes with funny noses.

3405
01:46:52.531 --> 01:46:53.364
Let me guess.

3406
01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:55.920
He's got musical notes.

3407
01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:56.850
Can I guess more?

3408
01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.090
Right?

3409
01:46:58.090 --> 01:46:58.720
And,

3410
01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.553
and

3411
01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:01.920
in an Esperanza,

3412
01:47:01.921 --> 01:47:05.910
you walk out in front of Columbia University at lunchtime,

3413
01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:07.980
it's the future.

3414
01:47:07.981 --> 01:47:10.200
You would not know that it's United States.

3415
01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:13.200
It is a complete composite international.

3416
01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.210
Just the smell of all the food trucks.

3417
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:20.160
The last thing you smell is salami and yellow cheese on white bread.

3418
01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:21.023
Thank God.

3419
01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:22.980
Say thank God and a few other languages.

3420
01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:26.173
Really.

3421
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:27.030
Okay.

3422
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:32.030
So it's a communication and that's part of my fascination with it.

3423
01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:36.210
It's a constantly evolving Esperanto art form.

3424
01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:39.150
I've visited tribes in New Guinea who can't dance.

3425
01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:40.013
They don't have,

3426
01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:41.010
they don't dance,

3427
01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:42.630
but they did have tattooing.

3428
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:44.310
They did have scars.

3429
01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:45.271
Ice Man.

3430
01:47:45.271 --> 01:47:46.500
They found it a glacier.

3431
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.071
That guy,

3432
01:47:47.071 --> 01:47:47.710
uh,

3433
01:47:47.710 --> 01:47:48.543
uh,

3434
01:47:48.630 --> 01:47:48.840
you know,

3435
01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:49.710
they found his body,

3436
01:47:49.711 --> 01:47:50.600
I forget what they call it,

3437
01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:51.210
Africa,

3438
01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:51.781
what his name is,

3439
01:47:51.781 --> 01:47:52.770
but he had tattoos on him.

3440
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:53.190
I mean,

3441
01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:57.810
he's thousands of years old that Fabio

3442
01:48:01.110 --> 01:48:01.943
Joe,

3443
01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:03.870
doesn't he go to your gym?

3444
01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:06.770
Jamie's as I see him all the time,

3445
01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:08.971
they still look good.

3446
01:48:08.971 --> 01:48:12.270
But Fabio is very recognizable.

3447
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:17.220
Fabio is like sideburns and flares and a easy listening.

3448
01:48:17.221 --> 01:48:18.330
We always make fun.

3449
01:48:18.331 --> 01:48:20.660
But there's one of them in your past that guide,

3450
01:48:20.850 --> 01:48:22.290
banked on his hair.

3451
01:48:22.530 --> 01:48:22.891
I mean,

3452
01:48:22.891 --> 01:48:24.180
if that guy went bald like me,

3453
01:48:24.181 --> 01:48:25.140
he'd be fucked.

3454
01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:27.000
It still is the exact same.

3455
01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:27.751
Fabulous,

3456
01:48:27.751 --> 01:48:28.290
right?

3457
01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:29.490
Amazing genetics.

3458
01:48:30.190 --> 01:48:31.080
He got a lucky break.

3459
01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:33.600
He's one of the characters.

3460
01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:36.120
Who are other characters like that?

3461
01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:36.840
Oh,

3462
01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:41.640
David Hasselhoff sore now has a hassle book.

3463
01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:42.600
What does that,

3464
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:42.811
well,

3465
01:48:42.811 --> 01:48:45.210
he has his own Facebook thing and he's met so many.

3466
01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.750
I got the disdain look from Joe.

3467
01:48:51.010 --> 01:48:52.090
Got a hassle,

3468
01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:53.670
not smiler.

3469
01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:55.200
Oh my God.

3470
01:48:55.201 --> 01:48:56.160
Housel book.

3471
01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:58.290
He is fucking cold colo here.

3472
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:02.040

3473
01:49:03.450 --> 01:49:07.020

3474
01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:08.190
Holy Shit.

3475
01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:09.480
Who was uh,

3476
01:49:09.570 --> 01:49:10.860
Anna Nicole Smith?

3477
01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:11.280
Yeah,

3478
01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:11.480
she,

3479
01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:12.210
there's three.

3480
01:49:12.210 --> 01:49:13.230
There's three phases.

3481
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:14.610
First phase,

3482
01:49:14.610 --> 01:49:17.220
pretty big guest genes ad correct.

3483
01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:17.580
Right.

3484
01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:19.350
And then there's married to the old dude.

3485
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.580
Well,

3486
01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:20.520
I'm a little Janky.

3487
01:49:20.521 --> 01:49:23.970
I kind of liked the last one to the rich right before she dies.

3488
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.790
Elvis had three phases.

3489
01:49:27.090 --> 01:49:27.751
So,

3490
01:49:27.751 --> 01:49:28.260
uh,

3491
01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.093
yeah,

3492
01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:33.000
but there are folks also that don't have phases.

3493
01:49:33.001 --> 01:49:36.660
Springsteen never had aphasia was always Springsteen there and is looking good.

3494
01:49:36.661 --> 01:49:37.494
Fabio,

3495
01:49:37.710 --> 01:49:39.740
he's about 85 years old still.

3496
01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:41.690
I mean,

3497
01:49:41.690 --> 01:49:43.020
I don't see him working out a lot,

3498
01:49:43.021 --> 01:49:43.854
but he's there.

3499
01:49:43.890 --> 01:49:45.210
What does he do if he's at the gym?

3500
01:49:45.250 --> 01:49:45.750
I don't know.

3501
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:46.583
Talking to a women.

3502
01:49:46.590 --> 01:49:47.680
Oh Damn.

3503
01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:48.520
Still scoring.

3504
01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:48.671
<v 4>No,</v>

3505
01:49:48.671 --> 01:49:49.504
but

3506
01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:51.280
that's,

3507
01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.220
that's so cre,

3508
01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.400
you want to think about it but you don't,

3509
01:49:54.401 --> 01:49:55.290
but you do,

3510
01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:56.020
but you don't.

3511
01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:56.381
Yeah.

3512
01:49:56.381 --> 01:49:58.170
You want to think about the guy that wants a bank.

3513
01:49:58.171 --> 01:49:58.391
Fab.

3514
01:49:58.391 --> 01:49:59.224
Fabulous.

3515
01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:01.120
Super pumped about it.

3516
01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:02.590
He's coming over in five minutes.

3517
01:50:02.591 --> 01:50:03.424
I've got to get ready.

3518
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:06.100
What are you watching on TV?

3519
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:08.260
Do you have television?

3520
01:50:08.290 --> 01:50:08.940
Yes.

3521
01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:12.250
And what are you watching regular like cause I don't have television.

3522
01:50:12.251 --> 01:50:14.860
I listened to serious Jack Sham routinely.

3523
01:50:15.250 --> 01:50:18.070
I listened to like six different channels over and over again there.

3524
01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.190
Lately I'm watching the Marvelous Mrs Maizel,

3525
01:50:21.250 --> 01:50:22.640
which is a a net.

3526
01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:23.620
It's a not nothing for,

3527
01:50:23.621 --> 01:50:24.041
excuse me,

3528
01:50:24.041 --> 01:50:25.210
it's an Amazon show.

3529
01:50:25.450 --> 01:50:29.540
It's an Amazon original show about a standup comedian in the 1950s when women

3530
01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:29.790
stand,

3531
01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:31.780
standup comedian who hangs out with Lenny Bruce.

3532
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:33.250
It's really good.

3533
01:50:33.250 --> 01:50:33.610
Okay.

3534
01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:36.230
Really good show women standup comedian.

3535
01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:37.840
There's a great subject.

3536
01:50:37.850 --> 01:50:38.683
Sherif Silverman.

3537
01:50:38.850 --> 01:50:39.310
Yeah.

3538
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:40.143
Hooray.

3539
01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.150
Spectacular.

3540
01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:41.980
Right.

3541
01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:46.980
She has a real hurdle because one of the things that she does best is play the

3542
01:50:47.591 --> 01:50:50.770
part of the character she's lampooning.

3543
01:50:50.890 --> 01:50:51.530
Sure.

3544
01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:52.270
Yeah.

3545
01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:56.650
She plays the part beautifully of a witless.

3546
01:50:56.710 --> 01:50:57.543
Yup.

3547
01:50:57.610 --> 01:50:58.540
Racist,

3548
01:50:58.541 --> 01:50:59.374
whatever.

3549
01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:04.600
And her hurdle is that a large segment of the audience doesn't realize that it's

3550
01:51:04.601 --> 01:51:05.434
an act.

3551
01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:06.640
Well now.

3552
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:07.990
Now that's the hurdle.

3553
01:51:08.050 --> 01:51:11.860
Especially now if you go back and look at some of her older bits and look at any

3554
01:51:11.861 --> 01:51:12.191
special,

3555
01:51:12.191 --> 01:51:14.920
if you looked at it written down as opposed to her sang it.

3556
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:20.260
We're in such an overwhelmingly sensitive time when it comes to subject matter

3557
01:51:20.290 --> 01:51:20.591
that yeah,

3558
01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:22.120
that would be a big hurdle for now,

3559
01:51:22.150 --> 01:51:25.120
but it's the best work ever and it made such an impact.

3560
01:51:25.121 --> 01:51:26.830
The first time I ever saw her do it,

3561
01:51:26.831 --> 01:51:28.590
and this is a tradition that goes all the way back.

3562
01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:30.070
Back during Lincoln,

3563
01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:34.840
there was a fellow who wrote the Nas be letters where he pretended to be a

3564
01:51:34.841 --> 01:51:39.841
southern racist and making fun of southern racism by pretending to be Lincoln

3565
01:51:40.151 --> 01:51:44.710
kept the articles clipped from the newspaper in his drawer so he could read them

3566
01:51:44.711 --> 01:51:48.040
occasionally and laugh during the civil war.

3567
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.251
You know,

3568
01:51:48.251 --> 01:51:53.251
this is a tradition of acting out the character that you are about to execute.

3569
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.811
Unfortunately,

3570
01:51:55.811 --> 01:51:56.381
there's a lot.

3571
01:51:56.381 --> 01:51:56.830
What?

3572
01:51:56.830 --> 01:52:01.600
What is the chemistry that folks don't understand that you are pretending they

3573
01:52:01.601 --> 01:52:02.350
don't care.

3574
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.831
It's not.

3575
01:52:02.831 --> 01:52:04.330
It's a dishonest approach.

3576
01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:07.690
They don't care whether or not you're pretending what they see.

3577
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:12.040
You have said something or there's something written that shows that you said

3578
01:52:12.041 --> 01:52:16.120
something that they feel is in violation and so they want to go after it.

3579
01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:16.640
It,

3580
01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:17.830
it doesn't make illiterates.

3581
01:52:17.850 --> 01:52:18.110
Yes,

3582
01:52:18.110 --> 01:52:20.020
it's literal and it's also,

3583
01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:24.070
it's disingenuous because they know it could be parody and they don't care.

3584
01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:25.510
There's so much of that today.

3585
01:52:25.511 --> 01:52:26.680
It's really interesting.

3586
01:52:26.681 --> 01:52:30.730
It's really interesting because there's so many people that are,

3587
01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.740
they just looking for things to be upset about.

3588
01:52:32.741 --> 01:52:37.240
It's a recreational outrage and I think it's probably because things are going

3589
01:52:37.241 --> 01:52:39.280
so well in this world.

3590
01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:39.970
I mean it's not,

3591
01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:42.220
I mean some people say it's not going that well.

3592
01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:42.581
You know,

3593
01:52:42.581 --> 01:52:43.810
there's a lot of things to be fixed.

3594
01:52:43.811 --> 01:52:44.620
For sure.

3595
01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:46.130
It's is the safest time

3596
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:47.210
<v 5>to be alive ever.</v>

3597
01:52:47.630 --> 01:52:48.430
It just is.

3598
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:52.100
Is is undeniably the safest tongue agree with that and I think people are more

3599
01:52:52.101 --> 01:52:54.740
open minded than ever or more kind than ever.

3600
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:56.390
There's less violence than ever.

3601
01:52:56.391 --> 01:52:56.631
All the,

3602
01:52:56.631 --> 01:52:57.710
if you look at Pinker's work,

3603
01:52:58.370 --> 01:52:59.870
all these things are trending in a very,

3604
01:52:59.871 --> 01:53:01.340
very clear and obvious direction.

3605
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:06.260
And I think when you have coddled mines and you have more safety,

3606
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:09.770
people start running around looking for things to be upset at the end.

3607
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:13.640
And also a lot of young people that are very idealistic think they're going to

3608
01:53:13.641 --> 01:53:14.474
change the world.

3609
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:17.420
And one of the ways are going to change the world's by policing language and

3610
01:53:17.421 --> 01:53:20.240
policing the way people talk about things and discuss things.

3611
01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.680
And so standup comedy,

3612
01:53:21.681 --> 01:53:22.041
which is,

3613
01:53:22.041 --> 01:53:22.850
you know,

3614
01:53:22.850 --> 01:53:24.980
you say a lot of things you don't really mean cause they're funny.

3615
01:53:24.981 --> 01:53:25.221
You know,

3616
01:53:25.221 --> 01:53:27.110
that's the whole point behind it.

3617
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:32.290
And so it's ripe as far as a target for that kind of recreational outrage.

3618
01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:38.430
<v 1>The musical equivalent perhaps is really shitty songs written about important</v>

3619
01:53:38.431 --> 01:53:39.050
subjects.

3620
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:40.240
Yeah.

3621
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:41.303
Yeah.

3622
01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:44.910
Really shitty songs written about important subjects are offensive.

3623
01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:49.170
They write the melody sound,

3624
01:53:49.171 --> 01:53:52.190
reminds you of overdue dentist appointments.

3625
01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:57.690
Sounds like why hot water being thrown in this example,

3626
01:53:58.110 --> 01:53:59.670
but it's about starving children.

3627
01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:00.001
Right?

3628
01:54:00.001 --> 01:54:01.020
What's a good example?

3629
01:54:01.290 --> 01:54:01.531
No,

3630
01:54:01.531 --> 01:54:02.364
don't go there.

3631
01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:04.860
We don't need to do that.

3632
01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.170
But we all know this.

3633
01:54:06.970 --> 01:54:07.980
We're all thinking,

3634
01:54:07.981 --> 01:54:08.191
yeah,

3635
01:54:08.191 --> 01:54:09.024
we all do.

3636
01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:12.000
And if you criticize the song,

3637
01:54:12.450 --> 01:54:15.510
even if you say it's just musically,

3638
01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:18.690
that sounds like we shall overcome.

3639
01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:19.890
Whoa,

3640
01:54:19.890 --> 01:54:21.120
that's about patch.

3641
01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:22.563
Yeah.

3642
01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:24.420
I love pets.

3643
01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:24.820
Beautiful.

3644
01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:25.653
You just,

3645
01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:27.090
and with his movies like that too,

3646
01:54:27.091 --> 01:54:27.390
right?

3647
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:30.450
There's movies about really important subjects that are terrible movies.

3648
01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:31.853
Like how many

3649
01:54:33.450 --> 01:54:37.050
caused me to think that if it's are really,

3650
01:54:37.051 --> 01:54:38.400
really important subject,

3651
01:54:38.401 --> 01:54:41.540
it probably as a terrible movie most likely.

3652
01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:42.374
Why do I think that?

3653
01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:43.230
Well,

3654
01:54:43.230 --> 01:54:46.950
there's no way to really get an important subject and boil it down to two hours.

3655
01:54:48.090 --> 01:54:48.241
Oh,

3656
01:54:48.241 --> 01:54:49.080
I didn't think of that.

3657
01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:50.110
You know,

3658
01:54:50.110 --> 01:54:50.943
can be two hours

3659
01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:52.910
and employee.

3660
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:53.311
You're right,

3661
01:54:53.311 --> 01:54:53.640
Jack.

3662
01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:53.941
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

3663
01:54:53.941 --> 01:54:54.270
I mean,

3664
01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:58.680
especially like one thing that drives me crazy is when they take liberties with

3665
01:54:58.681 --> 01:54:59.910
someone's biography,

3666
01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:03.420
like if they would do a biography on someone's life and they change things

3667
01:55:03.421 --> 01:55:06.750
around or add things to it for theatrical flair.

3668
01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:08.160
<v 1>She the queen movie.</v>

3669
01:55:08.490 --> 01:55:08.641
No,

3670
01:55:08.641 --> 01:55:09.260
I did not see it yet.

3671
01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:10.380
I haven't seen it either.

3672
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:11.580
I heard it's very good though.

3673
01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:13.620
You heard it's very good.

3674
01:55:13.621 --> 01:55:16.530
Did you ask the person who told you that why it's good?

3675
01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:17.461
Um,

3676
01:55:17.461 --> 01:55:18.030
yes.

3677
01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:18.391
Yes.

3678
01:55:18.391 --> 01:55:19.110
And what did they share?

3679
01:55:19.110 --> 01:55:20.290
They said the,

3680
01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:20.821
first of all,

3681
01:55:20.821 --> 01:55:23.820
the guy who plays Freddie Mercury apparently is brilliant in it.

3682
01:55:23.821 --> 01:55:26.640
And it's head they seen originally had they seen Freddie lives?

3683
01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:26.881
No,

3684
01:55:26.881 --> 01:55:27.540
not live.

3685
01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.010
I saw Freddy live at the forum.

3686
01:55:29.011 --> 01:55:34.011
I was in the maybe 20th row six in when Bohemian rhapsody had just come out.

3687
01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:36.150
Oh my goodness.

3688
01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:36.421
Yeah,

3689
01:55:36.421 --> 01:55:37.630
I saw him in is absolutely.

3690
01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:38.641
That is major,

3691
01:55:38.641 --> 01:55:39.780
major prime there.

3692
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:42.150
So I'm very curious as to,

3693
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:43.920
well stage is one thing,

3694
01:55:43.921 --> 01:55:44.100
but

3695
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.570
<v 2>what Freddie was and what he brought was way more than what you saw on stage.</v>

3696
01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:49.440
Yeah.

3697
01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:49.820
Yeah.

3698
01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:50.340
Very La.

3699
01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:51.173
What was he bringing?

3700
01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:53.610
Well,

3701
01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:59.120
his sensibilities in terms of music weren't just three chords in an attitude and

3702
01:55:59.791 --> 01:56:01.260
they'll fall for that shit either.

3703
01:56:01.261 --> 01:56:02.940
If Keith ever sits here and tries,

3704
01:56:02.941 --> 01:56:07.941
that shit is all raw again and now you just named three three goals in an etude.

3705
01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:09.480
Yeah.

3706
01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:12.540
And you need to know the inversions of each one.

3707
01:56:12.541 --> 01:56:14.130
All seven modal nut.

3708
01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:14.993
Fuck you Keith.

3709
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:19.080
Because he does know all those and the trick tunings and whatever.

3710
01:56:19.110 --> 01:56:19.850
Yeah.

3711
01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:20.190
Um,

3712
01:56:20.190 --> 01:56:25.190
Freddy brought a whole wealth of listening to different kinds of music,

3713
01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:30.950
whether it was orchestral big band bistro than me done it then.

3714
01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:34.140
That's bestrode uh,

3715
01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:36.110
uh,

3716
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:37.081
what do you call it?

3717
01:56:37.081 --> 01:56:37.561
Music,

3718
01:56:37.561 --> 01:56:38.190
music,

3719
01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:38.741
music,

3720
01:56:38.741 --> 01:56:40.290
that small,

3721
01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:40.680
uh,

3722
01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.290
something you might hear in a coffee shop in France.

3723
01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:44.220
Well,

3724
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:46.710
his music was so different.

3725
01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:50.370
His singing was so different than anything else from his era.

3726
01:56:50.710 --> 01:56:51.181
But you listen to,

3727
01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:52.230
we are the champions.

3728
01:56:52.710 --> 01:56:54.600
He didn't try to sing black.

3729
01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:56.070
Okay.

3730
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:57.120
Sang Freddie Mercury.

3731
01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.860
We Sang European nonblack what?

3732
01:57:01.861 --> 01:57:04.230
We're very used to even in country.

3733
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:07.620
I had a very famous black producer,

3734
01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:09.150
African American producer,

3735
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.811
say to me,

3736
01:57:09.811 --> 01:57:10.644
David Lee,

3737
01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:14.700
do you know what it means to be a black man in the United States today?

3738
01:57:14.701 --> 01:57:15.000
I see.

3739
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.410
Every time I step up to the mic,

3740
01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:18.893
I try.

3741
01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:20.730
That's what I grew up with,

3742
01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:22.680
trying to sound like meltdown,

3743
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:24.400
trying to sound like Wilson Pickett.

3744
01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:26.850
Try to sound like an on and on that,

3745
01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:29.210
that you know,

3746
01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:31.740
that voter block had such an impact on music,

3747
01:57:31.741 --> 01:57:34.410
much less the overall culture and comedy.

3748
01:57:34.411 --> 01:57:34.590
Yeah.

3749
01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:35.100
<v 5>Well,</v>

3750
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:35.371
I mean,

3751
01:57:35.371 --> 01:57:36.800
if I had to vote for Bingo,

3752
01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.040
greatest all time,

3753
01:57:38.041 --> 01:57:38.511
comedian,

3754
01:57:38.511 --> 01:57:39.344
it'd be prior.

3755
01:57:39.570 --> 01:57:41.430
The greatest of all time I would,

3756
01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:42.680
I would have to say it's,

3757
01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:43.650
he's in the running.

3758
01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:44.060
I mean,

3759
01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:45.180
if it's not him,

3760
01:57:45.181 --> 01:57:46.110
I don't know who it is.

3761
01:57:47.130 --> 01:57:49.210
I'll agree with you that there's so many,

3762
01:57:49.410 --> 01:57:49.800
some,

3763
01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:53.310
I mean you look at African American standup comedians and the contribution in

3764
01:57:53.311 --> 01:57:58.311
terms of like the overall numbers of the top 10 a giant chunk of them were

3765
01:57:59.491 --> 01:58:00.270
black,

3766
01:58:00.270 --> 01:58:01.710
a giant Chunk Chappelle,

3767
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.633
Chris Rock,

3768
01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:04.500
definitely prior.

3769
01:58:04.770 --> 01:58:05.160
That guy's,

3770
01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.480
that guy's forget about Bernie Mac,

3771
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:08.070
Bernie Mac with God damn genius.

3772
01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:08.560
You know,

3773
01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:10.440
a lot of people don't know about Robin Harris.

3774
01:58:10.441 --> 01:58:14.880
Robin Harris has such huge influence to people in the nineties the eighties and

3775
01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:15.713
the nineties when he died,

3776
01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:16.441
he died.

3777
01:58:16.441 --> 01:58:18.480
I think in the early nineties

3778
01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:21.060
<v 2>you're illuminating for the audience,</v>

3779
01:58:21.061 --> 01:58:23.730
but here you're preaching to the already convinced judge.

3780
01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:26.460
I think it's because of the,

3781
01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:28.020
I grew up with comedy records.

3782
01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:28.890
Yeah.

3783
01:58:28.890 --> 01:58:29.723
Okay.

3784
01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:31.020
Red Fox.

3785
01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:31.680
And if you're,

3786
01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:36.680
you can still hear red doing on the classic comedy channel on Sirius Xm and his

3787
01:58:38.701 --> 01:58:40.190
shit is still funny.

3788
01:58:40.191 --> 01:58:42.510
It's still good and read.

3789
01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:43.480
Let's revisit,

3790
01:58:43.481 --> 01:58:46.330
is it the delivery system?

3791
01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:49.360
It's everything or the thing,

3792
01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.750
because you can't sell it.

3793
01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:54.850
I started imitating Red Fox when I was probably 12 years old.

3794
01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:56.500
That is the lead.

3795
01:58:56.501 --> 01:58:57.490
It wasn't walks in,

3796
01:58:58.610 --> 01:58:59.443
right?

3797
01:58:59.630 --> 01:59:00.190
Yeah.

3798
01:59:00.190 --> 01:59:01.330
I should do it.

3799
01:59:01.690 --> 01:59:02.350
And you know,

3800
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:02.860
I mean,

3801
01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:06.400
Bill Cosby Cosby was obviously a horrible person in retrospect,

3802
01:59:06.730 --> 01:59:08.220
but his art form is,

3803
01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:09.640
his artwork was amazing.

3804
01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:09.911
I mean,

3805
01:59:09.911 --> 01:59:11.320
I listen to comedy records.

3806
01:59:11.321 --> 01:59:13.240
You memorized word for word,

3807
01:59:13.241 --> 01:59:14.860
you memorized Richard Pryor,

3808
01:59:14.861 --> 01:59:16.420
you're memorized Red Fox,

3809
01:59:16.421 --> 01:59:20.650
you memorize bill Cosby and you memorized Rodney Dangerfield.

3810
01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:21.100
Oh yeah.

3811
01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:21.491
Okay.

3812
01:59:21.491 --> 01:59:21.730
This,

3813
01:59:21.730 --> 01:59:22.960
those are the four horsemen.

3814
01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:27.430
And if when you run out of conversation at a beer soak,

3815
01:59:27.431 --> 01:59:28.330
frat party,

3816
01:59:28.331 --> 01:59:29.020
highschool,

3817
01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:29.651
whatever,

3818
01:59:29.651 --> 01:59:31.540
which is in about two sentences,

3819
01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:32.673
you see,

3820
01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:35.200
you either quote your favorite movies.

3821
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.650
Yeah.

3822
01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:37.420
That's how you would converse as guys,

3823
01:59:37.421 --> 01:59:37.870
you know,

3824
01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:37.991
hey,

3825
01:59:37.991 --> 01:59:38.171
you know,

3826
01:59:38.171 --> 01:59:39.880
let's see where it fucking blows them away.

3827
01:59:39.890 --> 01:59:40.780
Fucking a flood.

3828
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:43.660
And we express ourselves or you go,

3829
01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:44.771
you start it.

3830
01:59:44.771 --> 01:59:44.981
You know,

3831
01:59:44.981 --> 01:59:46.120
I can't get no respect.

3832
01:59:46.190 --> 01:59:47.370
Yeah.

3833
01:59:47.850 --> 01:59:48.280
Yeah.

3834
01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:48.461
And,

3835
01:59:48.461 --> 01:59:49.630
and doctor told me,

3836
01:59:49.631 --> 01:59:50.520
I have to run it.

3837
01:59:50.890 --> 01:59:53.390
I even tried this with the staff and said,

3838
01:59:53.391 --> 01:59:53.800
David,

3839
01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:54.633
how you doing?

3840
01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:55.961
Yeah,

3841
01:59:55.961 --> 02:00:00.961
man on doctor told me I had to run a 10 a mile a day and then call them on 10

3842
02:00:01.931 --> 02:00:02.764
days later.

3843
02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:04.480
And while I'm calling you,

3844
02:00:04.481 --> 02:00:05.320
I'm 10 miles away.

3845
02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:08.470
Rodney Dangerfield.

3846
02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:09.333
Okay.

3847
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
You learned comedy records and you sat around the record player and learned it.

3848
02:00:16.211 --> 02:00:18.230
I don't think people do that and no,

3849
02:00:18.300 --> 02:00:18.610
no.

3850
02:00:18.610 --> 02:00:19.510
That was a thing man.

3851
02:00:19.511 --> 02:00:19.991
When I was a kid,

3852
02:00:19.991 --> 02:00:21.310
we used to listen to Cheech and Chong.

3853
02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:24.490
Big Bamboo would all sit around and listen to the record.

3854
02:00:24.970 --> 02:00:25.301
Yeah,

3855
02:00:25.301 --> 02:00:25.990
man.

3856
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:29.280
And that was a different one too because they weren't even doing stand up David.

3857
02:00:29.281 --> 02:00:31.300
That was a completely unique thing.

3858
02:00:31.301 --> 02:00:33.640
They were doing sketch comedy on a record.

3859
02:00:34.810 --> 02:00:38.230
It's interesting that pot culture,

3860
02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:40.090
which is the international now.

3861
02:00:40.210 --> 02:00:41.043
Okay.

3862
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:42.183
Um,

3863
02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:45.160
started with an agent and a Hispanic.

3864
02:00:45.161 --> 02:00:45.940
Yeah,

3865
02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:47.560
they fucking were the kings of it.

3866
02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:48.251
Age.

3867
02:00:48.251 --> 02:00:49.780
You can again,

3868
02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:53.230
sideburns and when it was the old bottoms,

3869
02:00:53.231 --> 02:00:54.130
we make fun.

3870
02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:54.580
Yeah.

3871
02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:58.210
But everybody on earth knows Cheech and Chong.

3872
02:00:58.211 --> 02:00:59.920
How many decades later?

3873
02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:00.940
How many decades?

3874
02:01:00.941 --> 02:01:05.941
I went rock climbing as far away as humanly possible from anything ever made by

3875
02:01:07.031 --> 02:01:07.391
God,

3876
02:01:07.391 --> 02:01:10.070
man or others please called Arapaho ease.

3877
02:01:10.970 --> 02:01:15.250
It's about four hours north of Melbourne out in the middle of nowhere.

3878
02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:16.930
Big San drip castles.

3879
02:01:16.931 --> 02:01:18.720
You can dial it up and fire rapidly.

3880
02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.010
And we had a couple of campers like trucks that we parked and we put up a tarp

3881
02:01:24.011 --> 02:01:27.130
in the middle and Campfire and whatever.

3882
02:01:28.330 --> 02:01:29.170
And uh,

3883
02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:30.041
I had a little,

3884
02:01:30.041 --> 02:01:33.390
a little television screen and uh,

3885
02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:35.560
we plugged that into the car battery.

3886
02:01:36.010 --> 02:01:36.843
Okay.

3887
02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:37.510
And you know,

3888
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:40.010
I went to the other camp sites because we fucked

3889
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.120
<v 1>up not broad enough,</v>

3890
02:01:41.121 --> 02:01:41.841
whatever it was,

3891
02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:42.261
water,

3892
02:01:42.261 --> 02:01:44.460
food or whatever answer appellees wow.

3893
02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:44.780
You know,

3894
02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:48.320
I went to the different camp sites and invited everybody,

3895
02:01:48.321 --> 02:01:48.561
you know,

3896
02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:48.981
hey man,

3897
02:01:48.981 --> 02:01:50.040
can I borrow this?

3898
02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:52.520
And you guys got any oatmeal or anything like this?

3899
02:01:52.521 --> 02:01:53.151
And then yeah,

3900
02:01:53.151 --> 02:01:58.151
we were going to be watching Cheech and Chong over under the far edge over

3901
02:01:58.551 --> 02:01:58.761
there.

3902
02:01:58.761 --> 02:01:59.391
You'll see us,

3903
02:01:59.391 --> 02:02:03.590
you'll heal it and come on over and join us from all over the world.

3904
02:02:03.591 --> 02:02:04.880
You've got guys from Thailand,

3905
02:02:04.881 --> 02:02:06.380
you got girls from England.

3906
02:02:06.490 --> 02:02:08.390
Is everybody knew Cheech and Chong.

3907
02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:11.470
It was the great leveler or all right.

3908
02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:13.640
And when he sat there in subzero temperatures,

3909
02:02:13.641 --> 02:02:17.150
swaddled and sleeping bags laughing in seven languages,

3910
02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:19.680
she,

3911
02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:20.513
John,

3912
02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:20.961
look,

3913
02:02:20.961 --> 02:02:22.430
you don't even need subtitles.

3914
02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:23.180
Yeah,

3915
02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:24.440
you don't need to read the movie.

3916
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:26.030
They're back together doing it again,

3917
02:02:26.031 --> 02:02:26.864
which is amazing.

3918
02:02:27.370 --> 02:02:28.840
<v 5>And they had to get those guys in here.</v>

3919
02:02:30.450 --> 02:02:31.720
As long as they're talking to each other,

3920
02:02:31.930 --> 02:02:32.763
they'll make sure.

3921
02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:37.130
<v 1>Are they actually talking to each other or has this gone?</v>

3922
02:02:37.131 --> 02:02:37.964
Eddie and Dave,

3923
02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:40.510
<v 5>Eddie and day for a while.</v>

3924
02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:42.070
It definitely when Eddie and day for a while,

3925
02:02:42.071 --> 02:02:42.904
but they're back.

3926
02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:43.420
Yeah,

3927
02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:44.200
they're back together.

3928
02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:44.411
Well,

3929
02:02:44.411 --> 02:02:45.330
they were touring quite a bit.

3930
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:47.590
I think success brought them back together again.

3931
02:02:47.591 --> 02:02:48.210
They realize like,

3932
02:02:48.210 --> 02:02:48.400
oh,

3933
02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:50.020
everybody wants to see Cheech and Chong.

3934
02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:52.420
Everybody doesn't really want to see Chung or Cheech.

3935
02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:53.913
You know what I'm saying?

3936
02:02:54.490 --> 02:02:54.701
I mean,

3937
02:02:54.701 --> 02:02:56.200
not that everybody doesn't want to see them,

3938
02:02:56.201 --> 02:02:57.880
but that the numbers are so different.

3939
02:02:58.120 --> 02:02:58.931
The numbers of people that,

3940
02:02:58.931 --> 02:02:59.120
I mean,

3941
02:02:59.120 --> 02:02:59.720
Tommy Chong,

3942
02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:01.270
very beloved guy,

3943
02:03:01.450 --> 02:03:02.620
but the together,

3944
02:03:02.621 --> 02:03:03.061
they're,

3945
02:03:03.061 --> 02:03:05.050
they're exponentially more powerful.

3946
02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:06.610
It's the Everly brothers.

3947
02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:07.473
Yes,

3948
02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:08.730
yes,

3949
02:03:08.730 --> 02:03:09.220
yes.

3950
02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:10.053
<v 1>It's a,</v>

3951
02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:12.430
but the culture changed a man of his times.

3952
02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:15.910
Sometimes the times changes and yes,

3953
02:03:15.970 --> 02:03:19.000
how the time's now represent that which they,

3954
02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:19.660
you know,

3955
02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:20.493
pre,

3956
02:03:20.650 --> 02:03:21.970
I mean those guys were whatever.

3957
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.190
They were doing something that was illegal.

3958
02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:25.780
This is illegal comedy.

3959
02:03:25.781 --> 02:03:28.600
There was a legal subject matter today in Studio Shitty.

3960
02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:33.220
You could spend a 10 day vacation if you came from somewhere and just worked

3961
02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:37.300
from the Sushi bar to the dispensary on Studio City.

3962
02:03:37.301 --> 02:03:38.021
There's a space,

3963
02:03:38.021 --> 02:03:39.520
it's about two miles long.

3964
02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:41.080
You could spend 10 days,

3965
02:03:41.081 --> 02:03:42.370
come visit us from Japan,

3966
02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:49.080
stay at the Marriott all the way near a whatever it is universal and you can on

3967
02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:51.400
just work from Sushi bar to dispatch.

3968
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:53.570
Reefers Sushi bar to dispatch dispatcher.

3969
02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:54.653
<v 5>They're touring.</v>

3970
02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:55.740
Look at that up on the screen.

3971
02:03:56.010 --> 02:03:57.970
There's a whole schedule and it,

3972
02:03:58.560 --> 02:03:59.430
where are they working?

3973
02:03:59.431 --> 02:04:00.061
I can't read it.

3974
02:04:00.061 --> 02:04:02.010
It says there in Richmond,

3975
02:04:02.011 --> 02:04:07.011
BC at the river rock casino in Vancouver at the hard rock South Lake Tahoe.

3976
02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.400
There's a bunch of places.

3977
02:04:08.401 --> 02:04:08.941
San Juan,

3978
02:04:08.941 --> 02:04:10.320
Puerto Rico in the house.

3979
02:04:10.321 --> 02:04:12.600
What's the average age of comics today?

3980
02:04:13.530 --> 02:04:16.440
The best ones are in their forties and 50s,

3981
02:04:16.441 --> 02:04:17.700
it seems like right now.

3982
02:04:18.630 --> 02:04:18.991
Really?

3983
02:04:18.991 --> 02:04:19.291
Yeah.

3984
02:04:19.291 --> 02:04:20.460
Between Chris Rock,

3985
02:04:20.461 --> 02:04:21.510
Dave Chappelle.

3986
02:04:21.570 --> 02:04:21.691
Oh,

3987
02:04:21.691 --> 02:04:22.081
you're right.

3988
02:04:22.081 --> 02:04:22.580
Okay.

3989
02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:25.230
[inaudible] um,

3990
02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:25.810
yeah,

3991
02:04:25.810 --> 02:04:25.930
uh,

3992
02:04:25.930 --> 02:04:26.470
the best guy,

3993
02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:27.241
Joey Diaz,

3994
02:04:27.241 --> 02:04:28.550
all the best guys who are in their 50.

3995
02:04:28.551 --> 02:04:28.740
[inaudible]

3996
02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:30.810
<v 1>cause it does change when you think like,</v>

3997
02:04:30.811 --> 02:04:31.644
um,

3998
02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:32.941
I don't know.

3999
02:04:32.941 --> 02:04:35.190
There's a lot of gangster movies on Netflix,

4000
02:04:35.191 --> 02:04:35.590
right?

4001
02:04:35.590 --> 02:04:36.130
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

4002
02:04:36.130 --> 02:04:38.370
And when it's that,

4003
02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:39.660
<v 4>then the fellows are older,</v>

4004
02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:41.190
they're wearing Tuxedos,

4005
02:04:41.191 --> 02:04:41.791
you know,

4006
02:04:41.791 --> 02:04:42.840
they're in nightclubs,

4007
02:04:42.841 --> 02:04:43.621
like Zeros,

4008
02:04:43.621 --> 02:04:44.454
kind of a,

4009
02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:44.820
yeah,

4010
02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:49.820
the 21 club and then that changed to a comedy cellar and you know,

4011
02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:51.990
something like that.

4012
02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:54.300
Today it's also about productivity.

4013
02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:54.751
Like you,

4014
02:04:54.751 --> 02:04:57.360
you have to be able to put out material.

4015
02:04:57.450 --> 02:04:58.050
And uh,

4016
02:04:58.050 --> 02:05:02.100
because most of us are doing Netflix specials now and most of us seem to be on a

4017
02:05:02.101 --> 02:05:04.050
schedule of doing one every couple of years.

4018
02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:08.160
So you have to be able to turn over an hour every couple of years and then take

4019
02:05:08.161 --> 02:05:11.340
that hour and hammer that motherfucker down to a Samurai sword,

4020
02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:11.821
excuse me,

4021
02:05:11.821 --> 02:05:16.530
a Katana Polish that hammer it down,

4022
02:05:16.531 --> 02:05:17.430
Polish that blade.

4023
02:05:17.431 --> 02:05:18.270
You have to have it.

4024
02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:20.010
And then you have to know when to release it,

4025
02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:21.180
which is one of the things that I asked,

4026
02:05:21.181 --> 02:05:23.340
like how do you know when you're writing a song like running with the devil?

4027
02:05:23.490 --> 02:05:24.450
How do you know when it's done?

4028
02:05:24.630 --> 02:05:28.350
Because with a bit you kind of don't know because you do it differently all the

4029
02:05:28.351 --> 02:05:28.681
time.

4030
02:05:28.681 --> 02:05:32.880
You fuck around with it on stage and you know I'm a tall long does it take to do

4031
02:05:32.881 --> 02:05:33.714
an hour?

4032
02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:35.490
It just assassinate changes.

4033
02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:36.571
It changes.

4034
02:05:36.571 --> 02:05:38.130
There's no real one thing I like.

4035
02:05:38.131 --> 02:05:42.420
Sometimes I've come up with a new hour and like like four or five months and

4036
02:05:42.421 --> 02:05:44.100
sometimes it's taken me a whole year.

4037
02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:44.341
It's,

4038
02:05:44.341 --> 02:05:45.061
it's really,

4039
02:05:45.061 --> 02:05:48.870
it's really different every time depending upon how much effort I put into it.

4040
02:05:48.871 --> 02:05:51.630
And also depending upon how lucky I get with subjects,

4041
02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:53.250
like sometimes there's a subject,

4042
02:05:53.251 --> 02:05:54.090
it's just rich.

4043
02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:54.590
Almost like a,

4044
02:05:54.590 --> 02:05:58.320
you hit a gold mine and like you hit a ball that he hit that in mind.

4045
02:05:58.321 --> 02:05:58.560
You're like,

4046
02:05:58.560 --> 02:05:58.921
ah,

4047
02:05:58.921 --> 02:06:00.240
there's so much here.

4048
02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:00.961
And there's so many.

4049
02:06:00.961 --> 02:06:03.780
Also branching off little rivers from this mine,

4050
02:06:03.781 --> 02:06:04.830
this one initial mind.

4051
02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:05.731
So there's,

4052
02:06:05.731 --> 02:06:06.450
there's that.

4053
02:06:06.450 --> 02:06:07.200
You never know.

4054
02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:07.771
You never know.

4055
02:06:07.771 --> 02:06:07.991
It's,

4056
02:06:07.991 --> 02:06:08.251
it's,

4057
02:06:08.251 --> 02:06:09.084
it's hard to tell.

4058
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:11.251
Fascinating.

4059
02:06:11.251 --> 02:06:12.480
I wouldn't mess around with it.

4060
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:14.190
It moves and changes.

4061
02:06:14.191 --> 02:06:15.330
I do it differently all the time.

4062
02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:15.781
You know,

4063
02:06:15.781 --> 02:06:15.930
I'm,

4064
02:06:15.930 --> 02:06:16.210
I'm,

4065
02:06:16.210 --> 02:06:19.010
I'm a giant fan of Leonard Skinner and one of the things that I always thought

4066
02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:23.280
was crazy about Skinner was there riffs when they would do guitar riffs,

4067
02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:24.840
it was the same riff.

4068
02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:25.620
They wouldn't,

4069
02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:27.210
when they would do a solo there,

4070
02:06:27.211 --> 02:06:29.670
Solos were like orchestrated,

4071
02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:34.880
like they don't get enough credit for bringing dynamic musical artists as well

4072
02:06:36.781 --> 02:06:41.040
as these southern dudes that were just drinking and singing about whiskey and

4073
02:06:41.041 --> 02:06:42.900
getting away from women like they're fat,

4074
02:06:42.930 --> 02:06:43.561
ugly dudes.

4075
02:06:43.561 --> 02:06:45.780
And most of their songs about getting away from women.

4076
02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:46.290
Like,

4077
02:06:46.290 --> 02:06:47.041
I gotta go,

4078
02:06:47.041 --> 02:06:48.120
I gotta be free.

4079
02:06:48.450 --> 02:06:49.590
I'm moving on.

4080
02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:50.880
Call me the breeze.

4081
02:06:50.881 --> 02:06:51.421
It was so like,

4082
02:06:51.421 --> 02:06:53.550
I gotta get the fuck Outta here before he locked me down.

4083
02:06:53.730 --> 02:06:55.290
That was a big part of their music.

4084
02:06:55.291 --> 02:06:56.730
But when you see like,

4085
02:06:56.731 --> 02:06:57.564
um,

4086
02:06:57.810 --> 02:06:58.730
like some of their,

4087
02:06:58.731 --> 02:06:59.130
uh,

4088
02:06:59.130 --> 02:06:59.980
like free bird,

4089
02:07:00.090 --> 02:07:02.130
that free bird solo,

4090
02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:02.850
that gestalt,

4091
02:07:02.850 --> 02:07:05.170
which is one of the greatest solos in the history of all music.

4092
02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:07.020
There's some specific reasons for this.

4093
02:07:07.290 --> 02:07:07.950
Okay.

4094
02:07:07.950 --> 02:07:12.660
One of the more specific reasons is you had to build,

4095
02:07:12.930 --> 02:07:13.920
it has a beginning,

4096
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:14.491
a middle,

4097
02:07:14.491 --> 02:07:15.720
a crescendo,

4098
02:07:15.721 --> 02:07:16.660
and then their,

4099
02:07:16.661 --> 02:07:17.880
their specific names to,

4100
02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:19.433
um,

4101
02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:24.660
when we moved to more channels in recording,

4102
02:07:24.661 --> 02:07:28.200
when the Leonard Skinner recorded all their early stuff as eight track and then

4103
02:07:28.201 --> 02:07:30.210
you had to double up or early van Halen,

4104
02:07:30.211 --> 02:07:30.841
same thing.

4105
02:07:30.841 --> 02:07:32.970
You had to compile your tracks or whatever.

4106
02:07:33.710 --> 02:07:33.930
Um,

4107
02:07:33.930 --> 02:07:36.460
you had to really walk in with your solo

4108
02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:37.840
<v 1>written okay.</v>

4109
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:42.870
And play and you would work it until it really had a thing and crescendos.

4110
02:07:43.150 --> 02:07:43.590
Yeah.

4111
02:07:43.590 --> 02:07:44.423
Okay.

4112
02:07:44.710 --> 02:07:46.180
Once there were many tracks,

4113
02:07:46.181 --> 02:07:47.860
guys would come in and just wing it and go,

4114
02:07:47.861 --> 02:07:48.221
okay,

4115
02:07:48.221 --> 02:07:49.940
let's try one blue.

4116
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.741
Okay,

4117
02:07:50.741 --> 02:07:51.071
great.

4118
02:07:51.071 --> 02:07:51.670
That's fine.

4119
02:07:51.670 --> 02:07:52.503
Let's do it again.

4120
02:07:52.930 --> 02:07:53.763
Track too.

4121
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:55.600
And they just make it up as they go.

4122
02:07:55.930 --> 02:07:56.763
Okay.

4123
02:07:57.010 --> 02:07:59.110
And then when it's time to mix,

4124
02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:03.400
they'll put a little of track two and a little of track six and start moving

4125
02:08:03.401 --> 02:08:08.401
those channels in a way that you would never think to play the guitar.

4126
02:08:09.550 --> 02:08:10.450
For example,

4127
02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:13.150
ed started doing that on a couple of tracks,

4128
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:14.223
right?

4129
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:16.540
Original Solos running with the devil.

4130
02:08:16.541 --> 02:08:16.901
Did it.

4131
02:08:16.901 --> 02:08:17.001
It,

4132
02:08:17.001 --> 02:08:17.131
it,

4133
02:08:17.131 --> 02:08:17.591
it did,

4134
02:08:17.591 --> 02:08:18.200
it did it.

4135
02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:18.910
Okay.

4136
02:08:18.910 --> 02:08:20.500
These are thematic solos.

4137
02:08:20.650 --> 02:08:21.760
Most Beetle Solas,

4138
02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:23.350
the matic you follow?

4139
02:08:23.770 --> 02:08:24.760
Listen to the solo in,

4140
02:08:24.761 --> 02:08:25.594
ain't talking about that

4141
02:08:25.610 --> 02:08:28.330
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

4142
02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:30.230
<v 1>these are thematic solos.</v>

4143
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:33.650
When he started going like this,

4144
02:08:34.130 --> 02:08:37.070
he'd record six different versions of the souls.

4145
02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:38.390
Okay.

4146
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:40.680
And then just started move the channel.

4147
02:08:40.681 --> 02:08:41.031
Like here,

4148
02:08:41.031 --> 02:08:41.691
turn this one on,

4149
02:08:41.691 --> 02:08:42.321
turn this one off,

4150
02:08:42.321 --> 02:08:45.520
turn this 100 and then he'd have to go learn the solo.

4151
02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:46.580
Wow.

4152
02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:49.640
So he'll see his hand move from down here to up here and down there.

4153
02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:55.340
It became a gymnastic effort,

4154
02:08:55.670 --> 02:09:00.670
more elbow and shoulder to get his hand from the far end of the fret board all

4155
02:09:02.571 --> 02:09:07.571
the way up to the pickup and back to duplicate that Wabisabi wow approach to

4156
02:09:12.381 --> 02:09:13.400
making solos.

4157
02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:18.640
So it was a very oblique or unique kind of way of creating a solo.

4158
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:21.770
It was utilizing the digital,

4159
02:09:21.771 --> 02:09:22.760
digital future,

4160
02:09:22.761 --> 02:09:25.610
multi tracking and a improvising.

4161
02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:27.350
And we fall as opposed to,

4162
02:09:27.351 --> 02:09:30.440
I'm going to sit down and I'm going to just,

4163
02:09:30.590 --> 02:09:32.270
I'm going to create something like a book.

4164
02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:33.801
Here's the beginning,

4165
02:09:33.801 --> 02:09:34.910
here's the scene here.

4166
02:09:34.930 --> 02:09:35.721
The character's,

4167
02:09:35.721 --> 02:09:36.620
here's the conflict.

4168
02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:37.761
Instead,

4169
02:09:37.761 --> 02:09:41.510
it's let's just mix that all up together in interesting ways.

4170
02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:45.830
It literary Burroughs came up with bill Burroughs many,

4171
02:09:45.831 --> 02:09:46.670
many years ago.

4172
02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:51.760
Came up with the idea of writing a book than clipping the pages into pieces,

4173
02:09:52.341 --> 02:09:56.630
putting them all in a hat and pull the pieces out one by one.

4174
02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:57.680
This is piece number one.

4175
02:09:57.681 --> 02:09:58.750
This is piece number two,

4176
02:09:58.751 --> 02:09:59.584
page number three.

4177
02:09:59.750 --> 02:10:02.090
And that's the way you actually remember a story.

4178
02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:04.250
Huh?

4179
02:10:04.250 --> 02:10:05.090
I don't get that.

4180
02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:06.133
Okay.

4181
02:10:06.170 --> 02:10:07.610
You remember a wedding?

4182
02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:08.450
Yes.

4183
02:10:08.450 --> 02:10:09.920
You don't remember in sequence,

4184
02:10:10.590 --> 02:10:11.300
right?

4185
02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:12.470
We had a batch party,

4186
02:10:13.150 --> 02:10:14.810
then I got measured for the tissue,

4187
02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:16.190
then I went here.

4188
02:10:16.191 --> 02:10:17.660
You remember Badge Party,

4189
02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:18.890
then putting the ring.

4190
02:10:19.850 --> 02:10:21.510
Then I was throwing up back behind the

4191
02:10:23.730 --> 02:10:25.610
Oh then then there was a car and it's,

4192
02:10:25.611 --> 02:10:26.030
it's,

4193
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:28.010
it doesn't come in sequential order.

4194
02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:28.760
Right.

4195
02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:29.480
Okay.

4196
02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:33.650
So it's another way of kind of a crafty way of writing an essay.

4197
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:35.803
<v 2>Um,</v>

4198
02:10:36.350 --> 02:10:38.780
perhaps a bit difficult to digest,

4199
02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:40.670
but movies are made that way.

4200
02:10:40.671 --> 02:10:41.504
Now.

4201
02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:43.070
Terentino's starts in the middle,

4202
02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:43.640
right?

4203
02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:44.360
We're used to it.

4204
02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:44.600
Yeah.

4205
02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:45.080
He always,

4206
02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:47.360
James Bond always starts in the middle of a chase.

4207
02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:48.273
Mm.

4208
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:49.650
Door flies open.

4209
02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:50.870
Well these guys are,

4210
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:53.420
why is he catch you off guard?

4211
02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:58.250
He's running across the top of a train because they started as opposed to here's

4212
02:10:58.251 --> 02:11:01.190
the field horse walks onto the field.

4213
02:11:02.210 --> 02:11:03.530
I see the cabin,

4214
02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:07.880
what I'm getting from this when in regards to his song making in particular the

4215
02:11:07.881 --> 02:11:10.610
way Eddie and you did it was there's no shortcuts,

4216
02:11:11.150 --> 02:11:11.451
you know,

4217
02:11:11.451 --> 02:11:14.960
and the fact that first of all,

4218
02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:17.420
you know he's one of the great masters,

4219
02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:17.721
right?

4220
02:11:17.721 --> 02:11:19.400
Eddie van Halen is one of the great masters.

4221
02:11:19.401 --> 02:11:24.401
If you have mean a hundred of the greatest guitar artists of all time and the

4222
02:11:25.581 --> 02:11:26.540
history of the human race,

4223
02:11:26.541 --> 02:11:27.374
he's in that group.

4224
02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:30.050
But we certainly made a contribution commensurate with that.

4225
02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:30.760
Yeah,

4226
02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:32.720
100% so you have to have that,

4227
02:11:32.721 --> 02:11:34.420
but then there's also no shortcuts.

4228
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:35.810
Even when you're a great master.

4229
02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:36.590
No,

4230
02:11:36.590 --> 02:11:37.520
there's no shortcuts.

4231
02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:37.851
No.

4232
02:11:37.851 --> 02:11:40.310
You will have to sharpen and sharpen.

4233
02:11:40.311 --> 02:11:42.230
And Shar you described sharpening his sword.

4234
02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:47.270
I visited a foundry where they make Sorge north of Tokyo.

4235
02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:47.900
How was that?

4236
02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:47.991
Well,

4237
02:11:47.991 --> 02:11:49.190
how does that work?

4238
02:11:49.191 --> 02:11:50.020
Is in the,

4239
02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:52.070
his work goes into museums.

4240
02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:54.110
That is one of the things that I really want to do.

4241
02:11:54.380 --> 02:11:57.620
The found my bunk school foundry for guys with hammers,

4242
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:59.690
super sweaty,

4243
02:11:59.691 --> 02:12:00.524
hot,

4244
02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:03.110
like things like visiting the 16 hundreds.

4245
02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:04.453
Okay.

4246
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.150
That's not who sharpens and polishes the sword.

4247
02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:10.940
That's my other friend who's 55 years old,

4248
02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:13.210
lives in a suburb of Tokyo.

4249
02:12:13.230 --> 02:12:14.510
That's all he does for a living.

4250
02:12:14.690 --> 02:12:18.530
So they take the first sword to him and then he sharpens it.

4251
02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:19.393
Yes.

4252
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.890
Ah,

4253
02:12:19.890 --> 02:12:20.091
Kay.

4254
02:12:20.091 --> 02:12:22.280
And he's the one who makes it get that chrome finish.

4255
02:12:22.281 --> 02:12:24.650
So the man who forges it does not sharpen it.

4256
02:12:24.651 --> 02:12:25.460
Correct.

4257
02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:26.300
Different specialty.

4258
02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:27.440
Is that always been the case?

4259
02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:28.303
Yes.

4260
02:12:28.370 --> 02:12:30.050
And insured pot soared.

4261
02:12:30.051 --> 02:12:35.051
Polisher does the sharpening and that's a specialty requires shirt and stones

4262
02:12:36.351 --> 02:12:37.880
from different parts of Japan.

4263
02:12:37.881 --> 02:12:38.750
You don't use wheels,

4264
02:12:38.751 --> 02:12:40.940
you use the old stones for the mountains,

4265
02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:42.013
et Cetera.

4266
02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:43.940
Use water from a wooden book.

4267
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.840
Hmm.

4268
02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:46.490
You Rub it with your hands.

4269
02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:47.780
He's 55 years old.

4270
02:12:47.781 --> 02:12:51.320
This is all he does for a living museums from around the world.

4271
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:52.310
Is there a video of this?

4272
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:54.050
Oh yeah.

4273
02:12:54.050 --> 02:12:54.980
What's the gentleman's name?

4274
02:12:57.020 --> 02:12:57.890
We'll find it.

4275
02:12:58.160 --> 02:12:59.300
I'm stalling for a sec.

4276
02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:02.113
Uh,

4277
02:13:02.690 --> 02:13:07.550
he lives in a very little apartment and he's got two gun safes like you would

4278
02:13:07.551 --> 02:13:08.150
use,

4279
02:13:08.150 --> 02:13:08.541
you know,

4280
02:13:08.541 --> 02:13:12.470
like liberty gun safes and museums from all over the world.

4281
02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:14.630
Send Him Sorge Oh,

4282
02:13:14.631 --> 02:13:15.170
here he goes.

4283
02:13:15.170 --> 02:13:15.770
Okay.

4284
02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:19.640
That become a rusty humidity there.

4285
02:13:20.110 --> 02:13:20.270
Ah,

4286
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.750
what does that,

4287
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:21.081
okay,

4288
02:13:21.081 --> 02:13:24.050
this is a pants that's page and he's going to be using,

4289
02:13:24.051 --> 02:13:27.980
that's what they use to laminate by putting paste on that sword.

4290
02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:32.700
Parts of it will cool differently anyways.

4291
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:33.300
Uh,

4292
02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:36.510
so that sharpened has shored takes for ever.

4293
02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:38.840
That's what makes your patterns Ah,

4294
02:13:38.890 --> 02:13:39.660
so they do it.

4295
02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:41.280
It's so you want that edge,

4296
02:13:41.281 --> 02:13:45.750
a little different of hardness than you want the rest of the sword you clad.

4297
02:13:45.890 --> 02:13:47.820
And what is that sharp feasting on it?

4298
02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:49.620
What was that stuff?

4299
02:13:49.650 --> 02:13:52.910
It's made of ash and it's made of a

4300
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.863
<v 7>uh,</v>

4301
02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:55.573
uh,

4302
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:58.623
<v 2>or,</v>

4303
02:13:58.700 --> 02:13:59.180
or,

4304
02:13:59.180 --> 02:14:00.050
wow.

4305
02:14:00.170 --> 02:14:04.370
And so when it heats up is that when it becomes a part of the sword?

4306
02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:05.601
Wow,

4307
02:14:05.601 --> 02:14:07.100
he's going to laminate that.

4308
02:14:07.340 --> 02:14:07.910
Okay.

4309
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:09.050
This is wild.

4310
02:14:09.490 --> 02:14:09.620
Oh,

4311
02:14:09.620 --> 02:14:11.960
they got scientists look at this motherfucker with his lab coat.

4312
02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:13.111
He's examining,

4313
02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:13.910
you're going to ruin it.

4314
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:14.743
Get him out of there.

4315
02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:18.020
At that scientist from a shirt and Candice steal Tom Mahogany.

4316
02:14:19.070 --> 02:14:19.903
Okay.

4317
02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:22.690
And when you do the little padding like dad,

4318
02:14:22.710 --> 02:14:23.600
that's ash.

4319
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:27.440
So he's putting little pieces of ash on and on purchase stone.

4320
02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:28.170
Ah.

4321
02:14:28.170 --> 02:14:30.050
Does that challenge going to sharpen that?

4322
02:14:30.630 --> 02:14:31.270
Oh,

4323
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:34.250
you'll spend hundreds of hours doing that on a sword,

4324
02:14:34.251 --> 02:14:35.900
which is why they cost so much.

4325
02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:41.030
There are many different kinds of of stones that they'll use a different parts

4326
02:14:41.031 --> 02:14:41.870
of the sword.

4327
02:14:42.650 --> 02:14:47.300
Can you dig the point that the top gets a different kind of stone in the middle

4328
02:14:47.301 --> 02:14:49.490
of the sword Cetera?

4329
02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:55.620
<v 5>It's amazing like Japanese culture and especially when you look into the Ancient</v>

4330
02:14:57.161 --> 02:14:57.941
Samurai culture,

4331
02:14:57.941 --> 02:15:00.640
like a book of five rings is one of my greatest all time books.

4332
02:15:00.850 --> 02:15:03.880
I've read it dozens of times in my life.

4333
02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:09.300
But to put yourself in the mindset of someone with such a singular vision to,

4334
02:15:09.641 --> 02:15:10.211
to great,

4335
02:15:10.211 --> 02:15:12.040
to become a Great Samurai,

4336
02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:14.650
he needed to become a great artist,

4337
02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:15.670
a great poet.

4338
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:17.560
He needed to be good at carpentry.

4339
02:15:17.561 --> 02:15:19.360
He needed to be good at calligraphy.

4340
02:15:19.361 --> 02:15:21.460
He needed to have all these different skills.

4341
02:15:21.630 --> 02:15:21.910
<v 2>No,</v>

4342
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:23.260
just like your kids shout.

4343
02:15:23.590 --> 02:15:24.423
Yeah.

4344
02:15:25.330 --> 02:15:29.950
He kids got to take chess lessons or go or go go lessons.

4345
02:15:30.100 --> 02:15:30.933
Okay.

4346
02:15:31.210 --> 02:15:31.640
Uh,

4347
02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:33.070
they got to learn to paint and draw.

4348
02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:33.740
Yeah.

4349
02:15:33.740 --> 02:15:35.170
You got to learn some martial arts.

4350
02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:36.130
Yeah,

4351
02:15:36.130 --> 02:15:37.480
multiple languages.

4352
02:15:37.780 --> 02:15:41.500
This is a liberal arts education is seen through the eyes of somebody in the 15

4353
02:15:41.501 --> 02:15:42.100
hundreds

4354
02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:42.431
<v 5>it's just,</v>

4355
02:15:42.431 --> 02:15:44.640
I'm so fascinated with Japanese countries.

4356
02:15:44.730 --> 02:15:46.480
So many things came from that one.

4357
02:15:46.481 --> 02:15:47.530
Small Island,

4358
02:15:48.860 --> 02:15:51.880
I mean you look into in terms of like martial arts contributions,

4359
02:15:52.210 --> 02:15:54.310
I mean it is probably the,

4360
02:15:55.150 --> 02:15:56.740
there's a bunch of contributors,

4361
02:15:56.741 --> 02:16:01.060
Brazilian Jujitsu and Chinese Kung Fu and western boxing,

4362
02:16:01.061 --> 02:16:01.930
but God damn,

4363
02:16:01.931 --> 02:16:03.910
you look at the contributions of Japan.

4364
02:16:04.330 --> 02:16:05.800
I mean overwhelming,

4365
02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:10.930
just overwhelming between judo and Jujitsu and so many different martial arts,

4366
02:16:10.931 --> 02:16:11.651
karate,

4367
02:16:11.651 --> 02:16:11.861
this,

4368
02:16:11.861 --> 02:16:16.330
so many different styles that were perfected in this one small place.

4369
02:16:16.970 --> 02:16:17.351
<v 2>Okay.</v>

4370
02:16:17.351 --> 02:16:18.184
Jen Island,

4371
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:23.470
I agree with you and that lends itself towards grilling down burrowing in newly

4372
02:16:25.911 --> 02:16:26.870
digging in.

4373
02:16:26.990 --> 02:16:27.470
Yeah.

4374
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:28.303
You follow.

4375
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:30.280
If somebody is going

4376
02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:31.240
<v 1>to make a sword,</v>

4377
02:16:31.241 --> 02:16:33.640
it takes six different people to make one sword.

4378
02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:39.190
The person who makes the handle is not the person who wraps the handle.

4379
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:43.720
The person who makes the sword is not the one who sharpens it.

4380
02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:46.390
The collar,

4381
02:16:46.450 --> 02:16:48.070
the furniture on the sword,

4382
02:16:48.071 --> 02:16:52.060
the peg that holds it in that gold's collar,

4383
02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:53.500
that's a different person.

4384
02:16:54.250 --> 02:16:57.520
And the person who makes the scabbard for the sword,

4385
02:16:57.550 --> 02:16:59.020
is it different person?

4386
02:16:59.021 --> 02:16:59.860
You want me to keep going?

4387
02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:01.270
Oh yes.

4388
02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:01.490
I mean,

4389
02:17:01.490 --> 02:17:03.130
what's an age of specialization?

4390
02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:03.580
Yeah.

4391
02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:04.930
Started for them many,

4392
02:17:04.931 --> 02:17:06.250
many decades ago.

4393
02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:08.290
The idea of,

4394
02:17:08.350 --> 02:17:09.183
uh,

4395
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:14.170
I'm one man and I'll build everything in the cabin alone in the wilderness.

4396
02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:15.870
Great movie comes from 19 six.

4397
02:17:15.871 --> 02:17:20.470
She's is the fellow who builds the cabin and uses handmade tools to do it up in

4398
02:17:20.471 --> 02:17:20.861
the woods.

4399
02:17:20.861 --> 02:17:21.694
Right?

4400
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:22.421
I'll dig the,

4401
02:17:22.421 --> 02:17:22.691
well,

4402
02:17:22.691 --> 02:17:23.740
I'll plant the potatoes.

4403
02:17:23.741 --> 02:17:26.030
I'll build the house owl,

4404
02:17:26.050 --> 02:17:26.950
create the hearth.

4405
02:17:26.951 --> 02:17:28.240
I'll fish the fish,

4406
02:17:28.241 --> 02:17:29.110
I'll hunt the elk,

4407
02:17:29.111 --> 02:17:29.944
et cetera.

4408
02:17:30.370 --> 02:17:32.230
And the Japanese perhaps,

4409
02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:32.920
you know,

4410
02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:35.350
as well as other neighborhoods shed.

4411
02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:38.010
I'm just going to specialize in ALC.

4412
02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:39.413
Mm.

4413
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:41.583
Yeah.

4414
02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:43.270
And somebody else said,

4415
02:17:43.271 --> 02:17:43.710
uh,

4416
02:17:43.710 --> 02:17:44.030
um,

4417
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.860
um,

4418
02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:46.870
I just like to cook if that's okay.

4419
02:17:47.770 --> 02:17:48.580
Yeah.

4420
02:17:48.580 --> 02:17:49.600
Somebody else said,

4421
02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:51.550
I'm not even going to cook it.

4422
02:17:51.551 --> 02:17:52.540
I'm going to eat it raw.

4423
02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:55.993
Have you had,

4424
02:17:56.590 --> 02:17:57.910
have you ever fucked around with archery?

4425
02:17:58.990 --> 02:17:59.231
Oh,

4426
02:17:59.231 --> 02:18:00.670
a million years ago,

4427
02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:01.190
you know,

4428
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:02.480
with scouts,

4429
02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:03.071
whatever.

4430
02:18:03.071 --> 02:18:03.880
But uh,

4431
02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:06.310
that seems like something that'd be right up your alley.

4432
02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:06.821
That's a,

4433
02:18:06.821 --> 02:18:07.541
it's a,

4434
02:18:07.541 --> 02:18:09.860
an act of doing it without doing.

4435
02:18:09.910 --> 02:18:10.880
<v 4>Yes.</v>

4436
02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:13.300
It is a mind cleansing thing too.

4437
02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:14.940
<v 1>I think you'd be perfect for you.</v>

4438
02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:16.380
This is what I saw.

4439
02:18:16.381 --> 02:18:20.640
You have a virtual reality range out there.

4440
02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:21.121
Oh,

4441
02:18:21.121 --> 02:18:21.954
wait a minute.

4442
02:18:22.770 --> 02:18:23.700
All right officer,

4443
02:18:23.701 --> 02:18:25.230
I confess it's all coming back.

4444
02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:26.550
I see.

4445
02:18:26.550 --> 02:18:27.930
I saw you on TV.

4446
02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:29.071
A filling.

4447
02:18:29.071 --> 02:18:34.071
The frigerator are getting ready to fill the frigerator with a bow and Arrow

4448
02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:34.321
hours.

4449
02:18:34.321 --> 02:18:34.491
Um,

4450
02:18:34.491 --> 02:18:35.800
so tell me about this.

4451
02:18:36.180 --> 02:18:37.020
I bow hunt.

4452
02:18:38.390 --> 02:18:39.830
Actually eat.

4453
02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:41.673
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

4454
02:18:41.710 --> 02:18:42.110
right.

4455
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.500
Oh,

4456
02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:43.160
100%.

4457
02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:43.560
Tell us.

4458
02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:45.930
Most of what I eat is elk meat or,

4459
02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:46.813
or deer meat.

4460
02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:47.640
Yeah,

4461
02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:48.280
that's the,

4462
02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:49.740
if you look at my diet on paper,

4463
02:18:49.741 --> 02:18:51.180
it's probably 60% elk.

4464
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.823
When did you begin this?

4465
02:18:53.310 --> 02:18:53.581
Uh,

4466
02:18:53.581 --> 02:18:56.400
2012 was the first hunting trip I went on.

4467
02:18:56.401 --> 02:18:59.780
My good friend Steve Rinella took me on a trip on his television show meat

4468
02:18:59.781 --> 02:19:00.060
eater.

4469
02:19:00.060 --> 02:19:00.601
And then,

4470
02:19:00.601 --> 02:19:00.810
uh,

4471
02:19:00.810 --> 02:19:01.890
I became obsessed.

4472
02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:02.310
Well I was,

4473
02:19:02.310 --> 02:19:05.160
I was trying to figure out what I was doing because I had seen a bunch of

4474
02:19:05.161 --> 02:19:07.110
factory farming videos and I was like,

4475
02:19:07.111 --> 02:19:07.381
okay,

4476
02:19:07.381 --> 02:19:10.290
I'm either going to become a vegetarian or I'm going to become a hunter.

4477
02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:10.680
Like,

4478
02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:11.010
uh,

4479
02:19:11.010 --> 02:19:11.470
this is,

4480
02:19:11.470 --> 02:19:12.900
I follow that and be a part of this.

4481
02:19:12.940 --> 02:19:13.651
I follow then.

4482
02:19:13.651 --> 02:19:16.960
So I became a hunter and a,

4483
02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:17.911
first of all,

4484
02:19:17.911 --> 02:19:20.370
the nutrition that you get from wild games,

4485
02:19:20.371 --> 02:19:21.120
she a difference.

4486
02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:21.900
Feel the difference.

4487
02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:22.261
Yeah.

4488
02:19:22.261 --> 02:19:22.561
Yeah.

4489
02:19:22.561 --> 02:19:23.281
Everybody does.

4490
02:19:23.281 --> 02:19:24.114
I give it to a friend.

4491
02:19:24.690 --> 02:19:25.620
He just feel better.

4492
02:19:25.621 --> 02:19:26.640
It just feels amazing.

4493
02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:27.231
Yeah.

4494
02:19:27.231 --> 02:19:29.960
It's so nutrient dance since red and rich.

4495
02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:33.590
And so why you're eating an athlete and you're eating a wild athlete that's

4496
02:19:33.591 --> 02:19:35.630
running away from wolves and mountain lions.

4497
02:19:36.020 --> 02:19:36.201
I mean,

4498
02:19:36.201 --> 02:19:40.130
it's just a different thing than a cow that's like locked up in a cage or a pig

4499
02:19:40.131 --> 02:19:41.390
that's locked up in a stall.

4500
02:19:41.430 --> 02:19:44.480
It makes stellar since and they live a free life.

4501
02:19:44.481 --> 02:19:45.800
It's a wild animal.

4502
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:46.011
They,

4503
02:19:46.011 --> 02:19:48.290
there's no one telling them what to do or where to go,

4504
02:19:48.470 --> 02:19:52.280
and you gotta be able to sneak it up in on them on the right wind with the right

4505
02:19:52.281 --> 02:19:53.001
conditions,

4506
02:19:53.001 --> 02:19:55.210
and make sure you get a shot off on them.

4507
02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:56.840
Yeah,

4508
02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:57.470
I love it.

4509
02:19:57.470 --> 02:19:58.580
How often you go out?

4510
02:19:58.750 --> 02:19:59.870
A couple times a year,

4511
02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:01.850
usually two or three times a year.

4512
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:03.103
All the way.

4513
02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:03.831
Yeah.

4514
02:20:03.831 --> 02:20:05.750
If three commercial freezers in the back,

4515
02:20:05.751 --> 02:20:06.800
I'll show you after we're done.

4516
02:20:07.220 --> 02:20:08.660
I have a three elk.

4517
02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:13.040
There were two elk rather than her parsed up and to elk and two axis deer and

4518
02:20:13.041 --> 02:20:13.874
those freezers.

4519
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:15.140
Yeah,

4520
02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:17.480
each ELC has several hundred pounds of meat,

4521
02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:18.081
you know,

4522
02:20:18.081 --> 02:20:19.670
and then I'd give a lot of it to my friends.

4523
02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:21.830
A good portion of my friends,

4524
02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:24.770
they always get a little packages of elk for me.

4525
02:20:24.771 --> 02:20:27.830
Elk Sausage and elk roasts and all these different things.

4526
02:20:27.831 --> 02:20:29.450
I'm always giving people recipes,

4527
02:20:29.451 --> 02:20:30.410
showing them how to eat it,

4528
02:20:30.780 --> 02:20:31.670
me how to cook it.

4529
02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:32.901
Citrus thing,

4530
02:20:32.901 --> 02:20:34.490
that's the most modern way is the,

4531
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:36.170
is the classic.

4532
02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.630
I eat what I call rabbit food.

4533
02:20:38.631 --> 02:20:39.800
It's the Cracko Diet,

4534
02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:42.680
like a crocodile Berge foliage.

4535
02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:48.770
D One credit hour says the other ones you have for breakfast,

4536
02:20:48.890 --> 02:20:49.723
the chicken,

4537
02:20:49.940 --> 02:20:51.950
anything that is it sitting in?

4538
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:53.503
We

4539
02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:57.640
what'd,

4540
02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:00.830
what'd you have fish when you catch it in seaweed,

4541
02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:02.541
but a,

4542
02:21:02.541 --> 02:21:05.690
that seems to serve me the Brady Diet.

4543
02:21:05.691 --> 02:21:07.720
Everybody's talking about the Tom Brady Diet.

4544
02:21:07.770 --> 02:21:08.510
What does he do?

4545
02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:09.290
Well,

4546
02:21:09.290 --> 02:21:10.170
we call it eating,

4547
02:21:10.270 --> 02:21:10.580
eating,

4548
02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:11.480
eating clean.

4549
02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:13.760
Who's not eating any processed flies?

4550
02:21:13.761 --> 02:21:15.140
Not eating any white bread.

4551
02:21:15.141 --> 02:21:15.230
He,

4552
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.470
she,

4553
02:21:15.470 --> 02:21:15.831
nope.

4554
02:21:15.831 --> 02:21:18.590
Meal and clean proteins,

4555
02:21:18.591 --> 02:21:19.091
you know,

4556
02:21:19.091 --> 02:21:20.270
know fried stuff.

4557
02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:22.100
And he's in his forties so it's crazy.

4558
02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:22.940
Yeah,

4559
02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:23.271
he's,

4560
02:21:23.271 --> 02:21:24.021
he's a,

4561
02:21:24.021 --> 02:21:25.100
is he a miracle?

4562
02:21:25.130 --> 02:21:28.160
Is something special on when you look at his body,

4563
02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:30.380
he looks like a guy at the beach,

4564
02:21:30.470 --> 02:21:31.460
like a regular guy.

4565
02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:33.530
He doesn't look like a super athlete.

4566
02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:36.470
One of the greatest football players of all time.

4567
02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:37.790
Are we seeing something?

4568
02:21:37.791 --> 02:21:41.900
Because between him and Alex Honnold and there are a couple of others,

4569
02:21:41.901 --> 02:21:42.860
stellar,

4570
02:21:42.861 --> 02:21:43.161
like,

4571
02:21:43.161 --> 02:21:44.060
Whoa,

4572
02:21:44.390 --> 02:21:48.080
are we starting to see a trend because of better nutrition and better training

4573
02:21:48.081 --> 02:21:49.160
and cross trainings?

4574
02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:50.810
And there's so many factors.

4575
02:21:50.811 --> 02:21:51.890
When you deal with football,

4576
02:21:51.891 --> 02:21:52.750
there's so many fewer,

4577
02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:53.593
bigger,

4578
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:54.201
stronger.

4579
02:21:54.201 --> 02:21:54.650
Yeah.

4580
02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:54.831
Well,

4581
02:21:54.831 --> 02:21:55.581
I think with football,

4582
02:21:55.581 --> 02:21:56.540
with with Tom Brady,

4583
02:21:56.541 --> 02:21:57.740
I think it's training,

4584
02:21:57.741 --> 02:21:58.820
intelligence,

4585
02:21:58.850 --> 02:21:59.840
dedication,

4586
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:01.130
obsession,

4587
02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:02.750
and then also nutrition,

4588
02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:03.240
all those,

4589
02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:03.981
all those factors.

4590
02:22:03.981 --> 02:22:05.230
But you have to like really be,

4591
02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:09.200
and there's no way to be as good as he is without being incredibly immersed in

4592
02:22:09.201 --> 02:22:11.030
whatever you're trying to excel at.

4593
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.931
There's no way.

4594
02:22:11.931 --> 02:22:12.890
And with Alex Honnold,

4595
02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:15.980
I mean the guy lives out of his van because he wants to live out of his van

4596
02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:20.060
because all he wants to do is just drive around to different mountains and climb

4597
02:22:20.061 --> 02:22:20.241
them.

4598
02:22:20.241 --> 02:22:20.481
I mean,

4599
02:22:20.481 --> 02:22:21.350
that's his thing.

4600
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:21.771
For me,

4601
02:22:21.771 --> 02:22:22.700
it was the surfers.

4602
02:22:22.970 --> 02:22:23.620
Yeah.

4603
02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:26.010
1960s exact

4604
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.210
<v 1>same lifestyle.</v>

4605
02:22:27.390 --> 02:22:29.690
They needed to be use a vertical for Kentucky's,

4606
02:22:29.710 --> 02:22:30.930
the doors of the useless,

4607
02:22:30.931 --> 02:22:33.030
they call themselves some vertical surfer.

4608
02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:33.531
That's it.

4609
02:22:33.531 --> 02:22:33.730
Yeah,

4610
02:22:33.730 --> 02:22:34.351
it's a vertical.

4611
02:22:34.351 --> 02:22:36.000
So for me it was,

4612
02:22:36.490 --> 02:22:36.780
you know,

4613
02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:38.190
we're going to go camp at Santa,

4614
02:22:38.191 --> 02:22:39.024
no free,

4615
02:22:39.530 --> 02:22:40.060
you know,

4616
02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:41.590
<v 5>which is something that you talked to surfers.</v>

4617
02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:42.453
There's something,

4618
02:22:42.740 --> 02:22:44.890
there's a weird corny way to put it,

4619
02:22:44.891 --> 02:22:47.050
but I haven't talked to all of them obviously,

4620
02:22:47.051 --> 02:22:51.370
but a lot of high level surfers like Kelly Slater or let go out,

4621
02:22:51.371 --> 02:22:52.720
my good friend Shane Dorian,

4622
02:22:52.990 --> 02:22:53.890
they are,

4623
02:22:54.170 --> 02:22:56.530
they're spiritual in some strange way.

4624
02:22:56.531 --> 02:22:58.300
They're at peace in some strange way.

4625
02:22:58.780 --> 02:23:02.950
And I think part of it is because they're constantly on that ocean and I think

4626
02:23:02.951 --> 02:23:04.660
the ocean is like a battery.

4627
02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:06.640
I think you get energy out of it.

4628
02:23:06.641 --> 02:23:07.140
I think it,

4629
02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:08.140
it's alive.

4630
02:23:08.141 --> 02:23:09.460
It feels alive.

4631
02:23:09.461 --> 02:23:12.070
I think it stimulates you in a very unique way.

4632
02:23:12.310 --> 02:23:13.143
And with those guys,

4633
02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:16.270
they're writing these immense waves,

4634
02:23:16.271 --> 02:23:16.720
these,

4635
02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:21.720
these creations of nature and gravity and force and mass and water and that Wa

4636
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:25.750
riding them and they're riding a living thing.

4637
02:23:25.751 --> 02:23:27.070
There's organisms in it.

4638
02:23:27.071 --> 02:23:27.330
It's,

4639
02:23:27.330 --> 02:23:29.110
it's filled with salt.

4640
02:23:29.111 --> 02:23:29.561
I mean it's,

4641
02:23:29.561 --> 02:23:30.940
it charges the body.

4642
02:23:30.941 --> 02:23:34.390
It's got a different frequency than the rest of the world.

4643
02:23:34.990 --> 02:23:35.651
And these guys,

4644
02:23:35.651 --> 02:23:37.000
they seem different.

4645
02:23:37.001 --> 02:23:37.480
They have a,

4646
02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:39.160
there's a different vibe about them.

4647
02:23:39.161 --> 02:23:41.050
I'm more content vibe.

4648
02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:44.260
I've always said it's like there's something about beach towns,

4649
02:23:44.261 --> 02:23:46.840
like why is everybody by the beach so fucking chill?

4650
02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:49.510
Like what is that something crazy?

4651
02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:50.750
<v 1>Music isn't chill,</v>

4652
02:23:51.410 --> 02:23:52.310
Jack Johnson is,

4653
02:23:52.311 --> 02:23:53.530
but you know what I'm saying?

4654
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:55.210
Classic Surf Music is

4655
02:23:55.230 --> 02:23:56.021
<v 8>Donna.</v>

4656
02:23:56.021 --> 02:23:56.101
No,

4657
02:23:56.101 --> 02:23:56.280
no,

4658
02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:56.501
no,

4659
02:23:56.501 --> 02:23:56.641
no,

4660
02:23:56.641 --> 02:23:56.911
no,

4661
02:23:56.911 --> 02:23:57.031
no,

4662
02:23:57.031 --> 02:23:57.151
no,

4663
02:23:57.151 --> 02:23:57.320
no.

4664
02:23:57.320 --> 02:23:57.890
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4665
02:23:57.890 --> 02:23:58.480
I guess it's some,

4666
02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:00.410
sounds like the waves mimic the way,

4667
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:03.890
the way I perhaps Dick Dale and the Dell Tomes,

4668
02:24:03.891 --> 02:24:06.710
we're imitating the way waves made you feel.

4669
02:24:06.890 --> 02:24:07.270
Whoa.

4670
02:24:07.270 --> 02:24:07.560
No,

4671
02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:07.701
no,

4672
02:24:07.701 --> 02:24:07.821
no,

4673
02:24:07.821 --> 02:24:08.654
no.

4674
02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:12.740
And now they're playing what it feels like to sit around the campfire on the

4675
02:24:12.741 --> 02:24:13.550
beach,

4676
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:14.383
right?

4677
02:24:17.270 --> 02:24:17.571
Yeah.

4678
02:24:17.571 --> 02:24:18.231
That kind of shit.

4679
02:24:18.231 --> 02:24:19.420
It's kind of a beach tone.

4680
02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:20.120
A little bit.

4681
02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:21.200
Is it runner's high?

4682
02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:22.240
I don't know.

4683
02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:26.390
Cause we used to walk into the running stores and you know everybody behind the

4684
02:24:26.490 --> 02:24:27.150
counters.

4685
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:31.760
I did attended a gray and it stays with,

4686
02:24:32.210 --> 02:24:34.490
that's day that stays with you.

4687
02:24:34.820 --> 02:24:36.680
I ride my bicycle everywhere.

4688
02:24:37.330 --> 02:24:38.210
I'm on two wheels.

4689
02:24:38.211 --> 02:24:41.030
I've successfully replaced the automobile and Pasadena.

4690
02:24:41.210 --> 02:24:41.630
Really?

4691
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:43.820
I got to go to the seven 11 I'm on the bicycle.

4692
02:24:43.821 --> 02:24:45.290
I got to Pasadena.

4693
02:24:45.350 --> 02:24:46.130
Oh yeah.

4694
02:24:46.130 --> 02:24:47.750
I want to go to the,

4695
02:24:47.751 --> 02:24:48.141
you know,

4696
02:24:48.141 --> 02:24:51.530
wherever you get on the bicycle in the rain,

4697
02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:52.280
doesn't matter.

4698
02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:52.970
Really.

4699
02:24:52.970 --> 02:24:53.190
Yeah.

4700
02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:57.890
Just you don't drive the car as in Pasadena as infrequently as possible.

4701
02:24:57.920 --> 02:24:58.700
Wow.

4702
02:24:58.700 --> 02:24:59.480
This,

4703
02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:00.530
this is cow.

4704
02:25:00.531 --> 02:25:02.810
I cross train as opposed to,

4705
02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:06.410
I think we can going to hire coaches.

4706
02:25:06.411 --> 02:25:07.520
It's just stay on that bike.

4707
02:25:07.540 --> 02:25:08.660
What have you go to dinner somewhere.

4708
02:25:09.890 --> 02:25:10.940
Don't laugh.

4709
02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:11.481
Okay.

4710
02:25:11.481 --> 02:25:12.860
I'll take it to an extreme.

4711
02:25:12.861 --> 02:25:14.330
When I'm in New York City,

4712
02:25:14.390 --> 02:25:18.050
I have my bike and everything's set up over there and my bicycle and so forth.

4713
02:25:18.051 --> 02:25:19.070
Got a little apartment there.

4714
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:20.583
Um,

4715
02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:22.670
I saw a scene in doctor know,

4716
02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:24.070
careful what you let your kids

4717
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.251
<v 2>see.</v>

4718
02:25:24.251 --> 02:25:25.150
It could be for life.

4719
02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:31.500
Sean Connery comes out of the ocean and one of those black neoprene wetsuit.

4720
02:25:32.060 --> 02:25:32.310
Right,

4721
02:25:32.310 --> 02:25:33.143
right.

4722
02:25:33.610 --> 02:25:38.610
And he peels it off and he's got a blue Tuxedo on underneath without a drop of

4723
02:25:38.951 --> 02:25:39.784
water.

4724
02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:42.370
Do I have to finish this?

4725
02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:43.000
Yeah,

4726
02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:43.241
no.

4727
02:25:43.241 --> 02:25:43.900
I got my,

4728
02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:48.400
I got my jumpsuits and I got my flight suits and everything like is more than

4729
02:25:48.401 --> 02:25:51.160
once I've gone to a club or a dinner,

4730
02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:54.700
I give the door guy or the parking guy or the as it John,

4731
02:25:54.701 --> 02:25:56.970
that's my bike chained up over there and the corners,

4732
02:25:56.980 --> 02:25:58.970
$20 keep an eye on it.

4733
02:25:58.990 --> 02:26:00.970
Don't let any pro snap that walk.

4734
02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:04.690
And I just stuffed my backpack up under the bike like this.

4735
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:06.220
I do this in the rain.

4736
02:26:06.221 --> 02:26:07.360
I do it in the snow.

4737
02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:09.330
I do it every once somebody says the rain and go.

4738
02:26:09.331 --> 02:26:09.521
Yeah.

4739
02:26:09.521 --> 02:26:10.630
Like every kid in Hawaii,

4740
02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:12.280
there are no snow days in Hawaii.

4741
02:26:13.180 --> 02:26:13.840
It's raining.

4742
02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:14.673
Just assume it.

4743
02:26:15.430 --> 02:26:17.230
There are no snow days in the Dakotas.

4744
02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:18.333
It's snowing.

4745
02:26:18.450 --> 02:26:18.670
Yeah,

4746
02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:19.503
go to school.

4747
02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:21.483
And uh,

4748
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.260
I've done this all over the world.

4749
02:26:23.890 --> 02:26:26.440
I take my bicycles with me wherever I go.

4750
02:26:26.470 --> 02:26:27.370
So when you were in Japan,

4751
02:26:27.371 --> 02:26:28.000
he took a bike.

4752
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:28.301
Oh,

4753
02:26:28.301 --> 02:26:29.950
I know who all of Tokyo bike.

4754
02:26:29.951 --> 02:26:34.951
Like I know the roof of my mouth take you anywhere on those streets.

4755
02:26:34.991 --> 02:26:36.460
I know every alleyway.

4756
02:26:36.461 --> 02:26:38.350
I know all the ways downtown.

4757
02:26:38.650 --> 02:26:43.540
I would routinely make a two hour trip to my art lessons from where I lived all

4758
02:26:43.541 --> 02:26:44.351
the way downtown,

4759
02:26:44.351 --> 02:26:46.840
each Ebisu and all the way back like that.

4760
02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:51.070
When you drive around today as opposed to in the old days before cell phones,

4761
02:26:51.071 --> 02:26:53.200
do you notice a difference with people paying attention?

4762
02:26:54.250 --> 02:26:55.120
Text moves?

4763
02:26:55.660 --> 02:26:59.350
I know that getting off the line could take a week depending on

4764
02:27:02.110 --> 02:27:06.280
the light changes and counting on how long it takes is everybody's got to sign

4765
02:27:06.281 --> 02:27:07.150
off their phone,

4766
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:09.070
turn off the computer,

4767
02:27:09.490 --> 02:27:11.500
do as or whatever.

4768
02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:12.250
Um,

4769
02:27:12.250 --> 02:27:13.830
by and large,

4770
02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:15.133
um,

4771
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:18.790
what I have noticed is that when people are watching you,

4772
02:27:18.970 --> 02:27:23.230
they no longer have their hands in their pockets and pretend to be Westlake.

4773
02:27:24.470 --> 02:27:26.440
Now you pretend you stare into your cell phone.

4774
02:27:26.770 --> 02:27:27.603
That's true.

4775
02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:27.940
You've,

4776
02:27:27.940 --> 02:27:28.241
oh,

4777
02:27:28.241 --> 02:27:30.980
and a fan or somebody who's watching you and said,

4778
02:27:30.990 --> 02:27:31.823
are you gonna go like,

4779
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:38.670
that's 1960s now they look today more often than not,

4780
02:27:38.741 --> 02:27:43.741
I'm the only guy who's actually present in a place I walk into a coffee shop has

4781
02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:45.100
the cell phone.

4782
02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:45.790
No,

4783
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:50.260
I walk into a coffee shop or a restaurant or even a club,

4784
02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:55.980
which is pretty centrally a social experience and everybody is staring into

4785
02:27:58.481 --> 02:28:02.220
their cell phones in different banquettes and different whatever.

4786
02:28:02.221 --> 02:28:03.460
I'm more often than not,

4787
02:28:03.461 --> 02:28:06.730
I'm the only one who's actually present looking,

4788
02:28:06.731 --> 02:28:07.564
seeing,

4789
02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:08.830
have you airing,

4790
02:28:08.930 --> 02:28:10.390
smelled old with those things.

4791
02:28:10.391 --> 02:28:11.530
Have you ever oh sure.

4792
02:28:11.531 --> 02:28:12.100
Fucked with them.

4793
02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:13.360
And you decided it's not for you.

4794
02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:15.430
I'm going to let you know a little secret.

4795
02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.650
Very digitally literate.

4796
02:28:17.890 --> 02:28:18.640
Okay.

4797
02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:21.440
I can fly a $6 million helicopter backwards.

4798
02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:22.280
Can you really?

4799
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:23.113
Yes,

4800
02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:27.410
but it forces people to make eye contact.

4801
02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:28.910
You want to talk to me?

4802
02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:30.410
You have to sit just like this.

4803
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:31.783
Okay.

4804
02:28:31.970 --> 02:28:35.450
And you can't text me cause that's avoidance.

4805
02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:38.690
Can't a,

4806
02:28:38.691 --> 02:28:41.780
there's a whole lot of off ramps I take out of the program.

4807
02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:42.950
What about email?

4808
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:44.443
I don't.

4809
02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:45.500
You don't email?

4810
02:28:45.501 --> 02:28:46.210
Nope.

4811
02:28:46.210 --> 02:28:51.210
Well I'm surrounded by individuals and I know exactly what to ask for and about.

4812
02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:53.870
So what do you want to get ahold of you?

4813
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:54.950
They have to go find you.

4814
02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:58.250
At no point in my life.

4815
02:28:58.251 --> 02:28:58.940
Like as a,

4816
02:28:58.940 --> 02:28:59.721
with yourself,

4817
02:28:59.721 --> 02:29:00.554
I'm assuming,

4818
02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:03.980
am I more than five feet away from somebody with a cell phone?

4819
02:29:04.190 --> 02:29:05.210
Uh,

4820
02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:06.073
I was laughing.

4821
02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:08.960
It's like James Bond or some secret agent shit.

4822
02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:10.100
We're even Miguel,

4823
02:29:10.101 --> 02:29:13.030
the Gardner has a smartphone.

4824
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.983
Everyone has one.

4825
02:29:15.070 --> 02:29:16.670
He's going to pull a gun and defend me,

4826
02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:17.620
whoever it,

4827
02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:20.390
carry them at one point and decide to stop carrying them.

4828
02:29:21.020 --> 02:29:21.710
Yes.

4829
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:23.660
And it became a constant,

4830
02:29:24.620 --> 02:29:25.850
uh,

4831
02:29:26.490 --> 02:29:28.310
as show people.

4832
02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:29.210
We are targets,

4833
02:29:29.570 --> 02:29:30.710
targets for love,

4834
02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:31.850
targets for greed,

4835
02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:34.970
targets for proximity,

4836
02:29:34.971 --> 02:29:35.804
it's Cetera.

4837
02:29:36.110 --> 02:29:37.970
And uh,

4838
02:29:38.090 --> 02:29:39.770
it became a constant interruption,

4839
02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:45.400
became a constant sheet in an effort to find my way to where Shane Dorian is.

4840
02:29:46.970 --> 02:29:48.230
I want to be out on that wave.

4841
02:29:48.231 --> 02:29:48.560
Man.

4842
02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:49.393
I want calm.

4843
02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:50.990
I want to live in New York City.

4844
02:29:51.290 --> 02:29:56.060
I want to live in the middle of the noise and the clamor and I want to be able

4845
02:29:56.061 --> 02:29:57.380
to keep my heart rate down.

4846
02:29:58.550 --> 02:30:01.130
I want to be able to keep my waist down.

4847
02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:02.053
You dig.

4848
02:30:02.690 --> 02:30:04.560
And uh,

4849
02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:09.700
I found myself constantly having to answer that phone and having to deal with,

4850
02:30:10.940 --> 02:30:12.200
hey man,

4851
02:30:12.201 --> 02:30:13.190
how are you?

4852
02:30:13.191 --> 02:30:15.110
Just what cut to the crash.

4853
02:30:15.950 --> 02:30:17.510
And uh,

4854
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:19.790
getting texted is avoidance.

4855
02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:20.510
Yeah.

4856
02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:23.660
Nine and a half times out of 10 it's just somebody who didn't really want to

4857
02:30:23.661 --> 02:30:24.590
talk on the phone.

4858
02:30:25.070 --> 02:30:25.880
You hear this?

4859
02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:26.180
Well,

4860
02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:26.871
I texted you.

4861
02:30:26.871 --> 02:30:27.381
I tell you,

4862
02:30:27.381 --> 02:30:30.260
you're the only plan Yam landing today.

4863
02:30:30.290 --> 02:30:31.123
Yeah.

4864
02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:32.450
But at any given time,

4865
02:30:33.350 --> 02:30:34.640
the guy driving the car,

4866
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.863
the assessment,

4867
02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:40.010
even the Gardner has a smartphone and everybody knows you can find me.

4868
02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:41.063
Yeah.

4869
02:30:41.330 --> 02:30:42.560
And You keep it that way.

4870
02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:43.310
But yeah.

4871
02:30:43.310 --> 02:30:43.761
So what,

4872
02:30:43.761 --> 02:30:45.680
what year was it where he decided to do this?

4873
02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:46.873
How long ago?

4874
02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:48.050
About four years ago.

4875
02:30:48.051 --> 02:30:48.980
Four years ago.

4876
02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:50.990
You bought into then you carrying the phone,

4877
02:30:50.991 --> 02:30:52.250
doing the whole deal and you went,

4878
02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:54.170
I don't want this anymore.

4879
02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:55.790
It was constant phone ringing,

4880
02:30:55.791 --> 02:30:57.110
constantly having to check in.

4881
02:30:57.320 --> 02:30:58.850
Constant of,

4882
02:30:58.851 --> 02:30:59.684
uh,

4883
02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:01.311
I called you,

4884
02:31:01.311 --> 02:31:02.420
how come you didn't call me back?

4885
02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:05.810
Rah Rah Rah became a leash.

4886
02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:06.890
Yeah.

4887
02:31:06.890 --> 02:31:08.360
It also indicates,

4888
02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:09.261
you know,

4889
02:31:09.261 --> 02:31:12.350
as you start to call over and over and over again,

4890
02:31:12.680 --> 02:31:12.891
it's,

4891
02:31:12.891 --> 02:31:14.870
it's a like a tracer.

4892
02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:16.393
You follow?

4893
02:31:17.050 --> 02:31:17.883
Um,

4894
02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:19.100
you have stalkers.

4895
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:20.423
Sure.

4896
02:31:21.120 --> 02:31:21.953
Got a good one.

4897
02:31:22.260 --> 02:31:22.650
No,

4898
02:31:22.650 --> 02:31:22.920
no.

4899
02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:23.310
Right.

4900
02:31:23.310 --> 02:31:24.300
I got stockers.

4901
02:31:24.430 --> 02:31:24.870
Yeah,

4902
02:31:24.870 --> 02:31:26.550
I got a stock or who makes prank call?

4903
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:27.630
Uh,

4904
02:31:27.930 --> 02:31:29.520
I can tell you what time get the work.

4905
02:31:29.850 --> 02:31:31.170
I can tell you what time he goes home.

4906
02:31:31.890 --> 02:31:35.250
I can tell you if he went to church and then brunch and what time he got home

4907
02:31:35.251 --> 02:31:36.084
from that.

4908
02:31:36.450 --> 02:31:39.660
I can tell you if you had something to drink the night before and went home and

4909
02:31:39.661 --> 02:31:41.310
slept it off the next day.

4910
02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:45.600
It's the nature of communications.

4911
02:31:45.890 --> 02:31:47.760
Remember tracer bullets worked both ways.

4912
02:31:47.761 --> 02:31:48.594
Boy,

4913
02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:53.100
you're going to indicate everywhere you are and everything you do and your whole

4914
02:31:53.101 --> 02:31:54.570
entire thing of your lives.

4915
02:31:54.571 --> 02:31:55.920
Very Orwellian.

4916
02:31:55.980 --> 02:31:57.180
Especially with social media,

4917
02:31:57.181 --> 02:32:01.080
right half and probably the last thing I want you to know about me is how boring

4918
02:32:01.081 --> 02:32:01.914
I am.

4919
02:32:03.730 --> 02:32:04.563
Not Kidding.

4920
02:32:05.350 --> 02:32:05.900
<v 5>There's also,</v>

4921
02:32:05.900 --> 02:32:10.900
there's a thing of giving into this non human device and integrating it with

4922
02:32:12.581 --> 02:32:13.414
your life.

4923
02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:15.590
You W W and where people just,

4924
02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:17.200
they never leave it alone.

4925
02:32:17.230 --> 02:32:18.220
They're constantly on it.

4926
02:32:18.221 --> 02:32:19.150
They're checking it with,

4927
02:32:19.540 --> 02:32:20.920
you're not even getting anything out of it.

4928
02:32:20.921 --> 02:32:22.240
You're just checking it for nothing.

4929
02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:23.830
He'd just checking your email,

4930
02:32:23.831 --> 02:32:24.730
checking your photos,

4931
02:32:24.731 --> 02:32:26.440
checking your Instagram is nothing coming,

4932
02:32:26.860 --> 02:32:28.480
nothing positive coming out of it.

4933
02:32:28.481 --> 02:32:30.790
It's just like this weird distraction from life.

4934
02:32:30.850 --> 02:32:32.590
Used to use the frigerator for that.

4935
02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:33.160
Yeah,

4936
02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:33.911
that's right.

4937
02:32:33.911 --> 02:32:34.990
It's almost the same.

4938
02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:36.011
You're so right.

4939
02:32:36.011 --> 02:32:38.830
It's like a digital version of opening the refrigerator when you know nothing's

4940
02:32:38.831 --> 02:32:39.530
in there.

4941
02:32:39.530 --> 02:32:41.800
Grazie that's so true.

4942
02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:43.011
It's so true.

4943
02:32:43.011 --> 02:32:43.990
It's like boredom

4944
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.860
<v 2>exercise.</v>

4945
02:32:45.130 --> 02:32:45.760
Yeah.

4946
02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:49.900
It's a habit or ranch for it or reach for it.

4947
02:32:49.930 --> 02:32:52.480
Do you have one just in case you have to use it?

4948
02:32:52.990 --> 02:32:54.550
I'm giving away all my secrets.

4949
02:32:54.610 --> 02:32:57.760
I am constantly in the grid.

4950
02:32:58.420 --> 02:32:58.930
Okay.

4951
02:32:58.930 --> 02:32:59.710
Okay.

4952
02:32:59.710 --> 02:33:00.190
Um,

4953
02:33:00.190 --> 02:33:04.510
one of my closest colleagues that I work with two or three nights a week,

4954
02:33:05.020 --> 02:33:09.460
college Smith has written 17 books on how to run Adobe photo shop.

4955
02:33:10.150 --> 02:33:10.750
Okay.

4956
02:33:10.750 --> 02:33:14.650
We've been working on an art project together for quite some time.

4957
02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:16.690
We'll debut that at another time.

4958
02:33:18.250 --> 02:33:19.083
Um,

4959
02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:20.770
I love the Internet.

4960
02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:25.000
I love what the digit future has brought to us.

4961
02:33:25.001 --> 02:33:29.680
My only real regret in life is that I didn't have this grown up.

4962
02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:31.870
Go look it up.

4963
02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:33.550
I should have that tattooed

4964
02:33:35.430 --> 02:33:37.480
and signed by my parents.

4965
02:33:39.940 --> 02:33:40.151
Yeah,

4966
02:33:40.151 --> 02:33:41.980
it's a great time for finding things out.

4967
02:33:42.490 --> 02:33:47.440
The information if you want to learn the encyclopedia Britannica was what we had

4968
02:33:47.441 --> 02:33:52.441
goes look it up and Canterbury records in case you wanted some music,

4969
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:57.070
which was an hour's bike ride each way.

4970
02:33:57.100 --> 02:33:57.933
Okay.

4971
02:33:58.170 --> 02:34:00.790
And I can keep going and now you can get music.

4972
02:34:00.820 --> 02:34:01.930
Oh my God.

4973
02:34:01.931 --> 02:34:02.620
It was just,

4974
02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:05.200
it's for somebody like me when,

4975
02:34:05.201 --> 02:34:05.441
uh,

4976
02:34:05.441 --> 02:34:07.270
I was flavor of the week,

4977
02:34:07.271 --> 02:34:08.380
the first time,

4978
02:34:08.830 --> 02:34:13.750
know I did all the rock star stuff and one of the first things that I wanted to

4979
02:34:13.751 --> 02:34:15.260
do because I'd read that Elton John,

4980
02:34:15.330 --> 02:34:16.240
this is,

4981
02:34:16.690 --> 02:34:19.470
you would them to close the store,

4982
02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:22.510
shop around by yourself and no,

4983
02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:22.720
no.

4984
02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:24.430
You got to have a security guy of course,

4985
02:34:24.431 --> 02:34:26.200
brings a pillowcase.

4986
02:34:26.260 --> 02:34:26.550
Ah,

4987
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:29.650
he put the records on a pillowcase with impunity.

4988
02:34:29.810 --> 02:34:30.510
Ooh.

4989
02:34:30.510 --> 02:34:31.690
Pick your records.

4990
02:34:31.691 --> 02:34:32.090
It,

4991
02:34:32.090 --> 02:34:33.670
you don't even read the liners.

4992
02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:34.713
Yeah.

4993
02:34:35.050 --> 02:34:36.070
If you have a good cover,

4994
02:34:36.071 --> 02:34:37.630
you're in the camp.

4995
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.610
Yeah.

4996
02:34:42.610 --> 02:34:43.391
I remember that.

4997
02:34:43.391 --> 02:34:47.080
I used to buy records based on how cool the cover looked.

4998
02:34:47.350 --> 02:34:47.590
Oh.

4999
02:34:47.590 --> 02:34:50.720
Routinely to chance route team lax,

5000
02:34:50.740 --> 02:34:52.780
especially double album covers and,

5001
02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:53.390
and,

5002
02:34:53.390 --> 02:34:54.223
and uh,

5003
02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:55.030
and uh,

5004
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:56.080
I would routinely,

5005
02:34:56.200 --> 02:34:57.940
I would shop by weight.

5006
02:34:58.780 --> 02:34:59.410
Okay.

5007
02:34:59.410 --> 02:35:01.090
I would do that at bookstores too,

5008
02:35:01.570 --> 02:35:06.570
as much as we could carry coming out of the bookstores because for example,

5009
02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:07.660
um,

5010
02:35:07.660 --> 02:35:09.460
I like many different kinds of music.

5011
02:35:09.610 --> 02:35:13.360
One of my favorites is danceable Electronica,

5012
02:35:15.060 --> 02:35:15.400
uh,

5013
02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:16.570
R and B disco.

5014
02:35:16.571 --> 02:35:18.430
Anything that has a call it floor.

5015
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:20.890
If it has anything to do with dancing,

5016
02:35:20.980 --> 02:35:21.813
it's four.

5017
02:35:21.970 --> 02:35:23.850
And there were no floor stations here in the,

5018
02:35:23.851 --> 02:35:25.840
in California in the 70s.

5019
02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:28.630
You wanted to hear anything that's,

5020
02:35:28.631 --> 02:35:29.464
you know,

5021
02:35:29.710 --> 02:35:34.510
you had KJLH may be some small am kind of a station,

5022
02:35:34.511 --> 02:35:35.560
but you went to New York.

5023
02:35:35.770 --> 02:35:36.603
You had,

5024
02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:38.110
let me put the headphones on.

5025
02:35:38.111 --> 02:35:38.944
I could do the voice.

5026
02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:41.860
This is puggle.

5027
02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:42.401
There'll be you,

5028
02:35:42.401 --> 02:35:42.781
Katie,

5029
02:35:42.781 --> 02:35:44.350
you shuttled traffic

5030
02:35:47.710 --> 02:35:48.281
this time.

5031
02:35:48.281 --> 02:35:48.560
Bay,

5032
02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:49.393
Ebay.

5033
02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:50.820
We're missing djs.

5034
02:35:51.310 --> 02:35:51.850
Sorry.

5035
02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:52.930
We're missing djs.

5036
02:35:52.931 --> 02:35:54.490
That's something that's missing from our culture,

5037
02:35:54.491 --> 02:35:56.680
the comet and Bob and Bob and with the best bet for the boss.

5038
02:35:56.681 --> 02:35:57.670
Beat at the top of the pops.

5039
02:35:57.671 --> 02:35:58.300
Managed gold.

5040
02:35:58.300 --> 02:35:59.260
I'm diamond Dave.

5041
02:35:59.261 --> 02:36:01.960
No time to waste to making the taste baby shut up.

5042
02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:03.490
Time to play the record.

5043
02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:05.050
Big Wolf,

5044
02:36:05.051 --> 02:36:05.884
man Jack,

5045
02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:09.010
those guys are gone.

5046
02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:09.281
That,

5047
02:36:09.281 --> 02:36:11.440
that's like a missing segment of our culture.

5048
02:36:12.100 --> 02:36:17.100
I was in pass and Dena listening for the first FM radio underground station,

5049
02:36:18.791 --> 02:36:19.960
which was KPPC.

5050
02:36:21.130 --> 02:36:22.540
It was metro media,

5051
02:36:22.541 --> 02:36:24.100
I believe it was channel five.

5052
02:36:24.250 --> 02:36:25.660
Tell me if this gets too boring.

5053
02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:26.943
Um,

5054
02:36:27.730 --> 02:36:31.300
here's the history of it is during the Cold War,

5055
02:36:31.570 --> 02:36:36.570
right around 1965 66 it became a legal imperative that all radio stations,

5056
02:36:39.011 --> 02:36:43.330
regular ones had to operate an FM band station.

5057
02:36:43.870 --> 02:36:46.720
Fm had been around since the 1930s my uncle man,

5058
02:36:46.721 --> 02:36:47.470
he remembered it.

5059
02:36:47.470 --> 02:36:47.980
Okay.

5060
02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:48.910
But it never got used.

5061
02:36:48.911 --> 02:36:50.020
It was am radio

5062
02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:57.540
KFW be channel 98 and it was like the mighty 10 90,

5063
02:36:59.031 --> 02:36:59.400
you know.

5064
02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:00.190
Okay.

5065
02:37:00.190 --> 02:37:01.960
That kind of screaming Dj kind of thing.

5066
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.730
Why?

5067
02:37:03.730 --> 02:37:04.271
Because you know,

5068
02:37:04.271 --> 02:37:06.130
in case there's an a national emergency,

5069
02:37:06.430 --> 02:37:11.430
you are not allowed to take your normal programming though from Kfw WB and put

5070
02:37:11.561 --> 02:37:15.070
it on your sister station on FM had to be different programming.

5071
02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:15.890
Hmm,

5072
02:37:15.890 --> 02:37:16.520
okay.

5073
02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:19.970
You can't just dominate FM because you've got the advertisers,

5074
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.130
your channel five get a lot of advertisers.

5075
02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:24.220
You got Earl Scheib car paint there,

5076
02:37:24.270 --> 02:37:24.590
right?

5077
02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:25.241
You have rinse.

5078
02:37:25.241 --> 02:37:26.720
So you've got,

5079
02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:27.150
uh,

5080
02:37:27.150 --> 02:37:28.610
chasing Sandborne coffee,

5081
02:37:28.611 --> 02:37:29.510
you're going to squeeze me,

5082
02:37:30.330 --> 02:37:31.070
right,

5083
02:37:31.070 --> 02:37:31.760
right.

5084
02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:35.060
You're not allowed to have the same programming and channel five,

5085
02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:37.640
they operate a KPP sheet,

5086
02:37:38.090 --> 02:37:40.670
which is a one oh six point shopping today.

5087
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:42.200
It's k rock or whatever in it.

5088
02:37:42.201 --> 02:37:45.500
Like when I was six right in there and uh,

5089
02:37:46.190 --> 02:37:47.023
uh,

5090
02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:50.630
they brought in literally all these FM stations.

5091
02:37:50.830 --> 02:37:51.041
She,

5092
02:37:51.041 --> 02:37:51.231
you know,

5093
02:37:51.231 --> 02:37:51.620
the,

5094
02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:52.431
the is,

5095
02:37:52.431 --> 02:37:52.761
you know,

5096
02:37:52.761 --> 02:37:53.600
all said well,

5097
02:37:53.601 --> 02:37:54.020
uh,

5098
02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:54.890
my nephew,

5099
02:37:54.910 --> 02:37:55.160
he's,

5100
02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:56.570
he loves that rock stuff.

5101
02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:56.961
You know,

5102
02:37:56.961 --> 02:37:57.081
he's,

5103
02:37:57.081 --> 02:37:58.100
he's got a lot of records.

5104
02:37:58.101 --> 02:38:01.120
Maybe he'll be a DJ kind of thing or who,

5105
02:38:01.121 --> 02:38:03.110
who would be a DJ for this kind of stuff?

5106
02:38:03.111 --> 02:38:03.501
I don't know.

5107
02:38:03.501 --> 02:38:04.550
Who's a non screamer?

5108
02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:05.870
The jazz guys.

5109
02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:06.920
Yeah.

5110
02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:07.753
Okay.

5111
02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:09.560
They brought in big daddy,

5112
02:38:09.561 --> 02:38:11.540
Tom Donahue and his wife Rachel.

5113
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:16.670
And they came in and they start broadcasting on KPPC and Tom was a jazz DJ and

5114
02:38:17.210 --> 02:38:22.210
he would talk just kind of like this and Da,

5115
02:38:23.100 --> 02:38:23.940
okay,

5116
02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:28.680
we got a new quicksilver here.

5117
02:38:30.330 --> 02:38:33.330
Can't wait till it comes out and stereo.

5118
02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:40.760
Take a listen now to first side see in a few.

5119
02:38:42.270 --> 02:38:42.731
Yeah.

5120
02:38:42.731 --> 02:38:44.280
And we would practice that.

5121
02:38:46.290 --> 02:38:47.370
There's an art to that.

5122
02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:48.240
Oh yeah.

5123
02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:50.700
There's an art to preparing you for a new song.

5124
02:38:50.710 --> 02:38:51.510
Yeah.

5125
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:52.020
Okay.

5126
02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:53.460
Got a brand new wouldn't here.

5127
02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:54.473
Yeah.

5128
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:57.360
He use development hand like Djs,

5129
02:38:57.361 --> 02:38:57.721
you know,

5130
02:38:57.721 --> 02:38:58.381
like sweat,

5131
02:38:58.381 --> 02:38:59.214
jazz,

5132
02:38:59.730 --> 02:39:00.750
jazz guys.

5133
02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:04.610
Back then a lot of them were uh,

5134
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:07.190
doing things that

5135
02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:10.490
cause you to slow down,

5136
02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:13.333
you know what I mean?

5137
02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:17.070
And we started doing those things too.

5138
02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:22.740
Lula gauge here,

5139
02:39:24.210 --> 02:39:24.721
little strength.

5140
02:39:24.721 --> 02:39:27.950
A patient's Joe knows about me,

5141
02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:29.590
I do right after that.

5142
02:39:30.250 --> 02:39:32.290
<v 4>And then it would set you up for the music.</v>

5143
02:39:32.291 --> 02:39:34.780
You'd actually enjoy the music a little bit more because of that guy.

5144
02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:35.620
Oh yeah.

5145
02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:35.921
Yeah.

5146
02:39:35.921 --> 02:39:37.270
We get into the hands too.

5147
02:39:37.390 --> 02:39:37.780
Okay.

5148
02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:38.451
Here's a little something.

5149
02:39:38.451 --> 02:39:39.510
You work kind of Kook,

5150
02:39:39.511 --> 02:39:42.790
inspiring that if streaming services are smart,

5151
02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:44.170
they would bring that shit back.

5152
02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:46.420
They'd find someone you know,

5153
02:39:46.421 --> 02:39:48.910
because like streaming services are the new radio,

5154
02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:49.420
right?

5155
02:39:49.420 --> 02:39:50.980
I mean that's where a lot of people get their music.

5156
02:39:51.010 --> 02:39:52.810
The grade I'm talking about like Pandora.

5157
02:39:52.850 --> 02:39:53.390
Yeah.

5158
02:39:53.390 --> 02:39:54.223
All those things.

5159
02:39:55.740 --> 02:39:57.790
That's sort of what Apple's pitch was.

5160
02:39:57.791 --> 02:40:02.470
They have a whole radio section on apple music and they have beaches.

5161
02:40:02.471 --> 02:40:02.651
Yeah,

5162
02:40:02.651 --> 02:40:06.190
they have shows and well the DJ is running on both.

5163
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:07.121
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

5164
02:40:07.121 --> 02:40:08.730
but like as a sport judge,

5165
02:40:08.770 --> 02:40:10.630
what is it in the natural,

5166
02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:11.950
okay,

5167
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:12.700
great movie,

5168
02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:13.470
Bro.

5169
02:40:13.470 --> 02:40:15.180
Duvall devolves a writer,

5170
02:40:15.650 --> 02:40:16.483
a writer,

5171
02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:18.660
and they get into a little bit of an argument.

5172
02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:19.891
He says,

5173
02:40:19.891 --> 02:40:21.270
you don't play baseball.

5174
02:40:21.271 --> 02:40:21.721
He says,

5175
02:40:21.721 --> 02:40:22.201
yeah,

5176
02:40:22.201 --> 02:40:26.910
but on a good day I can make it look a little bit more interesting and make it a

5177
02:40:26.911 --> 02:40:30.500
little more exciting to help you see what she tells me.

5178
02:40:30.501 --> 02:40:31.410
You understand what?

5179
02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:32.280
Paraphrase?

5180
02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:32.671
Sure.

5181
02:40:32.671 --> 02:40:35.980
That's what I do with the exact,

5182
02:40:37.230 --> 02:40:40.380
that's an art form that implicates everything.

5183
02:40:40.381 --> 02:40:41.214
Drama,

5184
02:40:41.610 --> 02:40:41.920
pay,

5185
02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:43.590
throws whole Larry.

5186
02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:45.300
It all in one paragraph.

5187
02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:48.600
I've watched you go from zoo.

5188
02:40:51.130 --> 02:40:51.780
Yeah.

5189
02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:54.750
That's how I can pull up in a channel seamlessly.

5190
02:40:55.410 --> 02:40:56.610
I grew up with the greats.

5191
02:40:56.670 --> 02:40:57.300
Scully.

5192
02:40:57.300 --> 02:40:58.900
Co-Sale Sal,

5193
02:40:58.901 --> 02:40:59.734
tell me,

5194
02:41:00.030 --> 02:41:01.200
so tell me Holly.

5195
02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:04.420
So cash is please.

5196
02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:06.120
It's all the cash it out.

5197
02:41:06.300 --> 02:41:07.133
Okay.

5198
02:41:08.010 --> 02:41:09.490
And we would imitate that for,

5199
02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:10.621
you know,

5200
02:41:10.621 --> 02:41:12.970
trying to get that kind of an eloquent sal,

5201
02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:14.033
you know.

5202
02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:15.150
Um,

5203
02:41:15.150 --> 02:41:17.910
but you have djs,

5204
02:41:17.911 --> 02:41:19.110
they're not really djs.

5205
02:41:19.350 --> 02:41:22.530
They are representatives of a lifestyle.

5206
02:41:22.531 --> 02:41:23.191
For example,

5207
02:41:23.191 --> 02:41:25.620
I'm going into Dj voice cause I got the headphones.

5208
02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:29.670
This is why I don't wear the headphones cause come to aware.

5209
02:41:29.890 --> 02:41:30.190
Yeah,

5210
02:41:30.190 --> 02:41:31.770
it's sun goes down.

5211
02:41:33.710 --> 02:41:35.820
I haven't been to sleep since the late eighties.

5212
02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:39.473
Um,

5213
02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.140
what was I talking about?

5214
02:41:41.330 --> 02:41:42.560
I started riffing there.

5215
02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:45.063
Djs,

5216
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:48.240
djs now aren't really Dj's.

5217
02:41:48.690 --> 02:41:49.441
When you listen,

5218
02:41:49.441 --> 02:41:51.180
for example is Sirius Xm.

5219
02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:53.580
You have for example,

5220
02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:55.800
the country artist.

5221
02:41:55.820 --> 02:41:56.250
Sure.

5222
02:41:56.250 --> 02:41:57.030
Okay.

5223
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.930
And it's no shoes,

5224
02:41:57.931 --> 02:42:00.360
radio and you know,

5225
02:42:00.361 --> 02:42:01.194
it's um,

5226
02:42:01.380 --> 02:42:03.210
he's not a humorist.

5227
02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:04.800
Okay.

5228
02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:07.860
He's not even an interlocutor he and behold.

5229
02:42:07.900 --> 02:42:10.230
And so it came to pass like in Greek tragedy.

5230
02:42:10.610 --> 02:42:13.050
And so it came to pass that the sun came in,

5231
02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:13.893
the war was won.

5232
02:42:13.950 --> 02:42:14.910
He's not that.

5233
02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:16.920
It's Kenny Chesney going.

5234
02:42:17.730 --> 02:42:18.990
And I say it with respect,

5235
02:42:18.991 --> 02:42:19.824
you know,

5236
02:42:20.620 --> 02:42:21.000
hi,

5237
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:21.541
this is Kenny.

5238
02:42:21.541 --> 02:42:25.350
And I was just walking down here in Panama City and my phone went dead.

5239
02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:25.680
No,

5240
02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:29.950
I walked inside and I asked as Goodfellas rag here at the Joe Rogan Barbecue,

5241
02:42:30.610 --> 02:42:31.560
fire it up.

5242
02:42:31.561 --> 02:42:33.390
If I could just sort of charge it up.

5243
02:42:33.391 --> 02:42:34.171
And they said,

5244
02:42:34.171 --> 02:42:34.770
hell yeah.

5245
02:42:34.770 --> 02:42:38.730
So I'll just want him to tell you y'all come down road mark Cuban and she can

5246
02:42:38.731 --> 02:42:40.470
always find is right here on no shoes radio.

5247
02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:41.731
Oh,

5248
02:42:41.731 --> 02:42:42.564
so there's something,

5249
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:46.770
it's not really follow.

5250
02:42:46.771 --> 02:42:47.471
It's not announced.

5251
02:42:47.471 --> 02:42:47.850
He was,

5252
02:42:47.850 --> 02:42:48.990
he's kind of being,

5253
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:50.423
um,

5254
02:42:50.820 --> 02:42:51.653
Tom Petty.

5255
02:42:52.110 --> 02:42:54.690
He was a coke and spirit or you know,

5256
02:42:54.691 --> 02:42:55.470
like,

5257
02:42:55.470 --> 02:42:56.161
hey man,

5258
02:42:56.161 --> 02:42:57.660
I'm down here in the basement,

5259
02:42:57.661 --> 02:42:59.730
me and I'm listening to some recommendation and we'll burn.

5260
02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:00.880
It's fire up the bong.

5261
02:43:02.610 --> 02:43:03.391
Check this out.

5262
02:43:03.391 --> 02:43:04.560
This is fucking tasty.

5263
02:43:04.561 --> 02:43:05.340
This is it.

5264
02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:06.173
It's an important,

5265
02:43:07.350 --> 02:43:08.650
I had friends like that.

5266
02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:10.980
They could choose the music too.

5267
02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:12.370
Was the other thing about Tj,

5268
02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:13.870
they would choose the music.

5269
02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:15.431
I don't know.

5270
02:43:15.431 --> 02:43:16.264
A taste maker.

5271
02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:17.493
FM radio.

5272
02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:18.543
Yeah.

5273
02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:19.540
Yes.

5274
02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:20.373
You Bet.

5275
02:43:20.620 --> 02:43:22.330
And yeah,

5276
02:43:22.690 --> 02:43:23.860
that makes a big difference.

5277
02:43:23.861 --> 02:43:27.100
I did not think about as listen to WBCN in Boston.

5278
02:43:27.190 --> 02:43:30.070
It was a like 1980s and uh,

5279
02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:31.990
they wanted to play Michael Jackson.

5280
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.861
And the guy said,

5281
02:43:32.861 --> 02:43:33.250
listen,

5282
02:43:33.250 --> 02:43:36.730
I know this isn't rock is WBCN was the rock a boss to sure.

5283
02:43:37.370 --> 02:43:38.051
But they're like,

5284
02:43:38.051 --> 02:43:38.201
look,

5285
02:43:38.201 --> 02:43:39.220
I know this isn't rock,

5286
02:43:39.221 --> 02:43:39.941
but damn,

5287
02:43:39.941 --> 02:43:40.930
this is good music.

5288
02:43:41.350 --> 02:43:42.550
And they played Billie Jean.

5289
02:43:42.890 --> 02:43:43.541
I remember thinking,

5290
02:43:43.541 --> 02:43:43.780
Wow,

5291
02:43:43.780 --> 02:43:48.780
what a bold choice to watch a bold choice in a certain sense.

5292
02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:49.930
Okay.

5293
02:43:49.930 --> 02:43:54.930
And the Shurtan Shank is that after Awhile FM radio became very codified.

5294
02:43:57.100 --> 02:43:57.461
You know,

5295
02:43:57.461 --> 02:44:00.700
just like the horse race is somewhere in the mid seventies,

5296
02:44:00.701 --> 02:44:05.170
late seventies it became a playlist and the djs no longer pick their own

5297
02:44:05.171 --> 02:44:06.004
records.

5298
02:44:06.370 --> 02:44:08.740
Program directors picked the records.

5299
02:44:08.770 --> 02:44:09.603
Okay.

5300
02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:16.080
And it became very specific target demo we want a home in and whatever.

5301
02:44:16.590 --> 02:44:21.550
And keep in mind when Howard stern left regular radio,

5302
02:44:21.551 --> 02:44:24.580
terrestrial radio for the stratosphere,

5303
02:44:24.970 --> 02:44:27.220
I got his job in New York City.

5304
02:44:27.250 --> 02:44:27.371
Oh,

5305
02:44:27.371 --> 02:44:28.001
that's right.

5306
02:44:28.001 --> 02:44:31.270
I was broadcasting in seven different cities.

5307
02:44:31.330 --> 02:44:32.650
I forgot you did that.

5308
02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:32.891
Okay.

5309
02:44:32.891 --> 02:44:33.641
Dallas,

5310
02:44:33.641 --> 02:44:34.474
New York,

5311
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:35.081
Philly,

5312
02:44:35.081 --> 02:44:36.850
I think I was an and Cetera,

5313
02:44:36.851 --> 02:44:37.684
cetera.

5314
02:44:37.930 --> 02:44:40.090
And it turns out,

5315
02:44:40.091 --> 02:44:43.960
I think what they wanted was a version of Howard Stern.

5316
02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.380
Okay,

5317
02:44:44.380 --> 02:44:44.711
great.

5318
02:44:44.711 --> 02:44:45.640
I'll be a third class,

5319
02:44:45.641 --> 02:44:47.950
Howard stern or a first class David Lee.

5320
02:44:48.370 --> 02:44:52.000
My approach to is very different then his would be,

5321
02:44:52.001 --> 02:44:53.650
we're two very different people.

5322
02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:55.661
He's talking,

5323
02:44:55.661 --> 02:44:56.740
he's a personality.

5324
02:44:56.800 --> 02:44:58.690
It's all about interaction.

5325
02:44:59.110 --> 02:45:01.150
I see myself as show people,

5326
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:03.010
I'm music first.

5327
02:45:03.430 --> 02:45:04.060
Okay.

5328
02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:07.930
So the first thing I'm going to pick when we throw a barbecue is not the food or

5329
02:45:07.931 --> 02:45:08.641
the guest list,

5330
02:45:08.641 --> 02:45:09.940
but what's the music?

5331
02:45:10.110 --> 02:45:10.943
Right.

5332
02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:12.333
Well,

5333
02:45:12.670 --> 02:45:17.670
white people listen to Bob Marley when we're on vacation and when we celebrate

5334
02:45:17.831 --> 02:45:18.610
things,

5335
02:45:18.610 --> 02:45:19.870
we listened to Kool and the gang,

5336
02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:20.240
right?

5337
02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:21.010
Right.

5338
02:45:21.010 --> 02:45:25.600
And I would play those and the ratings were going up and they were pissing off

5339
02:45:25.601 --> 02:45:27.250
management really well.

5340
02:45:27.251 --> 02:45:27.611
They said,

5341
02:45:27.611 --> 02:45:31.360
we feel that Leonard Skinner to Nickelback are more appropriate for your

5342
02:45:31.361 --> 02:45:31.900
audience.

5343
02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:34.450
So the ratings were going up and they were upset.

5344
02:45:35.530 --> 02:45:38.320
And because you couldn't rein me in.

5345
02:45:38.620 --> 02:45:39.130
Okay,

5346
02:45:39.130 --> 02:45:40.090
now keep in mine.

5347
02:45:40.091 --> 02:45:43.810
I hired cooling the gang open for van Halen tour before last.

5348
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:49.950
You have never seen so many people dancing in one place because that's the sound

5349
02:45:52.390 --> 02:45:54.160
of every wedding.

5350
02:45:54.161 --> 02:45:57.850
Bar Mitzvah Fromm Bachelor party.

5351
02:45:57.940 --> 02:46:01.540
Cause this is ladies night and the fee,

5352
02:46:01.770 --> 02:46:02.440
oh,

5353
02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:03.790
a water die.

5354
02:46:03.880 --> 02:46:05.250
And you got to sing that.

5355
02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:06.790
Look at each other as you're driving,

5356
02:46:06.791 --> 02:46:08.500
going whoa to God.

5357
02:46:08.501 --> 02:46:10.670
What did they say to you before you took the job?

5358
02:46:10.671 --> 02:46:11.780
Like what was the,

5359
02:46:11.930 --> 02:46:14.150
what was the conversation when you agreed to do it?

5360
02:46:14.151 --> 02:46:17.240
What did you think was going to happen as opposed to what did happen?

5361
02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:18.980
Well,

5362
02:46:18.981 --> 02:46:20.510
what you say and what is real.

5363
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:21.171
Yeah,

5364
02:46:21.171 --> 02:46:22.340
that's the problem right now.

5365
02:46:22.620 --> 02:46:22.790
I,

5366
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:25.160
we've discussed doing commercials for example,

5367
02:46:25.460 --> 02:46:29.480
and I don't feel comfortable doing commercials unless it's something I actually

5368
02:46:29.481 --> 02:46:29.910
use,

5369
02:46:29.910 --> 02:46:30.211
you know,

5370
02:46:30.211 --> 02:46:31.760
like sunglasses or cigarettes

5371
02:46:33.700 --> 02:46:34.790
behind that,

5372
02:46:35.180 --> 02:46:36.013
you know,

5373
02:46:37.730 --> 02:46:39.590
Vermont care bear kind of a thing.

5374
02:46:39.591 --> 02:46:40.371
I don't know.

5375
02:46:40.371 --> 02:46:40.760
Right.

5376
02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:43.100
So it was uncomfortable from the beginning.

5377
02:46:43.490 --> 02:46:47.490
I got fired for playing too much ethnic music and uh,

5378
02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:50.030
for late night humor too early in the morning.

5379
02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:52.640
But that was Howard Stern's hold deals late nine.

5380
02:46:52.641 --> 02:46:53.090
Humor.

5381
02:46:53.090 --> 02:46:54.020
No it's not.

5382
02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:56.360
It's a different kind of humor.

5383
02:46:56.570 --> 02:46:58.250
What was your deal as opposed to his,

5384
02:46:59.930 --> 02:47:00.261
well,

5385
02:47:00.261 --> 02:47:02.150
whenever we brought on porn stars,

5386
02:47:02.151 --> 02:47:03.060
I actually knew them.

5387
02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:07.520
There were no died.

5388
02:47:08.190 --> 02:47:12.890
We'd already gone through the getting to know you phase seasons earlier,

5389
02:47:13.130 --> 02:47:16.680
kind of an expect you to do all talk or did they want you to play music as well

5390
02:47:16.681 --> 02:47:18.260
as just my sense of humor is different.

5391
02:47:18.261 --> 02:47:21.080
Unique as is his and as is yours.

5392
02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:21.711
Okay.

5393
02:47:21.711 --> 02:47:22.544
You can't eat.

5394
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:28.030
We have old league of imitations in our end of the business in broadcasting.

5395
02:47:28.821 --> 02:47:29.630
Okay.

5396
02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:30.590
But um,

5397
02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:34.520
there no snare drum and high hat nor is there for Howard.

5398
02:47:34.730 --> 02:47:35.563
You follow?

5399
02:47:36.110 --> 02:47:36.901
He,

5400
02:47:36.901 --> 02:47:38.420
he's very,

5401
02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:40.011
again,

5402
02:47:40.011 --> 02:47:41.300
I start with the music.

5403
02:47:41.870 --> 02:47:46.870
I start with the ambiance and if humor arises or personalities arise or we have

5404
02:47:48.231 --> 02:47:48.531
guests,

5405
02:47:48.531 --> 02:47:48.831
great.

5406
02:47:48.831 --> 02:47:49.191
If we don't,

5407
02:47:49.191 --> 02:47:50.030
that's fine too.

5408
02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:51.733
Um,

5409
02:47:52.390 --> 02:47:53.150
uh,

5410
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:55.370
and I think they expected other,

5411
02:47:56.300 --> 02:47:59.190
what I showed up with was it,

5412
02:47:59.191 --> 02:48:00.650
it also ranged,

5413
02:48:01.100 --> 02:48:02.150
uh,

5414
02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:03.680
it wasn't always funny.

5415
02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:04.580
Mm.

5416
02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:05.150
Okay.

5417
02:48:05.150 --> 02:48:08.810
Do you think that it was just maybe something you would have excelled at if they

5418
02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:10.190
had different expectations?

5419
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:12.230
Like instead of following Howard stern it,

5420
02:48:12.231 --> 02:48:13.540
they just did this David Lee Ross,

5421
02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:14.450
you bet.

5422
02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:15.560
Do you think you'd still be doing it?

5423
02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:16.593
Uh,

5424
02:48:16.900 --> 02:48:17.630
yes.

5425
02:48:17.630 --> 02:48:18.200
Really?

5426
02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:18.860
Yeah.

5427
02:48:18.860 --> 02:48:19.520
Wow.

5428
02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:19.880
Yeah.

5429
02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:22.010
Their expectations was the funny,

5430
02:48:22.011 --> 02:48:23.540
the funny interview.

5431
02:48:23.541 --> 02:48:26.540
The guests have pop culture,

5432
02:48:26.541 --> 02:48:29.090
funny guests and the subject matter.

5433
02:48:29.091 --> 02:48:32.540
Just as we've touched on subjects here that are hilarious and subjects that are

5434
02:48:32.541 --> 02:48:33.370
pretty dense.

5435
02:48:33.370 --> 02:48:33.760
Yeah,

5436
02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:33.951
it was,

5437
02:48:33.951 --> 02:48:34.500
I call it,

5438
02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:36.890
you're just going to detonate halfway down the turnpike.

5439
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:37.250
Oh,

5440
02:48:37.250 --> 02:48:38.330
that's what he fucking meant.

5441
02:48:39.210 --> 02:48:41.570
It's not stuff that's going to go away real quick.

5442
02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:41.871
Do you,

5443
02:48:41.871 --> 02:48:43.160
have you thought about doing that now?

5444
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:46.490
Like what if apple came to you or one of these streaming services came to you

5445
02:48:46.491 --> 02:48:47.660
and wanting to do something like that?

5446
02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:50.720
They always arrive with expectations

5447
02:48:52.250 --> 02:48:54.860
and the expectations.

5448
02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:56.630
Just as we discussed,

5449
02:48:56.631 --> 02:48:59.390
three phases of Anna Nicole Smith and Elvis.

5450
02:48:59.870 --> 02:49:01.460
Which Dave are you referring to?

5451
02:49:02.890 --> 02:49:03.110
Well,

5452
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:05.420
I just think it just with someone like you.

5453
02:49:05.450 --> 02:49:06.860
I mean I'm not a program director,

5454
02:49:06.861 --> 02:49:07.830
but if I was,

5455
02:49:07.890 --> 02:49:07.980
I

5456
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:09.600
<v 5>would say just let him be him.</v>

5457
02:49:09.810 --> 02:49:10.710
Just figure it out.

5458
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:11.551
Just let it,

5459
02:49:11.551 --> 02:49:12.750
give it time to grow.

5460
02:49:13.210 --> 02:49:14.250
That's what people don't do.

5461
02:49:14.251 --> 02:49:15.084
The metal,

5462
02:49:15.330 --> 02:49:16.200
the metal,

5463
02:49:16.230 --> 02:49:16.861
they are like,

5464
02:49:16.861 --> 02:49:17.671
you're going to do,

5465
02:49:17.671 --> 02:49:19.800
I look from what I know of you,

5466
02:49:20.010 --> 02:49:23.070
you're going to do your best at everything.

5467
02:49:23.610 --> 02:49:24.960
Everything you do,

5468
02:49:24.990 --> 02:49:26.190
you're going to do your best.

5469
02:49:26.250 --> 02:49:27.330
If I was going to hire you,

5470
02:49:27.570 --> 02:49:28.350
that's what I would say.

5471
02:49:28.350 --> 02:49:29.760
Everybody get the fuck away from him.

5472
02:49:30.090 --> 02:49:33.810
He's going to do his best now let them hire who he wants to hire and do what he

5473
02:49:33.811 --> 02:49:36.510
wants to do and put what he wants to put on and let him figure it out.

5474
02:49:36.810 --> 02:49:38.220
But you hired David Lee Roth,

5475
02:49:38.221 --> 02:49:41.000
he didn't hire Mike Fitzgerald and,

5476
02:49:41.001 --> 02:49:41.321
and,

5477
02:49:41.321 --> 02:49:42.660
and Ken Buchanan,

5478
02:49:42.661 --> 02:49:44.700
whatever the fuck the other people are that work in the office.

5479
02:49:44.701 --> 02:49:46.110
It also wants to just in the soup.

5480
02:49:46.410 --> 02:49:46.831
No,

5481
02:49:46.831 --> 02:49:48.270
you hired David Lee Roth.

5482
02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:51.540
Let David Lee Roth Be David Lee Roth and let him find his legs.

5483
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:57.210
<v 2>That's a difficult entity because it comes with a lot of history.</v>

5484
02:49:57.330 --> 02:49:58.163
Yeah.

5485
02:49:58.320 --> 02:49:58.651
You know,

5486
02:49:58.651 --> 02:49:59.910
and then the people will start,

5487
02:49:59.911 --> 02:50:01.260
folks will start conducting.

5488
02:50:01.290 --> 02:50:02.123
Wow,

5489
02:50:02.130 --> 02:50:03.390
you gotta play this.

5490
02:50:03.391 --> 02:50:04.480
You got a plate.

5491
02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:08.400
And it has very specific expectation usually.

5492
02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:09.383
However,

5493
02:50:09.540 --> 02:50:11.580
in this age there's a lot,

5494
02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:12.600
a lot of freedoms.

5495
02:50:12.601 --> 02:50:13.434
There's a lot of,

5496
02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:14.693
uh,

5497
02:50:15.010 --> 02:50:15.451
you know,

5498
02:50:15.451 --> 02:50:18.660
what you're discussing is something that I think about occasional.

5499
02:50:18.690 --> 02:50:20.880
So it seems like something you'd be open to nail home,

5500
02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:22.140
get you a job.

5501
02:50:22.140 --> 02:50:23.670
Just from this particular interview,

5502
02:50:23.850 --> 02:50:25.320
I would be very open to it.

5503
02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:26.753
Um,

5504
02:50:27.060 --> 02:50:27.421
I,

5505
02:50:27.421 --> 02:50:28.254
uh,

5506
02:50:29.370 --> 02:50:29.611
you know,

5507
02:50:29.611 --> 02:50:32.190
they've approached me before to talk about it.

5508
02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:33.593
Um,

5509
02:50:33.870 --> 02:50:36.420
my interest in music is diverse,

5510
02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:38.070
but it's energized.

5511
02:50:38.430 --> 02:50:39.330
Switched on.

5512
02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:41.700
Henry Rollins of course,

5513
02:50:42.010 --> 02:50:44.620
<v 5>does his own radio show and he picks his own pelly list.</v>

5514
02:50:44.621 --> 02:50:48.730
It's like one of the last few things that a person like him who is able to do

5515
02:50:48.731 --> 02:50:49.480
like that,

5516
02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:51.040
and he does it once he once a week.

5517
02:50:51.041 --> 02:50:51.430
Right.

5518
02:50:51.430 --> 02:50:52.263
Does it,

5519
02:50:52.510 --> 02:50:53.440
and he's going one night a week.

5520
02:50:53.441 --> 02:50:54.850
He does and he loves it.

5521
02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:55.291
<v 2>I mean,</v>

5522
02:50:55.291 --> 02:50:58.830
something else that people have approached me for is a writing a column.

5523
02:50:59.610 --> 02:51:02.700
Some of the good magazines have approached me,

5524
02:51:02.701 --> 02:51:06.510
big ones about becoming a writer and interesting to you.

5525
02:51:06.660 --> 02:51:07.230
You Bet.

5526
02:51:07.230 --> 02:51:07.531
Yeah.

5527
02:51:07.531 --> 02:51:08.310
It seems like it would be,

5528
02:51:08.310 --> 02:51:09.440
you bet it's a,

5529
02:51:09.470 --> 02:51:10.231
it's a different,

5530
02:51:10.231 --> 02:51:10.860
uh,

5531
02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:12.140
sound when we,

5532
02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:12.750
right.

5533
02:51:12.750 --> 02:51:13.140
Yeah,

5534
02:51:13.140 --> 02:51:13.860
no,

5535
02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:14.820
it's a,

5536
02:51:15.810 --> 02:51:17.880
it's in a bit of a different voice.

5537
02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:18.781
It's,

5538
02:51:18.781 --> 02:51:19.614
um,

5539
02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:23.970
my sense of humor comes out of it a little bit more in terms of darkness.

5540
02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:28.230
I remember reading an article in New York magazine's far bags,

5541
02:51:28.231 --> 02:51:33.231
1968 I don't remember the elements of the fellow was the theater critic for New

5542
02:51:34.470 --> 02:51:38.130
York magazine and the title was in defense of booing.

5543
02:51:38.890 --> 02:51:39.723
Huh.

5544
02:51:40.620 --> 02:51:41.453
Interesting.

5545
02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:43.620
Is Why do we always ask to tolerate clapping,

5546
02:51:43.621 --> 02:51:45.150
especially for shitty performances.

5547
02:51:45.750 --> 02:51:49.470
There's the clapper who claps because they're part of the gang and there's the

5548
02:51:49.471 --> 02:51:50.251
clapper yells,

5549
02:51:50.251 --> 02:51:50.761
Bravo.

5550
02:51:50.761 --> 02:51:52.080
So that they exist.

5551
02:51:52.081 --> 02:51:52.914
I am heard.

5552
02:51:55.020 --> 02:51:56.190
And he talks about how,

5553
02:51:56.191 --> 02:51:56.490
you know,

5554
02:51:56.490 --> 02:52:01.490
he gets thrown out of an opera for booing and everybody knew a theater critic

5555
02:52:01.861 --> 02:52:02.910
for 36 years.

5556
02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:03.690
Ah,

5557
02:52:03.690 --> 02:52:05.310
at New York magazine.

5558
02:52:05.500 --> 02:52:06.333
Wow.

5559
02:52:06.420 --> 02:52:09.280
And it always a permit booing and I support that.

5560
02:52:09.670 --> 02:52:10.450
Wow.

5561
02:52:10.450 --> 02:52:11.650
America stands alone.

5562
02:52:11.830 --> 02:52:15.280
Well that Kinda sneak Shin,

5563
02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:18.940
not just a zip as a form of negative targeting.

5564
02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:20.230
Okay.

5565
02:52:20.230 --> 02:52:21.730
But as a form of elevating,

5566
02:52:22.610 --> 02:52:23.443
you dig,

5567
02:52:23.770 --> 02:52:27.160
you don't go to the golf swing guy put on all the electrodes,

5568
02:52:27.370 --> 02:52:30.790
they do the slow motion things or you can go your gray Joe.

5569
02:52:30.791 --> 02:52:31.091
No,

5570
02:52:31.091 --> 02:52:32.530
he wants to go see your wrist.

5571
02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:33.300
Right,

5572
02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:34.133
right.

5573
02:52:34.560 --> 02:52:37.100
So what you're doing with the elbow and making them mistake.

5574
02:52:37.170 --> 02:52:38.010
Exactly.

5575
02:52:38.200 --> 02:52:39.670
He's there to identify the flaw,

5576
02:52:39.730 --> 02:52:40.300
right?

5577
02:52:40.300 --> 02:52:41.560
If there's no flaws,

5578
02:52:42.040 --> 02:52:42.910
there's no booing.

5579
02:52:43.350 --> 02:52:43.670
You know,

5580
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:44.840
a lot of folks are going to go,

5581
02:52:45.250 --> 02:52:45.911
Jesus,

5582
02:52:45.911 --> 02:52:46.181
man,

5583
02:52:46.181 --> 02:52:46.421
you,

5584
02:52:46.421 --> 02:52:48.010
you concentrate on the negative.

5585
02:52:48.250 --> 02:52:51.010
I love booing as much as going,

5586
02:52:51.011 --> 02:52:51.700
Yay.

5587
02:52:51.700 --> 02:52:52.630
In fact,

5588
02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:58.500
I can think of certain heavy metal records that we could discuss on the airplane

5589
02:52:58.901 --> 02:53:00.040
from La to New York.

5590
02:53:00.041 --> 02:53:01.270
That's five hour flight.

5591
02:53:01.570 --> 02:53:02.590
And I could discuss though,

5592
02:53:02.591 --> 02:53:04.300
record endlessly as long as we're going,

5593
02:53:04.301 --> 02:53:05.134
boo.

5594
02:53:06.260 --> 02:53:08.110
If we're discussing what's wrong with it,

5595
02:53:08.350 --> 02:53:09.700
you can go for five hours.

5596
02:53:10.420 --> 02:53:11.620
What's great about it?

5597
02:53:11.650 --> 02:53:13.600
How long are you going to sustain that 20 minutes.

5598
02:53:14.620 --> 02:53:14.920
Ah,

5599
02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:16.390
it's really smart

5600
02:53:18.130 --> 02:53:18.963
and smart.

5601
02:53:23.710 --> 02:53:24.543
The

5602
02:53:25.920 --> 02:53:26.860
criticism,

5603
02:53:26.861 --> 02:53:27.161
you know,

5604
02:53:27.161 --> 02:53:28.570
identifying the flies,

5605
02:53:28.571 --> 02:53:29.404
not negative,

5606
02:53:29.620 --> 02:53:30.170
right?

5607
02:53:30.170 --> 02:53:31.890
I'm having a bell over here.

5608
02:53:32.620 --> 02:53:33.310
Your days.

5609
02:53:33.310 --> 02:53:35.080
It's sort of a good example.

5610
02:53:35.081 --> 02:53:37.060
As Ed Wood's monster movies,

5611
02:53:37.270 --> 02:53:38.440
you see the string,

5612
02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:39.550
you see the smoke,

5613
02:53:39.551 --> 02:53:41.380
you see the flying saucer,

5614
02:53:41.381 --> 02:53:42.220
it looks fake.

5615
02:53:42.250 --> 02:53:42.780
That's a,

5616
02:53:42.780 --> 02:53:44.650
that you feel smugly superior.

5617
02:53:45.130 --> 02:53:47.080
You look at that thing that's,

5618
02:53:47.081 --> 02:53:47.740
you know,

5619
02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:48.700
it's a form of booing.

5620
02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.770
Yeah.

5621
02:53:49.770 --> 02:53:50.530
You know,

5622
02:53:50.530 --> 02:53:51.670
now today,

5623
02:53:51.671 --> 02:53:53.260
if it was people weren't doing that,

5624
02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:55.300
you wouldn't have black panther.

5625
02:53:55.330 --> 02:53:56.870
You wouldn't have spider man.

5626
02:53:57.190 --> 02:54:02.190
You wouldn't have Avengers and all the amazing special effects and CGI and

5627
02:54:02.231 --> 02:54:03.990
everything because it's high expectations.

5628
02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:05.110
It's just somebody going,

5629
02:54:05.111 --> 02:54:06.010
I see the string.

5630
02:54:06.030 --> 02:54:06.580
Right,

5631
02:54:06.580 --> 02:54:07.180
right.

5632
02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:07.810
Yeah.

5633
02:54:07.810 --> 02:54:08.643
Joe.

5634
02:54:09.850 --> 02:54:10.181
Yeah.

5635
02:54:10.181 --> 02:54:10.930
All right.

5636
02:54:10.930 --> 02:54:13.270
Let me invent computers and I'll get back to you.

5637
02:54:14.620 --> 02:54:15.251
David Lee Roth.

5638
02:54:15.251 --> 02:54:16.270
We just did three hours.

5639
02:54:16.530 --> 02:54:20.020
He believed that time flies when you don't know what you'd do with Joe.

5640
02:54:20.020 --> 02:54:20.920
You know what you're doing.

5641
02:54:21.750 --> 02:54:22.960
Sly Son of a bitch.

5642
02:54:22.990 --> 02:54:24.490
Doing nothing means a lot to me.

5643
02:54:24.491 --> 02:54:26.200
Did we really nail three hours?

5644
02:54:26.201 --> 02:54:29.840
Really did tell people one more time about your product line and where,

5645
02:54:29.880 --> 02:54:34.000
what website it is the original and please say it that Way Inc.

5646
02:54:34.210 --> 02:54:36.190
The original in the original,

5647
02:54:36.220 --> 02:54:37.960
not the metric enough ink.

5648
02:54:38.020 --> 02:54:39.130
The original.

5649
02:54:39.131 --> 02:54:39.850
She's pretty.

5650
02:54:39.850 --> 02:54:40.320
That's really it.

5651
02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:42.230
Go get a pretty good set shit.

5652
02:54:42.430 --> 02:54:44.710
We make it for everybody who's got ink,

5653
02:54:45.070 --> 02:54:47.110
anybody who's got tattoos and stuff.

5654
02:54:47.300 --> 02:54:50.320
Virtually everything that you're going to use in boot wire,

5655
02:54:50.330 --> 02:54:50.951
the bathroom,

5656
02:54:50.951 --> 02:54:52.180
anything here putting the locker,

5657
02:54:52.450 --> 02:54:54.190
but especially that brightener man,

5658
02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:59.550
that stuff's the shit dad that will read bome no more rubbing it with your

5659
02:54:59.951 --> 02:55:00.320
finger,

5660
02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:03.040
etc. And we've got a whole product line coming in.

5661
02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:03.620
Laughter.

5662
02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:04.010
When is the

5663
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:05.090
<v 1>name of the company today?</v>

5664
02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:07.270
I'm going to order a bunch of shit so you don't have to order it.

5665
02:55:07.271 --> 02:55:08.210
We'll have it delivered.

5666
02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:09.410
I'm going to order just because I love you.

5667
02:55:09.530 --> 02:55:11.180
God bless David Lee Roth.

5668
02:55:11.181 --> 02:55:12.700
You're a bad motherfucker coming,

5669
02:55:13.850 --> 02:55:14.450
Joe.

5670
02:55:14.450 --> 02:55:16.460
That's a very special belt to wear.

5671
02:55:16.490 --> 02:55:16.791
Thank you,

5672
02:55:16.791 --> 02:55:17.624
sir.

5673
02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:18.741
David Lee Roth,

5674
02:55:18.741 --> 02:55:19.574
ladies and gentlemen.

5675
02:55:19.850 --> 02:55:20.160
<v 0>Goodnight.</v>
