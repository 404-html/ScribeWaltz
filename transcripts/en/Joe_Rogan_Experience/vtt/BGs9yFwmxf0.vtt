00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches are doing the same kind of things that had gotten like you</v>

2
00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:05.860
<v Speaker 1>would do.</v>

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what they think.</v>

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.953
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the case.</v>

6
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>What is the big difference between body</v>

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 2>builders allergic as a high purpose each 40 do you have high reputations in</v>

8
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:16.850
<v Speaker 2>night?</v>

9
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 2>You know they eat different and they take other things different to get very</v>

10
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>

11
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 2>And then we don't want to get vague or just like we want to stay in the smallest</v>

12
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 2>weight class we can and get as strong as it was the same.</v>

13
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:26.881
<v Speaker 2>Big and strong,</v>

14
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:27.181
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>

15
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:28.014
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>

16
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 2>So we just want to be strong.</v>

17
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 2>So everything we do is not to build larger muscle.</v>

18
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Like I've worked with track people,</v>

19
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.123
<v Speaker 2>mostly girls.</v>

20
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to put 10 pounds,</v>

21
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 2>actually bodyweight,</v>

22
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 2>almost 10 pounds of extra weight that it had to overcome.</v>

23
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Gravity run down a track,</v>

24
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

25
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 2>So we keep keep your body weight to a minimum,</v>

26
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 2>you know the muscle mass.</v>

27
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 2>We just want to make it strong.</v>

28
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to get bigger to be shown.</v>

29
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 1>That's confusing to a lot of people.</v>

30
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of people think of big muscles meaning stronger and that's the only</v>

31
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:54.561
<v Speaker 1>way to get stronger.</v>

32
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>But I've seen some people and power lifting competitions,</v>

33
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>it just lift insane amounts of weight and they're not that big.</v>

34
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Well how is that possible?</v>

35
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.943
<v Speaker 2>But muscle type,</v>

36
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:04.550
<v Speaker 2>you're always talking about you.</v>

38
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.430
<v Speaker 2>I've always mentioned you a few times.</v>

39
00:01:06.431 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 2>You talk about like a wooly as [inaudible].</v>

40
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.600
<v Speaker 2>He runs out of gas real quick.</v>

41
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.673
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

42
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.491
<v Speaker 2>Tyrone?</v>

43
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Tyron Woodley.</v>

44
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 2>He has the same,</v>

46
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:16.300
<v Speaker 2>they've got a pretty,</v>

47
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 2>pretty much the same amount of muscle mass.</v>

48
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 2>He just has very fast,</v>

49
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:23.230
<v Speaker 2>which muscle and our guy you're talking about an endorsed may have board slow</v>

50
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:25.630
<v Speaker 2>twitch muscle and then so that that guy,</v>

51
00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:27.640
<v Speaker 2>that's why he can fight five rounds and Tyrone,</v>

52
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 2>where to start from where out somewhere in the second round.</v>

53
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also because a guy like Tyron is capable of putting out so much</v>

54
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:35.141
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

55
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:38.650
<v Speaker 1>like the way he can attack us and move so fast.</v>

56
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like having a 500 horsepower engine versus having a 400 horsepower.</v>

57
00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>One's going to just use [inaudible]</v>

58
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.660
<v Speaker 2>gaps.</v>

59
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

60
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Well just fashion.</v>

61
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 2>That's what you've got sprinters and you've got marathon runners and it looked</v>

62
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:50.744
<v Speaker 2>totally different.</v>

63
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And so when someone looks at a bodybuilder and they see this guy just covered in</v>

65
00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:55.721
<v Speaker 1>muscles,</v>

66
00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 1>they assume that guy would be able to lift a ton of weights.</v>

67
00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.980
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part,</v>

68
00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>those guys can't lift nearly as much weight as a guy like you can.</v>

69
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.723
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

70
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

71
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy to people.</v>

72
00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Like that doesn't even make sense.</v>

73
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

74
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of things are crazy.</v>

75
00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:08.971
<v Speaker 2>People do,</v>

76
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:09.251
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

77
00:02:09.251 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 2>aren't in and note came up.</v>

78
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 2>What were Michigan,</v>

79
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:13.780
<v Speaker 2>what about this anabolic steroids?</v>

80
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

81
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 2>does it frustrate you?</v>

82
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 2>The disc lack of understanding the general public has about this stuff?</v>

83
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.933
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

84
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

85
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.433
<v Speaker 2>you ever,</v>

86
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 2>you ever look at the Olympics?</v>

87
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

88
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.140
<v Speaker 2>we look at are weight lifters,</v>

89
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Olympic weight lifters.</v>

90
00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:28.960
<v Speaker 2>We don't go to the Olympics.</v>

91
00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I hope we never do hope.</v>

92
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I live to never get any letters.</v>

93
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.910
<v Speaker 2>They were sending the worst.</v>

94
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.743
<v Speaker 2>It's if there's ever,</v>

95
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 2>but they said our,</v>

96
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.930
<v Speaker 2>when the team,</v>

97
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.591
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty bad.</v>

98
00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Speaker 2>We can't get a guy on the 18 all right.</v>

99
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.880
<v Speaker 2>And they're just not very good.</v>

100
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.130
<v Speaker 2>You look at our women gymnastics people,</v>

101
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 2>they're extremely strong.</v>

102
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 2>They blew her out of the water.</v>

103
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.150
<v Speaker 2>You go to China,</v>

104
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.170
<v Speaker 2>they're male weight lifters and female archery ministry muscular and he killed</v>

105
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 2>her body.</v>

106
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 2>But your gym's look pathetic.</v>

107
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 2>It's because they're all in different systems.</v>

108
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:55.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

109
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 2>there you got better coaches and,</v>

110
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 2>and better systems that take stuff.</v>

111
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.093
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

112
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>American doesn't have good Olympic</v>

113
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.793
<v Speaker 2>power lifters,</v>

114
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Olympic weightlifters,</v>

115
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 2>weightlifters.</v>

116
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 2>We rolled the world pout of Jews in this country.</v>

117
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 2>America went into twos are not very good.</v>

118
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>They're not now terrible.</v>

119
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

120
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

121
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.251
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that.</v>

122
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 2>There was one girl what got a bronze in Olympic.</v>

123
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 2>One girl got a bronze.</v>

124
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.360
<v Speaker 2>We and my sport,</v>

125
00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 2>there's 12 male way classes.</v>

126
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

127
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 2>we hold seven of the total records.</v>

128
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 2>My Jim Holtz too.</v>

129
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

130
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.161
<v Speaker 2>and women,</v>

131
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>there's 10 weight classes.</v>

132
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 2>America holds nine of the 10 and my Jim holds five.</v>

133
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 2>I have the strongest male power lifter have ever lived,</v>

134
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

135
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 2>And the best and the strongest female.</v>

136
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.030
<v Speaker 2>It'll vary.</v>

137
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.863
<v Speaker 2>Same Gym.</v>

138
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Now what about shit late?</v>

139
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Those strongest men contests?</v>

140
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

141
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 2>well there's strong as guys,</v>

142
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 2>but that's a different thing entirely as well.</v>

143
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 2>It's another defense.</v>

144
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Like boxing is different than him in May.</v>

145
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

146
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 2>More,</v>

147
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.170

151
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.733

161
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Pakia I think you shouldn't have your key.</v>

162
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Might've been a,</v>

163
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

164
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

165
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

166
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.170
<v Speaker 1>white tie champions that right?</v>

167
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.411
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

168
00:04:13.411 --> 00:04:14.244
<v Speaker 1>Chris Algae area.</v>

169
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

170
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

171
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.241
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

172
00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:15.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

173
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.871
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

174
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:16.581
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>

175
00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:17.690
<v Speaker 1>a kickboxing champion.</v>

176
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>One time to put work has a name.</v>

177
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.780
<v Speaker 1>So what's the fuck is his name?</v>

178
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.293
<v Speaker 1>Samsung,</v>

179
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.031
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name,</v>

180
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:24.864
<v Speaker 1>but there was the guy that,</v>

181
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.900
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy that John Claude van Damme was always supposed to fight.</v>

182
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.110
<v Speaker 1>John Claude van Damme pretends is going to have a fight.</v>

183
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.650
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have a kickboxing fight with,</v>

184
00:04:31.651 --> 00:04:32.940
<v Speaker 1>this is Thai guy.</v>

185
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 1>But that guy won a world title as a Meu tie fighter and as a boxer.</v>

186
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:37.631
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

187
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:38.520
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty rare,</v>

188
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.660
<v Speaker 1>but I agree with you.</v>

189
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.940
<v Speaker 1>But now like what would be the difference?</v>

190
00:04:41.941 --> 00:04:42.181
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

191
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:45.090
<v Speaker 1>like if you see like if you got a guy coming to you that wanted to win,</v>

192
00:04:45.091 --> 00:04:46.770
<v Speaker 1>like a strongest man competition,</v>

193
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.070
<v Speaker 1>that seems like something that would be right up your alley because you're so</v>

194
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.550
<v Speaker 1>good at preparing fighters and understanding the different demands of different</v>

195
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:54.384
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

196
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.330
<v Speaker 2>My friend and Finland's names car,</v>

197
00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.200
<v Speaker 2>he's got four guys and that Jim had debt of over 900 and they're all strong man</v>

198
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.910
<v Speaker 2>and he does well.</v>

199
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.080
<v Speaker 2>He trains a lot of Straw man.</v>

200
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.681
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

201
00:05:03.681 --> 00:05:04.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in to that,</v>

202
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 2>but told Tom and I that the one thing in each sprint would thousand pound</v>

203
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.493
<v Speaker 2>wheelbarrows,</v>

204
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 2>thousand pounds on the rhubarb.</v>

205
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.170
<v Speaker 2>We do a lot of wheelbarrow work and all of a sudden he carry heavy yoke.</v>

206
00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 2>So that's two of the primary things.</v>

207
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:17.630
<v Speaker 2>You get them to be strong in.</v>

208
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.913
<v Speaker 2>What's a yoke?</v>

209
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.671
<v Speaker 2>A Yoga thing,</v>

210
00:05:19.671 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 2>putting me back and you walk around with it like if you walked around,</v>

211
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.500
<v Speaker 2>we do a normal amount of walking loop.</v>

212
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.760
<v Speaker 2>What bars with a badge and change hanging off such an unstable cause.</v>

213
00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:29.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what you have to be.</v>

214
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.570
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

215
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be stable and unstable environment.</v>

216
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.700
<v Speaker 2>So they walk a half a mile stuff like,</v>

217
00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

218
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.050
<v Speaker 2>basketball or he gets his strong.</v>

219
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Is that why you like wheelbarrows?</v>

220
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's almost like a dead lift that you've got to kind of walk with going in</v>

221
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.500
<v Speaker 1>price or we'll get more typewriter.</v>

222
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't thought that really helped us up as plum color to clinch.</v>

223
00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

224
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.913
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

225
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.251
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

226
00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:54.251
<v Speaker 1>so did you come up with the idea of using wheel barrels for Gwar Berlin ninth</v>

227
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>1990 and it's something that looked to you</v>

228
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.020
<v Speaker 2>like a good unstable platform for that and it builds up your registry manager,</v>

229
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.750
<v Speaker 2>you're building up your back and,</v>

230
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>and grew up you he got to have a grip.</v>

231
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.661
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

232
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:06.494
<v Speaker 2>So and you know,</v>

233
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 2>most [inaudible] guys got great grips anyhow,</v>

234
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 2>but it builds up grip and it builds up all your muscles and your walking.</v>

235
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 2>See My,</v>

236
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

237
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys do strength and conditioning.</v>

238
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's got to be combined.</v>

239
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.890
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that much time because fighting is a treatment,</v>

240
00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:21.340
<v Speaker 2>a skill.</v>

241
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.590
<v Speaker 2>You need all your,</v>

242
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean the world's strongest man.</v>

243
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:25.321
<v Speaker 2>And he the dam,</v>

244
00:06:25.321 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 2>the MMA champion,</v>

245
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

246
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.961
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

247
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.470
<v Speaker 2>So I believe you got to straight then Kadesia st time.</v>

248
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 2>That's why we do so much outside walking.</v>

249
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.631
<v Speaker 2>We're doing heavy.</v>

250
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:32.841
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

251
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I carry not objects walking.</v>

252
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 2>She'll work conditioning and strength training.</v>
