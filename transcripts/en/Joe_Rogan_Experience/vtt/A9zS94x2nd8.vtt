1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches to call this my only master.</v>

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>The cold is my only teacher.</v>

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.860
<v Speaker 1>And the breathing.</v>

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.910
<v Speaker 1>When you say you altered your breathing pattern,</v>

5
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:11.101
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

6
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean exactly?</v>

7
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

8
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.343
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>when I went in at a certain point,</v>

10
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>I knew how to be,</v>

11
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:18.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:18.954
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

13
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.411
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>relaxed.</v>

15
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.401
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

16
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>went in and done latec a cold car,</v>

17
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.370
<v Speaker 1>impact a go within and then begin breathing deeper and then a certain dance</v>

18
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.900
<v Speaker 1>between the cold and you breathe,</v>

19
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>a breath begins to start up,</v>

20
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 1>begins to charge your body.</v>

21
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>And after 25 breaths like that,</v>

22
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>very conscious in the cold,</v>

23
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:53.271
<v Speaker 1>the cold is a forest and it has his impact and you go along with a cold and what</v>

24
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>it does in the Fisher on the physiology and you use your breathing.</v>

25
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Now I know what happens physiologically,</v>

26
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>but then those days it was all by feeling.</v>

27
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>And after it does happen physiologically or you become a fully charged,</v>

28
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.861
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

29
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>the carbon dioxide goes out,</v>

30
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

31
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.600
<v Speaker 1>oh to get begins to roam freely throughout the body and fields up every cell and</v>

32
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>the Ph levels go up.</v>

33
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Now when you,</v>

34
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>when you say you altered your breathing,</v>

35
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:24.471
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

36
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>what you're showing me here is just breathing in and breathing out.</v>

37
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Like what is split specifically different about that than normal breathing?</v>

38
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

39
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>the way I used it,</v>

40
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.453
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>W it was like after 25 breaths,</v>

42
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

43
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>it was so fully charged.</v>

44
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.013
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

45
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.363
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

46
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I could stay like five to seven minutes under the ice every time.</v>

47
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Very controlled.</v>

48
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>And that means that there is not only a whole lot of oxygen inside the body in</v>

49
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

50
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>but the Ph levels go up.</v>

51
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a,</v>

52
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>later on I began to understand by signs by,</v>

53
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>by thinking about it.</v>

54
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

55
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

57
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>the ducting and all that.</v>

58
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

59
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I saw that,</v>

60
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.813
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>that we are able to tap into the brainstem,</v>

62
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>the adrenaline we showed lying in bed,</v>

63
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>people producing more adrenalin.</v>

64
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Now I know how to show to people just in a couple of days.</v>

65
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>That means every listener right now is able to do that.</v>

66
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>So we have proven this scientifically and it showed that people lying in bed</v>

67
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.250
<v Speaker 1>were able to produce more adrenaline than somebody in fear going for its first</v>

68
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.533
<v Speaker 1>Pankaj jump,</v>

69
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.883
<v Speaker 1>bungee jump.</v>

70
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And when you're still,</v>

71
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm still confused as to how you're,</v>

72
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>you're doing anything differently other than deep breathing.</v>

73
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>You're taking a deep breathe in,</v>

74
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>deep breathe out.</v>

75
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>And now we retained from breathing after exhalation.</v>

76
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Retent uh,</v>

77
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.570
<v Speaker 1>we stopped breathing after acceleration.</v>

78
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Breathe in like,</v>

79
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.241
<v Speaker 1>show me the method,</v>

81
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:02.310
<v Speaker 1>like if a view,</v>

82
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>if you'll go with me all right at 30 times.</v>

83
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.703
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

84
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>go foully and we're once again fully in letting go</v>

85
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.620
<v Speaker 1>right on fully and but Latin go,</v>

86
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>not fully out chess in Europe,</v>

87
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.323
<v Speaker 1>but fully yet.</v>

88
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.953
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

89
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.273
<v Speaker 1>I want it to go,</v>

90
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

91
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>don't hesitate.</v>

92
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.363
<v Speaker 1>Give it.</v>

93
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>It's about changing the chemistry right now in your body.</v>

94
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>So I'm breathing.</v>

95
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:37.534
<v Speaker 1>If you keep going,</v>

96
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>you'll be cut.</v>

97
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Become lightheaded.</v>

98
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.120
<v Speaker 1>And at a certain point you're so fully charged and ph levels go to a very high</v>

99
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

100
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>You're able to stay without eh,</v>

101
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>in the long four minutes.</v>

102
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.073
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

103
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Just keep on that feeling is understanding.</v>

104
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.863
<v Speaker 1>Go on,</v>

105
00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Andy.</v>

106
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Plan lighting go deeply yet letting go deeply in and go 10 times more deeply in</v>

107
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>that didn't go deeply in letting go.</v>

108
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to time it laddering,</v>

109
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>go deeply and daddy go have it fully.</v>

110
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.073
<v Speaker 1>Take him in,</v>

111
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.133
<v Speaker 1>letting go.</v>

112
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.393
<v Speaker 1>Take Command,</v>

113
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>letting and go take him in ladder and go,</v>

114
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 1>no hesitation.</v>

115
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I do this with the ovary and Matt as well and it feels wonderful.</v>

116
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.053
<v Speaker 1>Day Command.</v>

117
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.101
<v Speaker 1>Who are they?</v>

118
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:39.934
<v Speaker 1>Letting go.</v>

119
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.361
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

120
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 1>five times more deeply and letting go.</v>

121
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Letting go deeply and let it go two times more.</v>

122
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Letting go and stop.</v>

123
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

124
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.120
<v Speaker 1>just top witness without and the lungs.</v>

125
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.780
<v Speaker 1>You are able to stay much more than normally that normally.</v>

126
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.101
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

127
00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Because we change.</v>

128
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:15.834
<v Speaker 1>He'll chemistry.</v>

129
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Carbon dioxide went out,</v>

130
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.560
<v Speaker 1>oh two went up,</v>

131
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.993
<v Speaker 1>failed up,</v>

132
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.970
<v Speaker 1>all the sounds and the Ph levels go up.</v>

133
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Then we are able to tap into their central nervous system and that Dan,</v>

134
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 1>that we got the brainstem and that's the place of the pineal gland.</v>

135
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Hypothalamus,</v>

136
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.240
<v Speaker 1>pituitary gland and the pineal gland makes the secretion of Adrenalin in</v>

137
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:43.410
<v Speaker 1>dangerous situations.</v>

138
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Normally we do not get into it because of of our shallow breathing,</v>

139
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.320
<v Speaker 1>but this is the way to get into the most primitive part of the reptilian brain</v>

140
00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>without many and fend off bacteria getting better into the endocrine systems.</v>

141
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>We talk about it later,</v>

142
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>you know pastor one one 10 in minutes and you're still on.</v>

143
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.870
<v Speaker 1>That shows that the capacity to fail yourself up with the oxygen,</v>

144
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more than we normally use and as we do not use it,</v>

145
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>we are not making use of the full capacity of our faith physiology.</v>

146
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Now we found out we got a different layers and we never use it and this is the</v>

147
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 1>way to learn to use it to tap in and bang into the primitive brain,</v>

148
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>into the endocrine systems,</v>

149
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>immune systems,</v>

150

<v Speaker 1>the way nature has mandate to be.</v>

152
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 1>If it would do like three rounds,</v>

153
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>you would go to three minutes,</v>

154
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 1>four minutes without air,</v>

155
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>without training.</v>

156
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 1>It only shows the capacity to store up oxygen inside.</v>

157
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 1>We never use that.</v>

158

<v Speaker 1>breathe,</v>

161
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.661
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to.</v>

162
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Force is only learning how to Oksana Joey's the body and the oldest south.</v>

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Two 30 Oh</v>

173
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

174
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>When you feel the urge to breathe,</v>

175
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 1>you breathe in fully and keep it for 10 15 seconds,</v>

176
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 1>then that's one round.</v>

177
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.163
<v Speaker 1>Boolean.</v>

178

<v Speaker 1>And keep it.</v>

179
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 1>And how will you press your belly?</v>

180
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 1>The neck and then the hat</v>

181
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.370
<v Speaker 1>and now you are able to tap into the brainstem.</v>

182
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

183
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:53.541
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

184
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:54.374
<v Speaker 1>That's him.</v>

185
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 1>If we would do it again,</v>

186
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.573
<v Speaker 1>you would.</v>

187
00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

189
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.600
<v Speaker 1>it was very light headed.</v>

190
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.690
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is that breathing the breathing in for sure.</v>

191
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 1>So w w two to explain to people at home,</v>

192
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing is I'm breathing in all the ways is deeply as I can,</v>

193
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not breathing out all the way.</v>

194
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm just breathing out a little bit and then I'm breathing in more and I'm just</v>

196
00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>reading out a little bit and I'm breathing in more and breathing out a little</v>

197
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:19.310
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

198
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

199
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>And if you breathe,</v>

200
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>breathe in completely,</v>

201
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 1>you got all the oxygen possible inside.</v>

202
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>If you're just allowed to go,</v>

203
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 1>then you get to,</v>

204
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:29.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

205
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 1>where the exchange of the gasses happen.</v>

206
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 1>And this is the way a bass to Oksana [inaudible] the body.</v>

207
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

208
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

209
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a different way to get into the chemistry of the body and where we have</v>

210
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:44.684
<v Speaker 1>shown this.</v>

211
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.460
