<v Speaker 2>we didn't need a camel.</v>

42
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

43
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

44
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met him there,</v>

45
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we start filming,</v>

46
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.170
<v Speaker 2>we're on the streets of Cairo and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

47
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>like all of a sudden is thrown into</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kitchens.</v>

48
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:57.620
<v Speaker 2>We were eating pigeon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 2>it's like go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cover them cooking pigeon.</v>

50
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 2>And I'd seen the show like maybe once</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

51
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:07.160
<v Speaker 2>but I knew who he was and I knew what</v>
<v Speaker 2>that adventure was,</v>

52
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was so amped for it.</v>

53
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there was this seminal moment</v>

54
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:18.581
<v Speaker 2>on that show where we go out and we'd go</v>
<v Speaker 2>ripping across the desert with the</v>

55
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Bedouin and go out and cook a goat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a in the ground,</v>

56
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.770
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

57
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 2>and so as we're driving out over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>desert,</v>

58
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:28.521
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

59
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:30.530
<v Speaker 2>we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need some shots from car to car.</v>

60
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:31.041
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

61
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on the roof,</v>

62
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

63
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 2>and there's like this for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason there's a four post bed</v>

64
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 2>tied to the roof of this land rover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I get up there and kind of like,</v>

65
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>latch my arm around it and these guys</v>

66
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:45.920
<v Speaker 2>take off at I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear,</v>

67
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.100
<v Speaker 2>80 miles an hour across the desert and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on a bed.</v>

68
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely no regard for the fact that</v>

69
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the roof,</v>

70
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm shooting.</v>

71
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when we got there we got to camp.</v>

72
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>I survived it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at this big black and blue where I</v>

73
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:10.490
<v Speaker 2>was holding onto the four post bed and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>go over and I show Tony and um,</v>

74
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 2>that was it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From that moment on,</v>

75
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked this guy and I started going out</v>

76
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:17.861
<v Speaker 2>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

77
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I started getting invited to do more</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>

78
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 2>So that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many years?</v>

79
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Ten years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

80
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Ten years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

81
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.460
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize that parts unknown was</v>

82
00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:30.091
<v Speaker 1>even an oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

83
00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:31.260
<v Speaker 1>you doing no reservations.</v>

84
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was a no reservation show and</v>

85
00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:36.200
<v Speaker 2>then we went to parts unknown five years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

86
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

87
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.930
<v Speaker 2>So parts of one has been on for five</v>
<v Speaker 2>years</v>

88
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 2>and that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.850
<v Speaker 2>that transition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

90
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 2>no reservation was great and it really</v>
<v Speaker 2>laid the foundation for what we do and</v>

91
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:52.370
<v Speaker 2>what Tony did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it really built an audience and</v>

92
00:03:52.371 --> 00:03:55.670
<v Speaker 2>a following for him and that's where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>found out about it.</v>

93
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.331
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

94
00:03:56.331 --> 00:03:58.100
<v Speaker 2>It was a great show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

95
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

96
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 2>like that transition going on to CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into parts unknown,</v>

97
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.080
<v Speaker 2>that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really changed things have really</v>

98
00:04:06.081 --> 00:04:11.030
<v Speaker 2>opened up a lot of locations and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we didn't have access to before.</v>

99
00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:17.471
<v Speaker 2>kind of CNNS logistics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Rolodex and you know,</v>

101
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.380
<v Speaker 2>things that we didn't have at the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>network,</v>

102
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.700
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

103
00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:24.170
<v Speaker 2>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.530
<v Speaker 2>no reservations was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did some incredible shows.</v>

105
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Parts unknown is where it got really</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

106
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was on another level.</v>

107
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching the chains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

110
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:39.430

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're probably a little bit leery of.</v>

121
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 2>CNN was Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

122
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.350
<v Speaker 2>go for it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Yourself,</v>

123
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's figure out what this is</v>

124
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

125
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really is amazing.</v>

126
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 1>And with one of the things that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>made that show was Tony's narration</v>

127
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>because the narration gave you a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the way his,</v>

128
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>his sort of passionate enthusiasm for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and for various aspects of</v>

129
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>cooking and travel and food and culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you got it through his own words,</v>

130
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

131
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

132
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe in some ways the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>important aspect of the show.</v>

133
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean he is after all a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

135
00:05:43.131 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

136
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 2>and I'm in that is how he experienced</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

137
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually making the shows and the</v>

138
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 2>technical part of actually making the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

139
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd once you go through and kind of</v>

140
00:05:56.621 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 2>edit the and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of that voiceover was in at the</v>

141
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 2>rough cut phase and then you send it out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him and get his writing back and</v>

142
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 2>record that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vo and I keep describing it is like that</v>

143
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:13.331
<v Speaker 2>kind of Dr. Frankenstein lightening bolt</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the temples kind of moment where like</v>

144
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>the monster rises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would really bring the show to life.</v>

145
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>So this kinda carcass that was laid out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in rough cut form on the table,</v>

146
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden just gasped and jumped</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and,</v>

147
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really beautiful to see that and</v>

148
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 2>to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 2>as a director,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a producer,</v>

150
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>as a creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 2>at any level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

152
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:39.521
<v Speaker 2>to have that kind of power to have his</v>
<v Speaker 2>voice and his writing and his</v>

153
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:43.390
<v Speaker 2>introspection and thoughts and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

154
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 2>that would have like powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful force to work with.</v>

155
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a brilliant design.</v>

156
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 1>The way the show is put together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that narration really did make it</v>

157
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>something special and different from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those other kinds of shows because it</v>

158
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.640
<v Speaker 1>just his articulate and insightful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetic and artistic view of these things</v>

159
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 1>that he had this infectious passion for</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

160
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>He completely changed the way I thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>about cooking.</v>

161
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I had always thought about cooking as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

162
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 1>this guy knows how to make delicious</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

163
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place has good ribs is.</v>

164
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>And then when I saw his show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I saw parts unknown,</v>

165
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

166
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 1>it's an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an art form that you eat.</v>

167
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely contemporary art form.</v>

168
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even beyond that,</v>

169
00:07:29.551 --> 00:07:33.960
<v Speaker 2>it's an art form that's in that taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and incorporating all of these greater</v>

170
00:07:33.961 --> 00:07:36.870
<v Speaker 2>kind of macro social elements of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:07:36.871 --> 00:07:39.660
<v Speaker 2>where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of where you are,</v>

172
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people did for a living,</v>

173
00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:44.700
<v Speaker 2>what people's ancestors did for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>living,</v>

174
00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:45.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

175
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rooted in so much more than what I</v>

176
00:07:48.961 --> 00:07:49.860
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately it feels like we kind of joke</v>

178
00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:53.670
<v Speaker 2>around a lot and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

179
00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:55.350
<v Speaker 2>it's the food shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a food show,</v>

180
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason that worked I think is</v>

181
00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:00.120
<v Speaker 2>because of what you're saying and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

182
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 2>the food food is an art form that</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporates all of these other aspects.</v>

183
00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:11.571
<v Speaker 2>And so it can be a jumping point off for</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration into anything you want to</v>

184
00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:14.250
<v Speaker 2>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm to talk to about the history of a</v>

185
00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:15.960
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the politics of a place,</v>

186
00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:17.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

187
00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:18.720
<v Speaker 2>the religion of a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

188
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.510
<v Speaker 2>all of these things that inform who</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are.</v>

189
00:08:21.511 --> 00:08:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Well that's all written into the cuisine</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a place or an area.</v>

190
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

191
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>and he was into stuff that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily even like high,</v>

192
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high dollar items.</v>

193
00:08:35.111 --> 00:08:37.600
<v Speaker 1>He was into like street food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

194
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just the finest French know</v>

195
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:46.530
<v Speaker 1>trolls where these celebrated world</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous chefs were cooking these bizarre</v>

196
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.960
<v Speaker 1>small plate sort of masterpieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

197
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:51.610
<v Speaker 1>he would love street tacos.</v>

198
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

199
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

200
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I think that kind of like a whole new</v>
<v Speaker 2>fresh take on looking at food,</v>

201
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:00.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

202
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

203
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:07.130
<v Speaker 2>to look at these kind of high end French</v>
<v Speaker 2>preparations is highly talented,</v>

204
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 2>highly trained French chefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

205
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's tremendous beauty in that and</v>

206
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 2>all of those other things we've talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

207
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:19.550
<v Speaker 2>But to look at the woman on the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:20.700
<v Speaker 2>the making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

209
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best,</v>

210
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lingua Tacos,</v>

211
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 2>that was revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the realization that all of</v>

212
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that greatness,</v>

213
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 2>all of that nuance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that flavor,</v>

214
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

215
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 2>contained right within there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was an access point to it as well.</v>

216
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 2>It's just an access point that everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>can afford that everyone can go and,</v>

217
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

218
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right place at the right time.</v>

219
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like the culture at large was</v>

220
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 2>ready for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready for that,</v>

221
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 2>like experience in food and ready to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of chase that because now that's,</v>

222
00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.190
<v Speaker 2>that's all anyone wants now.</v>

223
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because of him.</v>

224
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do because I'm sure that he</v>

225
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>changed the way I look at things for</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of food and I think he had that</v>

226
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:12.531
<v Speaker 1>effect on many people may think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many years was known for five and</v>

227
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>then no reservations for nine new</v>
<v Speaker 1>reservations.</v>

228
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for about 10.</v>

229
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:19.770
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a cook's tour before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

230
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.060
<v Speaker 1>so original all told a decade and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his influence on people's food</v>

231
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>choices and just appreciation for food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

232
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I know personally I've had some great</v>
<v Speaker 1>meals in restaurants,</v>

233
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 1>but some of my favorite meals had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stepping outside of a bar,</v>

234
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 1:30,</v>

235
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:40.100
<v Speaker 1>you got a little buzz on and some dudes</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a Taco truck and like,</v>

236
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.040
<v Speaker 1>oh baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you got over there?</v>

237
00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And my friend or in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

238
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:46.140
<v Speaker 1>it's late at night and there's a falafel</v>
<v Speaker 1>cart.</v>

239
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:48.890
<v Speaker 1>And some guys got a incredible kabobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

240
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.350
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about street food man.</v>

241
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

242
00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I kinda keep like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a loose running list of my favorite</v>

243
00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:58.910
<v Speaker 2>meals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

244
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.550
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of them are on the show and</v>

245
00:11:01.551 --> 00:11:06.551
<v Speaker 2>some of them are not on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd say most of them are that,</v>

246
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them are accidentally stumbling</v>

247
00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:13.370
<v Speaker 2>into someplace where someone's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>something completely awesome that isn't,</v>

248
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some massive 26 course tasting menu.</v>

249
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's also about,</v>

250
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about place,</v>

251
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about where you are,</v>

252
00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:27.530
<v Speaker 2>the context of where you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it smells like,</v>

253
00:11:27.531 --> 00:11:29.810
<v Speaker 2>what it sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it looks like,</v>

254
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

255
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.160
<v Speaker 2>who you're with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

256
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.360
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

257
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda,</v>

258
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.610
<v Speaker 2>I think another reason to show kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked is we had an opportunity to</v>

259
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:44.720
<v Speaker 2>architect or articulate all of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those elements,</v>

260
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:47.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are able to choose an incredibly</v>

261
00:11:47.751 --> 00:11:52.310
<v Speaker 2>interesting guests to sit down with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really interesting restaurant with,</v>

262
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooking over</v>

263
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 3>a really interesting backstory in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful place and uh,</v>

264
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 3>and then use the power of kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>magic of TV to,</v>

265
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Polish it up and present this version</v>

266
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:08.320
<v Speaker 3>of travel and food in the world that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

267
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.160
<v Speaker 1>really everywhere too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

268
00:12:10.161 --> 00:12:12.710
<v Speaker 1>you guys covered Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you covered Europe,</v>

269
00:12:12.711 --> 00:12:16.520
<v Speaker 1>you covered some weird places in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>south where people are cooking pigs in</v>

270
00:12:16.521 --> 00:12:18.350
<v Speaker 1>their backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

271
00:12:18.351 --> 00:12:19.230
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

272
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:24.350
<v Speaker 1>it gave people an understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation of food and a view to chefs</v>

273
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.970
<v Speaker 1>and this view of chefs as artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these chefs look like tattoo</v>

274
00:12:28.971 --> 00:12:30.260
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look like,</v>

275
00:12:30.261 --> 00:12:31.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys who are painters or something,</v>

276
00:12:31.941 --> 00:12:34.160
<v Speaker 1>or women who are sculptors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

277
00:12:34.161 --> 00:12:36.950
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're real similar in the way they,</v>

278
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.160
<v Speaker 1>they appear to what we consider artists.</v>

279
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

280
00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:42.840
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think too,</v>

281
00:12:42.841 --> 00:12:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

282
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I kind of love about like,</v>

283
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this point,</v>

284
00:12:48.121 --> 00:12:51.570
<v Speaker 3>spent a good amount of time in kitchens</v>
<v Speaker 3>and good around Mount of time around</v>

285
00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:54.810
<v Speaker 3>kitchen staff is there's kind of two</v>
<v Speaker 3>elements coming together.</v>

286
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.670
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>

287
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 3>the artistic element that you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

288
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also this very,</v>

289
00:13:01.321 --> 00:13:04.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very earnest working class kind of</v>

290
00:13:04.381 --> 00:13:07.140
<v Speaker 3>element to the way a kitchen works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

291
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.700
<v Speaker 3>it was tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>

292
00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:11.070
<v Speaker 3>sweaty work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

293
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.620
<v Speaker 3>it's a rough environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

294
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.340
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's kind of part of what</v>

295
00:13:17.341 --> 00:13:21.150
<v Speaker 3>makes it so appealing to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kind of pulled back the curtain on,</v>

296
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.830
<v Speaker 3>on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

297
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.650
<v Speaker 3>let's say like these guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

298
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.100
<v Speaker 3>these guys are not these inaccessible</v>
<v Speaker 3>icons though.</v>

299
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Paul bocuse of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

300
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:34.290
<v Speaker 3>they are um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as Paul bocuse is awesome,</v>

301
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are these kind of rough and tumble,</v>

302
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that are back there making</v>

303
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:42.450
<v Speaker 3>something really awesome.</v>

304
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Tony also had this sort of punk rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensibility to it all to you know,</v>

305
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.080
<v Speaker 1>mean that was part of the thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>him that people found appealing is that</v>

306
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.770
<v Speaker 1>they had seen cooking shows before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they never saw cooking shows where</v>

307
00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:57.060
<v Speaker 1>the host gets fucked up.</v>

308
00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

309
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.160
<v Speaker 3>I was first time I partnered with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

310
00:14:01.161 --> 00:14:04.280
<v Speaker 3>this guy goes so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>

312
00:14:06.381 --> 00:14:08.240
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe he can do this all the</v>

313
00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:10.280
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think one of them</v>

314
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:15.030
<v Speaker 1>first times we ever got hung out</v>
<v Speaker 1>together was in Montreal.</v>

315
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 1>We were there for UFC fights and we went</v>
<v Speaker 1>out afterwards and got.</v>

316
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.560
<v Speaker 1>We had some steaks and it was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing walking into this restaurant and</v>

317
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:25.080
<v Speaker 1>people freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy actually had a copy of kitchen</v>

318
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:28.950
<v Speaker 1>confidential in the actual kitchen</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and had tony sign it.</v>

319
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.660
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fucking</v>

<v Speaker 1>wine and they were cooking on a wood</v>
<v Speaker 1>stove.</v>

345
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.470
<v Speaker 1>not really a performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an agreement that you're going</v>

346

<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go there and you're</v>

347
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:52.760
<v Speaker 1>going to share this enthusiasm for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience together and you're going to</v>

348
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:57.200
<v Speaker 1>try to enhance it with your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>anecdotes and personality and your own</v>

349
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.980
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for the food and the wine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then afterwards they're smoking</v>

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.170
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a shack on a frozen lake with,</v>

354
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.370
<v Speaker 2>with people who understand that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>an elegance to all of these things,</v>

355
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:20.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can create an environment that,</v>

356
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 2>that has an elegance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

357
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that's like a hallmark of a lot</v>

358
00:16:24.381 --> 00:16:26.790
<v Speaker 2>of the chefs that I've met through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show is like,</v>

359
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.080
<v Speaker 2>you will see that no matter how big they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

360
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.110
<v Speaker 2>no matter how successful there is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>inherent kind of desire to please on</v>

361
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.250
<v Speaker 2>multiple levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

362
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 2>you'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I remember we were in a Daniel</v>

363
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Boulud's house in France or did his</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents house.</v>

364
00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>

365
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Ballou like the mega chef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366

<v Speaker 2>crew members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have something to eat,</v>

<v Speaker 2>exactly what you're talking about.</v>

431
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.800
<v Speaker 1>genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique person.</v>

432
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Like is it genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rare person?</v>

433
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.490

434
00:20:01.491 --> 00:20:03.950
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I got out of being.</v>

435
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Being able to spend some time with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being able to talk to him and pick</v>

436
00:20:09.891 --> 00:20:12.740
<v Speaker 1>his brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did my podcast once and we always</v>

437
00:20:12.741 --> 00:20:15.680
<v Speaker 1>planned on doing it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we never got around to it because</v>

438
00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:19.670
<v Speaker 1>we're both have ridiculous schedules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just my,</v>

439
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I would think about things differently</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of him.</v>

440
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Like my eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would sometimes hold things to his</v>

441
00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:32.411
<v Speaker 1>standards and he me like legitimately is</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for things and his</v>

442
00:20:33.921 --> 00:20:36.710
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm for things changed the way I</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at a lot,</v>

443
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.000
<v Speaker 1>a lot of aspects of food and culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

444
00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:41.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even travel,</v>

445
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.960
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

448
00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.160

<v Speaker 2>and that was that experience in Montana</v>

449
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:55.220

453
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.410
<v Speaker 2>it's been a rough three months and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>still hard for me to really</v>

454
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:08.620
<v Speaker 2>contextualize it and put it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like,</v>

455
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upside down world,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And he was such a,</v>

457
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a friend and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborator,</v>

458
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:20.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also just such an icon to me,</v>

459
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.450
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

460
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

461
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:27.460
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

462
00:21:27.461 --> 00:21:29.460
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like the sun disappears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

463
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that is so just</v>

464
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:36.150
<v Speaker 2>inherently part of life they're in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dependable and you know.</v>

465
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

466
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's been all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to describe how,</v>

467
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.920
<v Speaker 2>how profound that span.</v>

468
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he got into Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got psyched because I'm like,</v>

471
00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.920
<v Speaker 1>he was always asking about things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

472
00:22:00.921 --> 00:22:03.230
<v Speaker 1>he's really good at things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when we were in Montana,</v>

473
00:22:03.231 --> 00:22:06.020
<v Speaker 1>we were rolling around on the dirt</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder stuff.</v>

474
00:22:06.021 --> 00:22:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Him and Josh was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

475
00:22:07.311 --> 00:22:09.290
<v Speaker 1>when you're in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like here's what you can do,</v>

476
00:22:09.291 --> 00:22:10.190
<v Speaker 1>you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

477
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.570
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

478
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.150
<v Speaker 1>he was so a wide eyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

479
00:22:14.151 --> 00:22:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it was before he even got his</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue belt or maybe it was like around</v>

480
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.490
<v Speaker 1>blue belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was super,</v>

481
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.830
<v Speaker 1>super jacked about it and he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it every day.</v>

482
00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were filming,</v>

483
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.990
<v Speaker 1>we were outside of billings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that where we were?</v>

484
00:22:26.991 --> 00:22:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Where were we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

485
00:22:27.831 --> 00:22:30.050
<v Speaker 1>well we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunt was the hunt.</v>

486
00:22:30.051 --> 00:22:30.750
<v Speaker 1>We were in like</v>

487
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.930
<v Speaker 2>go up in central Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

488
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

489
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.020
<v Speaker 2>we kind of started in billings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we headed up towards central</v>

490
00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Montana.</v>

491
00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 1>He was training so often and even on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road that he traveled to a club,</v>

492
00:22:42.651 --> 00:22:44.810
<v Speaker 1>there was just a Jujitsu club and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bozeman.</v>

493
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he found some guys and he was</v>

494
00:22:46.351 --> 00:22:48.830
<v Speaker 1>rolling with these guys in Bozeman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely like,</v>

495
00:22:48.831 --> 00:22:50.180
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it every day because that</v>

496
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.450
<v Speaker 1>was a day for a long time on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a mandate and we find the</v>

497
00:22:53.451 --> 00:22:54.440
<v Speaker 1>local,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

498
00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.000
<v Speaker 1>the local clubs and make sure that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a place or role texted me from some</v>

499
00:22:59.001 --> 00:23:02.850
<v Speaker 1>European bloc country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said he was shitting bone bone chips as</v>

500
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.820
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He worked out with some old school</v>

501
00:23:04.821 --> 00:23:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Carlson Gracie guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in rolling light.</v>

502
00:23:08.151 --> 00:23:12.140
<v Speaker 1>It's all top game and smashing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitting bone chips,</v>

503
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.740
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admired that a guy could be 58 years</v>

504
00:23:15.741 --> 00:23:19.820
<v Speaker 1>old and decide I'm going to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and I'm going to be obsessed</v>

505
00:23:19.821 --> 00:23:22.160
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he became addicted to it.</v>

506
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:23:23.241 --> 00:23:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is a very beneficial thing to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to,</v>

508
00:23:25.881 --> 00:23:28.070
<v Speaker 1>but it is absolutely an addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

509
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.610
<v Speaker 1>I've come back from injuries were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely shouldn't have been</v>

510
00:23:31.611 --> 00:23:35.000
<v Speaker 1>training yet and I just wrapped my arm</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and just fucking get in there.</v>

511
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.210
<v Speaker 1>People get super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super addicted to it and he got addicted</v>

512
00:23:38.211 --> 00:23:39.770
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like he's been addicted to many</v>

513
00:23:39.771 --> 00:23:40.580
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

514
00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.610
<v Speaker 1>he jumped right into the Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu experience.</v>

515
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

516
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.483
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

517
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't me.</v>

518
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was clearly like really good for him</v>

519
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.021
<v Speaker 3>to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

520
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I know very little about Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what I know from Tony,</v>

521
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slim.</v>

522
00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lost all that weight.</v>

523
00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden you had to stop spacs up</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking,</v>

524
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those were,</v>

525
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 3>those were big things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

526
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.300
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he looked great and he,</v>

527
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got off statens.</v>

528
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.570
<v Speaker 3>You're no longer on any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>

529
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.140
<v Speaker 3>He lost all that weight to cut all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbs out.</v>

530
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.970
<v Speaker 3>It was just eating like crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looked so good.</v>

531
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.510
<v Speaker 3>He did look good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

532
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.590
<v Speaker 3>he did look good and also just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

533
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing was kind of indicative</v>

534
00:24:25.161 --> 00:24:27.450
<v Speaker 3>of the way he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

535
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.510
<v Speaker 3>he did things so passionately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

536
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.390
<v Speaker 3>whether it was travel the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>soaking up all these experiences or</v>

537
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:38.060
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu or whatever he was into</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

538
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.870
<v Speaker 3>If something caught his attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just so aggressive about</v>

539
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.750
<v Speaker 3>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning what he could,</v>

540
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 3>pulling everything out of it that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he could,</v>

541
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy to see someone do something</v>

542
00:24:50.001 --> 00:24:55.001
<v Speaker 3>that's that physically demanding 58 with</v>
<v Speaker 3>no background in athletics at all.</v>

543
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you could see when he was like,</v>

544
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.870
<v Speaker 3>even when he was doing things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when he went to curt oce anders</v>

545
00:24:59.871 --> 00:25:02.790
<v Speaker 3>place and was rolling around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he doesn't have a background in</v>

546
00:25:02.791 --> 00:25:04.790
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's just pushing himself to it.</v>

547
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

548
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.730
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was true with everything,</v>

549
00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if he,</v>

550
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 3>if it was something that was interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>to him,</v>

551
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:13.900
<v Speaker 3>he just went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

552
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.170
<v Speaker 3>he loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

553
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:17.150
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

554
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember texting him going like,</v>

555
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:20.570
<v Speaker 3>how deep you getting into it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

556
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.790
<v Speaker 3>real fucking deep end.</v>

557
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:23.720
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

558
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.460
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting tapped out everyday.</v>

559
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.370
<v Speaker 3>But he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving guys half my age of real</v>

560
00:25:28.371 --> 00:25:29.780
<v Speaker 3>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>

561

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm loving it.</v>

562
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he talked about that a lot.</v>

563
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:35.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he talked about like the,</v>

564
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 3>the failure as much as anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that going in and,</v>

572
00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he rolled in Butte butte a hard</v>

573
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:54.500
<v Speaker 3>hit and town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love beauty.</v>

575
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I love you too much respect to anyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>from butte.</v>

576
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.620
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a hard hit in town.</v>

577
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:03.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd roll into real cowboys,</v>

578
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>oh no.</v>

581
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:16.400
<v Speaker 3>And then just jump into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know it's just different for a guy who's</v>

582
00:26:16.401 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 3>58.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you got a guy who does it at 20.</v>

583
00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:22.040
<v Speaker 3>I admire anybody who does Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a real humbling ego</v>

584
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.820
<v Speaker 3>dissolving experience and a lot of ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she's makes you realize like all</v>

585
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:28.250
<v Speaker 3>your illusions of how well you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>defend yourself.</v>

586
00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:31.310
<v Speaker 3>They go out the window and some just</v>
<v Speaker 3>chokes you easily and you're like,</v>

587
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.110
<v Speaker 3>oh great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a pitch.</v>

588
00:26:33.111 --> 00:26:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Wandered around running around this life</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking I'm a man.</v>

589
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:41.660
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that he did it at 58 just</v>
<v Speaker 3>showed what kind of a unusual duty was.</v>

590
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what you just talked about there.</v>

591
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:44.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about with like the</v>

592
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:46.950
<v Speaker 3>ego diminishing aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

593
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.270
<v Speaker 3>I think that that was something that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>took great pleasure in and I think that,</v>

594
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the way he went through</v>

595
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:56.970
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the things that,</v>

596
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate it right off the bat.</v>

597
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that kept me</v>
<v Speaker 3>around as long as I stayed around,</v>

598
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:04.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

599
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Speaker 3>it was the fact that it took for Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that he was constantly trying to</v>

600
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 3>dismantle that persona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

601
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.420
<v Speaker 3>to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

602
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the focal point of this scene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm the,</v>

603
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.110
<v Speaker 3>what we're interested in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm interested in talking about is</v>

604
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.990
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the camera's pointed away from</v>

605
00:27:24.991 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

606
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.260
<v Speaker 3>he was kind of a clearinghouse for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that information and he was the root of</v>

607
00:27:31.261 --> 00:27:33.120
<v Speaker 3>the show and it was his journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

608
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately,</v>

609
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was refreshing is he wasn't like</v>

610
00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:42.150
<v Speaker 3>working with some celebrity or hosts</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was completely consumed by their</v>

611
00:27:42.151 --> 00:27:44.330
<v Speaker 3>own ego and their own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

612
00:27:44.331 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 3>brandon and how they were presented to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

613
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.600
<v Speaker 3>That's so disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

614
00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:49.411
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

618
00:27:51.571 --> 00:27:56.520
<v Speaker 3>He was very self deprecating and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had reverence for real artists</v>

619
00:27:56.521 --> 00:28:00.690
<v Speaker 3>and real masters and that reverence came</v>
<v Speaker 3>across cross.</v>

620
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:06.110
<v Speaker 3>I texted him about some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a photo of a restaurant and</v>

621
00:28:06.691 --> 00:28:08.610

<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

626

641
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.930

<v Speaker 3>like an instant ability to sniff through</v>

<v Speaker 2>table besides Sienna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but safe to say that the.</v>

705
00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the relationship with travel</v>
<v Speaker 2>channel was toxic before that,</v>

706
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the travel channels,</v>

707
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.050
<v Speaker 1>religious own place at least was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if still is,</v>

708
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I think the original people that owned</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because my friend Bert Kreischer has</v>

709
00:31:57.961 --> 00:31:59.310
<v Speaker 1>a show over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a show over there,</v>

710
00:31:59.311 --> 00:32:01.260
<v Speaker 1>a couple shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Birth to conquer.</v>

711
00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:03.120
<v Speaker 1>And what was his other show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hurt Bert.</v>

712
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's crazy asshole.</v>

713
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.290
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

714
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Bert had issues with that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when he would be on the show,</v>

715
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.720
<v Speaker 1>if we'd all be hanging out together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to smoke pot,</v>

716
00:32:12.721 --> 00:32:14.760
<v Speaker 1>he had to make sure that Jamie turn the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera away from him.</v>

717
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they couldn't see.</v>

718
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

719
00:32:17.411 --> 00:32:18.244
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

720
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.253
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

721
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 2>and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any inside information,</v>

722
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 2>so this is purely like my outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

723
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:27.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't do the deals and I don't deal in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff and make the shows,</v>

724
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.780
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

725
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a network that was more interested</v>

726
00:32:31.061 --> 00:32:31.930
<v Speaker 2>in making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

727
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show's about sand castles,</v>

728
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.600
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

730
00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.770

<v Speaker 3>But the thing is if you're watching</v>

734
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.000
<v Speaker 3>everybody's scared of ghosts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you're watching and it's like</v>

735
00:32:56.001 --> 00:32:59.480
<v Speaker 3>people in there in the basement and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have night vision on and they pretend</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're just not making that hike,</v>

792
00:35:16.401 --> 00:35:17.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

793
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.170
<v Speaker 3>he weighs 110 pounds and he couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk for days.</v>

794
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.023
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

795
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:23.630
<v Speaker 3>And he's been doing this since he was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>

796
00:35:23.631 --> 00:35:24.464
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

797
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:26.783
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

798
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last time I went out with him was</v>

799
00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:30.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess two years ago I went up to</v>

800
00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Alaska and did the blacktail hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we actually had nice weather,</v>

801
00:35:34.551 --> 00:35:37.230
<v Speaker 3>which was kind of unbelievable because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>know you've been up there when it's</v>

802
00:35:37.231 --> 00:35:38.090
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

803
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.490
<v Speaker 3>10 days of rain coming sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had to leave early last time was</v>

804
00:35:42.491 --> 00:35:45.260
<v Speaker 3>there because a storm was coming and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to make a decision that says I'm</v>

805
00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.790
<v Speaker 3>coming every time we went up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we weren't gonna be able to get out.</v>

806
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.600
<v Speaker 3>There was a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

807
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Part of me was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though we're rain soaked,</v>

808
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:58.281
<v Speaker 3>I want to hunt the last six hours</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if I stay the last day,</v>

809
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 3>never know that might be the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that so many times that's when you hook</v>

810
00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 3>up with an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

811
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:06.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my experience up there with an</v>

812
00:36:06.211 --> 00:36:08.160
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds like the wrong thing really,</v>

813
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.320
<v Speaker 3>really wrong because a couple of animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>and catch can.</v>

814
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.990
<v Speaker 3>No Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

815
00:36:15.991 --> 00:36:17.880
<v Speaker 3>like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly the way it was.</v>

816
00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:20.600
<v Speaker 3>You go up there and you'd be in six days</v>
<v Speaker 3>rain.</v>

817
00:36:20.601 --> 00:36:24.570
<v Speaker 3>Then all of a sudden the fog a clear and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>

818
00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black tail standing right there looking</v>

819
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:29.370
<v Speaker 3>at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that a lot of bear up there</v>

820
00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:30.031
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

821
00:36:30.031 --> 00:36:31.530
<v Speaker 3>Tons of bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

822
00:36:31.531 --> 00:36:32.281
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

823
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I got my ass whipped last time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went up there first time I went up</v>

824
00:36:34.561 --> 00:36:35.610
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was still in shape.</v>

825
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was younger.</v>

826
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.810
<v Speaker 3>I did pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you were doing it all the time.</v>

827
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.700
<v Speaker 3>You have to do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the hiking thing is something.</v>

828
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're basically building up this</v>

829
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:47.130
<v Speaker 3>difference in your legs that you only</v>
<v Speaker 3>get from hiking.</v>

830
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Biking.</v>

831
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Endurance is no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's a joke because if you</v>

832
00:36:51.781 --> 00:36:54.300
<v Speaker 3>hike for like five feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like nothing.</v>

833
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.410
<v Speaker 3>You climbed a small hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

834
00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I could do this all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think you could do it all day?</v>

835
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.450
<v Speaker 3>You do that for 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can start.</v>

836
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.760
<v Speaker 3>He even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be drenched in sweat.</v>

837
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.810
<v Speaker 3>He'd want to take your jacket off and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you realize like,</v>

838
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.840
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to do this for eight more hours.</v>

839
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Eight more days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

840
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.550
<v Speaker 3>And then the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if your immune system,</v>

841
00:37:11.551 --> 00:37:13.440
<v Speaker 3>is it all tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to crash hard.</v>

842
00:37:13.441 --> 00:37:14.670
<v Speaker 3>You might get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

843
00:37:14.671 --> 00:37:16.320
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you,</v>

844
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.820
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't train for it.</v>

845
00:37:17.821 --> 00:37:19.800
<v Speaker 3>You can't train for that kind of back</v>
<v Speaker 3>country stuff.</v>

846
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.180
<v Speaker 3>You can go out and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

847
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.490
<v Speaker 3>run up and down the stair master,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

848
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:26.670
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't train all those little muscles</v>

849
00:37:26.671 --> 00:37:28.800
<v Speaker 3>that you use to constantly stabilize</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

850
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Senator Hassle,</v>

851
00:37:30.631 --> 00:37:34.620
<v Speaker 3>help a little with stairmaster will help</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little but really helped the major</v>

852
00:37:34.621 --> 00:37:35.250
<v Speaker 3>muscle groups.</v>

853
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.480
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Running hills,</v>

854
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.503
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helped me,</v>

855
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.260
<v Speaker 3>helped me a lot just because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much harder than hiking.</v>

856
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.360
<v Speaker 3>He's run them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do it easier.</v>

857
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.200
<v Speaker 3>It makes you hiking easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lucky with weighted packs onto.</v>

858
00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:47.480
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

859
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we did,</v>

860
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 3>but not just for training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For training.</v>

861
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:51.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

862
00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the stairmaster actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure I am.</v>

863
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing the stairmaster with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

864
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:59.760
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd put weights on my pack and go on the</v>

865
00:37:59.761 --> 00:38:01.100
<v Speaker 3>stairmaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

866
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And boots,</v>

867
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:05.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boots on the stairmaster.</v>

868
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Did they let you do that at the gym</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they look at you weird or will</v>

869
00:38:07.421 --> 00:38:09.660
<v Speaker 3>everyone looks at you weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

870
00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:12.510
<v Speaker 3>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you even talk about hunting and Los</v>

871
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Angeles and looking at weird metro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

872
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.380
<v Speaker 3>like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with you?</v>

873
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:20.970
<v Speaker 3>It's the fuck that guy got Cammo on for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

874
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.850
<v Speaker 3>Did you were camera with the gym?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I may have had some cammo</v>

875
00:38:26.851 --> 00:38:31.851
<v Speaker 3>aspect of my pack of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm bloodstains you know,</v>

876
00:38:32.251 --> 00:38:32.821
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

877
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:35.530
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting though because I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>back on those times and you know,</v>

878
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:38.530
<v Speaker 3>like while we're talking about like all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shitty weather and all that stuff,</v>

879
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.590
<v Speaker 3>and then just think back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first time I went out with Steve,</v>

880
00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:43.480
<v Speaker 3>him saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah Dude,</v>

881
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:44.600
<v Speaker 3>but you won't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

882
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.050
<v Speaker 3>you never tell stories about the good</v>
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>

883
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got to say to his credit that's</v>

884
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 3>been absolutely true is like those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those shitty days,</v>

885
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.680
<v Speaker 3>freezing cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

886
00:38:54.681 --> 00:38:57.760
<v Speaker 3>getting out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting out of your sleeping bag in the</v>

887
00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:02.620
<v Speaker 3>morning and putting on wet clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cold wet clothes to go to go out and</v>

888
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 3>hunt all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

889
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.380
<v Speaker 3>I look back on that with like a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>degree of fondness and I also have to</v>

890
00:39:08.381 --> 00:39:12.070
<v Speaker 3>say it made me a lot more of a person</v>
<v Speaker 3>than I was before,</v>

891
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toughens you up to it.</v>

892
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.720
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it toughened me up to open me up to the</v>

893
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:21.721
<v Speaker 3>idea of it opened me up to accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

894
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.230
<v Speaker 3>possibilities for myself that I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>never thought of before.</v>

895
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your capabilities,</v>

896
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:29.970
<v Speaker 3>your capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

897
00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.540
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we,</v>

898
00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:36.040
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all have that somewhere back down in</v>

899
00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 3>the brainstem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idea,</v>

900
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.140
<v Speaker 3>this ability to just go out in the woods</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

901
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt something and eat it,</v>

902
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and up until that point I had never done</v>

903
00:39:45.531 --> 00:39:47.390
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd done some hiking and some camping.</v>

904
00:39:47.391 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 3>It was always on trails and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 3>nicely marked and stuff like that.</v>

905
00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 3>The idea of stepping out of Steve's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>backdoor seeps cabin in just into the</v>

906
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:57.220
<v Speaker 3>woods at that time for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I first did it,</v>

907
00:39:57.221 --> 00:39:58.780
<v Speaker 3>that was completely new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

908
00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just walk into the woods,</v>

909
00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.020
<v Speaker 3>where do we go and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then to do it and to have it be</v>

910
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:11.870
<v Speaker 3>successful and to bring that animal back</v>
<v Speaker 3>into sit around and eat it and all this</v>

911
00:40:11.871 --> 00:40:12.460
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

912
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:16.000
<v Speaker 3>That was a real huge Aha moment for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

913
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.100
<v Speaker 3>personally and professionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

914
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.560
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do shit that we used to do,</v>

915
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000 years ago.</v>

916
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.120
<v Speaker 3>It was big for me too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember saying that on the show,</v>

917
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.720
<v Speaker 3>like when Steve was asking me and Brian</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the first hunt,</v>

918
00:40:28.721 --> 00:40:31.640
<v Speaker 3>which just by sheer luck we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>successful on the,</v>

919
00:40:31.641 --> 00:40:32.710
<v Speaker 3>on the first hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

920
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.260
<v Speaker 3>And Steve was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

921
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:35.860
<v Speaker 3>do you think you're going to do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>again?</v>

922
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:36.820
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

923
00:40:36.821 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

924
00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:39.480
<v Speaker 3>I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

925
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 3>when did you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

926
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:42.040
<v Speaker 3>the moment that deer dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

927
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.240
<v Speaker 3>The moment the deer dropped him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

928
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.710
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this forever.</v>

929
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 3>This is how I'm making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting my meat now I'm going to do</v>

930
00:40:47.381 --> 00:40:48.370
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

931
00:40:48.371 --> 00:40:49.930
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

932
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:51.910
<v Speaker 3>it's shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

933
00:40:51.911 --> 00:40:54.610
<v Speaker 3>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like really glib interpretations of</v>

934
00:40:54.611 --> 00:40:56.620
<v Speaker 3>like the motivation behind hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

935
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I was say cruelty and blood lust and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

936
00:40:59.801 --> 00:41:02.950
<v Speaker 3>because in its worst cases that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

937
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because I,</v>

938
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.730
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that hunting shows for years,</v>

939
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:10.630
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of what they put forward</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like kind of machismo and guys</v>

940
00:41:10.631 --> 00:41:13.680
<v Speaker 3>shooting black bears over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

941
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.640
<v Speaker 3>donut barrels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

942
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all the wrong reasons,</v>

943
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beliefs.</v>

944
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 3>We think of that as something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

945
00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:23.740
<v Speaker 3>or at least I do think of that as</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that people eat for food.</v>

946
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:28.090
<v Speaker 3>When you think about Cecil Cecil a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little while and that kind of shit</v>

947
00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:32.830
<v Speaker 3>really sours people on the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting because there's no justification</v>

948
00:41:32.831 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>for the person for shooting</v>

949
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.330
<v Speaker 1>a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to,</v>

950
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:40.460
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to do decades of education</v>
<v Speaker 1>about conservation and the importance of</v>

951
00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:43.340
<v Speaker 1>the money that goes for the hunt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they still don't get it because</v>

952
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:45.080
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to shoot a line?</v>

953
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's the good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>

954
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:47.803
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want,</v>

955
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say it's a good question for</v>

956
00:41:49.731 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

957
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:52.010
<v Speaker 2>I definitely have limits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

958
00:41:52.011 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 2>as much as I went around with Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have limits on what I would personally</v>

959
00:41:56.331 --> 00:41:58.670
<v Speaker 2>choose to do and I got to say the Africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff for me,</v>

960
00:41:58.671 --> 00:41:59.504
<v Speaker 2>ma'am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

961
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

962
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:05.910
<v Speaker 1>See that's interesting to me in Africa</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be to hunt something that I would</v>

963
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.580
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have antelope in Africa.</v>

964
00:42:08.581 --> 00:42:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I would love to hunt and hunt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>antelope and cook it and eat it.</v>

965
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.070
<v Speaker 1>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>

966
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.500
<v Speaker 1>There's no way I want to shoot a hippo</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything else,</v>

967
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.950
<v Speaker 1>even if people do eat hippos and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand they do that.</v>

968
00:42:22.951 --> 00:42:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

969
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

970
00:42:25.581 --> 00:42:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that,</v>

971
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.270
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but game animals that have been,</v>

972
00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.910
<v Speaker 1>that are delicious Neil Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>

973
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.560
<v Speaker 1>that people have eaten forever and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hunt,</v>

974
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.670
<v Speaker 1>they hunt elk or deer here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me makes sense.</v>

975
00:42:38.671 --> 00:42:40.680
<v Speaker 1>It would be just an adventure to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

976
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucking scary.</v>

977
00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:43.943
<v Speaker 1>It's so sketchy.</v>

978
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Africa and I became like,</v>

979
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I kinda took all the Africa shows I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could on parts unknown.</v>

980
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's mostly wonderful place.</v>

981
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

982
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.700
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's like a,</v>

983
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.151
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

984
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:03.860
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of misperception when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to.</v>

985
00:43:03.861 --> 00:43:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a negative experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

986
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I've had maybe I had one experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of quasi threatening,</v>

987
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we got to.</v>

988
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

989
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a crowd kind of turn on us and</v>

990
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:18.890
<v Speaker 2>throw rocks at us was we were driving</v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

991
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the one experience with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds experiences.</v>

992
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a,</v>

993
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.270
<v Speaker 2>we're in Goma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the DRC,</v>

994
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just a,</v>

995
00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.520
<v Speaker 2>it's just a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really chaotic place.</v>

996
00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:34.640
<v Speaker 2>A place has been run over by a civil</v>
<v Speaker 2>wars for decades.</v>

997
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.110
<v Speaker 2>People are in serious desperation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think worse than any of that,</v>

998
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:41.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge culture of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

999
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.240
<v Speaker 2>of nonprofit organizations and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1000
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.540
<v Speaker 2>So I think they're used to kind of white</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks coming in with this very</v>

1001
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:49.950
<v Speaker 2>patronizing kind of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1002
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:55.520
<v Speaker 2>and then we're down there with cameras</v>
<v Speaker 2>filming them and then all of a sudden</v>

1003
00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:58.040
<v Speaker 2>they realize that we're not paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone for this,</v>

1004
00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:59.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1005
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.710
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1006
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:02.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a tendency for people to feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1007
00:44:02.601 --> 00:44:04.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're here taking something from us,</v>

1008
00:44:04.761 --> 00:44:07.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're clearly making more money than</v>

1009
00:44:07.191 --> 00:44:10.430
<v Speaker 2>any of us will ever be able to make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1010
00:44:10.431 --> 00:44:12.680
<v Speaker 2>and what the fuck did we get for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1011
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.980
<v Speaker 2>and I can understand that point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how did it turn into them throwing</v>

1012
00:44:15.981 --> 00:44:17.600
<v Speaker 2>rocks at you guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1013
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realized we weren't going to be</v>

1014
00:44:19.731 --> 00:44:21.140
<v Speaker 2>paying for any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1015
00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:24.170
<v Speaker 2>our security team was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>

1016
00:44:24.171 --> 00:44:27.710
<v Speaker 2>time to get in the car and as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get in the car and you're leaving,</v>

1017
00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1018
00:44:28.911 --> 00:44:30.590
<v Speaker 2>these fucking assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1019
00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.900
<v Speaker 2>It just came down here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got not older footage,</v>

1020
00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.940
<v Speaker 2>gonna pack up and go back to their nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel,</v>

1021
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1022
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:42.210
<v Speaker 2>but that's the one experience and little</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of experiences there,</v>

1023
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part I found people that</v>

1024
00:44:44.631 --> 00:44:46.860
<v Speaker 2>are like incredibly gracious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1025
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I've found it to be one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopeful places,</v>

1026
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:50.940
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1027
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:56.030
<v Speaker 2>my day to day experiences in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw people who were working their</v>

1028
00:44:56.071 --> 00:45:00.600
<v Speaker 2>asses off on a grassroots level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The [inaudible] like some of the most,</v>

1029
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1030
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:07.070
<v Speaker 2>some of the most like dynamic grassroots</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism that I've ever seen and</v>

1031
00:45:08.401 --> 00:45:13.401
<v Speaker 2>people who will literally find any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any way to scrape out an existence and a</v>

1032
00:45:13.941 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1033
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 2>this is not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a lazy culture.</v>

1034
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:21.660
<v Speaker 2>This is a culture that will fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>through anything,</v>

1035
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Lagos and legacy is one of the</v>

1036
00:45:25.381 --> 00:45:27.270
<v Speaker 2>most dynamic cities I've ever been in.</v>

1037
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a constantly moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly people trying to make money,</v>

1038
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.300
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People trying to find a niche,</v>

1039
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a city of 20 million people,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I find a lot of beauty and just like</v>

1041
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.840
<v Speaker 2>raw human endeavor there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

1042
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can clear some of the,</v>

1043
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 2>like obvious stumbling blocks that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have in terms of corruption,</v>

1044
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:50.520
<v Speaker 2>in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1045
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:52.380
<v Speaker 2>foreign pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1046
00:45:52.381 --> 00:45:53.470
<v Speaker 2>in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1047
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:56.190
<v Speaker 2>manipulation of markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1048
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.010
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's tremendous promise there.</v>

1049
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1050
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.480
<v Speaker 2>just in terms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the Internet and technology sector</v>

1051
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:08.940
<v Speaker 2>in Africa is absolutely booming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1052
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:13.970
<v Speaker 2>you have kids that come in from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>villages on the streets of Lego's who</v>

1053
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:19.230
<v Speaker 2>can take your computer apart and rebuild</v>
<v Speaker 2>it by hand,</v>

1054
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self taught and all of that potential is</v>

1055
00:46:24.421 --> 00:46:26.640
<v Speaker 2>there to be tapped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1056
00:46:26.641 --> 00:46:27.780
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're starting to,</v>

1057
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.350
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1058
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.010
<v Speaker 2>So I guess I just find it a hopeful</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1059
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing that you only had one bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

1060
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.330
<v Speaker 2>only one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only one.</v>

1061
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.630
<v Speaker 2>But I can say that about traveling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world kind of in general.</v>

1062
00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've been in a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1063
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.360
<v Speaker 2>relatively hot zones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we never did active conflict</v>

1064
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:48.890
<v Speaker 2>because we don't make that kind of show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1065
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in places like Gaza or the DRC or</v>

1066
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:56.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can count on one hand in,</v>

1067
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many,</v>

1068
00:46:58.381 --> 00:47:00.270
<v Speaker 2>many years of doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1069
00:47:00.271 --> 00:47:03.240
<v Speaker 2>the number of times that I actually felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened by someone.</v>

1070
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've found that the most likely</v>

1071
00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:09.000
<v Speaker 2>scenarios you're going to get accosted</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a sandwich,</v>

1072
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or someone trying to,</v>

1073
00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduce you to their kids,</v>

1074
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or take a selfie with you.</v>

1075
00:47:14.341 --> 00:47:17.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the world that I know.</v>

1076
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't really understand the world that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see on TV here,</v>

1077
00:47:21.571 --> 00:47:22.410
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's not,</v>

1078
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.260
<v Speaker 2>that's not my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1079
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of good people.</v>

1080
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.170
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting back to Tony,</v>

1081
00:47:28.171 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1082
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.810
<v Speaker 2>that's legacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1083
00:47:31.811 --> 00:47:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I think that he really showed people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1084
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:37.930
<v Speaker 1>that is a problem with our view of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is that if it doesn't look scary,</v>

1085
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:39.540
<v Speaker 1>they're not gonna show it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1086
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.150
<v Speaker 1>just because if it's not dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean other than his show.</v>

1087
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.080
<v Speaker 1>What else are you seeing on CNN where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are in Africa where it's a good</v>

1088
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:51.860
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else are you seeing where people</v>

1089
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.920
<v Speaker 1>are in Egypt where it's a good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else are you seeing where people</v>

1090
00:47:54.921 --> 00:47:57.560
<v Speaker 1>are interacting with people on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street and there's not some sort of a</v>

1091
00:47:57.561 --> 00:48:02.000
<v Speaker 1>murder story or rape story or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful?</v>

1092
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:03.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1093
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.070
<v Speaker 2>I think you're starting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're starting to see it a little bit.</v>

1094
00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mostly you're seeing it in like,</v>

1095
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on like CNN,</v>

1096
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1097
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.940
<v Speaker 2>network or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you're starting to see them</v>

1098
00:48:15.941 --> 00:48:18.200
<v Speaker 2>covering stories about entrepreneurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1099
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive aspects,</v>

1100
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:21.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>building economies.</v>

1101
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 1>But it's a real problem in our view of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world for people that don't travel</v>

1102
00:48:25.301 --> 00:48:25.670
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1103
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Africa just simply doesn't make news in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

1104
00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet it takes a genocide,</v>

1105
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:32.470
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1106
00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 1>all I've been hearing about Africa</v>
<v Speaker 1>lately is what's going on with white</v>

1107
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:37.230
<v Speaker 1>farmers in South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1108
00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:42.720
<v Speaker 1>it's very scary stuff where people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging people to attack white</v>

1109
00:48:42.761 --> 00:48:45.210
<v Speaker 1>farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1110
00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:49.360
<v Speaker 1>and there's a whole lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociopolitical economic shit that goes</v>

1111
00:48:49.361 --> 00:48:50.980
<v Speaker 1>on without that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to pretend I</v>

1112
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:52.290
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1113
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.700
<v Speaker 1>that's what you hear about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear about good things here</v>

1114
00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:56.230
<v Speaker 1>about how many farmers have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered.</v>

1115
00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homes.</v>

1116
00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a shame man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1117
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:04.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go there and most of what I find</v>

1118
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.940
<v Speaker 2>going on there as positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1119
00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.740
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of pain,</v>

1120
00:49:08.741 --> 00:49:11.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of bad shit that happens</v>

1121
00:49:11.111 --> 00:49:12.010
<v Speaker 2>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

1122
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna deny that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1123
00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.183
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1124
00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:17.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't hear the good stuff.</v>

1125
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Did you have a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have like a place where you</v>

1126
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:24.340
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed traveling to the most?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1127
00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think really because uh,</v>

1128
00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1129
00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:29.771
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

1130
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:33.130
<v Speaker 2>this is another kind of like real lesson</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the show,</v>

1131
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:36.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we got to a place where we were</v>

1132
00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:39.130
<v Speaker 2>finding something kind of everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1133
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:44.080
<v Speaker 2>there's some places that I didn't enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much,</v>

1134
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:45.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1135
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I think most places we found something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like,</v>

1136
00:49:49.361 --> 00:49:50.194
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1137
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.460
<v Speaker 2>this is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1138
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 1>what was the one place where you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1139
00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going back here again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say,</v>

1140
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.510
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The positive people keep it positive.</v>

1141
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say it's a highly militarized</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1142
00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now and deep divides and uh,</v>

1143
00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:10.360
<v Speaker 2>on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1145
00:50:11.951 --> 00:50:13.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of beautiful people on both</v>

1146
00:50:13.901 --> 00:50:14.734
<v Speaker 2>sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1147
00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1148
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.790
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1149
00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was something we like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we encounter a lot as we kind of</v>

1150
00:50:23.051 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 2>progress in the show is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1151
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember my dad would say it to me all</v>

1152
00:50:26.051 --> 00:50:26.411
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1153
00:50:26.411 --> 00:50:26.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1154
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:28.550
<v Speaker 2>where are you guys going to go now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1155
00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:29.600
<v Speaker 2>you've been everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1156
00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we started to learn that you</v>

1157
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:34.430
<v Speaker 2>could like really point the camera kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of anywhere.</v>

1158
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:39.050
<v Speaker 2>I think a big one for me was like doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this West Virginia show last year,</v>

1159
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:42.170
<v Speaker 2>which the place it always been like</v>
<v Speaker 2>really close to my heart.</v>

1160
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Like I grew up there when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1161
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a place that has been,</v>

1162
00:50:47.831 --> 00:50:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I think like deeply misrepresented.</v>

1163
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another place has been deeply</v>

1164
00:50:51.411 --> 00:50:53.150
<v Speaker 2>Ruttenberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresented in the media,</v>

1165
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1166
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.990
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1167
00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got like I got into town on the scout</v>

1168
00:50:59.961 --> 00:51:01.940
<v Speaker 2>there and it's like there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant,</v>

1169
00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:04.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that there's no restaurant</v>

1170
00:51:04.131 --> 00:51:05.810
<v Speaker 2>like in the town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like two restaurants in the</v>

1171
00:51:05.811 --> 00:51:07.340
<v Speaker 2>county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1172
00:51:07.341 --> 00:51:09.260
<v Speaker 2>and I remember having this moment of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1173
00:51:09.261 --> 00:51:11.150
<v Speaker 2>can we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is work,</v>

1174
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:14.630
<v Speaker 2>like will Tony Respond to this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we make a show here.</v>

1175
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:19.310
<v Speaker 2>And within two days he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this big,</v>

1176
00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very deeply heartfelt statements about</v>

1177
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:24.290
<v Speaker 2>the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really loved it,</v>

1178
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:26.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was kind of another Aha moment</v>

1179
00:51:26.391 --> 00:51:27.081
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1180
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:29.380
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's something everywhere in</v>

1181
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:34.100
<v Speaker 2>the human story is everywhere and dig</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it wherever you go,</v>

1182
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:37.160
<v Speaker 2>the fundamentals of that don't change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

1183
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did was so cleanly and clearly</v>

1184
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:47.210
<v Speaker 2>and so free of bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut to the core of those very</v>

1185
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.600
<v Speaker 2>fundamental kind of human stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1186
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.990
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

1187
00:51:53.991 --> 00:51:56.840
<v Speaker 2>it worked well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We won an emmy two nights ago for it.</v>

1188
00:51:56.841 --> 00:52:00.740
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>posthumous Emmy's are always odd,</v>

1189
00:52:00.741 --> 00:52:01.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:03.290
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a rough night.</v>

1191
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he would get the rough cut,</v>

1192
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 2>would it be length of the actual show</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he would add narration to it.</v>

1193
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Did he have any say in the editing</v>
<v Speaker 2>process?</v>

1194
00:52:15.111 --> 00:52:15.801
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1195
00:52:15.801 --> 00:52:19.610
<v Speaker 2>so I think that's something important</v>
<v Speaker 2>too about who he was,</v>

1196
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:20.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1197
00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean like everyone calls him a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a chef,</v>

1198
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:26.240
<v Speaker 2>like he was a producer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a television producer,</v>

1199
00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:27.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1200
00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would pick the locations he had</v>

1201
00:52:30.261 --> 00:52:32.420
<v Speaker 2>picked a subject matter for the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

1202
00:52:32.421 --> 00:52:33.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a couple of lights.</v>

1203
00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 2>How did you guys work it out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say if you were going to go to</v>

1204
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you make,</v>

1205
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.790
<v Speaker 2>make the decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you decide where to go and</v>

1206
00:52:40.791 --> 00:52:41.930
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1207
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:43.520
<v Speaker 2>well I'll take you through the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

1208
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:46.130
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so tony would come up with a list of</v>

1209
00:52:46.131 --> 00:52:49.670
<v Speaker 2>places that he was interested in going</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe we would throw a couple in</v>

1210
00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:51.200
<v Speaker 2>light had mentioned the West Virginia</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show,</v>

1211
00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

1212
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 2>but this is my list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1213
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:57.200
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he'd write like a brief on each</v>

1214
00:52:57.201 --> 00:52:59.390
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in x,</v>

1215
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm interested in Singapore,</v>

1216
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.940
<v Speaker 2>it's Disneyland with the death penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1217
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:05.811
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1218
00:53:05.811 --> 00:53:08.780
<v Speaker 2>So there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of a basic operating</v>

1219
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:09.950
<v Speaker 2>thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1220
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:13.070
<v Speaker 2>We can kind of like go in and look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>this place.</v>

1221
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm from this perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1222
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.430
<v Speaker 2>and so some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them didn't add the Lego's</v>

1223
00:53:19.431 --> 00:53:21.180
<v Speaker 2>episode for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just be like,</v>

1224
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:22.910
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't been to Nigeria,</v>

1225
00:53:22.911 --> 00:53:24.520
<v Speaker 2>let's go to Nigeria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1226
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we would start doing research on</v>

1227
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 2>what that was just big kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1228
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.420
<v Speaker 2>30,000 foot macro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1229
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 2>what is this environment like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the interesting things,</v>

1230
00:53:36.601 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 2>what are the stories that have been told</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this place and how can we look at</v>

1231
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:42.750
<v Speaker 2>it from a different angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the Nigeria one,</v>

1232
00:53:42.751 --> 00:53:44.970
<v Speaker 2>we kind of focused in on like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:49.890
<v Speaker 2>grassroots capitalism dei,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why entrepreneurship,</v>

1234
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>street level,</v>

1235
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:56.400
<v Speaker 2>the street level kind of dynamics of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>economy,</v>

1236
00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:57.293
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1237
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:02.330
<v Speaker 2>And that became like we could see ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of make a beautiful human story</v>

1238
00:54:04.261 --> 00:54:09.261
<v Speaker 2>out of those elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd end up putting down to him</v>

1239
00:54:09.781 --> 00:54:11.970
<v Speaker 2>probably in like a two or three page</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1240
00:54:11.971 --> 00:54:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Like here are my ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1241
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:17.280
<v Speaker 2>here's what I found based on what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were interested in.</v>

1242
00:54:17.281 --> 00:54:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Here's some other things I've found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the way we'd Kinda like to go</v>

1243
00:54:20.911 --> 00:54:22.170
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he'd either be like,</v>

1244
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:23.004
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or no,</v>

1245
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:24.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and from that point,</v>

1246
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd just get heavy into research,</v>

1247
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:30.300
<v Speaker 2>write a treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1248
00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm in break that story into like six</v>
<v Speaker 2>acts,</v>

1249
00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:38.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then look for scenes to kind of fill</v>

1250
00:54:38.611 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate that story.</v>

1251
00:54:40.351 --> 00:54:42.330
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1252
00:54:42.331 --> 00:54:45.420
<v Speaker 2>I have this great economist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we're going to need an economist</v>

1253
00:54:45.421 --> 00:54:47.760
<v Speaker 2>at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we got to put a,</v>

1254
00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.910
<v Speaker 2>economists are kind of boring by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we got to put him somewhere more</v>

1255
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:54.780
<v Speaker 2>dynamic where there's this really</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting computer market that has a</v>

1256
00:54:54.781 --> 00:54:55.680
<v Speaker 2>lot of energy.</v>

1257
00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:58.500
<v Speaker 2>So let's put the economists there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can walk around,</v>

1258
00:54:58.501 --> 00:55:00.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a great restaurant in the corner</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1259
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.100
<v Speaker 2>So like here's some elements we can put</v>
<v Speaker 2>together that's a scene in a act of the</v>

1260
00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:07.740
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you put all that stuff together and</v>

1261
00:55:07.741 --> 00:55:10.110
<v Speaker 2>treatment form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send it to Tony,</v>

1262
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.640
<v Speaker 2>usually minimal notes from him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1263
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1264
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:19.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we'd go out and Scout,</v>

1265
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.110
<v Speaker 2>shoot the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1266
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.780
<v Speaker 2>how weird is it shooting in a restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 2>with camera people standing over the</v>

1267
00:55:24.781 --> 00:55:26.910
<v Speaker 2>table?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we got,</v>

1268
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I think we've got really good at not</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking over the environment,</v>

1269
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:31.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't,</v>

1270
00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:32.773
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1271
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to answer that because</v>

1272
00:55:35.641 --> 00:55:37.150
<v Speaker 2>you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we save?</v>

1273
00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 2>You and I are having a conversation at</v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner and we're being filmed right?</v>

1274
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:42.360
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would they be as close as Jamie is?</v>

1275
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Right there to cameras closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not around.</v>

1276
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:46.450
<v Speaker 2>On top of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1277
00:55:46.451 --> 00:55:48.030
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1278
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:49.530
<v Speaker 2>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1279
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.800
<v Speaker 2>But we wouldn't use like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were rules to that,</v>

1280
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:55.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like we're a documentary show.</v>

1281
00:55:55.411 --> 00:55:59.700
<v Speaker 2>We can't just go in and just completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>take over some place or take over some</v>

1282
00:55:59.701 --> 00:56:02.310
<v Speaker 2>village or scare the shit out of local</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>

1283
00:56:02.311 --> 00:56:05.640
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we got to go in with some deafness,</v>

1284
00:56:05.641 --> 00:56:07.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we would go in early and we would</v>

1285
00:56:07.441 --> 00:56:12.030
<v Speaker 2>light so that the character's Tony</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't really seeing us screw around</v>

1286
00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:13.440
<v Speaker 2>with lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

1287
00:56:13.441 --> 00:56:15.720
<v Speaker 2>That's all kind of in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1288
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:19.590
<v Speaker 2>put the cameras in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No sound guy.</v>

1289
00:56:19.591 --> 00:56:22.980
<v Speaker 2>No big booms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sit the rest of the crew down.</v>

1290
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Are they wearing wireless mics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1291
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.290
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1292
00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:27.330
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1293
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:32.400
<v Speaker 2>and then fill in local people and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the restaurant and make sure</v>

1294
00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 2>that there are people who actually go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that restaurant in the restaurant,</v>

1295
00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 2>make sure that fuels like alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like full of extras,</v>

1296
00:56:41.351 --> 00:56:43.800
<v Speaker 2>like miming dialogue and</v>

1297
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.500
<v Speaker 3>carrying large cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how big are the cameras are</v>

1298
00:56:46.501 --> 00:56:49.650
<v Speaker 3>carrying their big cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like regular big ole production cameras,</v>

1299
00:56:49.651 --> 00:56:52.320
<v Speaker 3>heavy on the shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you guys would use a mediator.</v>

1300
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1301
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1302
00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:58.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's two guys standing there with</v>

1303
00:56:58.601 --> 00:57:02.230
<v Speaker 2>cameras that have been traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least from Tony's perspective and</v>

1304
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 2>traveling with Tony for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1305
00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:08.380
<v Speaker 2>it was just like having two more friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the meal in terms of what the</v>

1306
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:09.400
<v Speaker 2>sidekicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1307
00:57:09.401 --> 00:57:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I think we learned early on that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta like you gotta go up,</v>

1308
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.190
<v Speaker 2>you've got to introduce yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to smile,</v>

1309
00:57:15.191 --> 00:57:17.650
<v Speaker 2>you gotta laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be able to be self deprecating</v>

1310
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:21.700
<v Speaker 2>and make them feel comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're there to ask them questions,</v>

1311
00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 2>not to tell them who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1312
00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:26.260
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1313
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:26.930
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1314
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just say we,</v>

1315
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.700
<v Speaker 2>we traveled all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people who've never been on</v>

1316
00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:33.430
<v Speaker 2>camera for that largely worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1317
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.020
<v Speaker 2>so it must've been doing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1318
00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Was there ever a time you in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant in.</v>

1319
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:39.420
<v Speaker 3>We're pissed off that there was people</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing there with cameras filming a</v>

1320
00:57:39.421 --> 00:57:40.980
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1321
00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:41.993
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1322
00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:44.460
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty easy.</v>

1323
00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:46.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone gets pissed off and they wave</v>

1324
00:57:46.561 --> 00:57:47.670
<v Speaker 3>you off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1325
00:57:47.671 --> 00:57:48.540
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

1326
00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no worries.</v>

1327
00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:51.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1328
00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.490
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it never really escalated,</v>

1329
00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:54.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1330
00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:58.740
<v Speaker 3>may never escalated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had a view of the world by doing</v>

1331
00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:03.330
<v Speaker 3>that show and traveling the way he did</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's less than one percent of the</v>

1332
00:58:03.331 --> 00:58:06.180
<v Speaker 3>population is ever gonna experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably less than one percent of one</v>

1333
00:58:06.181 --> 00:58:06.721
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1334
00:58:06.721 --> 00:58:08.190
<v Speaker 3>I would say for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1335
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's got to be an incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>enriching journey for you.</v>

1336
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hugely.</v>

1337
00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's Lee.</v>

1338
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:16.710
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1339
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very simple.</v>

1340
00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:22.620
<v Speaker 3>There's before and there's after and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's two different people really,</v>

1341
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:26.360
<v Speaker 3>because just all the data you had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take in the view of the world changes,</v>

1342
00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:28.470
<v Speaker 3>it gets bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes a much bigger place.</v>

1343
00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.040
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's was,</v>

1344
00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.150
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right and not what's</v>

1345
00:58:33.151 --> 00:58:34.740
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell people this too,</v>

1346
00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:35.940
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>

1347
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been all these places.</v>

1348
00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.560
<v Speaker 2>It's get out of the gap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the world doesn't work like that.</v>

1349
00:58:40.561 --> 00:58:42.510
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't sound like the more places</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

1350
00:58:42.511 --> 00:58:44.940
<v Speaker 2>the smaller the world feels more places</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go.</v>

1351
00:58:44.941 --> 00:58:47.250
<v Speaker 2>The bigger the world feels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just feels bigger and bigger and</v>

1352
00:58:47.251 --> 00:58:49.540
<v Speaker 2>bigger because he realized like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1353
00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:50.910
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every country,</v>

1354
00:58:50.911 --> 00:58:53.130
<v Speaker 2>there's this county in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this town,</v>

1355
00:58:53.131 --> 00:58:54.690
<v Speaker 2>in this county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this street,</v>

1356
00:58:54.691 --> 00:58:57.120
<v Speaker 2>there's all these other streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these other people.</v>

1357
00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:02.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our shows were just a sliver of a place,</v>

1358
00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:04.020
<v Speaker 2>a tiny little sliver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1359
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:07.740
<v Speaker 2>you can go into Lego's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd go back to Lego and make 10 more</v>

1360
00:59:07.741 --> 00:59:10.680
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each one of them completely unique and</v>

1361
00:59:10.681 --> 00:59:11.730
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1362
00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:13.680
<v Speaker 2>the world's a big place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of shit</v>

1363
00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:15.120
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know,</v>

1364
00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now</v>

1365
00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 1>they're going to keep hearing shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1366
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long are they going to,</v>

1367
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.500
<v Speaker 1>how long are they going to do this for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have.</v>

1368
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.470
<v Speaker 1>How many did they have all told?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many they did?</v>

1369
00:59:27.471 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Five seasons.</v>

1370
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Actually it's an 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we're getting near 100 shows,</v>

1371
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never counted.</v>

1372
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:36.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know a lot of shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1373
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.843
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll keep her.</v>

1374
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I have it on my dvr so they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally run these marathons and</v>

1375
00:59:42.291 --> 00:59:44.840
<v Speaker 1>then I'll go to my dvr and there's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 new shows,</v>

1376
00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:48.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've watched a few of them the other</v>

1377

<v Speaker 1>night for the first time I watched it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

1378
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I posted a thing on instagram too about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because I,</v>

1379
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:58.640
<v Speaker 1>I was real reluctant to watch it after</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died.</v>

1380
00:59:58.641 --> 01:00:03.641
<v Speaker 1>But then I went on a bender wash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like binged watched like three of them</v>

1381
01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:04.970
<v Speaker 1>in the night.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's when Tony really came in.</v>

1391
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.220
<v Speaker 2>What do you do if he's not there for</v>
<v Speaker 2>narration?</v>

<v Speaker 2>so no narration now.</v>

1396
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have our sidekicks,</v>

1397
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:40.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to him.</v>

1398
01:00:40.681 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 2>We have his dialogue in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1399
01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.710
<v Speaker 2>but who's going to step in and do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>voice and how offensive would it be if</v>

1400
01:00:49.711 --> 01:00:50.930
<v Speaker 2>we did that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would happen</v>

1401
01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:54.430
<v Speaker 1>to be someone who is so close to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it didn't,</v>

1402
01:00:54.431 --> 01:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>it didn't freak everybody out and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be someone who was on the show a</v>

1403
01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just there with them always.</v>

1404
01:00:59.761 --> 01:01:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person doesn't really exist.</v>

1405
01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1406
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.300
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no voice there.</v>

1407
01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:07.040
<v Speaker 2>When you would give him a rough cut,</v>

1408
01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

1409
01:01:09.251 --> 01:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>a show on Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you.</v>

1410
01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>So he would take that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would watch it and then he would</v>

1411
01:01:13.351 --> 01:01:14.184
<v Speaker 1>start writing.</v>

1412
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1413
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:17.150
<v Speaker 2>getting back to process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd like,</v>

1414
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:21.890
<v Speaker 2>I'd send him an act right once it was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>rough cut form and then you get his</v>

1415
01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:25.160
<v Speaker 2>notes back because that was always kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a terrifying moment too because</v>

1416
01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:26.300
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1417
01:01:26.301 --> 01:01:29.060
<v Speaker 2>you worked on the thing a lot and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>send it off to him.</v>

1418
01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:30.720
<v Speaker 2>He can go one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1419
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got gutted a few times but I got a</v>

1420
01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.460
<v Speaker 2>couple that were like out fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing,</v>

1421
01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:39.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's all the notes he had.</v>

1422
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:42.200
<v Speaker 2>But you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd send them basically scratch</v>

1423
01:01:42.201 --> 01:01:44.120
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd say like here's what we're</v>

1424
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:45.170
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1425
01:01:45.171 --> 01:01:47.630
<v Speaker 2>is this kind of idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes here,</v>

1426
01:01:47.631 --> 01:01:50.240
<v Speaker 2>this kind of idea goes here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he would actually write it,</v>

1427
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get that writing back.</v>

1428
01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.500
<v Speaker 2>How long will it take for him to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that?</v>

1429
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh he ripped that shit out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1430
01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fast.</v>

1431
01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

1432
01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:00.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was never an email or a text that</v>

1433
01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:04.970
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get back to you because he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>no slouch man.</v>

1434
01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:06.410
<v Speaker 2>He liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was sharp,</v>

1435
01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:08.180
<v Speaker 2>he was on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd get back to you,</v>

1436
01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:10.160
<v Speaker 2>he'd do the work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1437
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:11.023
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1438
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:15.350
<v Speaker 2>when he took pride in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would talk about doing the work.</v>

1439
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1440
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:17.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did.</v>

1441
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another,</v>

1442
01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.510
<v Speaker 2>that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another thing that was so delightful</v>

1443
01:02:21.511 --> 01:02:22.440
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1444
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.590
<v Speaker 2>suddenly you're having to drag some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1445
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:27.470
<v Speaker 2>carcass along and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1446
01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.390
<v Speaker 2>prop them up in front of the camera and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1447
01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:34.740
<v Speaker 2>he was into it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like he had total ownership,</v>

1448
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 2>total control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

1449
01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Incredible creative ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible creative power.</v>

1450
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Like he was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1451
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:44.500
<v Speaker 2>and no show was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1452
01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.301
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1453
01:02:45.301 --> 01:02:47.610
<v Speaker 2>we can just kind of slipped by on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1454
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:51.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every show is important and when they,</v>

1455
01:02:51.331 --> 01:02:52.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they weren't working,</v>

1456
01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:54.030
<v Speaker 2>he was pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1457
01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.910
<v Speaker 2>and great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1458
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I think the biggest thing that I miss in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this process of cutting this Texas show</v>

1459
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:06.951
<v Speaker 2>that I'm doing now is not having the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure of him looking at it and being</v>

1460
01:03:08.581 --> 01:03:09.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1461
01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no man,</v>

1462
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:12.600
<v Speaker 2>this ain't working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1463
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.280
<v Speaker 2>that was a real benefit to us.</v>

1464
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.713
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1465
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:17.850
<v Speaker 1>When did he start smoking again?</v>

1466
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:21.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so weirdest thing,</v>

1467
01:03:21.141 --> 01:03:21.890
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1468
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really know his smoking again.</v>

1469
01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:29.210
<v Speaker 2>And then the police show came out and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just saw him light up on camera,</v>

1470
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:30.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1471
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we're doing this again.</v>

1472
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.920
<v Speaker 2>And then a couple of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a couple of my shows at the end,</v>

1473
01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.770
<v Speaker 2>he'd start just lighting up on Cameron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was always like,</v>

1474
01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:45.230
<v Speaker 2>that was always no go territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the past when he was smoking,</v>

1475
01:03:45.231 --> 01:03:47.280
<v Speaker 2>we would like stop shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1476
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden he was just lighting up</v>

1477
01:03:50.601 --> 01:03:53.700
<v Speaker 2>right on camera and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1478
01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.460
<v Speaker 2>shocked the shit out of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1479
01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I kind of looked around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crew liked w,</v>

1480
01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.120
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

1481
01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked because he said that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>his daughter was born is when he decided</v>

1482
01:04:03.061 --> 01:04:05.850
<v Speaker 1>to stop smoking because he realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1483
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had something else to live for that</v>

1484
01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:09.511
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1485
01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:14.511
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want to be on some cancer bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Iron Long.</v>

1486
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Having his daughter visit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1487
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:17.723
<v Speaker 1>So he quit.</v>

1488
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:18.893
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1489
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:22.130
<v Speaker 1>it was a bummer when you started again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1490
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:25.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he stop going to Jujitsu?</v>

1491
01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1492
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.613
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

1493
01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:33.030
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't as frequent during the end,</v>

1494
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1495
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.190
<v Speaker 2>during the last few episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we stopped kind of having to find</v>

1496
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:39.503
<v Speaker 2>gyms.</v>

1497
01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:41.143
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1498
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.000
<v Speaker 2>and we'd offer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1499
01:04:43.001 --> 01:04:44.210
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

1500
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the last couple of shows</v>

1501
01:04:47.111 --> 01:04:48.910
<v Speaker 2>would probably like that for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1502
01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.740
<v Speaker 2>you want to find local gym?</v>

1503
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

1504
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good man.</v>

1505
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>So was it within the last year or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or less.</v>

1506
01:04:58.171 --> 01:05:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Less than a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's the last year or so.</v>

1507
01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's when the smoking started.</v>

1508
01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe a little earlier in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1509
01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see someone quit and then go</v>

1510
01:05:10.331 --> 01:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>back on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the weirder it is of our</v>

1511
01:05:14.231 --> 01:05:15.064
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1512
01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Does he got through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1513
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:19.300
<v Speaker 2>he got through the really hard part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1514
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 2>couple of years under his belt and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look great man.</v>

1515
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:24.410
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1516
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.600
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1517
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.010
<v Speaker 2>he was doing really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

1518
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:32.350
<v Speaker 2>where do you go from here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do I go from?</v>

1519
01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

1520
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1521
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1522
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Tony Gay I think gave us tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 2>tools to,</v>

1523
01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:46.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for how we look at the world and like</v>

1524
01:05:46.211 --> 01:05:49.720
<v Speaker 2>how we will continue to go on looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and um,</v>

1525
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what show I'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know it will continue that kind of</v>

1526
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.740
<v Speaker 2>ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1527
01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.970
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1528
01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.930
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I have this very powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

1529
01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.433
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1530
01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.011
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1531
01:06:08.011 --> 01:06:11.850
<v Speaker 2>set of tools now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he kind of handed us and you know,</v>

1532
01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:12.923
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1533
01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>to go on and keep doing this work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1534
01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:22.470
<v Speaker 1>isn't the problem with this work that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need someone like him?</v>

1535
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:28.230
<v Speaker 1>He kind of need like either a Rinella</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a very unique person and in many</v>

1536
01:06:29.521 --> 01:06:32.130
<v Speaker 1>ways similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not self-destructive at all,</v>

1537
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:37.160
<v Speaker 1>but really meticulous about his work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very good writer as well and his</v>

1538
01:06:39.211 --> 01:06:41.520
<v Speaker 1>narration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that separates</v>

1539
01:06:41.521 --> 01:06:46.050
<v Speaker 1>mediator from any other show is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve has this eloquent narration</v>

1540
01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.980
<v Speaker 1>exactly that goes to it and it makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize like our perception of what it</v>

1541
01:06:49.981 --> 01:06:53.370
<v Speaker 1>means to be a hunter is based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes,</v>

1542
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.660
<v Speaker 1>negative stereotypes that this is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best example.</v>

1543
01:06:57.661 --> 01:07:02.661
<v Speaker 1>This is a really well read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant man who has a great passion</v>

1544
01:07:02.671 --> 01:07:07.500
<v Speaker 1>for the outdoors and for public lands</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for wildlife and for consuming</v>

1545
01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:08.970
<v Speaker 1>wildlife in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1546
01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:15.790
<v Speaker 1>this adventure of pursuing it and eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and cooking it and showing you the</v>

1547
01:07:17.001 --> 01:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>art of cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1548
01:07:19.281 --> 01:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>the that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be able to make meat eater</v>

1549
01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.160
<v Speaker 1>with pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1550
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I can't even talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the apocalypse.</v>

1551
01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:33.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1552
01:07:33.501 --> 01:07:34.460
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1553
01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:38.780
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately I enjoyed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1554
01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:44.110
<v Speaker 1>for all the wrong reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's justification to joining a pork</v>

1555
01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:45.050
<v Speaker 1>lips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1556
01:07:45.051 --> 01:07:47.420
<v Speaker 1>because you got Ted nugent with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine gun in the helicopter.</v>

1557
01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then two,</v>

1558
01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:54.580
<v Speaker 1>you have this real wild pig epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a legitimate epidemic in Texas and</v>

1559
01:07:54.921 --> 01:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>they don't know how to eradicate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>

1560
01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:00.160
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've been putting it on television</v>

1561
01:08:00.161 --> 01:08:03.400
<v Speaker 3>on a hunting show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really hunting,</v>

1562
01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:07.720
<v Speaker 3>it's assassinating out of a helicopter</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're laughing and that it's that</v>

1563
01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:09.460
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the mentality behind it.</v>

1564
01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:10.300
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1565
01:08:10.301 --> 01:08:11.051
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1566
01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:14.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying don't have fun on a hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've bet a lot of fun on hunts,</v>

1567
01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a great time on a hunt.</v>

1568
01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about,</v>

1569
01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1570
01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:21.140
<v Speaker 3>you know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1571
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Firing off a thousand rounds,</v>

1572
01:08:23.211 --> 01:08:25.620
<v Speaker 3>cackling inside of a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1573
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Laughing when you see pigs do</v>
<v Speaker 3>somersaults because you had shot at him.</v>

1574
01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.280
<v Speaker 3>A helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1575
01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:35.300
<v Speaker 3>I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think I think is one of the things I</v>

1576
01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:36.970
<v Speaker 3>really loved about Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1577
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:40.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or love still that I still love about</v>

1578
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:42.080
<v Speaker 3>Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1579
01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:47.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really poignant episode on that show</v>

1580
01:08:47.181 --> 01:08:47.580
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

1581
01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:52.580
<v Speaker 3>It was when we went up to Alaska and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're hunting black bear and uh,</v>

1582
01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:55.730
<v Speaker 3>and he decided not to take a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1583
01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a guy that loves animals as much</v>

1584
01:08:59.181 --> 01:09:03.480
<v Speaker 3>as he loves hunting animals as much as</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loves conservation of animals as much</v>

1585
01:09:03.481 --> 01:09:06.920
<v Speaker 3>as he loves the knowledge and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>science behind animals and the natural</v>

1586
01:09:06.921 --> 01:09:07.754
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1587
01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to me was appealing.</v>

1588
01:09:10.641 --> 01:09:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Like that's something I can sink my</v>
<v Speaker 3>teeth into,</v>

1589
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.650
<v Speaker 3>dedicate my efforts towards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1590
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.350
<v Speaker 3>from working on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1591
01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 3>it was a crazy show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1592
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:21.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to him about it and his sort of</v>

1593
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:24.560
<v Speaker 3>idea of why he didn't do it was so</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

1594
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:26.710
<v Speaker 3>He just kind of went with his feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1595
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.460
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1596
01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.320
<v Speaker 3>To have a hunting show where you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear,</v>

1597
01:09:30.321 --> 01:09:33.410
<v Speaker 3>which is what you're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lined up in your scope and go,</v>

1598
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:35.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it.</v>

1599
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:36.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm not feeling it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1600
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:39.050
<v Speaker 3>I loved what he said to at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was like,</v>

1601
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I'm never going to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bear again.</v>

1602
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:46.360
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want to shoot a bear today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not gonna and that I,</v>

1603
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:47.480
<v Speaker 3>that was a big moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1604
01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:48.090
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1605
01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:49.790
<v Speaker 3>that's the words coming out of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>

1606
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:53.810
<v Speaker 3>How conflicted must his perception be to</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that?</v>

1607
01:09:53.811 --> 01:09:55.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm filming a show where I'm actively</v>

1608
01:09:55.821 --> 01:09:58.670
<v Speaker 3>hunting bears his camera people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a budget behind it.</v>

1609
01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Now I have to make a show about my</v>
<v Speaker 3>decision to not have to bear and then</v>

1610
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:05.960
<v Speaker 3>next week I'm going to go hunt something</v>
<v Speaker 3>else and then the next week I'm going to</v>

1611
01:10:05.961 --> 01:10:07.520
<v Speaker 3>go hudson something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1612
01:10:07.521 --> 01:10:12.290
<v Speaker 3>But I mean that like his ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like admit and kind of understand</v>

1613
01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:17.240
<v Speaker 3>that the human being is a complex animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with complex emotions and that,</v>

1614
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:20.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of just kind of uniform</v>

1615
01:10:20.781 --> 01:10:24.230
<v Speaker 3>direction of the human mind is like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>total fallacy.</v>

1616
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:26.480
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all over the fucking place,</v>

1617
01:10:26.481 --> 01:10:27.680
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

1618
01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really bought in at that moment if I</v>

1619
01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:34.190
<v Speaker 3>hadn't before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I completely kind of had,</v>

1620
01:10:34.191 --> 01:10:36.560
<v Speaker 3>but I really bought in at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1621
01:10:36.561 --> 01:10:37.400
<v Speaker 3>whew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1622
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:39.650
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy I can always stand behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1623
01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.510
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brave.</v>

1624
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:45.680
<v Speaker 3>It was brave because you realized this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is on the sportsman's network.</v>

1625
01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the sportsmans channel and they have</v>

1626
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:50.150
<v Speaker 3>only hunting shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1627
01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:53.570
<v Speaker 3>And then he's on a hunting show with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>got all these people that are watching</v>

1628
01:10:53.571 --> 01:10:58.190
<v Speaker 3>that would kill to be on a hunt like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and to have a big old bear in their</v>

1629
01:10:58.191 --> 01:11:00.260
<v Speaker 3>sites what they want and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

1630
01:11:00.261 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 3>we're going to see Steve shoot this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we're going to see them cook up a</v>

1631
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:08.021
<v Speaker 3>bear rose and he's getting a c stewed</v>
<v Speaker 3>carrots and onions and potatoes and</v>

1632
01:11:08.241 --> 01:11:09.580
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be amazing and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>

1633
01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's like,</v>

1634
01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:12.800
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1635
01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.240
<v Speaker 3>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're</v>

1636
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:17.980
<v Speaker 2>really nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when the episode came out was</v>

1637
01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.920
<v Speaker 2>this and when we had done a few things</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

1638
01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 2>like we had failed at a hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1639
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had taken shots that missed in the</v>

1640
01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:27.870
<v Speaker 2>hunt failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had gone on a mountain lion hunt</v>

1641
01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:29.100
<v Speaker 2>where we never even thought mountain</v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

1642
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:30.840
<v Speaker 2>Those were all kind of moments where</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1643
01:11:30.841 --> 01:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>will this work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we put this out in the hunting</v>

1644
01:11:33.121 --> 01:11:35.580
<v Speaker 2>community?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will they respond to it in every one of</v>

1645
01:11:35.581 --> 01:11:38.700
<v Speaker 2>those had kind of like hit or worked and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people actually appreciate it</v>

1646
01:11:38.701 --> 01:11:41.040
<v Speaker 2>because of the realism of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1647
01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:43.200
<v Speaker 2>that one was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you,</v>

1648
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:49.280
<v Speaker 2>can you put out a show where there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly legitimate shot at a very high</v>

1649
01:11:50.821 --> 01:11:53.040
<v Speaker 2>percentage shot at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1650
01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:57.450
<v Speaker 2>at exactly the animal we're going after</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the choice to not take the shot,</v>

1651
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:59.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are People gonna Respond?</v>

1652
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were like,</v>

1653
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:04.380
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly how you feel.</v>

1654
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:06.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was incredible,</v>

1655
01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:07.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1656
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:12.390
<v Speaker 2>it was like this moment and I don't mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bag on anyone else,</v>

1657
01:12:12.391 --> 01:12:14.280
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know that much about hunting</v>

1658
01:12:14.281 --> 01:12:16.470
<v Speaker 2>shows before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1659
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I know that a lot of what I saw I found</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be really,</v>

1660
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.740
<v Speaker 2>really either uninteresting or just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stupid,</v>

1661
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1662
01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1663
01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that it was like this moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>where like,</v>

1664
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.491
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1665
01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:30.780
<v Speaker 2>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1666
01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.940
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this industry is like,</v>

1667
01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:37.560
<v Speaker 2>missed a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big part of who the people you know,</v>

1668
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.410
<v Speaker 2>that are paying attention here are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1669
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:43.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to just go like sell</v>

1670
01:12:43.441 --> 01:12:45.030
<v Speaker 2>arrowheads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1671
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.490
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1672
01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.860
<v Speaker 2>and cackle hanging out of a helicopter.</v>

1673
01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's worst case example,</v>

1674
01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:01.360
<v Speaker 1>but for some hunting people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of a deeply indoctrinated into</v>

1675
01:13:02.331 --> 01:13:03.950
<v Speaker 1>the world of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't mind that show.</v>

1676
01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.370
<v Speaker 1>None of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he listened and no power,</v>

1677
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:07.263
<v Speaker 2>more power to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1691
01:13:33.381 --> 01:13:37.340

1692
01:13:37.341 --> 01:13:40.580
<v Speaker 1>hunting for a lot of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>become fans of his show the same way</v>

1693
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:43.280
<v Speaker 1>that Tony sort of changed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>

1694

<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>End of cooking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1696
01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:46.610
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1697
01:13:46.611 --> 01:13:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1698
01:13:49.041 --> 01:13:52.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not like terrence malick or</v>

1699
01:13:52.401 --> 01:13:54.820
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I got a lot to offer and I got</v>

1700
01:13:54.821 --> 01:13:56.210
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a career.</v>

1701
01:13:56.690 --> 01:14:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna I'm not going to dedicate</v>
<v Speaker 2>my career to these people unless I</v>

1702
01:14:00.261 --> 01:14:02.660
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really believe in what they're doing.</v>

1703
01:14:02.661 --> 01:14:07.580
<v Speaker 2>And like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are two cases of people really</v>

1704
01:14:07.581 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>believe in man because they were willing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at an industry or look at</v>

1705
01:14:12.071 --> 01:14:14.290
<v Speaker 2>something that they loved and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1706
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I have a completely different take on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1707
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:19.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1708
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:22.030

<v Speaker 2>And in both cases at work,</v>

1709
01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:24.820
<v Speaker 2>because they're both super smart,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1745
01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:09.870
<v Speaker 2>just bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who does not have trouble,</v>

1746
01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:11.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enduring during a lot of physical</v>

1747
01:16:11.761 --> 01:16:13.870
<v Speaker 2>discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1748
01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.700
<v Speaker 2>and that was what was kind of exciting</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the show too,</v>

1749
01:16:16.701 --> 01:16:19.890
<v Speaker 2>is he was really like willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>integrate that stuff into the</v>

1750
01:16:19.891 --> 01:16:20.880
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1751
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.710
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like we need to go out,</v>

1752
01:16:25.711 --> 01:16:28.860
<v Speaker 2>we need the perfect kill shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to set this up.</v>

1753
01:16:28.861 --> 01:16:30.480
<v Speaker 2>When you said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Kinda like,</v>

1754
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to go out and we're</v>

1755
01:16:32.551 --> 01:16:35.730
<v Speaker 2>going to see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to kind of grit our teeth</v>

1756
01:16:35.731 --> 01:16:38.280
<v Speaker 2>and bear it no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1757
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:40.380
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the journey takes us and we're</v>

1758
01:16:40.381 --> 01:16:42.800
<v Speaker 2>just going to document that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1759
01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:46.860
<v Speaker 2>that was super exciting television to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make at that time too,</v>

1760
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:47.803
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1761
01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I've done five episodes of his show and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we struck out on two of them,</v>

1762
01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:55.070
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1763
01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:58.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be.</v>

1764
01:16:58.581 --> 01:17:00.620
<v Speaker 1>They will never air shows like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1765
01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that they aired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1766
01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a lot of people will be like,</v>

1767
01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:06.391
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1768
01:17:06.391 --> 01:17:07.230
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1769
01:17:07.231 --> 01:17:11.660
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not sure that they aired a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of failed hunts before we started doing</v>

1770
01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:13.010
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they did.</v>

1771
01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was a popular thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've been done before,</v>

1772
01:17:16.411 --> 01:17:19.800
<v Speaker 1>but not to the extent the way Steve did</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite episodes.</v>

1773
01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.960
<v Speaker 1>He never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never shot a deer.</v>

1774
01:17:22.050 --> 01:17:27.050
<v Speaker 1>It was talking about his dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was brilliant and I think that was</v>

1775
01:17:27.511 --> 01:17:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Alaska as well,</v>

1776
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:31.290
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was,</v>

1777
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a blacktail hunt,</v>

1778
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:35.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe it wasn't Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1779
01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it was a cruise deer hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1780
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:39.530
<v Speaker 2>And Arizona.</v>

1781
01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:44.860
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the show was him using a</v>

1782
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:48.950
<v Speaker 1>spotting scope and binoculars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for deer and talking about his</v>

1783
01:17:48.951 --> 01:17:51.860
<v Speaker 1>relationship with his father and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was no music.</v>

1784
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Whoever edited it and put it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was brilliant.</v>

1785
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:55.304
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

1786
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was,</v>

1787
01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:57.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some heavy,</v>

1788
01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:01.690
<v Speaker 1>heavy duty shit and it sort of makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize like,</v>

1789
01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:03.590
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where you came from.</v>

1790
01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:05.180
<v Speaker 1>You came from a hard man.</v>

1791
01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:06.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1792
01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Taskmaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1793
01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1794
01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:13.720
<v Speaker 2>that was a brilliant episode is also</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1795
01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1796
01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:19.290
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I liked so much about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that episode too is it feels so much</v>

1797
01:18:19.291 --> 01:18:21.360
<v Speaker 2>like the process of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1798
01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:26.030
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long hours with people really kinda</v>

1799
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:28.110
<v Speaker 2>getting deep into stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1800
01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:30.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did an episode with him too.</v>

1801
01:18:30.181 --> 01:18:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't aired yet.</v>

1802
01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a lot of that I lead it like</v>

1803
01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.450
<v Speaker 2>just talking about life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1804
01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed that part of Vietnam</v>

1805
01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:43.430
<v Speaker 2>with him until a written spending those</v>
<v Speaker 2>long hours just sitting glassing hills,</v>

1806
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:46.270
<v Speaker 2>like talking about our families and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1807
01:18:46.271 --> 01:18:48.860
<v Speaker 2>plans for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1808
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:51.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was nice,</v>

1809
01:18:51.721 --> 01:18:52.800
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened.</v>

1810
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you how lucky I feel in my</v>

1811
01:18:55.621 --> 01:18:58.680
<v Speaker 2>career to like landed with these folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1812
01:18:58.950 --> 01:19:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great one too,</v>

1813
01:19:00.721 --> 01:19:01.770
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two,</v>

1814
01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:02.980
<v Speaker 1>those two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1815
01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:07.140
<v Speaker 1>But like we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real hard to find those kind of</v>

1816
01:19:07.141 --> 01:19:09.240
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of those kinds of guys</v>

1817
01:19:09.241 --> 01:19:10.074
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

1818
01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:12.650
<v Speaker 2>There's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1819
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:13.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1820
01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:17.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like there's more of what they</v>

1821
01:19:17.391 --> 01:19:19.970
<v Speaker 2>call premium content now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1822
01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:25.120
<v Speaker 2>on tv there's more people looking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that have more substance to it.</v>

1823
01:19:25.731 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 2>But that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think has happened?</v>

1824
01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:29.480
<v Speaker 2>What's the shift?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1825
01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:30.141
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1826
01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:31.670
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I don't really know.</v>

1827
01:19:31.671 --> 01:19:35.450
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in development so I'm not really</v>

1828
01:19:35.451 --> 01:19:36.284
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1829
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:39.200
<v Speaker 2>a place to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1830
01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:44.620
<v Speaker 2>I get the feeling that outlets like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix have really shaken up the,</v>

1831
01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:45.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the paradigm,</v>

1832
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:48.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Internet in general has</v>

1833
01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:53.051
<v Speaker 2>changed people's expectations and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uncensored content is so prevalent</v>

1834
01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.560
<v Speaker 2>and so much more attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>

1835
01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.700
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just changed,</v>

1836
01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:00.840
<v Speaker 2>changed the way people absorb things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1837
01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1838
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:05.760
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1839
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:06.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1840
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Netflix is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent a lot of money.</v>

1841
01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:12.090
<v Speaker 2>They've taken a lot of swings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all of those swings of Hit,</v>

1842
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:17.390
<v Speaker 2>but they've been pretty brave in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like how much and how would a wide</v>

1843
01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 2>range of content they've been willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take on.</v>

1844
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:22.560
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

1845
01:20:22.561 --> 01:20:23.071
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1846
01:20:23.071 --> 01:20:23.670
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1847
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:27.080
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's part of what's driving it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1848
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1849
01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:31.350
<v Speaker 2>I've been lucky enough to land at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said before,</v>

1850
01:20:31.351 --> 01:20:35.550
<v Speaker 2>like zero point zero with Chris and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lydia there and their ethos of,</v>

1851
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:40.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making content that like has a purpose,</v>

1852
01:20:40.171 --> 01:20:43.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that works towards bettering,</v>

1853
01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world or showing people something</v>

1854
01:20:45.961 --> 01:20:48.840
<v Speaker 2>about the world or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connecting people.</v>

1855
01:20:48.841 --> 01:20:51.660
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's probably been the greatest</v>

1856
01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:52.980
<v Speaker 2>gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what brought me in a Tony.</v>

1857
01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what brought me to Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1858
01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a connection with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are people out there that want</v>

1859
01:20:58.891 --> 01:21:02.210
<v Speaker 2>to use the medium to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1860

<v Speaker 3>American entrepreneurship is supposed to</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's just rare that something comes</v>

1951
01:24:48.281 --> 01:24:49.510
<v Speaker 3>along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is controversial,</v>

1952
01:24:49.511 --> 01:24:53.140
<v Speaker 3>but yet also lucrative has marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 3>sales and then all of a sudden it's</v>

1953
01:24:53.141 --> 01:24:54.760
<v Speaker 3>legal in the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1957
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:02.260
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The controversial part of that episode</v>

1958
01:25:02.261 --> 01:25:05.080
<v Speaker 3>was not Tony Smoking because that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal.</v>

1959
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:10.090
<v Speaker 3>It's perfectly fine for him to smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was when he handed the joint to me</v>

1960
01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:13.270
<v Speaker 3>over the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one was a little.</v>

1961
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that was a little tough for some</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks to swallow as well because.</v>

1962
01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1963
01:25:19.961 --> 01:25:21.250
<v Speaker 3>but he's working too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geez,</v>

1965
01:25:23.171 --> 01:25:24.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought of it that way.</v>

1966
01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I guess he was working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1967
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.700
<v Speaker 3>he's worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1968
01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:33.190
<v Speaker 3>I guess is the idea that you're holding</v>
<v Speaker 3>machinery the Hollingsworth.</v>

1969
01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:36.360
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shout out to the Hollingsworth's</v>

1970
01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Hollingsworth farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollingsworth far.</v>

1971
01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:39.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>

1972
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why was it,</v>

1973
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:45.190
<v Speaker 3>I guess because maybe they're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're holding a machine that's real</v>

1974
01:25:45.191 --> 01:25:48.070
<v Speaker 3>expensive gas man or the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they,</v>

1975
01:25:48.071 --> 01:25:49.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want the perception that we</v>

1976
01:25:49.781 --> 01:25:52.510
<v Speaker 3>were just partying and out of control in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the field and we,</v>

1977
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:54.250
<v Speaker 3>and we weren't man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1978
01:25:54.251 --> 01:25:55.870
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're professionals.</v>

1979
01:25:55.871 --> 01:25:57.460
<v Speaker 3>So did CNN have a problem with it?</v>

1980
01:25:59.950 --> 01:26:01.960
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe there were elements at</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN.</v>

1981
01:26:01.961 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Someone might've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone must have chimed in,</v>

1982
01:26:04.101 --> 01:26:05.120
<v Speaker 3>but in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1983
01:26:05.121 --> 01:26:06.900
<v Speaker 3>to their credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the end I left,</v>

1984
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they left us alone.</v>

1985
01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:09.213
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1986
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:11.150
<v Speaker 3>that's the only way would make a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1987
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:12.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as I was fucking cook,</v>

1988
01:26:12.771 --> 01:26:16.550
<v Speaker 3>start coming into the kitchen and still</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wanting to add ingredients.</v>

1989
01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:17.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the whole industry.</v>

1990
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.360
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the process on believable.</v>

1991
01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why this was so refreshing.</v>

1992
01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:26.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how rare is it not to get,</v>

1993
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:28.040
<v Speaker 3>not to have people just breathing down</v>
<v Speaker 3>your neck.</v>

1994
01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:32.150
<v Speaker 3>All the ton of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with mediator because Steven</v>

1995
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Rinella came from the wild within,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a show that that's where I met</v>

1996
01:26:36.051 --> 01:26:38.360
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him from that show and I had him</v>

1997
01:26:38.361 --> 01:26:42.020
<v Speaker 3>on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that show was a fucking goat rope.</v>

1998
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:45.410
<v Speaker 3>He was telling me that they were trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to let animals loose out of cages and</v>

1999
01:26:45.411 --> 01:26:47.830
<v Speaker 3>then he would shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were the early days when they're</v>

2000
01:26:47.890 --> 01:26:49.160
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then when they were like,</v>

2001
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:52.220
<v Speaker 3>there were line items in for like animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrangler and like,</v>

2002
01:26:52.221 --> 01:26:54.320
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to everyone's credit and like very</v>

2003
01:26:54.321 --> 01:26:56.660
<v Speaker 3>quickly at zero point zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very quickly with Steve,</v>

2004
01:26:56.661 --> 01:26:57.620
<v Speaker 3>there were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2005
01:26:57.621 --> 01:26:59.270
<v Speaker 3>we don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not doing that.</v>

2006
01:26:59.330 --> 01:27:03.300
<v Speaker 3>But it's hilarious at a producer</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually came up with that idea like,</v>

2007
01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.490
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how to do this.</v>

2008
01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Producer didn't know it sounded like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>producer came up with that idea.</v>

2009
01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:12.020
<v Speaker 3>That was just a playbook on how you make</v>
<v Speaker 3>tv just pulling from the playbook for</v>

2010
01:27:12.021 --> 01:27:12.771
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2011
01:27:12.771 --> 01:27:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean air quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV.</v>

2012
01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2013
01:27:15.711 --> 01:27:17.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad show.</v>

2014
01:27:17.421 --> 01:27:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2015
01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:20.960
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of huge mistakes in that</v>

2016
01:27:20.961 --> 01:27:22.370
<v Speaker 3>show and a lot of bullshit.</v>

2017
01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:24.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>though it was,</v>

2018
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:29.000
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a pretty revolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a pretty interesting show in a lot of</v>

2019
01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:30.040
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2020
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:32.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of truth in there too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2021
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:36.290
<v Speaker 3>we did end up going out and just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on hunts,</v>

2022
01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a very high pressure situation,</v>

2023
01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:43.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also like this is very typical of</v>

2024
01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:46.760
<v Speaker 3>kind of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the way that television works,</v>

2025
01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.830
<v Speaker 3>there's like still as we're out in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>field,</v>

2026
01:27:48.831 --> 01:27:53.510
<v Speaker 3>there's still at the network a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of infighting and jostling about</v>

2027
01:27:53.511 --> 01:27:55.860
<v Speaker 3>what the show actually was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this a,</v>

2028
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:58.370
<v Speaker 3>is this history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>

2029
01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:00.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality?</v>

2030
01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Is this subsistence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2031
01:28:02.691 --> 01:28:04.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember at one point someone saying</v>

2032
01:28:04.941 --> 01:28:05.631
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2033
01:28:05.631 --> 01:28:07.040
<v Speaker 3>it's not a hunting show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2034
01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:10.340
<v Speaker 3>and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like in the field covered in fucking</v>

2035
01:28:10.341 --> 01:28:11.710
<v Speaker 3>moose blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2036
01:28:11.711 --> 01:28:13.290
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2037
01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.290
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a hunting show from where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm standing,</v>

2038
01:28:15.410 --> 01:28:16.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2039
01:28:16.050 --> 01:28:17.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to say.</v>

2040
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:19.640
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying it's not a hunting show?</v>

2041
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's,</v>

2042
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:23.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember who that was,</v>

2043
01:28:23.751 --> 01:28:28.120
<v Speaker 3>but I think that they were very leery of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of like a hunting show.</v>

2044
01:28:28.330 --> 01:28:31.550
<v Speaker 3>What was the subsistence shows that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have?</v>

2045
01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:35.990
<v Speaker 3>They're all hunting and gathering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is like one of the more</v>

2046
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.030
<v Speaker 3>popular shows on all of these cable</v>
<v Speaker 3>channels where these,</v>

2047
01:28:39.090 --> 01:28:42.050
<v Speaker 3>these people that live in Alaska and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trapping now.</v>

2048
01:28:42.051 --> 01:28:42.741
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot.</v>

2049
01:28:42.741 --> 01:28:43.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2050
01:28:43.461 --> 01:28:44.830
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's crazy.</v>

2051
01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:47.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean not John,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're really exploded after that.</v>

2052
01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's something very</v>

2053
01:28:49.011 --> 01:28:49.880
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2054
01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:51.680
<v Speaker 3>when you take like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2055
01:28:51.681 --> 01:28:53.480
<v Speaker 3>when you take like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2056
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:57.710
<v Speaker 3>for some reason when you take Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the New York City intellectual and you</v>

2057
01:28:57.711 --> 01:29:00.050
<v Speaker 3>put them in that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a different reaction</v>

2058
01:29:00.051 --> 01:29:01.260
<v Speaker 3>then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2059
01:29:01.261 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 3>these people live</v>

2060
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.720
<v Speaker 2>in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like watching pygmies hunt,</v>

2061
01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:05.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are these certain days,</v>

2062
01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.740
<v Speaker 2>this is the natural environment of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2063
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:11.250
<v Speaker 2>and that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so hunting is acceptable under those</v>

2064
01:29:11.251 --> 01:29:12.270
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2065
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:15.000
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why isn't it acceptable for someone who</v>

2066
01:29:15.001 --> 01:29:18.750
<v Speaker 2>like lives it as like a base philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their life.</v>

2067
01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Give them a chance to explain why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2068
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.480
<v Speaker 2>But he lives in Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you ever hunt,</v>

2069
01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in Brooklyn,</v>

2070
01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 2>just go to the shopping center.</v>

2071
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2072
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Well you must be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there must be something wrong with you</v>

2073
01:29:31.081 --> 01:29:31.914
<v Speaker 3>if you enjoy it.</v>

2074
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2075
01:29:33.010 --> 01:29:35.510
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of the mentality.</v>

2076
01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Address</v>

2077
01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:37.790
<v Speaker 3>on the show too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2078
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I remember one of the first times tony</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot a deer on the show and then they</v>

2079
01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:43.140
<v Speaker 3>cooked it at that same guys restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

2080
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:47.160
<v Speaker 3>exactly what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marco Pierre White at his restaurant and</v>

2081
01:29:47.161 --> 01:29:50.280
<v Speaker 3>they shot a deer and Marco put the blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Tony's head.</v>

2082
01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2083
01:29:51.241 --> 01:29:52.890
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to do and you get your</v>
<v Speaker 3>first kill.</v>

2084
01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.550
<v Speaker 3>And then um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went and cooked it and it was a,</v>

2085
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:58.590
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

2086
01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:03.540
<v Speaker 3>there was one time where he shot a pig</v>
<v Speaker 3>at point blank range with a pistol and I</v>

2087
01:30:03.541 --> 01:30:04.111
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2088
01:30:04.111 --> 01:30:05.550
<v Speaker 3>they put that on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a big.</v>

2089
01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.550
<v Speaker 3>That was a big moment for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tell you talked about that a lot.</v>

2090
01:30:08.710 --> 01:30:09.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2091
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:11.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2092
01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:13.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he um,</v>

2093
01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.120
<v Speaker 2>that was Cajun country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2094
01:30:15.121 --> 01:30:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2095
01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

2096
01:30:21.211 --> 01:30:23.460
<v Speaker 2>I think the story goes that he liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

2097
01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:27.150
<v Speaker 2>they asked him to kill the pig and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes up and like just very,</v>

2098
01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:30.390
<v Speaker 2>very coldly double taps the pig in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

2099
01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:35.340
<v Speaker 2>And I think that he says there's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>this moment of silence amongst the</v>

2100
01:30:35.341 --> 01:30:36.174
<v Speaker 2>crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2101
01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:39.000
<v Speaker 2>oh Geez man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that,</v>

2102
01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:42.570
<v Speaker 2>that was cold dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they expect?</v>

2103
01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was like,</v>

2104
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:48.060
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would talk about it as if like a gasp</v>

2105
01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:50.260
<v Speaker 2>came up from the crowd was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>

2106
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:51.360
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2107
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.650
<v Speaker 2>the Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2108
01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:56.460
<v Speaker 2>like was like a mob hit or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:30:56.490 --> 01:31:00.420
<v Speaker 2>I think one is enough for a pig blank</v>
<v Speaker 2>range.</v>

2110
01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I've seen animals shot in the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2111
01:31:02.071 --> 01:31:05.420
<v Speaker 2>That could have used another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2112
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think especially with Jesus</v>

2113
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:11.730
<v Speaker 3>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a couple of pigs go real ugly.</v>

2114
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:16.680
<v Speaker 3>So double tap is totally acceptable to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me because when a pig goes bad,</v>

2115
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:20.400
<v Speaker 3>it's really not pleasant for anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2116
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's also,</v>

2117
01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.590
<v Speaker 3>you don't want an animal ever to suffer</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>

2118
01:31:25.650 --> 01:31:28.140
<v Speaker 3>Exactly see it's still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but another one in it.</v>

2119
01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.610
<v Speaker 3>That's always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.440
<v Speaker 3>Bow Hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rifle hunting.</v>

2121
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:33.900
<v Speaker 3>If it's still standing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put another one in it.</v>

2122
01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2123
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:36.320
<v Speaker 3>Or suffering in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2124
01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:38.190
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2125
01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:39.083
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2126
01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like kind of a responsibility you</v>

2127
01:31:42.141 --> 01:31:44.390
<v Speaker 2>take on yourself when you decide to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt.</v>

2128
01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:46.940
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2129
01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.800
<v Speaker 2>when I made that decision and I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>on two hunts now with Steve,</v>

2130
01:31:51.801 --> 01:31:55.130
<v Speaker 2>I've shot two deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like a very clear kind of</v>

2131
01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:56.660
<v Speaker 2>aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2132
01:31:56.661 --> 01:31:57.081
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2133
01:31:57.081 --> 01:32:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking responsibility now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only like this animal's life,</v>

2134
01:32:01.031 --> 01:32:06.031
<v Speaker 2>but for this animal's pain and suffering</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the consequences of my actions,</v>

2135
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:09.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not going to be lobbing off any</v>

2136
01:32:09.701 --> 01:32:11.670
<v Speaker 2>750 yard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2137
01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.830
<v Speaker 2>rifle shots because I'm not qualified to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

2138
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:19.840
<v Speaker 2>And it's irresponsible to the animal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the potential suffering that you can</v>

2139
01:32:19.841 --> 01:32:21.460
<v Speaker 2>cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2140
01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:24.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or losing the animal or you know,</v>

2141
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.210
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2142
01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>

2143
01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:30.840
<v Speaker 2>I guess that all comes from Steve</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

2144
01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:31.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2145
01:32:31.930 --> 01:32:34.880
<v Speaker 3>at least he's got such strong ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2146
01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:36.400
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2147
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:39.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean it became really clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2148
01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:42.290
<v Speaker 3>with me just knowing him that this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

2149
01:32:42.291 --> 01:32:43.490
<v Speaker 3>he's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a very,</v>

2150
01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:45.920
<v Speaker 3>very powerful moral compass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2151
01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Core set of beliefs that are just non</v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiable.</v>

2152
01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both of them.</v>

2153
01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Tony and Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Tony,</v>

2154
01:32:53.281 --> 01:32:57.060
<v Speaker 2>his moral compass is rock solid as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2155
01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:00.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any mistakes that he may have made in</v>

2156
01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:04.020
<v Speaker 2>his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can honestly say he made them with his</v>

2157
01:33:04.021 --> 01:33:07.200
<v Speaker 2>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made him with his moral compass in</v>

2158
01:33:07.201 --> 01:33:11.190
<v Speaker 2>mind and making his best attempt to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to follow that,</v>

2159
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:13.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2160
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:14.070
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2161
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:16.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was something that was,</v>

2162
01:33:16.161 --> 01:33:19.190
<v Speaker 2>it was really nice to be around a</v>
<v Speaker 2>refreshing of urine,</v>

2163
01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2164
01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:25.040
<v Speaker 3>Brian especially in this world of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>with gimmicks trying to become more</v>

2165
01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:30.150
<v Speaker 3>popular and more well known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had put zero effort into that.</v>

2166
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2167
01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:33.810
<v Speaker 3>just the basic philosophy of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to fake anything.</v>

2168
01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:37.050
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to do second takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not gonna know what the one where</v>

2169
01:33:37.051 --> 01:33:40.950
<v Speaker 3>they were thrown frozen octopus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like a really famous story,</v>

2170
01:33:40.951 --> 01:33:42.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Sicily episode.</v>

2171
01:33:42.691 --> 01:33:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he describes that is like the,</v>

2172
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:47.520
<v Speaker 3>maybe the darkest existential moment of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his life,</v>

2173
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:48.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

2174
01:33:48.930 --> 01:33:51.780
<v Speaker 3>who is throwing the fake octa?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The frozen side kicks,</v>

2175
01:33:51.870 --> 01:33:56.370
<v Speaker 3>so they set up these sidekicks who were</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the guy who was running the fishing</v>

2176
01:33:56.371 --> 01:33:59.460
<v Speaker 3>operation will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess they were the psychics and the</v>

2177
01:33:59.461 --> 01:34:01.890
<v Speaker 3>scene that we're gonna work with Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2178
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:06.090
<v Speaker 3>So the way you'd set a scene up normally</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that is you'd have like a psychic,</v>

2179
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:07.590
<v Speaker 3>someone who's going to talk to Tony and</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>

2180
01:34:07.591 --> 01:34:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do?</v>

2181
01:34:08.650 --> 01:34:09.451
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go out.</v>

2182
01:34:09.451 --> 01:34:13.840
<v Speaker 3>And the sidekick would be a local,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a local or</v>

2183
01:34:13.890 --> 01:34:16.150
<v Speaker 2>an expert in something or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fisherman.</v>

2184
01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Probably in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't on that trust.</v>

2185
01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2186
01:34:20.970 --> 01:34:21.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'd be like,</v>

2187
01:34:21.631 --> 01:34:22.520
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go walk to us.</v>

2188
01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you know someone who fishes octopus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2189
01:34:25.231 --> 01:34:27.420
<v Speaker 2>I know so and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll go out with them.</v>

2190
01:34:27.421 --> 01:34:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2191
01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:32.760
<v Speaker 2>but it turned out that they went to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this very crowded beach,</v>

2192
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:34.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think even in the scene,</v>

2193
01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:39.580
<v Speaker 3>can we really catch activists?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just like people swimming or a</v>

2194
01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.530
<v Speaker 3>kids with like a snorkel masks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2195
01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:42.761
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2196
01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:43.151
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2197
01:34:43.151 --> 01:34:44.640
<v Speaker 3>Everything's gonna be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's gonna be fine.</v>

2198
01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:47.680
<v Speaker 3>He got in the water and he starts</v>
<v Speaker 3>hearing these plops.</v>

2199
01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.590
<v Speaker 3>It looks above him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is these dead octopus,</v>

2200
01:34:50.591 --> 01:34:53.740
<v Speaker 3>like floating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drifting down to the bottom of the</v>

2201
01:34:53.741 --> 01:34:56.470
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're lobbing them in off the boat and</v>

2202
01:34:56.471 --> 01:34:59.060
<v Speaker 3>then picking them up as of late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got an octopus,</v>

2203
01:34:59.350 --> 01:35:00.620
<v Speaker 3>a got one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2204
01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.540
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think again,</v>

2205
01:35:02.541 --> 01:35:07.541
<v Speaker 3>like most TV shows that do exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know like where's the octopus</v>

2206
01:35:08.391 --> 01:35:12.470
<v Speaker 3>wrangler and for Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that was always completely</v>

2207
01:35:12.471 --> 01:35:16.700
<v Speaker 3>unacceptable way to make tv.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he had no idea it was going to happen</v>

2208
01:35:16.701 --> 01:35:18.030
<v Speaker 3>before it started happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2209
01:35:18.031 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started happening.</v>

2210
01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.930
<v Speaker 3>What did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2211
01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:24.890
<v Speaker 3>he left and went to the beach in order</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like get like seven Negroni's in a</v>

2212
01:35:24.891 --> 01:35:25.580
<v Speaker 3>row.</v>

2213
01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:29.840
<v Speaker 3>He was really bummed out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw him two weeks later in Tokyo and</v>

2214
01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:32.090
<v Speaker 3>he was still talking about it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I just,</v>

2215
01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.590
<v Speaker 3>I just had the worst experience of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2216
01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Worst thing that ever happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the darkest moment of my life,</v>

2217
01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:41.230
<v Speaker 3>the darkest moment of throwing frozen</v>
<v Speaker 3>octopuses to the water,</v>

2218
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:46.100
<v Speaker 3>completely went against the whole ethos</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the show,</v>

2219
01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:49.570
<v Speaker 3>but he made fun of it on the shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

2220
01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.140
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great scene.</v>

2221
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great scene.</v>

2222
01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:57.690
<v Speaker 3>It largely because Sally Freeman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the producer of that is like absolutely</v>

2223
01:35:58.281 --> 01:36:01.430
<v Speaker 3>brilliant and one of the best directors</v>
<v Speaker 3>has ever come through that show.</v>

2224
01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:06.290
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was funny to take on realizing that</v>

2225
01:36:06.291 --> 01:36:08.450
<v Speaker 3>they were throwing frozen octopus into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water.</v>

2226
01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how mortified he was bi at all.</v>

2227
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:13.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

2228
01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:16.010
<v Speaker 3>But I mean I bet that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's,</v>

2229
01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:17.760
<v Speaker 3>that's the way it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2230
01:36:17.770 --> 01:36:19.970
<v Speaker 3>like we didn't go in and like be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2231
01:36:19.971 --> 01:36:21.140
<v Speaker 3>action and now cut.</v>

2232
01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.670
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we're going to move the cameras and</v>

2233
01:36:22.671 --> 01:36:23.900
<v Speaker 3>say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2234
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:26.150
<v Speaker 3>there's none of that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

2235
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:28.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the hustle of the show was like</v>

2236
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:29.890
<v Speaker 3>being there with the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2237
01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:32.810
<v Speaker 3>You set up the scene and then you press</v>
<v Speaker 3>play and you let it go.</v>

2238
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:36.620
<v Speaker 3>And what happens happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sorry if you don't get exactly</v>

2239
01:36:36.621 --> 01:36:38.300
<v Speaker 3>what you hoped out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2240
01:36:38.301 --> 01:36:40.160
<v Speaker 3>but we're not going to interrupt the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2241
01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:42.080
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to manipulate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>control things.</v>

2242
01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:47.120
<v Speaker 3>That is the difference between really</v>
<v Speaker 3>good reality TV in the word reality TV</v>

2243
01:36:47.121 --> 01:36:49.280
<v Speaker 3>is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what does that even mean?</v>

2244
01:36:49.281 --> 01:36:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of these shows are</v>
<v Speaker 3>scripted.</v>

2245
01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have these loose scenarios and then</v>

2246
01:36:56.121 --> 01:36:58.910
<v Speaker 3>they go in a script them and they redo</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2247
01:36:58.911 --> 01:37:00.710
<v Speaker 3>The reshoot things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not reality.</v>

2248
01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:05.711
<v Speaker 3>It's like shitty acting with people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not trained and they're edited with,</v>

2249
01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:08.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people talk in front of the camera.</v>

2250
01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.290
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't know what Mo was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was crazy.</v>

2251
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:13.850
<v Speaker 3>And they got you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was like,</v>

2252
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:17.160
<v Speaker 3>I told Joe What we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No advanced,</v>

2253
01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:20.620
<v Speaker 3>no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like conflict,</v>

2254
01:37:20.621 --> 01:37:21.830
<v Speaker 3>like the Kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2255
01:37:21.831 --> 01:37:26.390
<v Speaker 3>if they've got it down to a science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a science of more ronic television</v>

2256
01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:27.180
<v Speaker 3>viewing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2257
01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:28.430
<v Speaker 3>Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could just sit there,</v>

2258
01:37:28.431 --> 01:37:29.270
<v Speaker 3>slack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jawed,</v>

2259
01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:31.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll keep you locked in,</v>

2260
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:33.520
<v Speaker 3>they'll keep you locked in the Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're good at it,</v>

2261
01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.720
<v Speaker 3>edits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll show you their tits and boom,</v>

2262
01:37:35.721 --> 01:37:37.660
<v Speaker 3>you cut to commercial in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2263
01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:42.920
<v Speaker 3>That's reality TV with what you guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing is more documentary</v>

2264
01:37:42.921 --> 01:37:44.030
<v Speaker 3>television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2265
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:46.040
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not saying that.</v>

2266
01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:48.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not saying that there's no aspect</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2267
01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.080
<v Speaker 3>of the convention of television there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course their ears.</v>

2268
01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.210
<v Speaker 3>But we used to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2269
01:37:53.211 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 3>like Vietnam doesn't look like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Vietnam</v>

2270
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.590
<v Speaker 2>doesn't not look like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2271
01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.770
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a refinement in a manipulation</v>

2272
01:38:01.771 --> 01:38:04.920
<v Speaker 2>in what we're doing because we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>choosing these locations are choosing to</v>

2273
01:38:04.921 --> 01:38:07.260
<v Speaker 2>talk to this person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're choosing to shoot it in a certain</v>

2274
01:38:07.261 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>

2275
01:38:08.251 --> 01:38:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Where adding light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2276
01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:13.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly the way reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a threshold,</v>

2277
01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:16.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a line which you don't cross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that line is,</v>

2278
01:38:16.701 --> 01:38:21.390
<v Speaker 2>is it a morally and ethically</v>
<v Speaker 2>established line by Tony and by the crew</v>

2279
01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:26.040
<v Speaker 2>that says like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a place at which it becomes</v>

2280
01:38:26.041 --> 01:38:29.430
<v Speaker 2>unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The manipulation of reality becomes a</v>

2281
01:38:29.431 --> 01:38:31.060
<v Speaker 2>manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2282
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.140
<v Speaker 2>that is now become unfair to the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are viewing this.</v>

2283
01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:36.150
<v Speaker 2>The people who are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2284
01:38:36.151 --> 01:38:37.140
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2285
01:38:37.141 --> 01:38:39.290
<v Speaker 2>we've become selfserving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2286
01:38:39.291 --> 01:38:42.180
<v Speaker 2>and that's the line that we chose never</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cross.</v>

2287
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:44.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can make it beautiful,</v>

2288
01:38:44.490 --> 01:38:46.280
<v Speaker 2>we can refine it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2289
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:49.170
<v Speaker 2>we can edit it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can make a compelling show,</v>

2290
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:52.380
<v Speaker 2>but it has to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to exist within,</v>

2291
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:56.070
<v Speaker 2>under this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within this certain threshold or else,</v>

2292
01:38:56.610 --> 01:38:59.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are we doing know it must</v>

2293
01:38:59.251 --> 01:39:04.080
<v Speaker 2>be a small percentage of people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>business that have that ethic incredibly</v>

2294
01:39:04.081 --> 01:39:07.320
<v Speaker 2>small and it's incredibly powerful to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have people.</v>

2295
01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:10.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm backing you that believe in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2296
01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.420
<v Speaker 2>and super rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2297
01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:14.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about in the film industry</v>

2298
01:39:14.761 --> 01:39:17.910
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how rare it is to have true artur final</v>

2299
01:39:17.911 --> 01:39:19.380
<v Speaker 2>cut directors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2300
01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:21.180
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only a handful of them,</v>

2301
01:39:21.181 --> 01:39:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>largely the studios have taken over that</v>

2302
01:39:24.421 --> 01:39:27.690
<v Speaker 2>control will equally in the television</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

2303
01:39:27.691 --> 01:39:30.870
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that rare to have people that have</v>

2304
01:39:30.871 --> 01:39:34.950
<v Speaker 2>the kind of power and control to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the luxury of saying,</v>

2305
01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:36.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey listen,</v>

2306
01:39:36.181 --> 01:39:38.640
<v Speaker 2>I have guidelines here and we're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to cross them.</v>

2307
01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:39.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2308
01:39:39.751 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 2>and have people be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

2309
01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:43.613
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

2310
01:39:43.650 --> 01:39:44.940
<v Speaker 2>go make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2311
01:39:45.450 --> 01:39:47.100
<v Speaker 2>and we were able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:50.230
<v Speaker 2>It seems like netflix would be a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good place for something like that.</v>

2313
01:39:51.010 --> 01:39:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Seems like Netflix will be a really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>place for a lot of things.</v>

2314
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:58.170
<v Speaker 2>It seems like that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the best place for like real</v>

2315
01:39:58.171 --> 01:39:59.004
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>

2316
01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I know how much is real fried when</v>

2317
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:04.920
<v Speaker 2>they're giving you money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime someone's given you money,</v>

2318
01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:07.430
<v Speaker 2>there's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get the real way to deal.</v>

2319
01:40:07.431 --> 01:40:12.120
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like to produce it yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the end is CNN was the best place</v>

2320
01:40:12.121 --> 01:40:13.170
<v Speaker 2>to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2321
01:40:13.230 --> 01:40:17.240
<v Speaker 2>and they really did back us up and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>really backed up Tony and that</v>

2322
01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:20.850
<v Speaker 2>philosophy and they completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>implicitly understood what we were</v>

2323
01:40:20.851 --> 01:40:23.300
<v Speaker 2>talking about when we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we can't do that now.</v>

2324
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:25.110
<v Speaker 2>It was jeff soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it his idea?</v>

2325
01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.581
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2326
01:40:26.581 --> 01:40:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the deal came about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume so because I think it came,</v>

2327
01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.270
<v Speaker 2>it came in just after that transfer of</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

2328
01:40:33.271 --> 01:40:35.880
<v Speaker 2>So did they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he have other places where he's</v>

2329
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:37.100
<v Speaker 2>thinking about taking it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started?</v>

2330
01:40:37.110 --> 01:40:38.700
<v Speaker 2>CNN again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

2331
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:39.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2332
01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:42.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a really successful show in its</v>

2333
01:40:42.091 --> 01:40:44.100
<v Speaker 2>own right at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure it would have gone</v>

2334
01:40:44.101 --> 01:40:46.230
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was,</v>

2335
01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I assume it was Jeff Zucker who brought</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in and that was like such a brilliant</v>

2336
01:40:52.261 --> 01:40:53.740
<v Speaker 2>moves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a perfect marriage,</v>

2337
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:55.540
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect marriage,</v>

2338
01:40:55.541 --> 01:40:58.360
<v Speaker 2>the perfect move for CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like perfect move for us.</v>

2339
01:40:58.530 --> 01:40:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was interesting when they</v>

2340
01:40:59.671 --> 01:41:03.270
<v Speaker 1>were taking a chance on these unscripted</v>
<v Speaker 1>television shows.</v>

2341
01:41:03.271 --> 01:41:05.650
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these non news show.</v>

2342
01:41:05.670 --> 01:41:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2343
01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen the united shades of</v>

2344
01:41:07.381 --> 01:41:10.780
<v Speaker 2>America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's all bell and he's great.</v>

2345
01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:12.630
<v Speaker 2>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a super,</v>

2346
01:41:12.631 --> 01:41:13.740
<v Speaker 2>super nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2347
01:41:13.741 --> 01:41:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I did an episode with him in Kenya with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

2348
01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:18.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will be the premier of this</v>

2349
01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.520
<v Speaker 2>upcoming season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2350
01:41:19.521 --> 01:41:20.354
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2351
01:41:20.370 --> 01:41:23.190
<v Speaker 2>so how many episodes have you guys done</v>
<v Speaker 2>that haven't aired yet?</v>

2352
01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we'll have seven in this next</v>

2353
01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:31.170
<v Speaker 2>season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only one,</v>

2354
01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:34.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those seven that was actually</v>

2355
01:41:34.321 --> 01:41:37.350
<v Speaker 2>completed with Tony's narration</v>
<v Speaker 2>narration,</v>

2356
01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:42.620
<v Speaker 2>the rest of them are uncomplete and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that respect,</v>

2357
01:41:42.690 --> 01:41:45.690
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been kind of fighting through</v>

2358
01:41:46.290 --> 01:41:48.300
<v Speaker 2>editing those over the last few months</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2359
01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:51.540
<v Speaker 2>and trying to figure out ways to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2360
01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:54.870
<v Speaker 2>to do this without completely gutting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2361
01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the method of making this show.</v>

2362
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:59.960
<v Speaker 2>So wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2363
01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:01.970
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a couple of specials in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there like,</v>

2364
01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to the crew and stuff like that,</v>

2365
01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to be a pretty profound</v>

2366
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:09.403
<v Speaker 2>see isn't.</v>

2367
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:14.000
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you're done with that,</v>

2368
01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you just start looking at new projects</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different things to do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2373
01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:26.580
<v Speaker 2>officially been announced yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2374
01:42:26.690 --> 01:42:28.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2375
01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.390
<v Speaker 2>but there's good stuff out there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2376
01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2377
01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:37.100
<v Speaker 2>One Nice thing in all of this incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult time has a lot of people have</v>

2378
01:42:39.421 --> 01:42:41.980
<v Speaker 2>come to us and said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2379
01:42:41.981 --> 01:42:44.340
<v Speaker 2>when we wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we always believed in what you guys did</v>

2380
01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:48.450
<v Speaker 2>and we'd like you to continue doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's a project we have the we</v>

2381
01:42:48.451 --> 01:42:49.860
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2382
01:42:49.861 --> 01:42:54.210
<v Speaker 2>so hopefully we can continue to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>things in the same kind of,</v>

2383
01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:55.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like we can.</v>

2384
01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like</v>

2385
01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:02.320
<v Speaker 1>the success of the show and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectuous enthusiasm that Tony had and</v>

2386
01:43:05.031 --> 01:43:06.020
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2387
01:43:06.021 --> 01:43:09.560
<v Speaker 1>so many people are fans of the show had</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that style of television.</v>

2388
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:12.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just gonna lead to more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people taking more chances and</v>

2389
01:43:12.981 --> 01:43:14.060
<v Speaker 1>doing things like that.</v>

2390
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:15.650
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2391
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2392
01:43:17.630 --> 01:43:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it's getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2393
01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:23.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will never be another Tony you</v>

2394
01:43:23.391 --> 01:43:25.100
<v Speaker 2>won't find that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2395
01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:30.470
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will have to be aware of going</v>

2396
01:43:30.471 --> 01:43:32.030
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to copy that,</v>

2397
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:35.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Tony and that's what you saw,</v>

2398
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Gordon Ramsey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they announced some show with him</v>

2399
01:43:37.851 --> 01:43:40.700
<v Speaker 1>traveling and people immediately just</v>
<v Speaker 1>start shitting all over him.</v>

2400
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's really from everything I</v>

2401
01:43:43.101 --> 01:43:43.671
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2402
01:43:43.671 --> 01:43:47.840
<v Speaker 1>just like a really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the problem is?</v>

2403
01:43:47.841 --> 01:43:50.510
<v Speaker 1>The way you phrase himself on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kitchen nightmares.</v>

2404
01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>She turns in like an asshole</v>

2405
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.990
<v Speaker 3>and yells at people that are intimidated</v>
<v Speaker 3>by him and that's his shtick,</v>

2406
01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.450
<v Speaker 3>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just this,</v>

2407
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:57.820
<v Speaker 3>this TV shtick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:00.170
<v Speaker 3>As far as I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2409
01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:02.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like a real nice guy.</v>

2410
01:44:02.721 --> 01:44:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might Guy Fieri too.</v>

2411
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:07.940
<v Speaker 3>He was nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just got crazy.</v>

2412
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy Fieri relentlessly shit out.</v>

2413
01:44:11.391 --> 01:44:15.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly Jews.</v>

2414
01:44:15.490 --> 01:44:18.690
<v Speaker 3>But he shits on everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he show up Martha Raye to.</v>

2415
01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:20.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2416
01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:23.310
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe right?</v>

2417
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:24.643
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>

2418
01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:27.540
<v Speaker 3>he would pull that trigger all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2419
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:29.570
<v Speaker 3>He would always make fun of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lamborghini and I'm like,</v>

2420
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:33.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm Kinda like a Lamborghini,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what are you talking about?</v>

2421
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:35.180
<v Speaker 3>One of those things you're not supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have,</v>

2422
01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:37.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could have some cool cars like</v>

2423
01:44:37.521 --> 01:44:40.130
<v Speaker 3>our member when he did the show with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Queens of the Stone Age,</v>

2424
01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Josh home and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the guys had a 69 Camaro shot.</v>

2425
01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.090
<v Speaker 3>That was a bad car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2426
01:44:47.091 --> 01:44:51.110
<v Speaker 3>But that's an okay to have bad ass car</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a classic because it's got</v>

2427
01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:53.780
<v Speaker 3>style points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

2428
01:44:53.781 --> 01:44:56.690
<v Speaker 3>But I would suggest to Tony that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>might want to pick up the Lamborghini</v>

2429
01:44:56.691 --> 01:45:01.691
<v Speaker 3>because the traction control</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big problems and big problems when the</v>

2430
01:45:03.231 --> 01:45:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Camaro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2431
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:08.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure as most people would have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn how to drive one of those.</v>

2432
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:09.920
<v Speaker 3>That was hot rod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2433
01:45:10.050 --> 01:45:12.310
<v Speaker 3>The thing was sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2434
01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:15.020
<v Speaker 3>But listen brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad we did this.</v>

2435
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:18.260
<v Speaker 3>We reached out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We decided to get together and talk,</v>

2436
01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:23.300
<v Speaker 3>give a lot of people insight to what it</v>
