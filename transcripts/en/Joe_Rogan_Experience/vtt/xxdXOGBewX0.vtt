1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches way.</v>

2
00:00:03.261 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Most people think that if you don't use it,</v>

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>you're an like,</v>

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.303
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>

5
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.980
<v Speaker 1>it will save.</v>

6
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>You Do,</v>

7
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>do something every day.</v>

8
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a friend who was a longshoreman and he worked with this guide that</v>

9
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>would shoot heroin every day at lunch.</v>

10
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>And that always freaked me out because the guy showed up for work everyday on</v>

11
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

12
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>He was a responsible guy,</v>

13
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>he was married,</v>

14
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>he had children and this guy would get heroin.</v>

15
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>He would cop every morning.</v>

16
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>He would go there and he would sit in his truck and he would shoot up and you</v>

17
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

18
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

19
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>however long that lasts,</v>

20
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:35.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>he gets an hour lunch break and they would come back and go to work.</v>

22
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>And I would like every day he goes every day.</v>

23
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Like I did it every day.</v>

24
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:42.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

27
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>this past summer,</v>

28
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>the past three months or so,</v>

29
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

30
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

31
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I was in Geneva,</v>

32
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>just got back in the states.</v>

33
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>and I was working in a heroin clinic where they administer heroin every day,</v>

35
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>seven days a week,</v>

36
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>twice a day to people who meet criteria for heroin addiction.</v>

37
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>And when I say day administer heroin,</v>

38
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean like small doses,</v>

39
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean doses that they'll up to like a gram a day,</v>

40
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>a thousand milligrams a day,</v>

41
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>a lot more than what people use here in the states typically.</v>

42
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>And these people who are getting heroin every day,</v>

43
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>a large percentage of them also go to work.</v>

44
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>A large percentage of them have families and they're taking care of their</v>

45
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>

46
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.891
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

47
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>this is their treatment and this is a treatment that works for them.</v>

48
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>But their treatment include two daily doses of intravenous heroin,</v>

49
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>seven days a week,</v>

50
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.161
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

51
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

52
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>and so like when I think about,</v>

53
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>well one of the reasons I went there,</v>

54
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and I did this because of the way we think of heroin in this country,</v>

55
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>we think of it as such as evil drug.</v>

56
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a American mythology.</v>

57
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

58
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's just wrong.</v>

59
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's ignorance and,</v>

60
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's how many including drug experts in this country think of heroin.</v>

61
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:58.764
<v Speaker 1>But that's just,</v>

62
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>we have all of this great technology,</v>

63
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>but we're so ignorant when it comes to many of these drugs.</v>

64
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Speaker 1>So heroin administered intravenously a daily basis is not,</v>

65
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not devastating.</v>

66
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.893
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

67
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.561
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

68
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>some people would do better about having a daily doses,</v>

69
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>a daily dose of heroin or another opiate.</v>

70
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.660
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

72
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not devastating.</v>

73
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see even me.</v>

74
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>I would go,</v>

75
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.021
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

76
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>that's got to fuck you up.</v>

77
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Like taken heroin every day.</v>

78
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:28.811
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

80
00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:29.070
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

81
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>it's been this whole journey.</v>

82
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:30.831
<v Speaker 1>Men,</v>

83
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>since I saw you last time,</v>

84
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I've been all over the world and this whole journey to see what people do with</v>

85
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>drugs or with drugs they're using and how they do it.</v>

86
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>It's been so eye opening,</v>

87
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.351
<v Speaker 1>even for me,</v>

88
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>someone who has spent their life studying drugs and I'm learning so much more</v>

89
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:48.290
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

90
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

91
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.910
<v Speaker 1>but the Switz experience of,</v>

92
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch also do this.</v>

94
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>There are some parts of Germany that does this.</v>

95
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>They have small programs in,</v>

96
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:56.191
<v Speaker 1>in the UK,</v>

97
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>they had small program.</v>

98
00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:58.171
<v Speaker 1>There are other countries,</v>

99
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>but the Swiss by far have the biggest program and they've been the most</v>

100
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:01.961
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

101
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>They've been doing this for more than 20 years now.</v>

102
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And he started doing this in response to,</v>

103
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

104
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>HIV concern.</v>

106
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>People worried about folks getting HIV.</v>

107
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:13.830
<v Speaker 1>So they had to do something,</v>

108
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>had to have clean needles,</v>

109
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>we had to make sure that the drugs were pure.</v>

110
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>so they're worried about death,</v>

112
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>HIV,</v>

113
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

114
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And this was the rational response where they put it in a medical community</v>

115
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>where people got treatment and,</v>

116
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

117
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

118
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>along with their heroin and they have no plans of going back,</v>

119
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.471
<v Speaker 1>nor should they,</v>

120
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>because it works.</v>

121
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.660
<v Speaker 1>The mind is such a motherfucker,</v>

122
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.520
<v Speaker 1>like if you could just get your mind to do what your heart wants to do,</v>

123
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.810
<v Speaker 1>life would be so much easier.</v>

124
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Like there are so many times I'm in the cage,</v>

125
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.600
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

126
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.733
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

127
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if my brain knew what my heart was trying to say,</v>

128
00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:54.530
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I wanted to do.</v>

129
00:03:54.531 --> 00:03:54.861
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

130
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:55.694
<v Speaker 1>And it's so,</v>

131
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.653
<v Speaker 1>and then you</v>

132
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.910
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

133
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't even put words on it,</v>

134
00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:00.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

136
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any mental training?</v>

137
00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any meditating or any visualization?</v>

138
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Fucking high school Budweiser rather than talking about,</v>

139
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.150
<v Speaker 1>God dammit fucking fight is a fight,</v>

140
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:12.470
<v Speaker 1>but I probably maybe should,</v>

141
00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean seminars,</v>

142
00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:14.640
<v Speaker 1>but you're a,</v>

143
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.150
<v Speaker 1>because of your style and because of nick style,</v>

144
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.310
<v Speaker 1>you guys are both really well loved.</v>

145
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Like if something like that happened with you,</v>

146
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>you could go do seminars and make a few grand every weekend.</v>

147
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.931
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

148
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not in Dublin.</v>

149
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.763
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to go anywhere.</v>

150
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Once you guys fought,</v>

151
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.843
<v Speaker 1>you could do it.</v>

152
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>If you and Connor fought and duked it out,</v>

153
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.660
<v Speaker 1>had an epic contest,</v>

154
00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:33.410
<v Speaker 1>then you could do it.</v>

155
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

156
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a big stick in the mud.</v>

157
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.570
<v Speaker 1>If you beat him a couple times decisively,</v>

158
00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:40.610
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to beat them to where they have to just give in.</v>

159
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:41.511
<v Speaker 1>They'd have to say,</v>

160
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:41.930
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

161
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.763
<v Speaker 1>you had to beat him,</v>

162
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.850
<v Speaker 1>beat him.</v>

163
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>But if you're fucking cut down to one 45 you had nailed it.</v>

164
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Torch him.</v>

165
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Connor exam.</v>

166
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

167
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the fuck out of that guy.</v>

168
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.543
<v Speaker 1>That guy's doing.</v>

169
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.950
<v Speaker 1>He's getting eyes on the sport.</v>

170
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

171
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.713
<v Speaker 1>he met Ron.</v>

172
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.650
<v Speaker 1>He really pisses me up.</v>

173
00:04:57.651 --> 00:04:59.720
<v Speaker 1>I feel like to tell him when he was in the fucking pressure,</v>

174
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.310
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to rip him so bad.</v>

175
00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

176
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Wanted to kill my own bag.</v>

177
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what car you can blow me like a cup of hot soup.</v>

178
00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:07.520
<v Speaker 1>You son of a bitch but low me on like a cup of hot soup.</v>

179
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.423
<v Speaker 1>How's that work?</v>

180
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.310
<v Speaker 1>You blow on a cup of hot soup.</v>

181
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:11.144
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

182
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.463
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

184
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.753
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

185
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.470
<v Speaker 1>but if he just blows you like that.</v>

186
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.210
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's confusing.</v>

187
00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:18.590
<v Speaker 1>The vernacular is really odd.</v>

188
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Like blow jobs.</v>

189
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why that</v>

190
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.460
<v Speaker 1>blow me like a cup of hot soup first time.</v>

191
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.211
<v Speaker 1>First Time.</v>

192
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:27.044
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

193
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that one before.</v>

195
00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:29.084
<v Speaker 1>I've been around</v>

196
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.580
<v Speaker 1>the uphill</v>

197
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.060
<v Speaker 2>battle because the way it's being treated presently.</v>

198
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

199
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 2>if you look,</v>

200
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.780
<v Speaker 2>the literature from 2012,</v>

201
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:44.781
<v Speaker 2>410,000 servicemen came back as veterans and,</v>

202
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

203
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.520
<v Speaker 2>were diagnosed with PTSD.</v>

204
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Now a post traumatic stress disorder is usually perceived as being a</v>

205
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:53.040
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>

206
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.143
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

207
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 2>psychologically precipitated event where they witnessed something that was</v>

208
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>horrifying to them.</v>

209
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>A death of a friend,</v>

210
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 2>loss of a limb or whatever the situation might have been to stimulate it.</v>

211
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 2>And that immediately opened him up to simple treatment here,</v>

212
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 2>take this packet of antidepressants and you'll get better.</v>

213
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

214
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 2>they didn't get better so they didn't get better because they were having what's</v>

215
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 2>called treatment resistant depression,</v>

216
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>which now we find is due to hormonal deficiency.</v>

217
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the civilian population,</v>

218
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 2>people with hormones with treatment resistant depression,</v>

219
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 2>you check them out and they testosterone deficient or estrogen overdose or low</v>

220
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 2>progesterone or low pregnenolone,</v>

221
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 2>other chemicals that are in our brain.</v>

222
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

223
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 2>these individuals have been the,</v>

224
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.953
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

225
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.990
<v Speaker 2>the foundation of what I do in trying to find a simple way to replenish them.</v>

226
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 2>What you have to do is test them and that's not being done.</v>

227
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 2>It's so much easier just to hand a packet and say you have PTSD when the</v>

228
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 2>majority of them are traumatic brain injury.</v>

229
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

230
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.730
<v Speaker 2>I was on Dr drew show with one of our patients who was a army corpsman and he</v>

231
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a single scratch on his body.</v>

232
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 2>But within two years of leaving a separating from the service,</v>

233
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 2>he started developing depression,</v>

234
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:13.671
<v Speaker 2>mood swings,</v>

235
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 2>explosive personality.</v>

236
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 2>He ends up coming into our program and we find out he has two and a half hormone</v>

237
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 2>deficiencies,</v>

238
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.030
<v Speaker 2>and the pattern is indicative of having had head trauma.</v>

239
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

240
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 2>it turned out he would walk behind Abramson tanks as they were discharging their</v>

241
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:28.371
<v Speaker 2>shells,</v>

242
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:28.821
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

243
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:29.091
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

244
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 2>my body would shutter,</v>

245
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 2>and it was around javelin missiles.</v>

246
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 2>He was around repetitive gunfire.</v>

247
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 2>He personally didn't have a scratch on him.</v>

248
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.131
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

249
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 2>That just the recoil,</v>

250
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 2>just the Bucharest does the sonic boom,</v>

251
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 2>the impact that that,</v>

252
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.611
<v Speaker 2>shocking.</v>

254
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 2>His body can do that too,</v>

255
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.773
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

256
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.680
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
