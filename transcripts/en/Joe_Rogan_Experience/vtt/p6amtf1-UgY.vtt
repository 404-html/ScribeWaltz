<v Speaker 1>those little Amazon things or the little</v>

27
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>google one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little google sticks,</v>

28
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.333
<v Speaker 1>you stick them in a Usb port on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer or on your tv and you can </v>

29
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>stream something from your computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to that and it plays on the TV.</v>

30
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>How in the fuck does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like your apple TV.</v>

31
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I have apple TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

32
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Speaker 1>like a big Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big Mac size,</v>

33
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>but this is like a usb stick.</v>

34
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 3>It's got a little processor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same like in the cell phone in it.</v>

35
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.023
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how any of that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>

37
00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 3>I can barely get the TV I have to work.</v>

38
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.613
<v Speaker 1>It's because I was watching some fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Dan espn three and I don't know </v>

39
00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:53.860
<v Speaker 1>if you knew this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but espn three is not really a station.</v>

40
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a website.</v>

41
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's espn one,</v>

42
00:01:57.941 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>espn two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are both on tv,</v>

43
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>but espn three is like a website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they had glory fights on espn three.</v>

44
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 1>We've got an issue here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's in here.</v>

45
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>There must be an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.743
<v Speaker 1>espn three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to watch the fights on espn three </v>

47
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:13.954
<v Speaker 1>because they were on UFC fight pass had </v>
<v Speaker 1>glory on up until this one fight and </v>

48
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 1>then from that one fight on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all on espn three,</v>

49
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.590
<v Speaker 1>so I had it on my laptop and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

50
00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:24.101
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

51
00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a fucking apple laptop </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

52
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Now I can't shoot it directly to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apple TV,</v>

53
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 1>and then I found out all you need is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those little drives.</v>

54
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>You stick that soccer in your TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>

55
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

56
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.843
<v Speaker 1>That's how that one.</v>

57
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 3>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little USB drive and then you could do</v>

58
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:40.944
<v Speaker 3>it right from your phone to your TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just bought an antenna the other day </v>

59
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 3>just to see like what local channels I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can get.</v>

60
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.783
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a signal 100 and well I got a </v>

61
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.653
<v Speaker 3>hundred and 12 channels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all Mexican and have all the </v>

62
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:54.564
<v Speaker 3>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just distress signals like the </v>

63
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 3>first episode of fear of the water</v>

64
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>walking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

65
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I think I hear something</v>

66
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gunshot.</v>

67
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 4>There's one channel that just plays like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Carson in like old shows from the</v>

68
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.361
<v Speaker 4>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

69
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 4>good call.</v>

70
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 5>And then there's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

71
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 5>there's Russian Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Korean,</v>

72
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.800
<v Speaker 5>but it is weird just watching</v>

73
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.683
<v Speaker 4>like all these free channels that they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that was one of the things with </v>

74
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:19.504
<v Speaker 4>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that happened with </v>

75
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 4>radio is in La in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would close down,</v>

76
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 4>like when they closed down that FM talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>station,</v>

77
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.184
<v Speaker 4>there's an FM talk station and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>closed it down and then a Mexican </v>

78
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 4>station popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what was another talk show?</v>

79
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.540
<v Speaker 5>Pretty much every FM station in La is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very Mexicans.</v>

80
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.750
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like morning radio shows.</v>

81
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.253
<v Speaker 5>They all sound the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always some big Mexican guy in </v>

82
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:50.361
<v Speaker 5>some like little tiny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's always like to sit in the woods.</v>

83
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.010
<v Speaker 5>You sound Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's terrible.</v>

84
00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:56.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a terrible.</v>

85
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.813
<v Speaker 5>That was an Asian accent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely not a worst racist Super </v>

86
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.310
<v Speaker 5>Mexican radio station.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Worst Mexican of all time,</v>

87
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.180
<v Speaker 4>but when I would pass by these bus </v>
<v Speaker 4>stops,</v>

88
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.030
<v Speaker 4>like all over La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd see these billboards that were for</v>

89
00:04:14.031 --> 00:04:15.740
<v Speaker 4>these stations that you never gonna to </v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to.</v>

90
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.813
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this one neighborhood that my ex </v>

91
00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 4>gardener,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had an ex gardener.</v>

92
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:23.750
<v Speaker 4>He used to fight chickens who was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a funny dude,</v>

93
00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:24.584
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He came over here a couple times from </v>

94
00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:27.290
<v Speaker 4>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He snuck over here,</v>

95
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.600
<v Speaker 4>worked over in America and it's not back</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then snow pack again.</v>

96
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.671
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

97
00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.260
<v Speaker 4>He fought chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to have chicken fights.</v>

98
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.590
<v Speaker 4>He was really not really in terms of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would go,</v>

99
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.723
<v Speaker 4>he would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the other people would actually </v>

100
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.243
<v Speaker 4>fight the chickens and it was like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing where all the men in this </v>

101
00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 4>community would go and they all had </v>
<v Speaker 4>these roosters.</v>

102
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.933
<v Speaker 4>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went to this guy's place and went to </v>

103
00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 4>check out his backyard and he had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

104
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.570
<v Speaker 4>a hundred rooster cages and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshitting.</v>

105
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.810
<v Speaker 4>They were fucking stacked on top of each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other and then they had an arena.</v>

106
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.793
<v Speaker 4>You'd go into the arena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a little barn and then it's </v>

107
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.543
<v Speaker 4>like a little sunken in area that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>had dug out and put like a little fence </v>

108
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:06.764
<v Speaker 4>around and that's where they would check</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chickens in and so they'd have to </v>

109
00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:12.140
<v Speaker 4>guys and they would handle the chickens </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they put spurs on the chickens.</v>

110
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 4>So it's not just the chickens fight each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>

111
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.520
<v Speaker 4>but they put little razor blades on </v>
<v Speaker 4>their feet.</v>

112
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

113
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.900
<v Speaker 4>And then they bet on who wins the fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then when they,</v>

114
00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:25.010
<v Speaker 4>when like when you know that either one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both chickens are fucked.</v>

115
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.903
<v Speaker 4>Like they're essentially dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe if you're lucky your chicken </v>

116
00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:28.844
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get totally.</v>

117
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.850
<v Speaker 5>Are there chicken commentators,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone like and here we crow,</v>

118
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.650
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

119
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And here we can't help yourself grow.</v>

120
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.850
<v Speaker 5>You can't help yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're terrible bird fighting.</v>

121
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.143
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's apparently a huge thing in the </v>

122
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:44.974
<v Speaker 4>Mexican community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's interesting is like you </v>

123
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 4>remember when Michael Vick gotten that </v>
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>

124
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.893
<v Speaker 4>horrible situation when they found out </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he was killing dogs and he had dog </v>

125
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 4>fights and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this terrible thing.</v>

126
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:55.924
<v Speaker 4>He was executing dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit is happening all throughout </v>

127
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.673
<v Speaker 4>the south every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a huge part of their culture by </v>

128
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 4>animal fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dog fights,</v>

129
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.763
<v Speaker 4>but much more so chicken fights in </v>
<v Speaker 4>chicken fights is a weird one where you </v>

130
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 4>can kind of okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

131
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.573
<v Speaker 4>like people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have a hierarchy of animals that </v>

132
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 4>they give a shit whether or not they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>having a bad life and chickens are super</v>

133
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 4>low on that scale.</v>

134
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.913
<v Speaker 5>Weird that the black people have dog </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights and the Mexicans have chicken </v>

135
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:25.994
<v Speaker 5>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would think the black people would </v>

136
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 5>have chicken sites because then they </v>
<v Speaker 5>could just have dinner afterwards.</v>

137
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their favorite.</v>

138
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Mexicans eat chickens too.</v>

139
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.630
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if say racist bitch,</v>

140
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 5>but the mind makes a Ginsey to dogs or </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexicans eat Sushi.</v>

141
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.973
<v Speaker 5>Sushi served on a Samurai or my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my ex girlfriend who used to live like </v>

142
00:06:45.421 --> 00:06:46.254
<v Speaker 5>in like the ghetto part of Los Angeles </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was always so weird at like six </v>

143
00:06:49.661 --> 00:06:52.950
<v Speaker 5>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many are you hurt?</v>

144
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.340
<v Speaker 5>Like it was like a lot like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just get used to it.</v>

145
00:06:57.341 --> 00:06:59.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it becomes like norm for the community,</v>

146
00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:00.424
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for someone to have a fucking rooster </v>

147
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:02.704
<v Speaker 5>and we were tripping our balls off in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Joshua tree one night and it was like </v>

148
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.360
<v Speaker 5>three or 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>AM.</v>

149
00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:08.194
<v Speaker 5>The Sun was not out at all and there was</v>
<v Speaker 5>one rooster that in the middle of the </v>

150
00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:12.634
<v Speaker 5>night was like,</v>

151
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.583
<v Speaker 5>we were always at their big group of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Comedians and us and we started fucking </v>

152
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.933
<v Speaker 5>dying riffing about this like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know how out of control this </v>

153
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:24.074
<v Speaker 5>chicken's life is where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's such an idiot that he's boxing in </v>

154
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 5>the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the other chickens are like,</v>

155
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:30.104
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can look who's blowing his load </v>

156
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:31.484
<v Speaker 5>early over here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all on mushrooms is dying in this </v>

157
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:34.844
<v Speaker 5>premature ejaculating basically chicken </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was below lined and it was just </v>

158
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't want anybody to know.</v>

159
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 5>So maybe it's clocks off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He took a nap earlier in the day.</v>

160
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.890
<v Speaker 5>Who just jumped the gun?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

161
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 5>he'd be the guy who jumps the gun and </v>
<v Speaker 5>felt way to refresh or mainly he felt</v>

162
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 4>that you guys were on mushrooms and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

163
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.640
<v Speaker 4>he got there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>

164
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 5>These people are crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or we're on mushrooms and like,</v>

165
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:58.550
<v Speaker 5>this'll be hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

166
00:07:58.551 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 5>they'll love this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch this.</v>

167
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 5>Three in the morning bomb.</v>

168
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.123
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe your very presence or maybe you </v>

169
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:06.370
<v Speaker 4>guys are loud and you woke him up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>

170
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.290
<v Speaker 4>We were laughing a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably what it is.</v>

171
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Public are pissed.</v>

172
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 4>It's probably a dog barking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

173
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.650
<v Speaker 4>It's probably like a bunch of reasons </v>
<v Speaker 4>why a chicken does that.</v>

174
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.843
<v Speaker 4>Not just because they wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also maybe you could fuck you shut </v>

175
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 4>up trying to sleep over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not bad enough.</v>

176
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 4>I sleep with my feet on a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they?</v>

177
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They purchased so they sleep.</v>

178
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.313
<v Speaker 4>They climb up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have these areas in my chicken coop </v>

179
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.173
<v Speaker 4>where they climb up and they put their </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet down and we have other areas where </v>

180
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:36.404
<v Speaker 4>they could go into a little chicken </v>
<v Speaker 4>house and they could like go inside and </v>

181
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 4>there's like a little roof on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chicken house.</v>

182
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 4>They fucking never use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't use that.</v>

183
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.773
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to like have their feet on </v>

184
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd like to grab on something and hang</v>

185
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 4>on to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weird,</v>

186
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.060
<v Speaker 4>so because they're used to purchasing </v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the wild,</v>

187
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 4>they're their body's designed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We think it as our to with my hands,</v>

188
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 4>I'd be so fucking tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but their hands are so different.</v>

189
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.540
<v Speaker 4>Like their feet are designed for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it doesn't make them tired.</v>

190
00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 4>That's an evolutionary advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can live in trees.</v>

191
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 4>How many chickens do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty three.</v>

192
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know you had that many.</v>

193
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 4>Have a gang of chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fresh eggs everyday.</v>

194
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 4>How many eggs is 23 a day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Depends on the time of year.</v>

195
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 4>Like this time of year they're starting </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

196
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.793
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're making a lot of eggs because </v>

197
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:23.600
<v Speaker 4>it's cold out and it's been raining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>

198
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700
<v Speaker 4>when there's less sunlight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make more eggs to dethrone a lot of</v>

199
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 4>eggs or do you just.</v>

200
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.131
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

201
00:09:31.131 --> 00:09:32.200
<v Speaker 4>Give them away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give them away.</v>

202
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.000
<v Speaker 4>But I eat a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

203
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 4>if there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's 23 of them,</v>

204
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 4>they might make 10 eggs a day and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably five of those.</v>

205
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Maybe six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

206
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat a lot of eggs.</v>

207
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.663
<v Speaker 4>Everybody eats eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We eat eggs and eggs are not bad for </v>

208
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:49.470
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fucking long standing myth that</v>

209
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 4>someone concocted in the 19 fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a New York Times article about</v>

210
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 4>it if you're really interested,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is terrible.</v>

211
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.453
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sugar companies for not that much </v>

212
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:02.100
<v Speaker 4>money for what's like in American </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars today,</v>

213
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 4>like $50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they paid off a bunch of scientists to a</v>

214
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.073
<v Speaker 4>fake these reports and write reports </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that saturated fat was causing </v>

215
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.730
<v Speaker 4>people to have heart disease and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>overweight.</v>

216
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 4>And when it was really sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about cholesterol?</v>

217
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.993
<v Speaker 4>It's not bad for you.</v>

218
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 4>Not only cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not bad for you.</v>

219
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:20.574
<v Speaker 4>It depends on what kind of cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certain types of cholesterol </v>

220
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:24.840
<v Speaker 4>that people have genetic propensities </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the not good,</v>

221
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 4>but there's ldl cholesterol and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's actually like different sizes of</v>

222
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:31.080
<v Speaker 4>different ldl cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cholesterol is,</v>

223
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:33.700
<v Speaker 4>and some of it's actually good for you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some of it's not good for you.</v>

224
00:10:33.701 --> 00:10:37.320
<v Speaker 4>And there's hdl cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but dietary cholesterol,</v>

225
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 4>like eating dietary cholesterol doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>move.</v>

226
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The blood lipids doesn't change.</v>

227
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.030
<v Speaker 4>That's not what changes your </v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol.</v>

228
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.220
<v Speaker 4>It's like sedentary lifestyle and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturate and sugar and processed foods.</v>

229
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.510
<v Speaker 4>Those things elevate cholesterol more </v>
<v Speaker 4>than eating things with cholesterol.</v>

230
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then saturated fat.</v>

231
00:10:56.821 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 4>We all grew up thinking saturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>was bad.</v>

232
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 4>That's why you have margarine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

233
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 4>Margarine is fucking illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

234
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.750
<v Speaker 4>do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

235
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 4>trans fats are illegal now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know trans fats in the next three</v>

236
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 4>years?</v>

237
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.223
<v Speaker 4>They have to remove them from food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have three more years to take them </v>

238
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:13.674
<v Speaker 4>out of food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They gave him like a grace period of </v>

239
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:15.474
<v Speaker 4>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these companies can shift their </v>

240
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 4>manufacturing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

241
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 4>Has Trans fats that we all ships a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of like Doritos and shit.</v>

242
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:23.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to read those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Fritos,</v>

243
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.250
<v Speaker 4>say some shit with trans fats in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

244
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:28.230
<v Speaker 4>so those are going to start tasting </v>
<v Speaker 4>different soon.</v>

245
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 4>Probably don't taste as good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then it might taste better.</v>

246
00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:31.854
<v Speaker 4>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing is that people thought that </v>

247
00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:34.900
<v Speaker 4>like margarine was good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marjorie,</v>

248
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 4>and is fucking terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

249
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.820
<v Speaker 4>Unsaturated fat is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturated fat is good for you.</v>

250
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.180
<v Speaker 4>That's how fucking stupid we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our whole lives,</v>

251
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:46.014
<v Speaker 4>we grew up with shitty information and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of it is because scientists were </v>

252
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:50.454
<v Speaker 4>paid off by the sugar company because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole New York Times article about </v>

253
00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 4>it stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You read it and you go,</v>

254
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:55.714
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like responsible for who knows </v>

255
00:11:57.491 --> 00:11:58.324
<v Speaker 4>how many millions of people making poor </v>
<v Speaker 4>dietary choices and perhaps ruining the </v>

256
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:04.900
<v Speaker 4>quality of their life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ruining the amount of energy they have,</v>

257
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.823
<v Speaker 4>ruining the amount of inspiration they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have because their body was </v>

258
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 4>fucking with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>causing all sorts of premature death and</v>

259
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:15.481
<v Speaker 4>diseases and it's not an exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like a subject that is been like</v>

260
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:18.430
<v Speaker 4>knowing at me for years now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy,</v>

261
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 4>crazy subject.</v>

262
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've sort of been talking about lately a</v>

263
00:12:21.931 --> 00:12:24.190
<v Speaker 6>graze upon it in my standup about how </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

264
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:25.080
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

265
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.510
<v Speaker 6>fats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something that you need and carbs,</v>

266
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.050
<v Speaker 6>which is what makes you fat is something</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you don't need,</v>

267
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 6>but we call fat people fat and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>insulting.</v>

268
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:37.120
<v Speaker 6>That's why I don't call fat people fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I call them carbs.</v>

269
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 6>Carbs aren't even necessarily bad for </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

270
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.340
<v Speaker 6>It's sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sugar's what's bad for you and the issue</v>

271
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 6>isn't carbs because carbs with fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like some carbs like Zucchini bread,</v>

272
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.710
<v Speaker 6>it's not bad for you and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 6>amazing though,</v>

273
00:12:51.711 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 6>like the marketing of it though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're right,</v>

274
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:54.154
<v Speaker 6>because it's like you're taught that </v>
<v Speaker 6>sugary sweet and sugar is good and give </v>

275
00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:59.410
<v Speaker 6>your kids candy on Halloween and sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sugar,</v>

276
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.330
<v Speaker 6>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then fat.</v>

277
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.590
<v Speaker 6>We call fat people fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the part.</v>

278
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:04.500
<v Speaker 6>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's weird is</v>

279
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.433
<v Speaker 4>if you see those photos that you saw a </v>
<v Speaker 4>long time ago from like the 19 twenties </v>

280
00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:12.970
<v Speaker 4>in the 19 thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see anyone fat.</v>

281
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 4>You see these people walking around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone looks lender.</v>

282
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's super rare when you see like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Jackie gleason,</v>

283
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 6>Karen Sweden to whenever we're in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Sweden.</v>

284
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even the pregnant women were skinny.</v>

285
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.273
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because America has let these </v>

286
00:13:26.691 --> 00:13:29.900
<v Speaker 4>assholes put all kinds of fucked up shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>that tastes great,</v>

287
00:13:29.901 --> 00:13:30.734
<v Speaker 4>but it's hugely bad for you and they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>put it all throughout our food and they </v>

288
00:13:34.131 --> 00:13:35.630
<v Speaker 4>did it when we were growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

289
00:13:35.631 --> 00:13:36.260
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

291
00:13:39.951 --> 00:13:43.850
<v Speaker 4>I used to love captain crunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit is straight sugar.</v>

292
00:13:43.851 --> 00:13:46.550
<v Speaker 4>I would eat a whole bowl of that like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant bowl.</v>

293
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:47.543

294
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.250
<v Speaker 7>the berries now as a serial.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh God.</v>

295
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's insane.</v>

296
00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:53.890
<v Speaker 7>They're not even going to pretend fuck </v>
<v Speaker 7>all that crunchy shit.</v>

<v Speaker 7>but I had one two days ago,</v>

312
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.470
<v Speaker 7>so that typically contain at least one </v>
<v Speaker 7>gram of trans fats.</v>

313
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.453
<v Speaker 7>Take a close look at the ingredients and</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're likely to find partially </v>

314
00:14:36.321 --> 00:14:38.480
<v Speaker 7>hydrogenated oils in the top five.</v>
<v Speaker 7>See,</v>

315
00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:41.880
<v Speaker 7>we used to think that that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Partially hydrogenated oil,</v>

316
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.540
<v Speaker 7>just partial,</v>
<v Speaker 7>partially hydrogenated corn oil.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Amazing.</v>

318
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.880
<v Speaker 4>We used to think that that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People would prefer that you would think</v>

319
00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 4>you making the healthy choice</v>

320
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 1>by choosing that motherfucker's it says </v>
<v Speaker 1>if refrigerated or frozen dough produces</v>

321
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:58.820
<v Speaker 1>a texture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems too good to be true.</v>

322
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 1>It probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

326
00:15:10.261 --> 00:15:11.094
<v Speaker 6>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did it because towards the end </v>

328
00:15:13.501 --> 00:15:16.880
<v Speaker 6>pretty good when I was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the tastes of it was amazing.</v>

329
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:17.783
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of really good vegan chefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there that know what the fuck </v>

343
00:15:47.011 --> 00:15:49.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about that is that kind of</v>

344
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.900
<v Speaker 1>processed totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of preservatives in</v>

345
00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:52.734
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just to get something that's Vegan </v>

346
00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:56.610
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean it's necessarily good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because Oreos are Vegan too.</v>

347
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 6>And I'm telling you it's very true </v>
<v Speaker 6>because,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was a Vegan for five years and then my</v>

349
00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:04.640
<v Speaker 6>diet fucking completely changed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean just steak every day for lunch at</v>

350
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:06.650
<v Speaker 6>some point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's in a sandwich and a bowl of</v>

351
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.250
<v Speaker 6>fa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

352
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.650
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

353
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:10.923
<v Speaker 6>That's how you say it.</v>

354
00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.410
<v Speaker 1>What was the reason why you decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a shift?</v>

355
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.673
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of it was just like I was just is </v>

356
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.670
<v Speaker 6>more gone to than I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just couldn't keep up.</v>

357
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.170
<v Speaker 6>My schedule got busy and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't that good at it.</v>

358
00:16:23.171 --> 00:16:25.990
<v Speaker 6>And it's impossible to do on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's impossible.</v>

359
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:29.200
<v Speaker 6>And I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was eating fucking the bare minimums,</v>

360
00:16:29.201 --> 00:16:32.530
<v Speaker 6>like French fries and you end up out </v>
<v Speaker 6>there and you got nothing.</v>

361
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.393
<v Speaker 6>Even if you go French fries,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so a lot of times that's boiled and </v>

362
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.530
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

363
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:35.961
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

364
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:39.000
<v Speaker 6>I know beef fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

365
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.810
<v Speaker 6>It's like an,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was just a nightmare,</v>

366
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.150
<v Speaker 6>but I mean it was also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

367
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:44.770
<v Speaker 6>at the time I had a really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

368
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.400
<v Speaker 6>cool smart girlfriend who was Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was cooking amazing stuff,</v>

369
00:16:48.401 --> 00:16:52.180
<v Speaker 6>fucking Vegan enchiladas once a week </v>
<v Speaker 6>that were just mind blowing and all this</v>

370
00:16:52.181 --> 00:16:54.310
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it was sort of easy for me and at the</v>

371
00:16:54.311 --> 00:16:55.144
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

372
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.070
<v Speaker 6>I was just looking for anything to help.</v>

373
00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 1>And what was the day that you did it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you do it?</v>

374
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.010
<v Speaker 6>I know you had a lot of influence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were going to.</v>

375
00:17:02.011 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 6>A lot of great steakhouses wasn't long </v>
<v Speaker 6>after I started working with you and I'm</v>

376
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.730
<v Speaker 6>just watching you eat a steak and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

377
00:17:08.731 --> 00:17:09.600
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

378
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:10.993
<v Speaker 6>and I wasn't getting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My energy levels have completely </v>

379
00:17:13.141 --> 00:17:13.974
<v Speaker 6>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go to the gym every day now pretty </v>

380
00:17:15.481 --> 00:17:16.051
<v Speaker 6>much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

381
00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:16.680
<v Speaker 6>six,</v>
<v Speaker 6>five,</v>

382
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.870
<v Speaker 6>six days a week and knock something out </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's.</v>

383
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.520
<v Speaker 6>I just wasn't like that before,</v>

384
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.473
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I brought this up to you while </v>

385
00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:23.844
<v Speaker 1>you were a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would just be raving about how much </v>

386
00:17:25.831 --> 00:17:29.670
<v Speaker 1>energy you have and how healthy you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's one thing that people always</v>

387
00:17:29.671 --> 00:17:30.750
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what they're doing.</v>

388
00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm guilty of it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're doing something,</v>

389
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:34.763
<v Speaker 1>you want to promote whatever that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because you want other people to do </v>

390
00:17:37.231 --> 00:17:38.064
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you start ranting and raving about </v>

391
00:17:40.051 --> 00:17:41.010
<v Speaker 1>how great it is.</v>

392
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.630
<v Speaker 6>And it was for a because.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I thought that it was that,</v>

393
00:17:44.631 --> 00:17:45.464
<v Speaker 6>but it also probably had a lot to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the timing of everything was where </v>

394
00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:48.604
<v Speaker 6>you started making money for the first </v>
<v Speaker 6>time in comedy around that very same </v>

395
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 6>time when I started dating that Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 6>girl,</v>

396
00:17:54.121 --> 00:17:54.954
<v Speaker 6>that was the beginning of the five years</v>
<v Speaker 6>of that like it was when I started </v>

397
00:17:57.961 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 6>getting to do the road a lot with like </v>
<v Speaker 6>Jeff Ross back then.</v>

398
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 6>And I started writing on the roast back </v>
<v Speaker 6>then and I had a little bit of money and</v>

399
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:04.944
<v Speaker 6>things were going good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think that that played a lot into </v>

400
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 6>my like energy and just feeling good </v>
<v Speaker 6>overall was,</v>

401
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.000
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>being able to survive</v>

402
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.320
<v Speaker 4>was the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you go to Fogo de Chao or something?</v>

403
00:18:14.321 --> 00:18:16.300
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys all went.</v>

404
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.490
<v Speaker 4>So you were there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you saw us?</v>

405
00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.130
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I bought your.</v>

406
00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:20.870
<v Speaker 6>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was happy.</v>

407
00:18:20.871 --> 00:18:23.900
<v Speaker 6>It was like a holiday for me because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>was awful.</v>

408
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.980
<v Speaker 6>Having like your friend and especially </v>
<v Speaker 6>being on the road and you just wanted to</v>

409
00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:28.814
<v Speaker 6>go to an awesome restaurant and then I </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't know about these options that we </v>

410
00:18:31.971 --> 00:18:33.530
<v Speaker 6>have here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was never that way.</v>

411
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:34.401
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

412
00:18:34.401 --> 00:18:35.234
<v Speaker 6>I was never that way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He would always make a thing about it </v>

413
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.570
<v Speaker 6>before I die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you able to eat here?</v>

414
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.090
<v Speaker 6>Like they never had a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's all good.</v>

415
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.140
<v Speaker 6>The point is is that that first day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even after Fogo de Chao,</v>

416
00:18:45.141 --> 00:18:45.974
<v Speaker 6>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like a fucking pit bull after </v>

417
00:18:46.851 --> 00:18:47.684
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that night you called me up </v>

418
00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:50.510
<v Speaker 6>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That night I was,</v>

419
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.100
<v Speaker 6>I made a beat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now I'm a different person.</v>

420
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.620
<v Speaker 6>It felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck happened to Tony?</v>

421
00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.250
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never done like real steroids,</v>

422
00:19:01.251 --> 00:19:04.970
<v Speaker 6>but I'd imagine that exact.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt like a fucking animal.</v>

423
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.750
<v Speaker 4>Did you still have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You haven't had elk yet?</v>

424
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 4>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never.</v>

425
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the.</v>

426
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 4>When we set up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting a new grill.</v>

427
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting a new yoga grill and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting my old one at the studio.</v>

428
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 4>I want to set up at the studio because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

429
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:20.760
<v Speaker 4>I have freezers back there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to grill some steaks.</v>

430
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the studio.</v>

431
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.180
<v Speaker 4>You got to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're,</v>

432
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.063
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna feel you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Feel another bump above where you're at </v>

433
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:28.854
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I used to watch Ted nugent and I'm </v>

434
00:19:30.231 --> 00:19:31.470
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's this crazy fucker?</v>

435
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:33.840
<v Speaker 4>Get all his energy because he's crazy as</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

436
00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:34.674
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's yelling and screaming and then </v>

437
00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:37.650
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like 70 something years old.</v>

438
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.670
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does,</v>

439
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:39.990
<v Speaker 4>how does you have so much God damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy?</v>

440
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.973
<v Speaker 4>And then I saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had this interview once where he's </v>

441
00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:44.550
<v Speaker 4>cooking the steak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this deer steak.</v>

442
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.383
<v Speaker 4>This is years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was probably one of the things that </v>

443
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.833
<v Speaker 4>is before I ever hunted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that popped into my </v>

444
00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:49.974
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of hunting and he was cutting </v>

445
00:19:52.351 --> 00:19:55.410
<v Speaker 4>up this piece of meat and showing like </v>
<v Speaker 4>how red and dark it wasn't talking about</v>

446
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 4>how many nutrients that there was in it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and how much more nutritious and healthy</v>

447
00:19:59.011 --> 00:19:59.844
<v Speaker 4>it is than store bought meat that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>hormones in it and antibiotics and all </v>

448
00:20:03.361 --> 00:20:04.194
<v Speaker 4>this jazz and I remember thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfuckers probably right and then </v>

449
00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:07.554
<v Speaker 4>the first time I deer meat from an </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal that I shot and I was sitting </v>

450
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:12.520
<v Speaker 4>there eating and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn it.</v>

451
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.300
<v Speaker 4>I feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>

452
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.240
<v Speaker 4>It's like a extra charge to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think that is?</v>

453
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Do you still really healthy animals?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you.</v>

454
00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 4>If you eat a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're eating a wild sprinter.</v>

455
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:25.523
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a wild sprinting machine </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's trying to get away from eating </v>

456
00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:29.880
<v Speaker 4>machines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating machines at what?</v>

457
00:20:29.881 --> 00:20:32.520
<v Speaker 4>Literally want to tear it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's it's life.</v>

458
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:33.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was that noise?</v>

459
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.310
<v Speaker 4>If you see a deer and the wild and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly like was gone over here,</v>

460
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.473
<v Speaker 4>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They bounce every now and then they </v>

461
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:43.140
<v Speaker 4>scare each other and then they have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking chill and come back.</v>

462
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.910
<v Speaker 6>Is there a restaurant at least in Los </v>
<v Speaker 6>Angeles that serves dear,</v>

463
00:20:46.911 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 6>like even that place in Calabasas,</v>

464
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.040
<v Speaker 4>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get some places that serve it,</v>

465
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:51.874
<v Speaker 4>but here's what's ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the stuff that they serve comes </v>

466
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:54.844
<v Speaker 4>from New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the venison that you buy comes </v>

467
00:20:57.221 --> 00:20:58.054
<v Speaker 4>from New Zealand and New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand's a treatment because New </v>

468
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.140
<v Speaker 4>Zealand is this gorgeous island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to visit New Zealand just to look</v>

469
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:08.590
<v Speaker 4>around because also because it's where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they filmed the hobbit and she's like,</v>

470
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.320
<v Speaker 4>you look at those scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those landscapes.</v>

471
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:12.880
<v Speaker 4>When they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you watched the Hobbit,</v>

472
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:13.780
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my God,</v>

473
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:16.510
<v Speaker 4>where is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's real in New Zealand.</v>

474
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 4>My friend remy is a hunting guide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remy Warren.</v>

475
00:21:19.991 --> 00:21:20.824
<v Speaker 4>He's been on the podcast before and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes to New Zealand once a year and </v>

476
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 4>guides people over New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He sent me some pictures of like what it</v>

477
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:28.930
<v Speaker 4>looks like there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

478
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't even want to go there to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

479
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.653
<v Speaker 4>I want to go there just as a vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to see what it's like because it's </v>

480
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:34.354
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be just stunning to look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>waterfalls and everything is green and </v>

481
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.280
<v Speaker 4>lush,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's what's fucked up about it.</v>

482
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.113
<v Speaker 4>Didn't have any animals on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's people from England came over to </v>

483
00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand and put all these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're so.</v>

484
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:47.704
<v Speaker 4>There was very little local wildlife and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the local wildlife they had was so </v>

485
00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:53.224
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wind up killing off a bunch of </v>

486
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They used to have an eagle there.</v>

487
00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.650
<v Speaker 4>It's called the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called the Haas Eagle that had a 14</v>

488
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:02.620
<v Speaker 4>foot wingspan and they think it hunted </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

489
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.450
<v Speaker 4>They think it's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 4>they exterminated that thing.</v>

490
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

491
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What in the fuck?</v>

492
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:13.840
<v Speaker 4>How cool is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Double check my math.</v>

493
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:14.703
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure it's 14 feet long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's way bigger than the biggest </v>

494
00:22:17.471 --> 00:22:18.940
<v Speaker 4>eagle we have today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way Bigger.</v>

495
00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:19.774
<v Speaker 4>It was the biggest eagle ever and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a lot of speculation that preyed on </v>

496
00:22:22.121 --> 00:22:24.820
<v Speaker 4>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but New Zealand has no predators,</v>

497
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.833
<v Speaker 4>so New Zealand has like all these elk </v>
<v Speaker 4>and deer and everything and a lot of </v>

498
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:30.334
<v Speaker 4>them are like fenced in and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>slaughter them and send them back to </v>

499
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:33.994
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

500
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.290
<v Speaker 4>They send it all over the world costs </v>
<v Speaker 4>eagle h a s a h,</v>

501
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:43.030
<v Speaker 4>a s eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an extinct eagle from New Zealand.</v>

502
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.940
<v Speaker 4>I think it only lived on New Zealand as </v>
<v Speaker 4>far as we know,</v>

503
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 4>two to three meters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's about three meters.</v>

504
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.440
<v Speaker 4>That's nine feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm full of Shit.</v>

505
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.170
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was 14 feet.</v>

506
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.183
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go find something else because I swear </v>

507
00:22:55.571 --> 00:22:56.404
<v Speaker 4>to God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something said that it was bigger than </v>

508
00:22:57.341 --> 00:22:58.090
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

509
00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:02.140
<v Speaker 4>We did this on the podcast before we </v>
<v Speaker 4>went over this on the podcast,</v>

510
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.030
<v Speaker 4>there was an episode where I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

511
00:23:04.031 --> 00:23:04.864
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was bigger than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then we found out other places did </v>

512
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 4>say it was bigger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I remember.</v>

513
00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.293
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you see if you could find one that </v>

514
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.760
<v Speaker 4>core operates my shitbag memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What should we do with this thing?</v>

515
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.850
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm all vape pens these days.</v>

516
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.693
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to smoke it.</v>

517
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:20.763
<v Speaker 8>Whoa.</v>

518
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.023
<v Speaker 4>So if you don't have predators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they don't have bears or wolves </v>

519
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.110
<v Speaker 4>have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have nothing.</v>

520
00:23:27.111 --> 00:23:29.260
<v Speaker 4>So these God damn things are everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

521
00:23:29.261 --> 00:23:30.290
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they slaughter them.</v>

522
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.350
<v Speaker 4>They get so bad that sometimes they have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to shoot him out of helicopters,</v>

523
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:34.683
<v Speaker 4>don't overpopulate areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they fly over these areas and gunned </v>

524
00:23:38.121 --> 00:23:40.760
<v Speaker 4>down these stags with helicopters and </v>
<v Speaker 4>leave them to rot.</v>

525
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.730
<v Speaker 4>What a panda bears eat like you can live</v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

526
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.290
<v Speaker 4>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

527
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 4>They're vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

528
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much.</v>

529
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:48.164
<v Speaker 4>They do a lot of rape in though panda </v>
<v Speaker 4>bears apparently the rape the fuck out </v>

530
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:53.390
<v Speaker 4>of each other and not pandas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking of cool.</v>

531
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 4>Those qualities of the Eucalyptus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are too.</v>

532
00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 4>It's funny because we thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

533
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.290
<v Speaker 4>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand is.</v>

534
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:04.124
<v Speaker 4>I'm so wild game meat that you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go to a restaurant and you have </v>

535
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 4>like elk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you by elk today,</v>

536
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.920
<v Speaker 4>most likely you're getting it from New </v>
<v Speaker 4>Zealand.</v>

537
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.280
<v Speaker 4>What was that one meat that you gave me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One time it was cooked.</v>

538
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.190
<v Speaker 4>It was the best meal I've ever had in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

539
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 4>That was wild boar for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

540
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.400
<v Speaker 4>there was smoke ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

541
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking there's nothing I've</v>

542
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 4>ever tasted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was that good?</v>

543
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it tastes different than anything.</v>

544
00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:29.354
<v Speaker 4>I cooked it for my kids the other day </v>
<v Speaker 4>and my wife was saying what while we're </v>

545
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:32.700
<v Speaker 4>eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlotte,</v>

546
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 4>sorry to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>

547
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.723
<v Speaker 4>this does not taste like any other kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of meat because you're eating a wild </v>

548
00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:41.060
<v Speaker 4>animal that's struggling and surviving </v>
<v Speaker 4>the acorns and shit.</v>

549
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.220
<v Speaker 4>It was like dark pig times too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like pig,</v>

550
00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:45.683
<v Speaker 4>like dark meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Latin restaurants because you gotta you </v>

551
00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:53.170
<v Speaker 4>gotTa Kill Them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to go out.</v>

552
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to go out and hunt them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill them.</v>

553
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.550
<v Speaker 4>There should be like.</v>

554
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.670
<v Speaker 4>But there's weird laws about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's weird laws in this country about</v>

555
00:24:58.671 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 4>wild game and it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's are good laws because the reason</v>

556
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:02.444
<v Speaker 4>why they establish these losses because </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the 18 hundreds we had almost no </v>

557
00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:09.490
<v Speaker 4>animals left because of market hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When market hunting is,</v>

558
00:25:09.491 --> 00:25:12.530
<v Speaker 4>is after the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and actually even before that,</v>

559
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.720
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have refrigerators man.</v>

560
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.420
<v Speaker 4>And so if you wanted meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to get it pretty fresh.</v>

561
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.270
<v Speaker 4>It had to be killed like within the last</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of days.</v>

562
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:24.950
<v Speaker 4>And so what they would do is they would </v>
<v Speaker 4>go to these,</v>

563
00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.761
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

564
00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:26.594
<v Speaker 4>soldiers who had come back from the war </v>
<v Speaker 4>and really didn't have anything to do </v>

565
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:30.913
<v Speaker 4>and these guys would get hired by these </v>
<v Speaker 4>meat companies and they would just go </v>

566
00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:34.724
<v Speaker 4>out and shoot buffalo and elk and deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at a certain point in time they had </v>

567
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:43.811
<v Speaker 4>almost eradicated all of the wild game </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals in this country that,</v>

568
00:25:44.061 --> 00:25:44.894
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

569
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.100
<v Speaker 4>like wild deer.</v>

570
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.963
<v Speaker 4>There was almost no deer left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the early 18 hundreds and the early </v>

571
00:25:49.521 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 4>19 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the turn of the century,</v>

572
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.110
<v Speaker 4>you would be super lucky if you saw a </v>
<v Speaker 4>deer.</v>

573
00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:54.944
<v Speaker 4>If you went deer hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be super lucky if you saw a deer </v>

574
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:58.530
<v Speaker 4>and they wouldn't be a big deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody just,</v>

575
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.690
<v Speaker 4>everybody just went buck wild on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was common in preparing themselves.</v>

576
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.793
<v Speaker 4>There should be a subscription box </v>
<v Speaker 4>service that lets you order hunting </v>

577
00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:08.791
<v Speaker 4>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

578
00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:09.051
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

579
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:09.291
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

580
00:26:09.291 --> 00:26:09.910
<v Speaker 4>you this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

581
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:10.743
<v Speaker 4>You're getting me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just explained that you can't sell it </v>

582
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:13.544
<v Speaker 4>because of that market hunting wiped out</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those animals because they sold </v>

583
00:26:16.731 --> 00:26:18.200
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they made laws,</v>

584
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:22.160
<v Speaker 4>established laws that say you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 4>sell wild game,</v>

585
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.353
<v Speaker 4>so if you go to public land and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a good percentage of the hunting that's </v>

586
00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:30.710
<v Speaker 4>done in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least is done on public land,</v>

587
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.700
<v Speaker 4>and what that means is Freddy Roosevelt </v>
<v Speaker 4>a or a theater.</v>

588
00:26:34.701 --> 00:26:38.840
<v Speaker 4>Roosevelt in his wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that we have all this incredible</v>

589
00:26:38.841 --> 00:26:42.800
<v Speaker 4>land in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's Freddy's brother?</v>

590
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Freddy Roosevelt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're thinking?</v>

591
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I said Freddy Roosevelt Franklin,</v>

592
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:50.550
<v Speaker 4>but I was thinking of Teddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

593
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Theater Roosevelt.</v>

594
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:54.993
<v Speaker 4>But was it Franklin Roosevelt who </v>
<v Speaker 4>established for two different </v>

595
00:26:57.781 --> 00:26:58.591
<v Speaker 4>Roosevelt's?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

596
00:26:58.591 --> 00:27:00.300
<v Speaker 4>Teddy and theory is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

597
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.300
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>teddy,</v>

598
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.290
<v Speaker 4>but Freddie Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Franklin,</v>

599
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:06.150
<v Speaker 4>Franklin Delano Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a different person.</v>

600
00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:07.803
<v Speaker 4>When was he president?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Theodore Roosevelt Guy who set it all </v>

601
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:12.720
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

602
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.750
<v Speaker 4>Theodore Roosevelt set up conservation </v>
<v Speaker 4>for like,</v>

603
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm good dude tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ten 33 to 45.</v>

604
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.730
<v Speaker 4>Which one is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Franklin Franklin.</v>

605
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so Teddy Roosevelt,</v>

606
00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:23.283
<v Speaker 4>the original.</v>

607
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.950
<v Speaker 4>That's why they called the teddy bear me</v>
<v Speaker 4>establish things like,</v>

608
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like um,</v>

609
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.940
<v Speaker 4>yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you go to yellowstone,</v>

610
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.030
<v Speaker 4>that's all because of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the people in his era,</v>

611
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.620
<v Speaker 4>they looked at all this amazing land and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they realized like,</v>

612
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.330
<v Speaker 4>we can't let this go away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is really important.</v>

613
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.780
<v Speaker 4>Like we gotta keep this public.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to keep this.</v>

614
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.843
<v Speaker 4>We got to figure out a way where </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone can go and enjoy this and not </v>

615
00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:49.434
<v Speaker 4>have someone just put a fence around it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and make it impossible for people to </v>

616
00:27:51.631 --> 00:27:55.020
<v Speaker 4>traverse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they set up all these public lands in</v>

617
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:57.060
<v Speaker 4>this country that are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really rare.</v>

618
00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:02.270
<v Speaker 4>You don't have these giant chunks of </v>
<v Speaker 4>land that no one can buy or sell in this</v>

619
00:28:02.281 --> 00:28:03.114
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do.</v>

620
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.310
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really rare in other countries.</v>

621
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.263
<v Speaker 4>What are some of the other animals that </v>
<v Speaker 4>tastes good that we don't ever get to </v>

622
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:11.310
<v Speaker 4>eat for El boar and elk are prime.</v>

623
00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.820
<v Speaker 4>Harriet Belk is probably the best meat </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll ever have in your life.</v>

624
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 4>It it tastes so much better than beef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

625
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:18.953
<v Speaker 4>it's just a pure meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pure and you're eating an animal </v>

626
00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 4>that eating when it's supposed to eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

627
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:25.260
<v Speaker 4>It's a healthy animal that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>prime of its life,</v>

628
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:26.123
<v Speaker 4>so you can really only get it if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunted you only or if you have a friend </v>

629
00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 4>that's a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way.</v>

630
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.170
<v Speaker 4>The only way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way.</v>

631
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.203
<v Speaker 4>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

632
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.680
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird because that's what we should</v>

633
00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:37.950
<v Speaker 4>be eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's so unamerican to not be able</v>

634
00:28:37.951 --> 00:28:39.140
<v Speaker 4>to buy something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

635
00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 4>you can't because we would wipe it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

636
00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:42.750
<v Speaker 4>It's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would wipe it out.</v>

637
00:28:42.751 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 4>But what if you have farm raised wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore?</v>

638
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:46.164
<v Speaker 4>Then not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they do that and they have done </v>

639
00:28:47.701 --> 00:28:48.534
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do raise wild ones and they put </v>

640
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:52.260
<v Speaker 4>them in these pens and they put fences </v>
<v Speaker 4>around them.</v>

641
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.273
<v Speaker 4>The problem is we're not supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating all of the same spot and when </v>

642
00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:57.590
<v Speaker 4>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they develop diseases.</v>

643
00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.990
<v Speaker 4>They don't have immune systems for them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they develop something called chronic</v>

644
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:01.824
<v Speaker 4>wasting disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was a giant issue in a lot of </v>

645
00:29:04.171 --> 00:29:06.270
<v Speaker 4>parts of the midwest where they took </v>
<v Speaker 4>these animals,</v>

646
00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:07.104
<v Speaker 4>and this is just speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't exactly know what caused his </v>

647
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:11.730
<v Speaker 4>chronic wasting disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't exist before.</v>

648
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.713
<v Speaker 4>These farm systems where they would grow</v>
<v Speaker 4>these deer in these pens and so these </v>

649
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 4>put these high fence operations up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these giant chain link fences.</v>

650
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:20.304
<v Speaker 4>The deer can't get out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all stuck in there and they </v>

651
00:29:21.901 --> 00:29:24.270
<v Speaker 4>would feed them and when you feed these </v>
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>

652
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:25.104
<v Speaker 4>they'd be eating each other's saliva and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would develop all these diseases </v>

653
00:29:28.171 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 4>they never developed before because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there were grass eaters.</v>

654
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.450
<v Speaker 4>They're supposed to be out there eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>wild vegetation.</v>

655
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:34.463
<v Speaker 4>That's what is supposed to be eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>sage and grasses and all the different </v>

656
00:29:36.931 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 4>things that you see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you know when you see a,</v>

657
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:39.653
<v Speaker 4>a buffalo roaming in a field,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they're supposed to be </v>

658
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 4>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

659
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.470
<v Speaker 4>But we've in our wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have realized,</v>

660
00:29:44.471 --> 00:29:45.304
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can get these fuckers fatter if we </v>

661
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:48.190
<v Speaker 4>just stick them in this thing and make </v>
<v Speaker 4>me eat corn.</v>

662
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.010
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what fucked up our food in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this country.</v>

663
00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:51.844
<v Speaker 4>It's what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing that fucked up the </v>

664
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.830
<v Speaker 4>production of processed foods with all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sugar.</v>

665
00:29:56.831 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 4>It's the same goddamn wisdom.</v>

666
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're far away though for </v>
<v Speaker 3>having like cloning food,</v>

667
00:30:01.471 --> 00:30:02.460
<v Speaker 3>being able to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

668
00:30:02.461 --> 00:30:04.520
<v Speaker 3>we can make food nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can do it.</v>

669
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:06.610
<v Speaker 3>You can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

670
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:07.613
<v Speaker 3>Do you think though it's not far away </v>
<v Speaker 3>that where you could actually buy a </v>

671
00:30:10.681 --> 00:30:11.940
<v Speaker 3>certain thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to the grocery story.</v>

672
00:30:11.941 --> 00:30:12.774
<v Speaker 3>This is fake food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can buy like bore and all the </v>

673
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.290
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

674
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.123
<v Speaker 4>It probably won't taste the same for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same reason why a cow doesn't taste the </v>

675
00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:21.090
<v Speaker 4>same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it eats grass,</v>

676
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.720
<v Speaker 4>like if you give a cow grass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it becomes this different animal.</v>

677
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.200
<v Speaker 4>If you give a cow corn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it becomes this fatty,</v>

678
00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:31.320
<v Speaker 4>lighter colored animal is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people think is more delicious.</v>

679
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.303
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people like that better that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like corn fed better include Anthony </v>

680
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.350
<v Speaker 4>Bourdain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He likes the corn fed beef.</v>

681
00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:38.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really does.</v>

682
00:30:38.481 --> 00:30:40.080
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really like a fatty steak,</v>

683
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.180
<v Speaker 4>but he's also a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

684
00:30:42.181 --> 00:30:45.870
<v Speaker 4>he knows how to cook it perfectly and </v>
<v Speaker 4>under manipulate that fat and you know,</v>

685
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:46.973
<v Speaker 4>marble it perfectly or the cookie </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfectly rather the marbling and all </v>

686
00:30:50.071 --> 00:30:51.330
<v Speaker 4>that sort of hang out with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

687
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:52.561
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A couple times.</v>

688
00:30:52.561 --> 00:30:55.830
<v Speaker 4>One hunting with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does he love his life as much as I think</v>

689
00:30:55.831 --> 00:30:56.664
<v Speaker 4>he should.</v>

690
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.860
<v Speaker 4>Here's the restaurant in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>according to him.</v>

691
00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>

692
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.213
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you guys have the world's best job </v>

699
00:31:14.791 --> 00:31:15.624
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope he fucking knows what he's doing </v>

700
00:31:16.891 --> 00:31:18.810
<v Speaker 4>is everybody's dream job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He knows and I know too.</v>

702
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:21.403
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely know that I have dream </v>

703
00:31:22.651 --> 00:31:25.020
<v Speaker 4>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my dream is different than his dream</v>

704
00:31:25.021 --> 00:31:26.430
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just both have dream job.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

707
00:31:29.311 --> 00:31:30.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like his dream job.</v>

708
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.583
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent is doing what he </v>

711
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.420
<v Speaker 4>which is really weird.</v>

712
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.480
<v Speaker 4>So everywhere he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's born in Jujitsu than I ever was.</v>

713
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.850
<v Speaker 4>He trains every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every fucking day.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They just lived separate,</v>

717
00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:55.770
<v Speaker 4>like he's on the road all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have a kid together and they're</v>

718
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.080
<v Speaker 4>really close and they raised the kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and it's like,</v>

719
00:31:58.081 --> 00:32:01.260
<v Speaker 4>it's not a bad situation at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a great guy.</v>

720
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.490
<v Speaker 4>He's a very,</v>

723
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.960
<v Speaker 4>and just pursued it and he's getting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>reward out of it and he chases it down.</v>

724
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.270
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes to these places,</v>

725
00:32:15.271 --> 00:32:17.280
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just sucking this world up.</v>

726
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.533
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's in Jamaica or China or anywhere </v>

727
00:32:20.761 --> 00:32:22.980
<v Speaker 4>he's going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just stuck in these places up.</v>

728
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.823
<v Speaker 4>He's just pulling them in and writing </v>
<v Speaker 4>about them and talking about them and </v>

729
00:32:26.521 --> 00:32:27.354
<v Speaker 4>experiencing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you get that from the show fucking </v>

731
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:31.463

<v Speaker 4>somehow able to really tap into that </v>

732
00:32:36.061 --> 00:32:38.130
<v Speaker 4>culture as fast as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

<v Speaker 5>into that.</v>

736
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:45.380
<v Speaker 5>It's not like Anthony's calling places </v>

<v Speaker 4>same show or same production company </v>

<v Speaker 4>let me the fuck home.</v>

748
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't like traveling that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

749
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:17.780
<v Speaker 4>I traveled pawlenty and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm home for a lot lately.</v>

750
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:18.614
<v Speaker 4>I'm home more now than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I like it a lot better and I'm not </v>

751
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.513
<v Speaker 4>working less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm working just as much on getting a </v>

752
00:33:23.811 --> 00:33:24.644
<v Speaker 4>lot of shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But all that air travel and all that </v>

753
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:28.760
<v Speaker 4>stuff that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is bullshit.</v>

754
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.710
<v Speaker 4>You're working smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

755
00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:32.900
<v Speaker 4>But I just realized like there's a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do this.</v>

756
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.920
<v Speaker 4>And another thing that helped fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendously,</v>

757
00:33:35.921 --> 00:33:39.470
<v Speaker 4>it's coming back to the store because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm working on shit all the time.</v>

758
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.353
<v Speaker 4>I did four sets here the other night on </v>
<v Speaker 4>last Thursday I did four sets and I'm </v>

759
00:33:43.581 --> 00:33:44.414
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can do four sets on a Thursday night </v>

760
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:48.770
<v Speaker 4>at the same goddamn club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't need to go anywhere.</v>

761
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.920
<v Speaker 4>Like I do eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I do like to do the road.</v>

762
00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:53.810
<v Speaker 4>I do like to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even the road,</v>

763
00:33:53.811 --> 00:33:54.644
<v Speaker 4>like what I'm doing the road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing less theaters than ever </v>

764
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.170
<v Speaker 4>because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

765
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.240
<v Speaker 4>I have more fun at clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>

766
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:02.430
<v Speaker 4>I like 300 people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I like.</v>

767
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.310
<v Speaker 4>You get more work done by doing more </v>
<v Speaker 4>sets.</v>

768
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.173
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get more work done by doing more </v>

769
00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 4>sets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also the experience you're not going</v>

770
00:34:08.751 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 4>to get as much money with the experience</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a different experience,</v>

771
00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:12.464
<v Speaker 4>a better experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more standup and you're connected </v>

772
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:17.240
<v Speaker 4>to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas those theaters,</v>

773
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:19.370
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is really fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

774
00:34:19.371 --> 00:34:21.380
<v Speaker 4>like New Year's was a fucking blast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

775
00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.170
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of it is a show,</v>

776
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:27.603
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

777
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.300
<v Speaker 5>Big Ass show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big lighting,</v>

778
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.060
<v Speaker 5>change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People there,</v>

779
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:31.953
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of it you're paying for that pop </v>

780
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.070
<v Speaker 5>that happens when the lighting change </v>
<v Speaker 5>happens and the show's about to start.</v>

781
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:38.210
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

782
00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:40.760
<v Speaker 5>you just paying for all that energy </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you don't get that.</v>

783
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:45.400
<v Speaker 5>You get always a cheesy thing usually at</v>
<v Speaker 5>a comedy club coming up next week at the</v>

784
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:46.610
<v Speaker 5>chuggle hood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

785
00:34:46.611 --> 00:34:50.090
<v Speaker 5>Almost every decent parking validation </v>
<v Speaker 5>available.</v>

786
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.450
<v Speaker 5>They always have weird announcements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there a chuckle hut by the way?</v>

787
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:54.583
<v Speaker 5>It must be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so because that's the fun </v>

788
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.060
<v Speaker 5>of everyone's jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did they say?</v>

789
00:34:59.061 --> 00:35:01.670
<v Speaker 5>Everybody says uncle fuckers chuckle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hut,</v>

790
00:35:01.671 --> 00:35:03.210
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what everybody says.</v>

791
00:35:03.211 --> 00:35:05.230
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've just always chuckle.</v>

792
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.340
<v Speaker 5>Head is like what I picture like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>worst comedy club that sound like,</v>

793
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.603
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those things are so important though </v>

794
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.090
<v Speaker 4>that without those clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

795
00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.413
<v Speaker 4>I've had this conversation with club </v>
<v Speaker 4>owners before to like give my thanks </v>

796
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:20.893
<v Speaker 4>because I think there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a combative relationship that </v>

797
00:35:22.451 --> 00:35:24.580
<v Speaker 4>happens between a lot of comics and club</v>
<v Speaker 4>owners,</v>

798
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.713
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to fuck us and because </v>

799
00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:29.020
<v Speaker 4>everybody has a story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

800
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.950
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has a story where a club owner</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked you over or something happened.</v>

801
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has a story and so in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning it's hard to get booked,</v>

802
00:35:36.911 --> 00:35:37.744
<v Speaker 4>so developed a sort of contentious </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with them in the first </v>

803
00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:42.270
<v Speaker 4>place because they don't want to use you</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're not really that good.</v>

804
00:35:42.271 --> 00:35:43.104
<v Speaker 4>Then things start going for you and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start selling tickets and then you </v>

805
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 4>think they're not giving you enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you sell too many tickets.</v>

806
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:50.910
<v Speaker 4>Then eventually you realized somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>along the line.</v>

807
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.890
<v Speaker 4>I think hopefully eventually I did at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least that the fucking need those people</v>

808
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.260
<v Speaker 4>like without them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no art form.</v>

809
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:02.130
<v Speaker 4>Like we need a place to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This isn't like music.</v>

810
00:36:02.131 --> 00:36:02.964
<v Speaker 4>This isn't like writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we have to go in front of those </v>

811
00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:07.200
<v Speaker 4>fucking people and we're not going to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it ourselves.</v>

812
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.640
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just the.</v>

813
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:09.623
<v Speaker 4>Especially the funny ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think Louis Ck is gonna open up a </v>

814
00:36:11.911 --> 00:36:12.744
<v Speaker 4>comedy club comedy club and Bill Burr </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Berg and open up a fucking laugh </v>

815
00:36:15.751 --> 00:36:17.050
<v Speaker 4>factory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

816
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to open up a comedy club?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

817
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.910
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

818
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.773
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is.</v>

819
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.190
<v Speaker 4>So you need those fucking people.</v>

820
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy because like,</v>

821
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>without.</v>

822
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.613
<v Speaker 6>And it's also amazing how each club has </v>
<v Speaker 6>their own different vibe and totally </v>

823
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:34.290
<v Speaker 6>different DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>

824
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:38.270
<v Speaker 6>I mean other than the Improv's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which you know are the Improv.</v>

825
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:40.973
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I figured out a way to make them all </v>

826
00:36:41.541 --> 00:36:42.374
<v Speaker 4>feel the same.</v>

827
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.253
<v Speaker 6>I think that's it and I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I enjoy my time in the southern </v>

828
00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:49.410
<v Speaker 6>California Improv's when I performed </v>
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

829
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.720
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's a thing.</v>

830
00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.790
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not bad.</v>

831
00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.760
<v Speaker 4>It's not a bad feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you go to do the Tempe Improv,</v>

832
00:36:55.761 --> 00:36:58.080
<v Speaker 4>even though it feels like all the Improv</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a fucking great clubs.</v>

833
00:36:58.081 --> 00:36:59.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with all of them.</v>

834
00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.480
<v Speaker 4>They figured out how to do it right </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you go to every place.</v>

835
00:37:02.481 --> 00:37:06.110
<v Speaker 4>It's almost all the same experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good experience and then it just,</v>

836
00:37:06.111 --> 00:37:09.230
<v Speaker 4>they leave it up to the stand up so they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have everything down in between,</v>

837
00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.660
<v Speaker 4>but it feels very different than say if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to Zane,</v>

838
00:37:11.661 --> 00:37:13.370
<v Speaker 4>he's in Nashville.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

839
00:37:13.371 --> 00:37:18.010
<v Speaker 4>That's a club that's been in that form </v>
<v Speaker 4>for 30 years or something like that.</v>

840
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.863
<v Speaker 4>It's an amazing spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This ancient headshots in the world on </v>

841
00:37:21.771 --> 00:37:24.830
<v Speaker 4>the wall where half the people are dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

842
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.960
<v Speaker 4>love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a different vibe.</v>

843
00:37:26.961 --> 00:37:28.050
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or the Ice House.</v>

844
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.070
<v Speaker 4>That's a totally different vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a non corporate vibe.</v>

845
00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.440
<v Speaker 4>That's like a holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this gym,</v>

846
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.620
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that place.</v>

847
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.180
<v Speaker 6>St e's in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Portland,</v>

848
00:37:38.181 --> 00:37:39.020
<v Speaker 6>helium,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Denver,</v>

849
00:37:39.021 --> 00:37:39.854
<v Speaker 6>comedy works.</v>

850
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Speaker 4>All those places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Helium and Philly.</v>

851
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

852
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those clubs are like these.</v>

853
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:47.003
<v Speaker 4>Almost like a mom and pop organization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you had to look at it that way </v>

854
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 4>because they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're a small business.</v>

855
00:37:51.631 --> 00:37:54.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a small business that caters to </v>
<v Speaker 4>live comedy.</v>

856
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.200
<v Speaker 4>Without it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're fucked.</v>

857
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.273
<v Speaker 4>Look what happened in Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last stop in river oaks closed down </v>

858
00:37:59.431 --> 00:38:01.320
<v Speaker 4>in Houston and so did the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

859
00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:02.154
<v Speaker 4>I know there's some guys out there and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want them to feel bad that I'm </v>

860
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.673
<v Speaker 4>shitting on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not shitting on Houston and there's </v>

861
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.920
<v Speaker 4>a lot of great comics came out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

862
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 4>a lot of our friends came out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maddie Kirsch.</v>

863
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:10.783
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what happened was they had this </v>

864
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.150
<v Speaker 4>powerful fucking scene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like everybody thought about,</v>

865
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:20.910
<v Speaker 4>you thought about La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought about New York,</v>

866
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:21.744
<v Speaker 4>you thought about Boston and San </v>
<v Speaker 4>Francisco and you thought about fucking </v>

867
00:38:23.821 --> 00:38:24.570
<v Speaker 4>Houston.</v>

868
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:25.403
<v Speaker 4>Houston was a real scene man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had kinison and Hicks and it was </v>

869
00:38:29.221 --> 00:38:30.054
<v Speaker 4>like they had a whole thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when we came along I came along and </v>

870
00:38:33.181 --> 00:38:36.640
<v Speaker 4>I started working there in the late </v>
<v Speaker 4>nineties and it was still echoing.</v>

871
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:38.410
<v Speaker 4>It was like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Hicks was dead.</v>

872
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Tennyson was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was like this bar,</v>

873
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.560
<v Speaker 4>just the last reverberations of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>echoes of that crew,</v>

874
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Pineapple and all these guys that </v>
<v Speaker 4>came through with him and,</v>

875
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:51.604
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the outlaws of comedy that they used to </v>

876
00:38:52.361 --> 00:38:53.194
<v Speaker 4>call themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were like looking for the next </v>

877
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:56.740
<v Speaker 4>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was there in Austin scene back then?</v>

878
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.113
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

879
00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 4>there was always a scene and very smart </v>
<v Speaker 4>seen.</v>

880
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 4>Austin has always been thought of as </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

881
00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:04.060
<v Speaker 4>a smart place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

882
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:07.720
<v Speaker 4>like because of the universities there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like a real liberal town,</v>

883
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:08.554
<v Speaker 4>a smart towns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The velveeta room came along and when </v>

884
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:11.800
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When did they start out?</v>

885
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:13.223
<v Speaker 5>I tell you what though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Houston has got a new up and coming </v>

886
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.013
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that new club that opened up the secret </v>

887
00:39:17.191 --> 00:39:19.080
<v Speaker 5>group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When did they open up?</v>

888
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:20.250
<v Speaker 5>Just this year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We.</v>

889
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.001
<v Speaker 5>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

890
00:39:21.001 --> 00:39:24.140
<v Speaker 5>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did an entire festival in like it's</v>

891
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:28.710
<v Speaker 5>this multi room to like super warehouse </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they have an outdoor parking lot and</v>

892
00:39:28.711 --> 00:39:29.544
<v Speaker 5>they put a huge outdoor tent so we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing like kill Tony in one room while </v>

893
00:39:32.791 --> 00:39:37.791
<v Speaker 5>Joey and sold out big ass warehouse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a fucking rave version of kill Tony</v>

894
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:41.790
<v Speaker 5>and outside in this big open field under</v>
<v Speaker 5>a huge tent.</v>

895
00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.653
<v Speaker 5>Joey Diaz just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this place has so many rooms and </v>

896
00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:50.580
<v Speaker 5>I do believe it or lots of comics that </v>
<v Speaker 5>got together and bought it.</v>

897
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.953
<v Speaker 5>They have a club too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called the secret group and that's </v>

898
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.300
<v Speaker 5>perfect with a bomb ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>huge green room in the middle,</v>

899
00:39:57.301 --> 00:39:58.410
<v Speaker 5>like off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

900
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.870
<v Speaker 5>but everybody's going to do there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's different shows,</v>

901
00:40:00.871 --> 00:40:01.590
<v Speaker 5>different room.</v>

902
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.580
<v Speaker 4>That sort of proves my point that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>need a club because the Houston scene,</v>

903
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:06.443
<v Speaker 4>they opened up an Improv there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know with Improv's the same </v>

904
00:40:08.731 --> 00:40:10.500
<v Speaker 4>thing we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a corporate environment.</v>

905
00:40:10.501 --> 00:40:11.334
<v Speaker 4>It's a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to have a bunch of </v>

906
00:40:12.151 --> 00:40:12.984
<v Speaker 4>people hanging around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably don't have an open mic </v>

907
00:40:14.761 --> 00:40:15.960
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they do,</v>

908
00:40:15.961 --> 00:40:18.600
<v Speaker 4>it's probably not that big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to get work.</v>

909
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.793
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the things about the really </v>
<v Speaker 4>good places is you can actually start </v>

910
00:40:21.931 --> 00:40:24.000
<v Speaker 4>out there and then work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

911
00:40:24.001 --> 00:40:26.760
<v Speaker 4>like a comedy works like Wendy as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole system.</v>

912
00:40:26.761 --> 00:40:31.110
<v Speaker 4>You started out there as a open miker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You develop your act and they let you mc</v>

913
00:40:31.111 --> 00:40:31.944
<v Speaker 4>on shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They teach how to bring people up to </v>

914
00:40:33.541 --> 00:40:36.360
<v Speaker 4>teach you how to middle than you learn </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to headline and then all of a sudden</v>

915
00:40:36.361 --> 00:40:37.194
<v Speaker 4>you're on the road.</v>

916
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.450
<v Speaker 4>You can actually become a comic and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can get paid there.</v>

917
00:40:39.451 --> 00:40:40.284
<v Speaker 4>She has like local headliners that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that started out in her club that'll </v>

918
00:40:42.781 --> 00:40:46.290
<v Speaker 4>come down there and do a week and sell </v>
<v Speaker 4>tickets like people know who they are.</v>

919
00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:48.270
<v Speaker 4>People in the town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a beast.</v>

920
00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need a club and need a club.</v>

921
00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.750
<v Speaker 4>You need cloud are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

922
00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:55.680
<v Speaker 4>looking at this place the greatest of </v>

<v Speaker 4>behind the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you can get a lot of light bulbs and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then control it with apps and change all</v>

933
00:41:12.421 --> 00:41:13.254
<v Speaker 5>the different colors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have the New Light Light Stir </v>

<v Speaker 5>Check it out.</v>

939
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.240
<v Speaker 5>I think it should be blue though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For what?</v>

940
00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.260
<v Speaker 5>To make an act.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want leave it blue.</v>

941
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm just thinking about a foot and if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a black wall,</v>

942
00:41:30.511 --> 00:41:31.590
<v Speaker 5>but the red behind it.</v>

943
00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.230
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the light.</v>

944
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we put the light on what?</v>

945
00:41:37.781 --> 00:41:40.340
<v Speaker 1>We're going to end the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the red light,</v>

946
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:41.781
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

947
00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:44.200
<v Speaker 1>the light is on time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I wrap it up,</v>

948
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.070
<v Speaker 1>we found it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

949
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:47.030
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

950
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:50.790
<v Speaker 1>so that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll put a red led light behind it.</v>

951
00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:51.624
<v Speaker 1>We're going to paint this whole room </v>
<v Speaker 1>black and we got to get rid of the </v>

952
00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:58.970
<v Speaker 1>interrogation lighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the first 48.</v>

953
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.790
<v Speaker 1>This is that room where people fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't talk even when they're guilty.</v>

954
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Keep your mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I walk in and put a cigarette out</v>

955
00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:10.700
<v Speaker 1>on my forehead right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I watched those videos,</v>

956
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 1>tell the damn truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always watched those videos.</v>

957
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I hope those guys lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they do a good job.</v>

958
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.971
<v Speaker 1>Am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

959
00:42:16.971 --> 00:42:18.770
<v Speaker 1>You can get out of this is really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

960
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.910
<v Speaker 6>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I did.</v>

961
00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:20.763
<v Speaker 6>I tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I've been watching those videos </v>

962
00:42:21.821 --> 00:42:23.620
<v Speaker 6>lately,</v>
<v Speaker 6>real interrogation videos.</v>

963
00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:24.813
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting as fuck to me because </v>
<v Speaker 6>either they break or they don't break </v>

964
00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:29.973
<v Speaker 6>and</v>

965
00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:30.871
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare.</v>

966
00:42:30.871 --> 00:42:32.490
<v Speaker 1>They don't break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they don't break you have to be</v>

967
00:42:32.491 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 1>really worried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

968
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Those are fucking sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly</v>

969
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.330
<v Speaker 6>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The interesting thing is when they don't</v>

970
00:42:37.331 --> 00:42:39.850
<v Speaker 6>break your even more amazed like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

971
00:42:39.851 --> 00:42:43.180
<v Speaker 6>you evil motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just able to stay so calm.</v>

972
00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.620
<v Speaker 6>You've got to look some of these up.</v>

973
00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:45.663
<v Speaker 1>My favorite is when they admit to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a lie and then they have </v>

974
00:42:48.971 --> 00:42:49.804
<v Speaker 1>to correct their store and then you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>him like four hours later and they just </v>

975
00:42:53.921 --> 00:42:54.754
<v Speaker 1>beat these dudes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep talking to them hour after </v>

976
00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:58.540
<v Speaker 1>hour after hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should be,</v>

977
00:42:58.541 --> 00:42:59.374
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally illegal because you leave me in </v>

978
00:43:01.751 --> 00:43:02.584
<v Speaker 1>a room for fucking six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I think that I'm going to get to a </v>

979
00:43:04.781 --> 00:43:07.510
<v Speaker 1>bed and six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start confessing to shit.</v>

980
00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Like that's when people do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

981
00:43:09.061 --> 00:43:11.260
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking stabbed him.</v>

982
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Can I go to sleep now?</v>

983
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.843
<v Speaker 6>Explain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

984
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:17.470
<v Speaker 6>yesterday got stuck on the tarmac in San</v>
<v Speaker 6>Francisco.</v>

985
00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:18.940
<v Speaker 6>Was It delta?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

986
00:43:18.941 --> 00:43:21.400
<v Speaker 6>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It had nothing to do with delta.</v>

987
00:43:21.401 --> 00:43:22.234
<v Speaker 6>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a ground stoppage for the </v>

988
00:43:23.261 --> 00:43:24.094
<v Speaker 6>first time in a very long time at lax,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which means any flights that are about </v>

989
00:43:27.311 --> 00:43:28.144
<v Speaker 6>to leave from anywhere automatically </v>
<v Speaker 6>delayed until further notice because </v>

990
00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:31.774
<v Speaker 6>they were the cause of whether they were</v>
<v Speaker 6>at full ground stoppage and about the </v>

991
00:43:35.831 --> 00:43:37.870
<v Speaker 6>interrogation thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm on the tarmac.</v>

992
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:38.873
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the delay was four hours and I was </v>

993
00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:44.470
<v Speaker 6>literally fighting back tears.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was breaking as a human.</v>

994
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were crying about the rain.</v>

995
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:49.020
<v Speaker 1>You were upstairs crying about the rain </v>
<v Speaker 1>during killed Tony.</v>

996
00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:51.360
<v Speaker 1>We had a massive drought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are dying.</v>

997
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:56.480
<v Speaker 1>There's no waterfield babies die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's dying from this drought.</v>

998
00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:59.190
<v Speaker 1>You know how many people died just </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday for hurricanes.</v>

999
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Tornadoes to or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1000
00:44:02.461 --> 00:44:03.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tornadoes,</v>

1001
00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.650
<v Speaker 1>tornadoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurricanes.</v>

1002
00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:05.830
<v Speaker 1>One of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1003
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta got hurricanes.</v>

1004
00:44:08.221 --> 00:44:10.950
<v Speaker 1>They know it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get fucked up by hurricane,</v>

1005
00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.170
<v Speaker 1>either you're really poor or you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really stupid.</v>

1006
00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you get fucked up by a tornado,</v>

1007
00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:16.134
<v Speaker 1>you just got shit.</v>

1008
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.350
<v Speaker 6>They said that 18 people died in Atlanta</v>
<v Speaker 6>or whatever that was,</v>

1009
00:44:19.351 --> 00:44:23.310
<v Speaker 6>but I looked it up in like 12 of them or</v>
<v Speaker 6>10 or 16 something.</v>

1010
00:44:23.311 --> 00:44:26.310
<v Speaker 6>There was a very high number of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people were all at one trailer park.</v>

1011
00:44:26.311 --> 00:44:31.050
<v Speaker 6>That basically just got like squished.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought that was crazy.</v>

1012
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 6>It was like whatever I'm in.</v>

1013
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.933
<v Speaker 5>I am just trying to guess here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but out of the 18 people that died in </v>

1014
00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:36.204
<v Speaker 5>Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 of them is my final answer on the </v>

1015
00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.440
<v Speaker 5>guests all from the same trailer park </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was thinking like,</v>

1016
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:43.050
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck had to happen to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>trailer park?</v>

1017
00:44:43.051 --> 00:44:45.140
<v Speaker 5>I didn't really get to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have much detail.</v>

1018
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:46.440
<v Speaker 5>There's been some towns</v>

1019
00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.010
<v Speaker 4>I think I want to say Jasper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Missouri,</v>

1020
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:50.503
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's one of those towns that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally wiped off the map by </v>

1021
00:44:54.381 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 4>tornadoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tornadoes came in like a gigantic eraser</v>

1022
00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:59.563
<v Speaker 4>and you talking about like hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>yards wide and just destroyed </v>

1023
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.540
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just clean the entire top off.</v>

1024
00:45:05.541 --> 00:45:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Killed everyone that was there and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>through the building through.</v>

1025
00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.500
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Annihilated the whole town.</v>

1026
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:15.230
<v Speaker 4>There's a before and after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Photo might not be Jasper.</v>

1027
00:45:15.231 --> 00:45:16.600
<v Speaker 4>I forget what the name of this town.</v>

1028
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.280
<v Speaker 5>Oklahoma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kansas City.</v>

1029
00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.100
<v Speaker 5>It sounds about right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all in that same area.</v>

1030
00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:22.570
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely in misery though.</v>

1031
00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:23.890
<v Speaker 4>Why am I saying Jasper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Missouri?</v>

1032
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.581
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1033
00:45:24.581 --> 00:45:25.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jasper,</v>

1034
00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:28.060
<v Speaker 4>wherever the fuck it was that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

1035
00:45:28.061 --> 00:45:29.840
<v Speaker 4>Whatever this town was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1036
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:31.083
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought they would come down and just </v>

1037
00:45:32.981 --> 00:45:34.930
<v Speaker 4>fuck up a few houses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never knew.</v>

1038
00:45:34.931 --> 00:45:36.880
<v Speaker 4>They occasionally killed the whole town.</v>

1039

<v Speaker 4>doesn't,</v>

1313
00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.410
<v Speaker 4>doesn't spend his tonight show many </v>
<v Speaker 4>accolades.</v>

1314
00:57:52.411 --> 00:57:54.580
<v Speaker 4>It's all from standup doing corporate </v>
<v Speaker 4>gigs.</v>

1315
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all corporate gigs.</v>

1316
00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:02.290
<v Speaker 4>You got to think a guy like that guy on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the coast,</v>

1317
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:04.660
<v Speaker 4>the tonight show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do a corporate gig,</v>

1318
00:58:04.661 --> 00:58:08.560
<v Speaker 4>you can make a ton of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't think people understand.</v>

1319
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:11.170
<v Speaker 4>He's probably making hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of dollars a gig.</v>

1320
00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:12.910
<v Speaker 4>They're flying them out there on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>private jet.</v>

1321
00:58:12.911 --> 00:58:14.980
<v Speaker 4>He does the gig that comes back and does</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tonight show,</v>

1322
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 4>so he would leave the tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>

1323
00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:18.430
<v Speaker 4>the tonight show tapes during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>daytime.</v>

1324
00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:21.730
<v Speaker 4>He'd be done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd fly somewhere on his private jet,</v>

1325
00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:22.863
<v Speaker 4>do some ridiculous corporate gig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make hundreds of thousands of dollars </v>

1326
00:58:25.271 --> 00:58:26.021
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fly right back,</v>

1327
00:58:26.021 --> 00:58:28.240
<v Speaker 4>and then do it again and do it again and</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it again,</v>

1328
00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.430
<v Speaker 4>and he's making millions of dollars a </v>
<v Speaker 4>month doing that.</v>

1329
00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Burbank airport balling shade leno's </v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1330
00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:37.663

<v Speaker 4>he swore he was telling crazy stories </v>

1331
00:58:40.211 --> 00:58:42.130
<v Speaker 4>about when he worked with the mafia and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mafia.</v>

1332
00:58:42.131 --> 00:58:43.420

01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:58.850
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what they eat.</v>

1382
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.060
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

1383
01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.170
<v Speaker 4>Lobsters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything they want,</v>

1384
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:04.123
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

1385
01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:08.710
<v Speaker 4>I bet it's one of those things where he </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably has food shipped damn everyday,</v>

1386
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.553
<v Speaker 4>so he gets to choose what he wants and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always fresh and they just get rid </v>

1387
01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:13.400
<v Speaker 4>of what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Neat.</v>

1388
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.593
<v Speaker 4>I bet it'S one of those deals because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>bet when when you have that kind of </v>

1389
01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.073
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would probably want to have like a </v>

1390
01:01:20.211 --> 01:01:23.000
<v Speaker 4>full menu where you could pick from </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want.</v>

1391
01:01:23.001 --> 01:01:23.834
<v Speaker 4>Even if it was just You eating alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's probably one of those guys so they </v>

1392
01:01:26.901 --> 01:01:29.430
<v Speaker 4>have to fly in fish and lobster and</v>

1393
01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:33.090
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably like vegan.</v>

1394
01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:34.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just seems like you'd be vegan.</v>

1395
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.800
<v Speaker 4>Why would you think that a guy who fucks</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those girls and lives in a gold pals</v>

1396
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:41.410
<v Speaker 4>vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you think you'd be like,</v>

1397
01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.840
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the library because he can afford it.</v>

1398
01:01:43.841 --> 01:01:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Most people can't afford healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle.</v>

1399
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Healthy lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1400
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.293
<v Speaker 3>It's expensive to be vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They keep this guy pretty low key </v>

1401
01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:53.374
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1402
01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.850
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well he keeps himself low keY,</v>

1403
01:01:55.851 --> 01:01:56.684
<v Speaker 4>particularly now after that whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that girl writing that article or </v>

1404
01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:03.550
<v Speaker 4>the book or whatever the fuck she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to write after tom,</v>

1405
01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:03.840
<v Speaker 4>don,</v>

1406
01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.673
<v Speaker 3>they have a three day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you were to call it a </v>

1407
01:02:06.881 --> 01:02:08.650
<v Speaker 3>festival or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they allow,</v>

1408
01:02:08.651 --> 01:02:09.484
<v Speaker 3>it says 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>locals and visitors arrive each day to </v>

1409
01:02:11.801 --> 01:02:14.920
<v Speaker 3>banquet at the royal family's palace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1410
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Fees for the locals I suppose after </v>
<v Speaker 3>ramadan.</v>

1411
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1412
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>he's muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he probably eats things that are.</v>

1413
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

1414
01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>he probably eats a lot of meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever the fuck he wants.</v>

1415
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:29.483
<v Speaker 1>They have restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think he's allowed to eat </v>

1416
01:02:31.201 --> 01:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>pork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's probably not eating bore.</v>

1417
01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>See they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came up with all that stuff though.</v>

1418
01:02:35.641 --> 01:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Back when people are getting diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1419
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:38.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs,</v>

1420
01:02:38.341 --> 01:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>they eat whatever the fuck they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead,</v>

1421
01:02:39.571 --> 01:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>eat everything including each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they probably came up with that stuff</v>

1422
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>like those religious rules about pork in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>

1423
01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>That's almost definitely related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease and illness.</v>

1424
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:51.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense.</v>

1425
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:52.733
<v Speaker 1>Jews and muslims all have that in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their religion that you're not </v>

1426
01:02:56.971 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be eating pork.</v>

1427
01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.273
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like trump taking the ta or the us </v>

1428
01:03:02.281 --> 01:03:04.620
<v Speaker 3>government to Israel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard about that?</v>

1429
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:06.720
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1430
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when other con,</v>

1431
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:10.380
<v Speaker 3>when you have like bases in other </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>

1432
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.120
<v Speaker 3>he's going to put a base in Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would just say.</v>

1433
01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.013
<v Speaker 3>And that's something that presidents </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been scared to do for a long time </v>

1434
01:03:15.631 --> 01:03:18.960
<v Speaker 3>and he's at palestine's like pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>

1435
01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:23.961
<v Speaker 3>Jamie just said at the end of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the feast,</v>

1436
01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.413
<v Speaker 3>everyone gets a cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he also inserted a clause into the </v>

1437
01:03:28.051 --> 01:03:28.884
<v Speaker 3>constitution that proclaims quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can do no wrong and either as </v>

1438
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.110
<v Speaker 3>personal or any official capacity</v>

1439
01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:38.540
<v Speaker 1>that's in this constitution gave them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cake man.</v>

1440
01:03:38.541 --> 01:03:41.540
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can do no wrong.</v>

1441
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:46.010
<v Speaker 1>So you can do whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has a clause in their constitution</v>

1442
01:03:46.011 --> 01:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>that he could do whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>

1443
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:48.263
<v Speaker 3>Coming to our constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump's plan to move the us embassy to </v>

1444
01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.280
<v Speaker 3>jerusalem?</v>

1445

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.120
<v Speaker 4>It's just temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sobriety thing.</v>

1610
01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:14.954
<v Speaker 4>Working on sobriety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a slingshot and he pulled that </v>

1611
01:12:17.931 --> 01:12:21.620
<v Speaker 4>slingshot back and then he's eventually </v>
<v Speaker 4>got to let it go and I don't know why.</v>

1612
01:12:21.621 --> 01:12:23.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand sobriety.</v>

1613
01:12:23.721 --> 01:12:24.554
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand people that go off </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rails like he does where they get </v>

1614
01:12:27.981 --> 01:12:30.170
<v Speaker 4>that fucked up and that crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's got it.</v>

1615
01:12:30.171 --> 01:12:30.850
<v Speaker 4>Whatever that is.</v>

1616
01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:33.000
<v Speaker 5>You worked with them all the way back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck him.</v>

1617
01:12:33.001 --> 01:12:35.800
<v Speaker 5>And I worked with him for five years and</v>
<v Speaker 5>was always that way.</v>

1618
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Always that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Party machine.</v>

1619
01:12:37.161 --> 01:12:37.380
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1620
01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.630
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really honestly believe this.</v>

1621
01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:41.190
<v Speaker 4>And maybe andy would probably agree with</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

1622
01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 4>I think some shit happened to him when </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a child,</v>

1623
01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:45.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think um,</v>

1624
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:47.280
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he battles that,</v>

1625
01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.593
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think he has like a real issue </v>

1626
01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:50.550
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he,</v>

1627
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:51.990
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's talked about it before.</v>

1628
01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:54.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm not revealing anything that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>hasn't said already,</v>

1629
01:12:54.151 --> 01:12:57.480
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't remember like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his childhood or a lot of it.</v>

1630
01:12:57.510 --> 01:13:01.140
<v Speaker 4>It's blocked it out and he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>substance problem he just had,</v>

1631
01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:05.580
<v Speaker 4>he has it more than anybody I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>met in terms of like he gets it and then</v>

1632
01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:06.414
<v Speaker 4>that switch goes off and he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's off to the races and he's a sweet </v>

1633
01:13:09.481 --> 01:13:12.960
<v Speaker 4>guy and he's a fucking talented guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a really funny guy.</v>

1634
01:13:12.961 --> 01:13:15.360
<v Speaker 4>Like andy and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did scenes together.</v>

1635
01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.393
<v Speaker 4>Well we had to do three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four and five takes because I couldn't </v>

1636
01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:20.700
<v Speaker 4>stop laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was holding it in as much as I can.</v>

1637
01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:22.440
<v Speaker 4>He's a really funny guy.</v>

1638
01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:26.400
<v Speaker 5>It's shit faced to end as a negative and</v>
<v Speaker 5>annoying as he was the other night.</v>

1639
01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:31.360
<v Speaker 5>He was still sort of killing it through </v>
<v Speaker 5>this glaze of just annoyance.</v>

1640
01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

1641
01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:33.653
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like he was just the scottie </v>

1642
01:13:34.591 --> 01:13:35.424
<v Speaker 5>pippin is chappelle's Jordan because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was literally heckling chappelle while </v>

1643
01:13:38.101 --> 01:13:39.460
<v Speaker 5>he's on status.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucked up,</v>

1644
01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.500
<v Speaker 5>david again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1645
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:42.600
<v Speaker 5>they should have kicked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1646
01:13:42.601 --> 01:13:44.760
<v Speaker 5>they totally shut of you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1647
01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.170
<v Speaker 5>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he tried to fuck our friend.</v>

1648
01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.153
<v Speaker 5>The first five times I met andy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was completely shit faced and </v>

1649
01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:56.880
<v Speaker 5>obsessed with trying to fuck me and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

1650
01:13:56.890 --> 01:13:57.511
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1651
01:13:57.511 --> 01:13:58.610
<v Speaker 5>nice to meet you again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1652
01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:02.310
<v Speaker 5>and that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the last few times he was sober</v>

1653
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.340
<v Speaker 5>and fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really great guy.</v>

1654
01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:08.730
<v Speaker 5>And then I saw them for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 5>since that the other night.</v>

1655
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 5>And he's sitting in a chair right in </v>
<v Speaker 5>back bar area,</v>

1656
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.873
<v Speaker 6>like where the employees are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's the only one just sitting there in </v>

1657
01:14:14.321 --> 01:14:15.940
<v Speaker 6>a chair and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1658
01:14:15.941 --> 01:14:16.774
<v Speaker 6>I wonder what happened to annie as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>walking up all in one motion is I get </v>

1659
01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:23.200
<v Speaker 6>closer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see that at the same time he's licking</v>

1660
01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:24.213
<v Speaker 6>somebodies arm that he's with just </v>
<v Speaker 6>licking their arm up and down and I'm </v>

1661
01:14:26.891 --> 01:14:28.480
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh no,</v>

1662
01:14:28.481 --> 01:14:29.314
<v Speaker 6>he's not sober anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like his variation of sobriety and not </v>

1663
01:14:33.911 --> 01:14:34.744
<v Speaker 6>sober.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never seen him like getting drunk </v>

1664
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:38.920
<v Speaker 6>or having a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've only seen him on her.</v>

1665
01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:41.680
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>At a thousand miles an hour.</v>

1666
01:14:41.681 --> 01:14:46.681
<v Speaker 6>Shit faced and aggressively sexual </v>
<v Speaker 6>continuously or very nice dude.</v>

1667
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:48.790
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so weird.</v>

1668
01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.690
<v Speaker 6>I think he's a nice dude.</v>

1669
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:52.200
<v Speaker 4>These are nice too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he really is a good guy.</v>

1670
01:14:52.230 --> 01:14:53.063
<v Speaker 4>I think andy's a very good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just a very good guy that does not </v>

1671
01:14:55.111 --> 01:14:58.200
<v Speaker 4>get along with substances and he needs </v>
<v Speaker 4>them for whatever reason.</v>

1672
01:14:58.220 --> 01:14:58.591
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1673
01:14:58.591 --> 01:15:00.570
<v Speaker 4>he was drawn to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1674
01:15:00.571 --> 01:15:03.150
<v Speaker 4>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you do to cure someone</v>

1675
01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.620
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1676
01:15:04.621 --> 01:15:05.730
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1677
01:15:05.731 --> 01:15:08.520
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't even if I knew what to cure </v>
<v Speaker 4>one person,</v>

1678
01:15:08.521 --> 01:15:09.354
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody has their own </v>

1679
01:15:10.561 --> 01:15:11.394
<v Speaker 4>individual answer for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think for some people they just </v>

1680
01:15:15.421 --> 01:15:20.421
<v Speaker 4>don't want to ever get completely free </v>
<v Speaker 4>or they do and then they don't,</v>

1681
01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.613
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get bored or they can't take it </v>

1682
01:15:22.861 --> 01:15:24.480
<v Speaker 4>anymore or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1683
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:27.580
<v Speaker 12>but isn't it weird that when somebody </v>
<v Speaker 12>does start drinking,</v>

1684
01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:30.700
<v Speaker 12>like it's never just like a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's never like,</v>

1685
01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:31.540
<v Speaker 12>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1686
01:15:31.541 --> 01:15:33.280
<v Speaker 12>I started drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I shouldn't be drinking.</v>

1687
01:15:33.281 --> 01:15:35.920
<v Speaker 12>I have a little.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But it's just like opposite.</v>

1688
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.570
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's um,</v>

1689
01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.680
<v Speaker 4>it's a genetic thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1690
01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:40.993
<v Speaker 4>There's something about that alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They either got that thing or you don't </v>

1691
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:45.560
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if they,</v>

1692
01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.513
<v Speaker 4>like I'm sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've only had waters nine and I'm </v>

1693
01:15:48.651 --> 01:15:50.080

<v Speaker 4>Get super excited about.</v>

1729
01:17:13.611 --> 01:17:14.444
<v Speaker 4>I love caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much of all the things you can be </v>

1730
01:17:17.481 --> 01:17:20.570
<v Speaker 4>addicted to that one is the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>productive and the least destructive.</v>

1731
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.433
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't,</v>

1732
01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.413
<v Speaker 4>doesn't fuck you up to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you make shit decisions or get in car </v>

1733
01:17:25.191 --> 01:17:25.980
<v Speaker 4>accidents or anything.</v>

1734
01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:29.130
<v Speaker 3>I think I've done so much caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feeL like I feel it.</v>

1735
01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Like I like I'll have coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't as much.</v>

1736
01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:34.620
<v Speaker 3>It seems something youtube with </v>
<v Speaker 3>caffeine.</v>

1737
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:38.620
<v Speaker 4>Well that's why people who use it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>performance enhancing purposes,</v>

1738
01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:39.723
<v Speaker 4>they like to not use caffeine during the</v>
<v Speaker 4>day normally and then take caffeine </v>

1739
01:17:43.391 --> 01:17:45.820
<v Speaker 4>before they work out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like say if they have wrestling match or</v>

1740
01:17:45.821 --> 01:17:47.290
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guyS will do that.</v>

1741
01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.393
<v Speaker 4>They'll have no caffeine in their diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then right before they go and fight </v>

1742
01:17:51.461 --> 01:17:52.294
<v Speaker 4>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll take a caffeine pill and then </v>

1743
01:17:55.061 --> 01:17:58.140
<v Speaker 4>they get the full effects of it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the fact that you're not like.</v>

1744
01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:02.620
<v Speaker 4>Like how often we smoked pot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we got anybody that doesn't smoke pot</v>

1745
01:18:02.621 --> 01:18:05.380
<v Speaker 4>down here with us and we were hitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same way that we're hitting,</v>

1746
01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.480
<v Speaker 4>they would freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've seen it.</v>

1747
01:18:07.481 --> 01:18:09.910
<v Speaker 4>You've seen it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've seen it before.</v>

1748
01:18:09.911 --> 01:18:11.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean how many times we've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody high like,</v>

1749
01:18:11.710 --> 01:18:13.180
<v Speaker 4>do you get high?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'll like,</v>

1750
01:18:13.181 --> 01:18:14.930
<v Speaker 4>well I'll try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell?</v>

1751
01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:15.670
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1752
01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:19.010
<v Speaker 4>They take a big hit and they take a </v>
<v Speaker 4>second hit and like your god</v>

1753
01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.793
<v Speaker 3>for buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was dying for a second </v>

1754
01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:25.480
<v Speaker 3>after smoking kelly weed for the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1755
01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:28.530
<v Speaker 3>He started shaking and like he literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like just,</v>

1756
01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:30.580
<v Speaker 3>he looked like he was getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrocuted for.</v>

1757
01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.590
<v Speaker 4>We've done that to people so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1758
01:18:33.591 --> 01:18:37.550
<v Speaker 4>like you want end come on in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just way too strong for that.</v>

1759
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:39.500
<v Speaker 4>For us it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do it all the time.</v>

1760
01:18:39.501 --> 01:18:42.230
<v Speaker 4>So it's normal and your body builds up </v>
<v Speaker 4>this tolerance,</v>

1761
01:18:42.231 --> 01:18:44.720
<v Speaker 4>but if you don't have that tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get hit with it.</v>

1762
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:45.703
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terence mckenna used to say that's the </v>

1763
01:18:47.121 --> 01:18:47.954
<v Speaker 4>best way to smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just say the best way to do it is to </v>

1764
01:18:50.241 --> 01:18:54.440
<v Speaker 4>don't do it at all for a long time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then do as much as you can stand.</v>

1765
01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like then it becomes,</v>

1766
01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:01.610
<v Speaker 4>well very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very psychedelic and he would hit.</v>

1767
01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.910
<v Speaker 4>his thought was that we abused marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was guilty of it himself.</v>

1768
01:19:04.911 --> 01:19:06.470
<v Speaker 4>He said it's one of the things we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

1769
01:19:06.471 --> 01:19:07.330
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1770
01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:11.330
<v Speaker 4>before you listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I am a confessed cannabis addict.</v>

1771
01:19:11.331 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I small cannabis every day,</v>

1772
01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:13.970
<v Speaker 4>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I smoke it at night,</v>

1773
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:15.103
<v Speaker 4>but honestly I think the way to do it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take a long time off and then smoke </v>

1774
01:19:20.361 --> 01:19:24.470
<v Speaker 4>your fucking brains out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just take like weeks off.</v>

1775
01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:25.530
<v Speaker 4>Just get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bring you,</v>

1776
01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 4>bring your body completely back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>baseline.</v>

1777
01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.860
<v Speaker 4>And then just two days</v>

1778
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:35.880
<v Speaker 3>often it feels like if I smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's back to baseline.</v>

1779
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Like that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want two days off.</v>

1780
01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.930
<v Speaker 3>How often you guys go on stage without </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

1781
01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.900
<v Speaker 3>I tried it most of the term.</v>

1782
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:45.850
<v Speaker 4>Do you struggle talking when you go </v>
<v Speaker 4>onstage?</v>

1783
01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1784
01:19:47.091 --> 01:19:48.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1785
01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:51.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stutter or I lose my train of thought,</v>

1786
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:52.550
<v Speaker 3>like if I'm going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1787
01:19:52.551 --> 01:19:55.550
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go to the app that bit now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'll like,</v>

1788
01:19:55.551 --> 01:19:56.151
<v Speaker 3>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1789
01:19:56.151 --> 01:19:56.591
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1790
01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:59.570
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say just thinking it's memory for most</v>

1791
01:19:59.571 --> 01:20:00.650
<v Speaker 3>of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think like,</v>

1792
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:02.300
<v Speaker 3>especially with like pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd,</v>

1793
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:03.343
<v Speaker 3>I find that if I don't smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually remember everything I did </v>

1794
01:20:06.171 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 3>that night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I do smoke</v>

1795
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.580
<v Speaker 6>pete,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'd,</v>

1796
01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:09.413
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember anything I did that </v>
<v Speaker 6>night and I used to always think it was </v>

1797
01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:13.340
<v Speaker 6>alcohol based,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>

1798
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.480
<v Speaker 6>I've been trying and experimenting the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Same way.</v>

1799
01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.610
<v Speaker 6>I remember everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1800
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:19.860
<v Speaker 6>I smoke a lot of weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>weeds,</v>

1801
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:24.190
<v Speaker 6>and it just blocks my memory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Men in black kush.</v>

1802
01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:25.930
<v Speaker 6>The memory eraser.</v>

1803
01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:27.853
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it definitely has a different </v>

1804
01:20:28.351 --> 01:20:29.640
<v Speaker 4>effect on everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1805
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:32.310
<v Speaker 4>There's no doubt about that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>

1806
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.010
<v Speaker 4>you'll hear some people talk about pot </v>

<v Speaker 6>maybe like a little over a montH ago and</v>

<v Speaker 6>pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1862
01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:12.070
<v Speaker 6>once I get the bulk of work done in the </v>

1867
01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:22.503
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I woRk out a few hours later </v>

1868
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.903
<v Speaker 6>and then I do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just keep smoking throughout the </v>

1869
01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:27.893
<v Speaker 6>night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

1873
01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.393
<v Speaker 7>As long as it works.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you decide at one point that it </v>

1874
01:23:38.041 --> 01:23:39.810
<v Speaker 7>doesn't work anymore and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 7>switch it up,</v>

1875
01:23:39.811 --> 01:23:41.850
<v Speaker 7>I mean sometimes that happens too in </v>
<v Speaker 7>your life.</v>

1876
01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:43.850
<v Speaker 7>You get tired of a certain pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:44.753
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it might be a different kind of workout </v>

1878
01:23:46.531 --> 01:23:50.250
<v Speaker 7>you're doing or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but just changing things a little bit,</v>

1879
01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.190
<v Speaker 7>changing certain aspects of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just a little bit,</v>

1880
01:23:53.191 --> 01:23:55.380
<v Speaker 7>just a little bit of a turn,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a little deviation,</v>

1881
01:23:55.381 --> 01:23:57.330
<v Speaker 7>something new,</v>
<v Speaker 7>little something different.</v>

1882
01:23:57.810 --> 01:23:59.730
<v Speaker 7>It can be huge,</v>
<v Speaker 7>huge for your brain,</v>

1883
01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:02.010
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>start thinking of things different.</v>

1886
01:24:08.581 --> 01:24:10.680

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:14.250
<v Speaker 7>We were talking at kill tony,</v>
<v Speaker 7>about how people lived in their cars.</v>

<v Speaker 7>of homeless people that have storage </v>

1889
01:24:19.231 --> 01:24:20.064
<v Speaker 7>units and they used the storage unit to </v>
<v Speaker 7>bathe in and they just hang out there </v>

<v Speaker 7>all day then.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thank god there's a shadow warehouse </v>

<v Speaker 7>why?</v>

1897
01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.750
<v Speaker 7>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just hold your nose.</v>

1898
01:24:39.751 --> 01:24:40.584
<v Speaker 7>We can't go down this hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I and I look ahead and there was a </v>

1899
01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:47.390
<v Speaker 7>woman naked like washing herself and </v>
<v Speaker 7>poop rags everywhere.</v>

1900
01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:49.920
<v Speaker 7>Just rags on the ground with poop on it </v>
<v Speaker 7>everywhere.</v>

1901
01:24:50.370 --> 01:24:51.203
<v Speaker 7>And it smelled like poop.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And she said that she just lives there </v>

1902
01:24:54.961 --> 01:24:55.620
<v Speaker 7>during the day.</v>

<v Speaker 7>That's like how she shits on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They let her,</v>

1904
01:24:57.970 --> 01:25:01.440
<v Speaker 7>she can't throw her out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's nothing they can do.</v>

1905
01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:02.503
<v Speaker 7>You can't like get her for like some </v>
<v Speaker 7>sort of a health code sitting on the </v>

1906

1907
01:25:06.151 --> 01:25:06.984
<v Speaker 7>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you would think you would think it's </v>

1908
01:25:08.251 --> 01:25:13.251
<v Speaker 7>very weird and touchy and it's funny how</v>
<v Speaker 7>much people like try to protect people.</v>

1909
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.590
<v Speaker 7>Like if she had a house you could arrest</v>
<v Speaker 7>her for that.</v>

1910
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:19.050
<v Speaker 7>Like if she had a house and she just </v>
<v Speaker 7>wants to shit in public.</v>

1911
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:21.300
<v Speaker 7>I like to go to my storage unit and take</v>
<v Speaker 7>shits on the floor.</v>

1916
01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:29.960
<v Speaker 7>It.</v>

1917
01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:30.793
<v Speaker 6>It's also the location.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's this California culture where </v>

1918
01:25:32.751 --> 01:25:33.584
<v Speaker 6>that we nurture people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like if that was in Texas and some </v>

1919
01:25:35.571 --> 01:25:37.110
<v Speaker 6>storage unit owner walked by,</v>

1922
01:25:47.471 --> 01:25:49.570
<v Speaker 7>much better than your japanese mexican </v>
<v Speaker 7>accent.</v>

1923
01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:52.840
<v Speaker 7>You have a two days to pack up and get </v>
<v Speaker 7>up to the storage unit,</v>

1924
01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.620
<v Speaker 7>back up and get down to theater.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is Texas.</v>

1925
01:25:56.650 --> 01:25:59.620
<v Speaker 7>Nothing's like san francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 7>San francisco is the worst when it comes</v>

1926
01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:00.454
<v Speaker 7>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's fucking aggressive homeless </v>

1928
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.070

<v Speaker 3>a huge shit human shit right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the punchline comedy club.</v>

1930
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:09.733
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know it did because I filmed </v>

<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>francisco.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tolerant up there.</v>

1941
01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:42.993

<v Speaker 6>By the second show I was asking like how</v>
<v Speaker 6>many you went to the march earlier and </v>

1950
01:27:04.221 --> 01:27:06.020
<v Speaker 6>it was just like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1951
01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.510
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Raised.</v>

1952
01:27:07.511 --> 01:27:09.290
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever even heard,</v>

1953
01:27:09.650 --> 01:27:14.650
<v Speaker 1>have an elected leader that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>protested this hard right after they got</v>

1954
01:27:14.961 --> 01:27:16.890
<v Speaker 1>an office before they've done anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1955
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:21.370
<v Speaker 6>the funny thing is there was a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 6>women out there obviously that voted for</v>

1956
01:27:21.371 --> 01:27:24.360
<v Speaker 6>trump or didn't vote at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what the,</v>

1957
01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:25.203
<v Speaker 6>a lot of the numbers would say because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they said that most women voted for </v>

1958
01:27:28.781 --> 01:27:29.614
<v Speaker 6>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1959
01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:31.120
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that a style?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1960
01:27:31.130 --> 01:27:31.963
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most of the women that voted voted for </v>

1961
01:27:33.431 --> 01:27:34.270
<v Speaker 6>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>correct?</v>

1962
01:27:34.271 --> 01:27:35.090
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1963
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:35.830
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought I heard.</v>

1964
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:36.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1965
01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:39.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more women voted For trump than voted</v>

1966
01:27:39.461 --> 01:27:40.294
<v Speaker 1>for hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not most of the women voted for </v>

1967
01:27:41.891 --> 01:27:42.724
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if like there's a hundred and three </v>

1968
01:27:45.251 --> 01:27:48.430
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>53 of them voted for trump,</v>

1969
01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:50.680
<v Speaker 1>50 of them voted for hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really fat kind of a deal.</v>

1970
01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:55.000
<v Speaker 1>but when you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers that they had,</v>

1971
01:27:55.001 --> 01:27:59.260
<v Speaker 1>like an la whitney coming sent me this </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture and uh,</v>

1972
01:27:59.261 --> 01:28:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what in the fuck,</v>

1973
01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:01.810
<v Speaker 1>where is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1974
01:28:01.811 --> 01:28:03.460
<v Speaker 1>that's in downtown la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1975
01:28:03.461 --> 01:28:05.320
<v Speaker 1>that is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1976
01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:06.640
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1977
01:28:06.641 --> 01:28:07.780
<v Speaker 1>how many people are there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1978
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:12.600
<v Speaker 1>they expected 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they got 900,000</v>

1979
01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:16.330
<v Speaker 1>is the biggest one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even bigger than dc.</v>

1980
01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:17.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said they,</v>

1981
01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:19.420
<v Speaker 1>they don't even really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really know how many,</v>

1982
01:28:19.421 --> 01:28:23.350
<v Speaker 1>but she says they think somewhere around</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 970,000</v>

1983
01:28:23.351 --> 01:28:26.920
<v Speaker 1>people close to a million credible.</v>

1984
01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:28.543
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was interesting how many older </v>

1985
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:35.210
<v Speaker 3>ladies and older women didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I flew back and the woman next to me was</v>

1986
01:28:35.211 --> 01:28:38.780
<v Speaker 3>an old lady that sprayed her hair blue </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's like,</v>

1987
01:28:38.781 --> 01:28:40.320
<v Speaker 3>well you got up to protest.</v>

1988
01:28:42.330 --> 01:28:44.350
<v Speaker 6>I think this all came from the grab the </v>
<v Speaker 6>pussy stuff.</v>

1989
01:28:44.351 --> 01:28:46.060
<v Speaker 6>Like if he didn't have the grab them by </v>
<v Speaker 6>the pussy stuff.</v>

1990
01:28:46.061 --> 01:28:47.170
<v Speaker 6>This wouldn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1991
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:48.583
<v Speaker 6>It's because of one clip that they dug </v>
<v Speaker 6>up from the early nineties in between a </v>

1992
01:28:51.431 --> 01:28:52.264

<v Speaker 6>before that before</v>

1994

<v Speaker 12>I voted for weed,</v>

2009
01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:41.180
<v Speaker 12>but I didn't vote for trump or didn't </v>
<v Speaker 12>vote for president.</v>

2010
01:29:41.181 --> 01:29:43.730
<v Speaker 12>you got to that and you just left it out</v>
<v Speaker 12>now because I didn't like either.</v>

2011
01:29:43.731 --> 01:29:45.480
<v Speaker 12>I wouldn't have had a,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2012
01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.730
<v Speaker 12>old man mickey.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Hmm.</v>

2013
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:52.280
<v Speaker 12>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Did you vote for Gary Johnson?</v>

2014
01:29:52.281 --> 01:29:53.750
<v Speaker 12>Did my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I voted for him.</v>

2015
01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.320
<v Speaker 12>He seems like a throwaway.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'd really rather not vote and that</v>

2016
01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 4>brian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's never a throwaway.</v>

2017
01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:04.380
<v Speaker 4>If everybody voted for Gary Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would won.</v>

2018
01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:05.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that wasn't gonna happen.</v>

2019
01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Well why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's never a throwaway.</v>

2020
01:30:08.190 --> 01:30:11.910
<v Speaker 4>It's like you have to vote your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise voting is pointless regardless</v>

2021
01:30:11.911 --> 01:30:13.350
<v Speaker 4>of whether or not you think you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>throwing your vote away.</v>

2022
01:30:13.351 --> 01:30:14.184
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many people that were saying </v>

2023
01:30:14.461 --> 01:30:17.190
<v Speaker 4>that the reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2024
01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:18.083
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my state was going to go to hillary </v>

2025
01:30:18.931 --> 01:30:20.580
<v Speaker 4>clinton already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I already knew that,</v>

2026
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.473
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people predicted that if I stepped </v>

2027
01:30:23.041 --> 01:30:23.874
<v Speaker 4>in as a complete objective observer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had never had anything to do with the </v>

2028
01:30:26.341 --> 01:30:27.174
<v Speaker 4>system up until that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I walked in and they were </v>

2029
01:30:29.281 --> 01:30:30.114
<v Speaker 4>telling me the projected victory was </v>
<v Speaker 4>already to hillary clinton before it </v>

2030
01:30:33.031 --> 01:30:33.864
<v Speaker 4>even started right in this state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were right and they were right </v>

2031
01:30:36.331 --> 01:30:37.164
<v Speaker 4>in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2032
01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:40.350
<v Speaker 4>So if I vote for Gary Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped throwing shit away,</v>

2033
01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.470
<v Speaker 4>it's just voting my conscience and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not even really my conscience honestly,</v>

2034
01:30:43.650 --> 01:30:46.950
<v Speaker 4>because maybe gary's not the right guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the job either.</v>

2035
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:49.140
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't know what aleppo waS,</v>

2036
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:50.820
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2037
01:30:50.821 --> 01:30:55.821
<v Speaker 4>but bernie sanders isn't enough anymore </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not a big fan of hillary and uh,</v>

2038
01:30:56.601 --> 01:30:57.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>

2039
01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big fan of trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big fan of any.</v>

2040
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:02.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big fan of being president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

2041
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

2042
01:31:04.291 --> 01:31:05.124
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's an article that I </v>

2043
01:31:06.031 --> 01:31:06.864
<v Speaker 4>tweeted recently that someone tweeted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and I retweeted it about having a </v>

2044
01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.090
<v Speaker 4>council of wise people like seven or </v>
<v Speaker 4>eight people</v>

2045
01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:17.380
<v Speaker 5>like star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was that jim,</v>

2046
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:21.460
<v Speaker 12>this article on fortune.com</v>
<v Speaker 12>says that a 42 percent of women,</v>

2047
01:31:21.461 --> 01:31:25.510
<v Speaker 12>most of them white came out to support.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It came out to support trump.</v>

2048
01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:27.850
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But we weren't talking about that.</v>

2049
01:31:27.851 --> 01:31:28.684
<v Speaker 12>We.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We're talking about the marches against </v>

2050
01:31:29.291 --> 01:31:29.861
<v Speaker 12>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I know,</v>

2051
01:31:29.861 --> 01:31:33.550
<v Speaker 12>but I mean that's done.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Tony's point is that 42 percent of women</v>

2052
01:31:33.551 --> 01:31:35.700
<v Speaker 12>voted for him so that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that.</v>

2053
01:31:35.770 --> 01:31:36.603
<v Speaker 12>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 12>How many women then were there that </v>

2054
01:31:38.141 --> 01:31:40.000
<v Speaker 12>voted for trump?</v>
<v Speaker 12>ProBably none</v>

2055
01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.140
<v Speaker 4>because there's 20 million people in los</v>
<v Speaker 4>anGeles.</v>

2056
01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:45.590
<v Speaker 4>You have 20 million people in los </v>
<v Speaker 4>angeles and you got less than a million.</v>

2057
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:47.930
<v Speaker 4>It's highly likely that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that less than a million.</v>

2058
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.823
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of secret trump supporters</v>
<v Speaker 5>should are disguising themselves as </v>

2059
01:31:53.161 --> 01:31:57.440
<v Speaker 5>these people telling you they're out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there because they have to these.</v>

2060
01:31:58.530 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 12>It's a game to</v>

2061
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 1>some of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can feel it.</v>

2062
01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:02.993
<v Speaker 1>What you think the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around in that rally actually </v>

2063
01:32:05.501 --> 01:32:07.330
<v Speaker 1>voted for trump and they're holding up </v>
<v Speaker 1>signs.</v>

2064
01:32:07.331 --> 01:32:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Fuck trump.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2066
01:32:11.291 --> 01:32:13.210

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2067
01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.370
<v Speaker 6>I think that their secret trump </v>
<v Speaker 6>supporters.</v>

2068
01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:16.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>aBsolutely.</v>

2069
01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:19.810
<v Speaker 6>Marching with signs the whole deal for </v>
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>

2070
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.210
<v Speaker 6>what they have to do for whatever their </v>
<v Speaker 6>jobs are or whoever their bosses.</v>

2071
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.000
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

2072
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.370
<v Speaker 6>Marchelle join yet the march.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2073
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:28.121
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

2074
01:32:28.121 --> 01:32:28.954
<v Speaker 6>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As long as you talk to tom about that </v>

2075
01:32:31.181 --> 01:32:32.110
<v Speaker 6>raise or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2076
01:32:32.111 --> 01:32:37.111
<v Speaker 6>whatever the people do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's crazy at that march.</v>

2077
01:32:40.331 --> 01:32:42.370
<v Speaker 6>There's like five year old girls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2078
01:32:42.371 --> 01:32:43.204
<v Speaker 6>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean these parents are mad about what </v>

2079
01:32:45.071 --> 01:32:45.904
<v Speaker 6>the possibility of what of their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hearing something that trump said and </v>

2080
01:32:49.121 --> 01:32:51.660
<v Speaker 6>there's like five year old girls walking</v>
<v Speaker 6>down the street going down,</v>

2081
01:32:51.670 --> 01:32:53.270
<v Speaker 6>catch my pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't touch me.</v>

2082
01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Really true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really see five-year-old st?</v>

2083
01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.313
<v Speaker 1>Don't judge my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The march was saying don't touch my </v>

2084
01:33:02.171 --> 01:33:03.004
<v Speaker 1>pussy and there's little kids that yOu </v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying that five-year-olds are </v>

2085
01:33:04.511 --> 01:33:08.110
<v Speaker 1>saying that probably not fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's,</v>

2086
01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:08.953
<v Speaker 1>here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you Think that having these gigantic </v>

2087
01:33:11.171 --> 01:33:13.150
<v Speaker 1>marches all over the country like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

2088
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:16.990
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that's probably a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because a guy like trump,</v>

2089
01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:20.170
<v Speaker 1>the last thing he wants is all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people hating him.</v>

2090
01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:23.680
<v Speaker 1>The last thing he wants is to realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's never been a president ever</v>

2091
01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:28.860
<v Speaker 1>in the history of this country that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten protested so widely and so hugely</v>

2092
01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:33.130
<v Speaker 1>right after getting into office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2093
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:37.780
<v Speaker 1>That's got to freak him out and that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to affect the way you make decisions.</v>

2094
01:33:37.781 --> 01:33:40.780
<v Speaker 1>IT has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that these people like,</v>

2095
01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:41.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2096
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just got in,</v>

2097
01:33:43.181 --> 01:33:44.014
<v Speaker 1>you haven't done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you did was when the election again </v>

2098
01:33:45.551 --> 01:33:47.330
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost seems interesting to you</v>

2099
01:33:47.370 --> 01:33:50.550
<v Speaker 6>because what if that ends up turning him</v>
<v Speaker 6>into,</v>

2100
01:33:50.551 --> 01:33:51.990
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what if the.</v>

2101
01:33:51.991 --> 01:33:55.860
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's a chance with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just turns on these people and starts</v>

2102
01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:57.600
<v Speaker 6>fulfilling the propheCy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2103
01:33:58.730 --> 01:34:00.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2104
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.950
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2105
01:34:00.951 --> 01:34:03.740
<v Speaker 1>the republicans that support him that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are on the fence,</v>

2106
01:34:03.741 --> 01:34:07.640
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't support him anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a populist and a lot of ways since.</v>

2107
01:34:07.670 --> 01:34:09.290
<v Speaker 1>One of the more interesting things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2108
01:34:09.291 --> 01:34:12.050
<v Speaker 1>like he's willing to change his mind on </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2109
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:17.410
<v Speaker 1>If the people are really vehemently </v>
<v Speaker 1>against his decisions,</v>

2110
01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:19.593
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows who the fuck knows what's </v>

2111
01:34:23.151 --> 01:34:25.420
<v Speaker 1>going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that I'm reading,</v>

2112
01:34:25.421 --> 01:34:26.254
<v Speaker 1>it's really fascinating is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to keep him away from television </v>

2113
01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.050
<v Speaker 1>and criticism because he freaks out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they don't want him to overreact.</v>

2114
01:34:33.051 --> 01:34:36.740
<v Speaker 1>TheY don't want him to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism of him because he keeps making</v>

2115
01:34:36.741 --> 01:34:38.620
<v Speaker 1>these fucking crazy tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's this?</v>

2116
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:39.663
<v Speaker 6>His press secretary or somebody that </v>
<v Speaker 6>just put out a thing the other day that </v>

2117
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:46.180
<v Speaker 6>was talking about the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many people were at the at the thing</v>

2118
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:48.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's like a publicist though.</v>

2119
01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:51.100
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he's not even a press secretary.</v>

2120
01:34:51.101 --> 01:34:54.910
<v Speaker 6>This guy's a publicist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have a publicist because of how bad</v>

2121
01:34:56.050 --> 01:34:57.740
<v Speaker 6>trump is going to get into</v>

2122
01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:59.340
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get into like,</v>

2123
01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:02.840
<v Speaker 1>that guy is going to be saving his ass a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot in the future.</v>

2124
01:35:02.841 --> 01:35:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I feel my friend Jason Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy who owns this company.</v>

2125
01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:08.530
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

2126
01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:13.560
<v Speaker 1>You got 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cotton mouth is that it is one of the.</v>

2127
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the best.</v>

2128
01:35:16.731 --> 01:35:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes some of the best,</v>

2129
01:35:18.231 --> 01:35:20.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting gear in the world and he has his</v>

2130
01:35:20.121 --> 01:35:20.954
<v Speaker 1>picture on his instagram and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>disputing what the press is saying when </v>

2131
01:35:24.571 --> 01:35:26.360
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about how little the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd was.</v>

2132
01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:27.373
<v Speaker 1>Look how big the crowd is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an actual photo that he took </v>

2133
01:35:29.961 --> 01:35:32.420
<v Speaker 1>with his actual phone and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that the,</v>

2134
01:35:32.421 --> 01:35:33.254
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd didn't go out to the press </v>

2135
01:35:33.981 --> 01:35:35.510
<v Speaker 1>tent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll fucking it clearly.</v>

2136
01:35:35.511 --> 01:35:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Does she?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge crowd.</v>

2137
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:40.920
<v Speaker 1>It could also just be now.</v>

2138
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.620
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could also just be the photo.</v>

2139
01:35:42.621 --> 01:35:44.720
<v Speaker 1>There could be like a brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that photo.</v>

2140
01:35:44.721 --> 01:35:45.554
<v Speaker 1>That photo shows a gigantic crowd of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that goes all the way back past </v>

2141
01:35:49.041 --> 01:35:50.820
<v Speaker 1>where they said the crowd didn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2142
01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:52.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that there might be a big gap</v>

2143
01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.150
<v Speaker 1>in just how the photo is that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that there's a gap in the middle,</v>

2144
01:35:56.151 --> 01:35:56.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like this.</v>

2145
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:58.170
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2146
01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but look what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look at what you're looking at.</v>

2147
01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not in that photo and that photo you are</v>

2148
01:36:03.681 --> 01:36:04.514
<v Speaker 1>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all those people all the way </v>

2149
01:36:05.781 --> 01:36:06.614
<v Speaker 1>back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go all the way past the barricades </v>

2150
01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.070
<v Speaker 1>looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People There are like,</v>

2151
01:36:10.071 --> 01:36:12.260
<v Speaker 1>that's not the pictures they showed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

2152
01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>

2153
01:36:13.201 --> 01:36:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And you can see these folks show Jason </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrisonj a s o n a,</v>

2154
01:36:18.170 --> 01:36:19.003
<v Speaker 1>m h a I r s t o n.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a photo that he took himself </v>

2155
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:27.103
<v Speaker 1>and that's where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like someone who was actually there </v>

2156
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:32.650
<v Speaker 1>who went to the inauguration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could take a picture of this.</v>

2157
01:36:33.010 --> 01:36:33.843
<v Speaker 1>This is photoj</v>

2158
01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:36.400
<v Speaker 12>pbs put up.</v>
<v Speaker 12>This is a time lapse from the top of the</v>

2159
01:36:36.401 --> 01:36:38.800
<v Speaker 12>Washington monument from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 12>From day,</v>

2160
01:36:38.801 --> 01:36:41.170
<v Speaker 12>like the time of day started like </v>
<v Speaker 12>sunrise.</v>

2161
01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:43.060
<v Speaker 12>So everyone started leaving it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Oh,</v>

2162
01:36:43.061 --> 01:36:44.410
<v Speaker 12>so they have all of it?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

2163
01:36:44.411 --> 01:36:46.780
<v Speaker 12>they have sky view of it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Okay,</v>

2164
01:36:46.781 --> 01:36:50.560
<v Speaker 12>so his photo,</v>
<v Speaker 12>does it represent what this is saying?</v>

2165
01:36:50.561 --> 01:36:53.560
<v Speaker 12>There's gaps though.</v>
<v Speaker 12>See there's gaps in between.</v>

2166
01:36:53.561 --> 01:36:55.570
<v Speaker 12>The crowds was not filled in from that </v>
<v Speaker 12>angle.</v>

2167
01:36:55.571 --> 01:36:57.460
<v Speaker 12>It.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It represents a big crowd,</v>

2168
01:36:57.461 --> 01:37:00.110
<v Speaker 12>but when you look at it from the top,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you can see like the gaps in the.</v>

2169
01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.233
<v Speaker 12>But either way,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there's a lot of people there but it </v>

2170
01:37:02.411 --> 01:37:04.840
<v Speaker 12>wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't know if it was a million.</v>

2171
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either way it's a giant crowd,</v>

2172
01:37:07.531 --> 01:37:10.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's nowhere near as many that went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see obama,</v>

2173
01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:13.440
<v Speaker 1>that that's been proven by the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that take public transportation.</v>

2174
01:37:13.441 --> 01:37:14.274
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thIs is still not filled in yet and </v>

2175
01:37:15.541 --> 01:37:18.650
<v Speaker 1>it's still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I.</v>

2176
01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:20.730
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're standing,</v>

2177
01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.100
<v Speaker 1>if there's a bunch of people missing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle,</v>

2178
01:37:23.130 --> 01:37:23.963
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be in the tail </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the people behind it's going to </v>

2179
01:37:25.411 --> 01:37:28.350
<v Speaker 1>fill in the gaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does look pretty goddamn packed.</v>

2180
01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's what you're saying.</v>

2181
01:37:30.631 --> 01:37:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Then because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really in your head,</v>

2182
01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:35.813
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to imagine what obama's </v>
<v Speaker 1>must've looked like because that does </v>

2183
01:37:38.581 --> 01:37:39.414
<v Speaker 1>look insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't where we were when obama </v>

2184
01:37:41.851 --> 01:37:42.684
<v Speaker 1>was inaugurated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't there taking pictures in the </v>

2185
01:37:44.581 --> 01:37:45.414
<v Speaker 1>same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we would get a chance to really </v>

2186
01:37:47.251 --> 01:37:49.620
<v Speaker 1>check to really check it and understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2187
01:37:49.890 --> 01:37:50.723
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that I would buy more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because of what you said about </v>

2188
01:37:55.441 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

2189
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.963
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.940
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's still a fuck load of </v>
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>

2191
01:37:59.941 --> 01:38:00.774
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were making it seem like there </v>

2192
01:38:01.591 --> 01:38:04.500
<v Speaker 7>wasn't that many people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a lot of god damn people.</v>

2193
01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:06.083
<v Speaker 7>It's just not as many as obama.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would like to compare that to when </v>

2194
01:38:08.161 --> 01:38:09.900
<v Speaker 7>bush was inaugurated,</v>
<v Speaker 7>bush had more.</v>

2195
01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:11.270
<v Speaker 7>Bush had more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2196
01:38:13.670 --> 01:38:15.950
<v Speaker 7>it was raining and the trump </v>
<v Speaker 7>inauguration.</v>

2197
01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:16.873
<v Speaker 7>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And how many of those people were hair </v>

2198
01:38:18.630 --> 01:38:21.150
<v Speaker 7>spray in respect to Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Trump.</v>

2199
01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.630
<v Speaker 7>I saw point someone made to that at the </v>
<v Speaker 7>time in 2009.</v>

2200
01:38:24.631 --> 01:38:26.970
<v Speaker 7>I guess when obama,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when the inauguration happened,</v>

2201
01:38:26.971 --> 01:38:29.790
<v Speaker 7>there are a lot more people out of work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh shit.</v>

2202
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:32.470
<v Speaker 7>and that now there's people that have </v>
<v Speaker 7>jobs and they had less.</v>

2203
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 7>There's a white house,</v>
<v Speaker 7>propaganda welfare baby statement.</v>

2204
01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:38.353
<v Speaker 7>help sincerely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Obama tried to find out how many people </v>

2205
01:38:42.001 --> 01:38:42.834
<v Speaker 7>were there when bush was inaugurated and</v>
<v Speaker 7>how many people were there when clinton </v>

2206
01:38:46.441 --> 01:38:48.330
<v Speaker 7>was inaugurated and there's a good </v>
<v Speaker 7>thousand bushel.</v>

2207
01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:49.860
<v Speaker 7>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Two thousand one.</v>

2208
01:38:49.861 --> 01:38:50.521
<v Speaker 7>The first.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First one,</v>

2209
01:38:50.521 --> 01:38:52.280
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2210
01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:55.350
<v Speaker 7>it was 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was a good photoshop out there.</v>

2211
01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:57.740
<v Speaker 7>It shows overall shows,</v>
<v Speaker 7>reptiles.</v>

2212
01:38:57.741 --> 01:38:59.880
<v Speaker 7>It shows you their illness shape of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>skull.</v>

2213
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:00.773
<v Speaker 7>Alex jones,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did you hear he was at down there and </v>

2214
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.103
<v Speaker 7>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some trump supporter or something like </v>

2215
01:39:05.851 --> 01:39:08.570
<v Speaker 7>that and gotten a huge fight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then with alex?</v>

2216
01:39:08.630 --> 01:39:09.180
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

2217
01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:10.013
<v Speaker 7>Alex jones.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was right next to it and had to call </v>

2218
01:39:11.131 --> 01:39:12.920
<v Speaker 7>the police.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2219
01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:15.690
<v Speaker 7>I saw someone was saying that Alex Jones</v>
<v Speaker 7>had liquor on his breath.</v>

2220
01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:21.350
<v Speaker 7>He says he doesn't drink $200.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Three hundred thousand or so for 2000.</v>

2221
01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:22.990
<v Speaker 7>One for bush,</v>
<v Speaker 7>400,000</v>

2222
01:39:22.991 --> 01:39:23.824
<v Speaker 7>in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then one point $8 million for Iraq </v>

2223
01:39:26.491 --> 01:39:29.370
<v Speaker 7>in 2009 and 1 million in 2013.</v>

2224
01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.560
<v Speaker 7>In comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 7>bill clinton also had 800,093</v>

2225
01:39:35.561 --> 01:39:40.270
<v Speaker 7>and 250,097.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Damn two and only 250,097.</v>

2226
01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:43.030
<v Speaker 7>I mean the rain is going to deeply </v>
<v Speaker 7>affect that though,</v>

2227
01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:44.990
<v Speaker 7>because it's all local people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2228
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:46.640
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who does that?</v>

2229
01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:49.150
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jason harrison fluent for that.</v>

2230
01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:53.620
<v Speaker 7>Margaret murphy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she flew in for that shifts the march.</v>

2231
01:39:54.130 --> 01:39:56.450
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but she flew in,</v>

2232
01:39:59.930 --> 01:40:00.701
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of those.</v>

2233
01:40:00.701 --> 01:40:02.290
<v Speaker 7>That's another thing that goes against </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

2234
01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.900
<v Speaker 7>A lot of those women that were marching,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're marching in the rain.</v>

2235
01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:06.160
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the one that.</v>

2236
01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:06.993
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's why jeremiah watkins and his </v>

2237
01:40:08.381 --> 01:40:09.640
<v Speaker 7>character.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Daisy watkins.</v>

2238
01:40:09.641 --> 01:40:11.190
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like daisy.</v>

2239
01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:13.320
<v Speaker 7>I like his character.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2240
01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:14.163
<v Speaker 7>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They all had raincoats on during the </v>

2241
01:40:16.241 --> 01:40:19.090
<v Speaker 7>roast battle tonight or during the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd rather kill tony tonight.</v>

2242
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:22.270
<v Speaker 7>Represent those hillary supporters that </v>
<v Speaker 7>went out in the rain.</v>

2243
01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:26.500
<v Speaker 7>Is it a big deal because of this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The question of the size or the question</v>

2244
01:40:26.501 --> 01:40:29.490
<v Speaker 7>over the lining of the size.</v>
<v Speaker 7>lying of the size of size,</v>

2245
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:31.090
<v Speaker 7>but he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He wants to say,</v>

2246
01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:35.320
<v Speaker 7>this guy wants to say this is the </v>
<v Speaker 7>largest crowd of any inauguration ever.</v>

2247
01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:37.120
<v Speaker 7>Clearly that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>RIght?</v>

2248
01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.460
<v Speaker 7>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's clearly not true.</v>

2249
01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:44.230
<v Speaker 7>If it seems like a big ass crowd to me </v>
<v Speaker 7>looking at that photo,</v>

2250
01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:47.170
<v Speaker 7>but I've never looked at a photo of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>inauguration before,</v>

2251
01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:50.560
<v Speaker 7>so if you compare it to obama,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's clearly still a big ass crop,</v>

2252
01:40:50.770 --> 01:40:53.590
<v Speaker 7>but it's definitely not the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 7>ever,</v>

2253
01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:54.310
<v Speaker 7>so</v>

2254
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 4>that's not good when the fucking white </v>
<v Speaker 4>house minister of propaganda sounds like</v>

2255
01:40:58.481 --> 01:40:59.314
<v Speaker 4>that guy from baghdad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember at the beginning of the war </v>

2256
01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:04.570
<v Speaker 4>there was some guy that was doing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>baghdad population thing.</v>

2257
01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:06.550
<v Speaker 4>Remember that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck was that guy?</v>

2259
01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:13.980
<v Speaker 7>They're letting people downstairs just </v>
<v Speaker 7>walk downstairs so they should keep that</v>

2260
01:41:13.981 --> 01:41:15.900
<v Speaker 7>door shut.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's such a bad.</v>

2261
01:41:16.530 --> 01:41:17.363
<v Speaker 7>Who was that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Remember that guy joe baghdad or </v>

2262
01:41:19.411 --> 01:41:21.010
<v Speaker 7>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Remember that.</v>

2263
01:41:21.011 --> 01:41:22.110
<v Speaker 7>It was like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a meme.</v>

2264
01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:24.300
<v Speaker 7>It was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was like when?</v>

2265
01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:26.550
<v Speaker 7>When the war started,</v>
<v Speaker 7>get the fuck outta here.</v>

2289
01:42:36.281 --> 01:42:37.570
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is baghdad.</v>

2290
01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.270
<v Speaker 4>Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2291
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:41.090
<v Speaker 5>Did you watch a that saddam series on </v>
<v Speaker 5>hbo?</v>

2292
01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:42.793
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm sayinG is this baghdad bob </v>

2293
01:42:44.151 --> 01:42:44.984
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is essentially what the trump guys </v>

2294
01:42:47.121 --> 01:42:49.820
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's saying shit that everybody knows is</v>

2295
01:42:49.821 --> 01:42:50.654
<v Speaker 4>not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's exaggerating in a way that </v>

2296
01:42:52.371 --> 01:42:53.204
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows is not true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is just the beginning of the </v>

2297
01:42:55.011 --> 01:42:55.844
<v Speaker 4>administration.</v>

2298
01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.140
<v Speaker 7>His quote is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my information was correct,</v>

2299
01:42:58.141 --> 01:43:01.870
<v Speaker 7>but my interpretations were not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Remember that.</v>

2300
01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:06.170
<v Speaker 7>Who was saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The fact that bob guys quote is,</v>

2301
01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:09.510
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but this way house guys should be fired.</v>

2302
01:43:09.630 --> 01:43:12.630
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That should be like a blatant firing,</v>

2303
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:13.583
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That start off a relationship with the </v>

2304
01:43:15.421 --> 01:43:17.010
<v Speaker 7>american people with a big,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fat,</v>

2305
01:43:17.011 --> 01:43:18.630
<v Speaker 7>juicy lie like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fired.</v>

2306
01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:21.610
<v Speaker 7>What about his speeches to he?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Didn't he say he was?</v>

2307
01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:22.493
<v Speaker 7>There was a picture of him handwriting </v>
<v Speaker 7>his speeches and then he's blatantly </v>

2308
01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:28.830
<v Speaker 7>ripped off the bain speech and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>avatar speech too.</v>

2309
01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:33.300
<v Speaker 5>Speech close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see it?</v>

2310
01:43:34.570 --> 01:43:39.570
<v Speaker 5>The same thing to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not a typical political speak.</v>

2311
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:45.070
<v Speaker 5>Everybody that's a typical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're right back to you,</v>

2312
01:43:46.771 --> 01:43:49.520
<v Speaker 5>to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People turn it into the bain thing.</v>

2313
01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:52.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope everybody's about it being</v>

2314
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:54.180
<v Speaker 6>stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you know,</v>

2315
01:43:54.510 --> 01:43:57.540
<v Speaker 1>not plagiarize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same thing.</v>

2316
01:43:57.630 --> 01:43:59.460
<v Speaker 1>The problem with it being the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2317
01:43:59.461 --> 01:44:02.520
<v Speaker 1>is this what bain said before he fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to destroy the city,</v>

2318
01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't say that shared when </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows.</v>

2319
01:44:05.071 --> 01:44:06.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what bain said.</v>

2320
01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:08.133
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

2321
01:44:08.150 --> 01:44:10.970
<v Speaker 6>There's supposed to be a guy much </v>
<v Speaker 6>checkin for bain speak.</v>

2322
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:12.383
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but imagine if you were going to say </v>

2323
01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:14.230
<v Speaker 1>something</v>

2324
01:44:14.230 --> 01:44:16.810
<v Speaker 6>cool to have a president that said </v>
<v Speaker 6>something had been said</v>

2325
01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:19.710
<v Speaker 1>that you're ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give it back to you.</v>

2326
01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.440
<v Speaker 1>You're just that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it is like a whole.</v>

2327
01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.980
<v Speaker 1>It was like a whole two or three </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences,</v>

2328
01:44:25.981 --> 01:44:29.910
<v Speaker 1>not just that phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no way that guy has enough time</v>

2329
01:44:29.911 --> 01:44:33.080
<v Speaker 1>to write his fucking speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2330
01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:38.070
<v Speaker 1>He took a picture and of course my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

2331
01:44:38.071 --> 01:44:41.520
<v Speaker 1>You should add a quill shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got down feather and an ink bottle.</v>

2332
01:44:42.670 --> 01:44:46.780
<v Speaker 6>Clearly trump likes to write his </v>
<v Speaker 6>speeches while watching batman.</v>

2333
01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.113
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he was just writing notes on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches with a pen and so it wasn't a </v>

2334
01:44:51.661 --> 01:44:52.530
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of,</v>

2335
01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.340
<v Speaker 1>kinda</v>

2336
01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:56.340
<v Speaker 6>cut through his next speech.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dear white house press.</v>

2337
01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:57.720
<v Speaker 6>Why so serious?</v>

2338
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a problem.</v>

2339
01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:03.160
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>president trump.</v>

2340
01:45:03.161 --> 01:45:06.970
<v Speaker 6>Were you watching that man with heath </v>
<v Speaker 6>ledger last night?</v>

2341
01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:08.560
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2342
01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:09.900
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be real weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2343
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:12.900
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's how it keeps up,</v>

2344
01:45:13.770 --> 01:45:15.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe there'll be an adjustment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

2345
01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:16.483
<v Speaker 6>Can you imagine how cool it would be if </v>
<v Speaker 6>it was revealed that he did have a </v>

2346
01:45:18.591 --> 01:45:20.090
<v Speaker 6>breathing problem all of a sudden</v>

2347
01:45:20.190 --> 01:45:23.650
<v Speaker 15>and had to wear some fucking mask.</v>
<v Speaker 15>How awesome.</v>

2348
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:29.390
<v Speaker 1>The avatar part is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>

2349
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:31.250
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't set in avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2350
01:45:31.251 --> 01:45:32.084
<v Speaker 1>we already discussed who snopes is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's running the guy that married a </v>

2351
01:45:35.130 --> 01:45:37.160
<v Speaker 1>cowgirl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

2352
01:45:37.161 --> 01:45:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I still think it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>

2353
01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:42.380
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good snow girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2354
01:45:42.381 --> 01:45:43.214
<v Speaker 1>But you have to listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one guy behind this thing </v>

2355
01:45:46.670 --> 01:45:47.503
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well guy and his wife and they got </v>

2356
01:45:49.281 --> 01:45:53.120
<v Speaker 1>divorced and now he's a guy and a former</v>
<v Speaker 1>escort and they,</v>

2357
01:45:53.121 --> 01:45:53.954
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still run it and they have a very </v>

2358
01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.740
<v Speaker 1>clear left wing bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very.</v>

2359
01:45:58.270 --> 01:46:03.270
<v Speaker 1>They've been a part of like anti bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>rallies in the past and so I get it.</v>

2360
01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:06.290
<v Speaker 1>It's good to have something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not totally dismissing it,</v>

2361
01:46:06.291 --> 01:46:07.124
<v Speaker 1>but these are just people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't like objective academics who </v>

2362
01:46:09.771 --> 01:46:12.830
<v Speaker 1>have combed the land and looked for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct answer all the time.</v>

2363
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:16.550
<v Speaker 1>There's stuff is widely criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't always agree with the criticism,</v>

2364
01:46:16.551 --> 01:46:17.384
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like they're the end all be</v>
<v Speaker 1>all when it comes to truth is what's </v>

2365
01:46:20.631 --> 01:46:21.730
<v Speaker 1>real on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2366
01:46:21.731 --> 01:46:22.564
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely a really good for </v>

2367
01:46:23.541 --> 01:46:24.374
<v Speaker 1>like say like a hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say these tacos are making it out </v>

2368
01:46:26.241 --> 01:46:29.180
<v Speaker 1>of horses and then they and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an article,</v>

2369
01:46:29.181 --> 01:46:30.130
<v Speaker 1>here's an article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet god,</v>

2370
01:46:30.131 --> 01:46:34.340
<v Speaker 1>thanks noax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some shit that was going on in a leading</v>

2371
01:46:34.341 --> 01:46:37.610
<v Speaker 1>up to the election that was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized fund.</v>

2372
01:46:37.810 --> 01:46:38.643
<v Speaker 1>I criticisms of snopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you find anything that's any </v>

2373
01:46:40.431 --> 01:46:40.700
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2374
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:41.533
<v Speaker 6>I found a great thing that a university </v>
<v Speaker 6>put together of how bias each thing is </v>

2375
01:46:47.211 --> 01:46:48.980
<v Speaker 6>and which direction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything leans.</v>

2376
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:53.340
<v Speaker 6>Like they went really deep into it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they made a really cool graph.</v>

2377
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:57.780
<v Speaker 6>Then that middle part is mainstream and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the higher up it is,</v>

2378
01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:01.800
<v Speaker 6>the more actual and factual everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>is in the lower it is,</v>

2379
01:47:01.801 --> 01:47:03.930
<v Speaker 6>the more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just like fake news,</v>

2380
01:47:03.931 --> 01:47:08.220
<v Speaker 6>like crap jargOn and the farther left it</v>
<v Speaker 6>means that leans liberal,</v>

2381
01:47:08.250 --> 01:47:11.430
<v Speaker 6>like there's crazy stuff over there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the far right leans,</v>

2382
01:47:11.431 --> 01:47:14.990
<v Speaker 6>conservative and it has everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>listed.</v>

2383
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:17.020
<v Speaker 1>What's really fucked up is we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

2384
01:47:17.170 --> 01:47:18.003
<v Speaker 6>Cnn is hot dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're wondering like the fakest </v>

2385
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:21.783
<v Speaker 6>terrible news,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it says that it's better than </v>

2386
01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:25.570
<v Speaker 6>reading the news.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what was the source of this?</v>

2387
01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:29.910
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a fox from what this was.</v>

2388
01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:32.530

<v Speaker 6>point 3 million views.</v>

2390
01:47:36.461 --> 01:47:40.140

<v Speaker 6>3 million views.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some school,</v>

01:48:16.001 --> 01:48:21.001
<v Speaker 6>are basically the best minimal partisan </v>
<v Speaker 6>bias mainstream but still reputable.</v>

2404
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:22.783
<v Speaker 1>well they say about the wall street </v>
<v Speaker 1>journals because it deals with the </v>

2405
01:48:24.111 --> 01:48:24.944
<v Speaker 1>financial markets and because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have just a clear editorial bias that </v>

2406
01:48:29.091 --> 01:48:31.220
<v Speaker 1>leans one way or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna affect business.</v>

2407
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Like tHey're not going to tolerate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2408
01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:35.240
<v Speaker 1>They want to know what the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really going on.</v>

2409
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Clean and clear without all your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2410
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.800
<v Speaker 1>hippie logic thrown into it.</v>

2411
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:43.100
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think about our t?</v>

2412
01:48:43.190 --> 01:48:44.023

2413
01:48:44.250 --> 01:48:46.840
<v Speaker 1>rt Russia today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2414
01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:47.773
<v Speaker 1>I'm mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's owned by Russia at the end of the </v>

2415
01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:49.830
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2416
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:54.830
<v Speaker 1>you realize that like they've got some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an influence over them.</v>

2417
01:48:54.871 --> 01:48:55.704
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of an influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had lee camp on my podcast and I </v>

2418
01:48:58.621 --> 01:49:01.440
<v Speaker 1>was asking him whether or not I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting uses fillers.</v>

2419
01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:05.220
<v Speaker 1>That dude fucking clamped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to say a word fillers.</v>

2420
01:49:05.250 --> 01:49:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Fillers like on his face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his face is looking.</v>

2421
01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:10.590
<v Speaker 1>It looks like someone's doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his face,</v>

2422
01:49:10.591 --> 01:49:14.400
<v Speaker 1>like botox or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he just clamped up.</v>

2423
01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2424
01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:20.213
<v Speaker 1>abby martin on the show before and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to work for Russia today and she </v>

2425
01:49:23.491 --> 01:49:24.324
<v Speaker 1>just decided not to do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's doing her own thing now and she </v>

2426
01:49:26.881 --> 01:49:31.020
<v Speaker 1>was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a reporting on the,</v>

2427
01:49:31.021 --> 01:49:32.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation,</v>

2428
01:49:32.461 --> 01:49:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine and they wanted a shipper to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine feel like,</v>

2429
01:49:36.451 --> 01:49:37.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you go check it out.</v>

2430
01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:40.200
<v Speaker 1>We're going to send her there and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go there on the ground.</v>

2431
01:49:40.410 --> 01:49:42.240
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck I am.</v>

2432
01:49:42.450 --> 01:49:43.283
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to Russia or you create </v>

2433
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:47.500
<v Speaker 1>out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when she realized like,</v>

2434
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to</v>

2435
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.980
<v Speaker 4>get out of this business because he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticizing them Russia today.</v>

2436
01:49:56.170 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2437
01:49:56.710 --> 01:49:57.543
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's probably a better news source </v>

2438
01:50:00.850 --> 01:50:04.390
<v Speaker 4>than what you're getting from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>America propaganda networks to this bad.</v>

2439
01:50:04.391 --> 01:50:06.760
<v Speaker 4>I watched post debate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2440
01:50:06.761 --> 01:50:11.200
<v Speaker 4>I watched cnn and fox news and I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and forth for a couple of hours.</v>

2441
01:50:11.201 --> 01:50:13.450
<v Speaker 4>I decided this is going to be like my </v>
<v Speaker 4>project for the night.</v>

2442
01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.313
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to see What the left is saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm going to see what the right is </v>

2443
01:50:16.181 --> 01:50:17.650
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy.</v>

2444
01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:18.693
<v Speaker 4>It was like to alternate realities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two completely different worlds and it </v>

2445
01:50:21.461 --> 01:50:24.700
<v Speaker 4>was so biased on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is so biased.</v>

2446
01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:29.320
<v Speaker 4>There's no one who's saying anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>that might make the other side look good</v>

2447
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:30.303
<v Speaker 4>or it might soften someone's point of </v>
<v Speaker 4>view or get hillary clinton is a fief </v>

2448
01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:35.853
<v Speaker 4>and a liar and she's profiting and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinton foundation is a problem and she </v>

2449
01:50:39.731 --> 01:50:40.564
<v Speaker 4>needs to go to jail and anybody else </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be in jail and taxes and this and </v>

2450
01:50:43.391 --> 01:50:44.224
<v Speaker 4>that and fucking real estate scandals </v>
<v Speaker 4>and and then you go to the other side </v>

2451
01:50:46.930 --> 01:50:50.320
<v Speaker 4>and it's all sexual assault.</v>

2455
01:50:59.190 --> 01:51:03.180

01:53:50.541 --> 01:53:52.460
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't follow sports so I didn't know,</v>

2517
01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:53.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that he was like this big </v>

2518
01:53:54.321 --> 01:53:55.880
<v Speaker 1>sports guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had heard people talk about it and</v>

2519
01:53:55.881 --> 01:53:56.714
<v Speaker 1>they really liked him and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember he went over and started doing </v>

2520
01:53:58.791 --> 01:53:59.624
<v Speaker 1>political stuff and then there was a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of controversy and I feel like some of </v>

2521
01:54:03.621 --> 01:54:06.980
<v Speaker 1>the controversy was like if you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>out doing sports,</v>

2522
01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:09.140
<v Speaker 1>you got to stick with sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

2523
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:10.123
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't like you starting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with sports and then all of a sudden </v>

2524
01:54:12.681 --> 01:54:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

<v Speaker 3>for that and we're supposed to like </v>

2533
01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:35.670
<v Speaker 3>listen to your opinion on ranting </v>
<v Speaker 3>political stuff.</v>

2534
01:54:35.710 --> 01:54:38.580
<v Speaker 3>Spend sports and politics go hand in </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand it two things.</v>

2535
01:54:38.581 --> 01:54:40.860
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know for the most part.</v>

2536
01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:44.970
<v Speaker 3>But you care about this trump thing I </v>
<v Speaker 3>did just because I have to hear about it</v>

2537
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.760
<v Speaker 3>nonstop every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every single thing.</v>

2538
01:54:47.761 --> 01:54:48.594
<v Speaker 3>I like internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tv people and all are talking about </v>

2539
01:54:52.651 --> 01:54:54.990
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a nightmare that won't stop.</v>

2540
01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:56.173
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't give a shit about politics </v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have to talk about trump and hear </v>

2541
01:54:59.761 --> 01:55:00.550
<v Speaker 3>about trump.</v>

2542
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:02.060
<v Speaker 1>But you do give a shit about trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2543
01:55:02.061 --> 01:55:05.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not just you hear about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were just saying I give a shit.</v>

2544
01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:06.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2545
01:55:06.701 --> 01:55:07.534
<v Speaker 3>it's embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like I wish I could just stop </v>

2546
01:55:09.461 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 3>hearing about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's nothing.</v>

2547
01:55:11.410 --> 01:55:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I think people are tired of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining about it,</v>

2548
01:55:13.301 --> 01:55:15.730
<v Speaker 1>which is fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you want them to do?</v>

2549
01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm just tired of people fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining about a god damn it.</v>

2550
01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:20.370
<v Speaker 1>So I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he won,</v>

2551
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:22.120
<v Speaker 1>so I get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's our president.</v>

2552
01:55:22.121 --> 01:55:22.954
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2553
01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:25.510
<v Speaker 1>do you really expect the people are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to stop complaining because that's</v>

2554
01:55:25.511 --> 01:55:27.040
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always complain.</v>

2555
01:55:27.490 --> 01:55:29.380
<v Speaker 1>People complain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter who the fuck wins.</v>

2556
01:55:29.530 --> 01:55:33.790
<v Speaker 1>If hillary clinton had won right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would be going crazy on fox news.</v>

2557
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.960
<v Speaker 1>they would be screaming for her head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can only hope that someone,</v>

2558
01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:38.973
<v Speaker 1>someone has the courage to prosecute </v>
<v Speaker 1>this criminal for deleting those emails </v>

2559
01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:44.490
<v Speaker 1>and they would just go crazy</v>

2560
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:45.323
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the difference is republicans would </v>

2561
01:55:46.711 --> 01:55:47.544
<v Speaker 5>not have walked in the street unless she</v>
<v Speaker 5>had a grand by the deq video that they </v>

2562
01:55:50.891 --> 01:55:51.724
<v Speaker 5>pulled out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even then people would think it was </v>

2563
01:55:53.701 --> 01:55:55.410
<v Speaker 5>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Women would it be out there,</v>

<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2566
01:56:00.091 --> 01:56:01.770
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So first of all,</v>

2567
01:56:01.771 --> 01:56:03.720
<v Speaker 5>the whole trump thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grab them by the pussy.</v>

2568
01:56:03.810 --> 01:56:08.810
<v Speaker 5>He's talking about if you have a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 5>money to to some guy being famous.</v>

2569
01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:11.340
<v Speaker 5>Very specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that what it was?</v>

2570
01:56:11.370 --> 01:56:12.960
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a celebrity.</v>

2571
01:56:12.961 --> 01:56:14.120
<v Speaker 5>You can just grab them by the pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2572
01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:16.290
<v Speaker 5>they let you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he was saying they let you.</v>

2573
01:56:16.510 --> 01:56:18.240
<v Speaker 5>He was talking about like crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>groupies.</v>

2574
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:20.340
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are like,</v>

2575
01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:22.110
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's unfit to be president,</v>

2576
01:56:22.111 --> 01:56:24.480
<v Speaker 5>but what our last.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2577
01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:29.170
<v Speaker 5>our last great president got his dick </v>
<v Speaker 5>sucked in office in the,</v>

2578
01:56:29.250 --> 01:56:31.440
<v Speaker 5>in the oval office by an intern.</v>

2579
01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:34.770
<v Speaker 5>Then he lied about it to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including everyone.</v>

2580
01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:39.240
<v Speaker 5>I did not have sexual relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Economy was bumping.</v>

2581
01:56:39.241 --> 01:56:42.210
<v Speaker 5>Gas prices were seventy two cents and </v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody gave a fuck,</v>

2582
01:56:42.211 --> 01:56:43.830
<v Speaker 5>but now all of a sudden it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

2583
01:56:43.831 --> 01:56:47.190
<v Speaker 5>this guy is demonizing women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2584
01:56:47.191 --> 01:56:47.761
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the things that he said.</v>

2586
01:56:50.911 --> 01:56:52.530
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told clinton say,</v>

2587
01:56:52.531 --> 01:56:53.640
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2597
01:57:14.041 --> 01:57:17.310
<v Speaker 5>someone say something and knowing they </v>
<v Speaker 5>did something to people.</v>

2598
01:57:17.311 --> 01:57:20.070
<v Speaker 5>There's a difference like knowing </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone did something,</v>

2599
01:57:20.071 --> 01:57:20.611
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:37.570
<v Speaker 12>was olbermann that was actually banned </v>
<v Speaker 12>from espn to main campus.</v>

2607
01:57:37.930 --> 01:57:38.763
<v Speaker 12>That's why when he came back he was </v>
<v Speaker 12>doing a show from New York in times </v>

2608
01:57:40.961 --> 01:57:43.810

01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:46.570
<v Speaker 12>He just had lots of running and starting</v>
<v Speaker 12>in 1997,</v>

2610
01:57:46.571 --> 01:57:50.230

<v Speaker 12>still hosted by craig kilborn,</v>

2611
01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:52.330

<v Speaker 12>them.</v>

2612
01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:54.060
<v Speaker 12>That was like his first problem.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He,</v>

2613
01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:54.993
<v Speaker 12>he,</v>

<v Speaker 12>godforsaken place.</v>

2615
01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:00.773
<v Speaker 12>Got into an argument for saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>just lots of different things that </v>

2616
01:58:04.301 --> 01:58:06.490
<v Speaker 12>happened over like 10 year period.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And then he came back,</v>

<v Speaker 12>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he had a little stint with them.</v>

2618
01:58:08.171 --> 01:58:11.050
<v Speaker 12>He got in trouble again for sanction </v>
<v Speaker 12>against penn state supporters.</v>

2619
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:13.350
<v Speaker 12>They suspended him for a little bit for </v>
<v Speaker 12>that.</v>

2620
01:58:13.710 --> 01:58:16.480
<v Speaker 12>Penn state support is after the sandusky</v>
<v Speaker 12>trial.</v>

2621
01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:18.153

01:58:33.650 --> 01:58:36.510
<v Speaker 5>Coming down here again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got to get one of the um,</v>

2631
01:58:36.710 --> 01:58:38.810
<v Speaker 5>comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People to block the door.</v>

2632
01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 5>They found that they can get down</v>

2633
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:45.550
<v Speaker 1>here where they just leave the door open</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a stairway where people</v>

2634
01:58:45.551 --> 01:58:46.780
<v Speaker 1>could just fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2635
01:58:46.810 --> 01:58:47.643
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to be a security guy up</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and that's supposed to let them </v>

2636
01:58:49.901 --> 01:58:52.050
<v Speaker 1>down there and she just shut the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2637
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:52.923
<v Speaker 1>people found out we're down here now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem because I opened my </v>

2638
01:58:55.271 --> 01:58:57.340
<v Speaker 1>big mouth because we're telling him </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2639
01:58:57.370 --> 01:58:59.770
<v Speaker 1>He called it the underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the comedy store.</v>

2640
01:59:00.490 --> 01:59:01.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's people that work here that </v>

2641
01:59:02.001 --> 01:59:04.870
<v Speaker 1>are supposed to be down here and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been doing it.</v>

2642
01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:06.013
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the loosest like as like the </v>

2643
01:59:08.171 --> 01:59:11.560
<v Speaker 1>people that work here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all comics for all fuck off's.</v>

2644
01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:12.693
<v Speaker 1>Everybody like half is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes to like letting people in to </v>

2645
01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.770
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

2646
01:59:18.010 --> 01:59:20.050
<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's half of the fun of this place?</v>

2647
01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:26.970
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to have someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch the door from now on these fox to.</v>

2648
01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:32.260
<v Speaker 1>That was the producer guy already?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no it wasn't.</v>

2649
01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:36.450
<v Speaker 1>He said it was him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw another dude too.</v>

2650
01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:37.890
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

2651
01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I told them to try to get someone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

2652
01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Either way we should do these live </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of like making it like this down</v>

2653
01:59:47.231 --> 01:59:48.064
<v Speaker 1>in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should just move this shit to </v>

2654
01:59:49.781 --> 01:59:50.614
<v Speaker 1>the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love live podcasting more than </v>

2655
01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:56.830
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the belly room is such a great spot</v>

2656
01:59:56.831 --> 01:59:59.460
<v Speaker 1>for it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've already done a bunch of killed</v>

2657
01:59:59.490 --> 02:00:02.730
<v Speaker 1>tony's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like maybe there's a problem with</v>

2658
02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>people knowing that we're doing it down </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2659
02:00:05.650 --> 02:00:07.810
<v Speaker 1>You know where they want to see what new</v>
<v Speaker 1>africa killed tony.</v>

2660
02:00:07.811 --> 02:00:08.644
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where were you guys doing that show was </v>

2661
02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:11.170
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't watch it.</v>

2662
02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:12.393
<v Speaker 1>So go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a new lock or something for that </v>

2663
02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>door up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2664
02:00:16.421 --> 02:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>they just need to have someone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually stays where they're supposed to</v>

2665
02:00:18.851 --> 02:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>stay and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2666
02:00:20.650 --> 02:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>not let people down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also like,</v>

2667
02:00:22.670 --> 02:00:23.503
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy staircase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of equipment down </v>

2668
02:00:25.421 --> 02:00:27.850
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is totally like behind the scenes.</v>

2669
02:00:27.970 --> 02:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>there's all that equipment at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>store owns.</v>

2670
02:00:30.011 --> 02:00:30.844
<v Speaker 1>It's all out there sitting out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just be wandering around with </v>

2671
02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:35.620
<v Speaker 1>that bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are weird,</v>

2672
02:00:35.621 --> 02:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to be behind the scenes.</v>

2673
02:00:37.811 --> 02:00:38.644
<v Speaker 1>They want to get to that back bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to go behind the bar that </v>

2674
02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:42.093
<v Speaker 1>people want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always want to go to that one place </v>

2675
02:00:42.851 --> 02:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>where you not supposed to.</v>

2676
02:00:43.590 --> 02:00:45.770
<v Speaker 6>And that's what's crazy is like when I </v>
<v Speaker 6>got here,</v>

2677
02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:48.470
<v Speaker 6>I was mr.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I,</v>

2678
02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:52.400
<v Speaker 6>you had to invite me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've always treated this building with a</v>

2679
02:00:52.401 --> 02:00:56.520
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous amount of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I never wanted any.</v>

2680
02:00:57.190 --> 02:00:58.550
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now I'm talking about that.</v>

2681
02:00:58.551 --> 02:01:01.730
<v Speaker 6>It goes that it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a statement that that is a thing</v>

2682
02:01:01.731 --> 02:01:03.440
<v Speaker 6>in which like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I've seen it,</v>

2683
02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:04.393
<v Speaker 6>those people that push themselves into </v>
<v Speaker 6>that back alley that are always trying </v>

2684
02:01:06.561 --> 02:01:07.394
<v Speaker 6>to smoke pot with everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're never the ones that end up a </v>

2685
02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:11.653
<v Speaker 6>fucking doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're always the ones in which it's </v>

2686
02:01:13.581 --> 02:01:15.920
<v Speaker 6>like a found out about having to move </v>
<v Speaker 6>back home.</v>

2687
02:01:15.921 --> 02:01:17.630
<v Speaker 6>My mom sick so I got to go to</v>

2688
02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>worst when someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimes in on a conversation and just all</v>

2689
02:01:21.821 --> 02:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden talking about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2690
02:01:24.190 --> 02:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2691
02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Or you get a lot of that back there.</v>

2692
02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:30.510
<v Speaker 6>It's the worst and they're losers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

2693
02:01:30.511 --> 02:01:32.490
<v Speaker 6>But my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is like the people that,</v>

2694
02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:33.533
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go with where they're invited and with </v>

2695
02:01:35.581 --> 02:01:37.320
<v Speaker 6>people that they're friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2696
02:01:37.321 --> 02:01:41.230
<v Speaker 6>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's just a different thing.</v>

2697
02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:42.290
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it definitely is.</v>

2698
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:44.570
<v Speaker 6>People want to race to the back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the,</v>

2699
02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:45.613
<v Speaker 6>to the green room in the back to smoke </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they think there's a shortcut </v>

2700
02:01:48.141 --> 02:01:48.974
<v Speaker 6>waiting for them there and is a not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You still have to meet a shortcut to </v>

2701
02:01:52.671 --> 02:01:54.110
<v Speaker 6>make it as a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2702
02:01:54.111 --> 02:01:54.980
<v Speaker 6>But I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>

2703
02:01:54.990 --> 02:01:57.770
<v Speaker 6>but I think this analogy applies </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably for any job,</v>

2704
02:01:57.890 --> 02:02:01.130
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean is it's like it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>not just about the hang,</v>

2705
02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:02.113
<v Speaker 6>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've always had this combination of </v>

2706
02:02:03.231 --> 02:02:03.840
<v Speaker 6>the two.</v>

2707
02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:07.290
<v Speaker 4>You've always had this like disdain for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who network.</v>

2708
02:02:07.670 --> 02:02:09.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2709
02:02:09.910 --> 02:02:10.743
<v Speaker 6>Because I think there's a way to do it </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think it happens organically and </v>

2710
02:02:12.841 --> 02:02:16.920
<v Speaker 6>naturally and in people that overdo it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just gross.</v>

2711
02:02:17.130 --> 02:02:19.350
<v Speaker 6>The people that overdo it or almost </v>
<v Speaker 6>always not that funny.</v>

2712
02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:21.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I do it a lot,</v>

2713
02:02:21.421 --> 02:02:24.270
<v Speaker 6>but I do it my own way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

2714
02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:27.300
<v Speaker 6>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm not a networker,</v>

2715
02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:32.360
<v Speaker 6>but I hang out and I do three podcasts a</v>
<v Speaker 6>week and fucking stand up all the time.</v>

2716
02:02:33.250 --> 02:02:35.080
<v Speaker 4>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one thing that's Like,</v>

2717
02:02:35.110 --> 02:02:37.810
<v Speaker 4>you're not consciously trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>network.</v>

2718
02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:40.660
<v Speaker 4>You're working with your peers and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends.</v>

2719
02:02:40.661 --> 02:02:41.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

2720
02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:41.931
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2721
02:02:41.931 --> 02:02:42.850
<v Speaker 4>there's that network.</v>

2722
02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:45.620
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a natural amount of </v>
<v Speaker 6>networking that happens.</v>

2723
02:02:45.630 --> 02:02:47.640
<v Speaker 6>Watch house of cards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's my favorite thing.</v>

2724
02:02:47.641 --> 02:02:49.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm the one that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you watch it now?</v>

2725
02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:51.150
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tell me about.</v>

2726
02:02:51.151 --> 02:02:51.984
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people told me about this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't try to claim you told me about </v>

2727
02:02:53.351 --> 02:02:54.184
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure a lot of people did because </v>

2728
02:02:54.841 --> 02:02:58.470
<v Speaker 6>it's like one of only four.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's go back to the show.</v>

2729
02:02:58.590 --> 02:02:59.423
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2730
02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:01.973
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking hilarious show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you realize like this is probably </v>

2731
02:03:05.071 --> 02:03:08.940
<v Speaker 4>how it really works and that networking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that kind of shit like that.</v>

2732
02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.850
<v Speaker 4>That kind of networking is what we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>scared of in comedy.</v>

2733
02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:13.980
<v Speaker 4>Like that's how the entire business </v>
<v Speaker 4>runs.</v>

2734
02:03:14.010 --> 02:03:16.740
<v Speaker 4>That's how the white house runs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how politics runs.</v>

2735
02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:17.933
<v Speaker 4>That's why you're scared of it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're scared of that kind of shit </v>

2736
02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:23.130
<v Speaker 4>getting into here where it's all about </v>
<v Speaker 4>favors and bullshit,</v>

2737
02:03:23.150 --> 02:03:25.060
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2738
02:03:25.061 --> 02:03:27.730
<v Speaker 6>This place has a loophole for not having</v>
<v Speaker 6>that crap.</v>

2739
02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:28.940
<v Speaker 4>It used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2740
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:31.470
<v Speaker 4>It used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you got gigs.</v>

2741
02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:32.490
<v Speaker 4>It used to be the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a.</v>

2742
02:03:32.491 --> 02:03:34.680
<v Speaker 4>There was a big problem in hollywood for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a long time.</v>

2743
02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:36.690

2745
02:03:40.531 --> 02:03:43.800

<v Speaker 6>writing the actual thing probably gets </v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing in.</v>

2762
02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:28.280
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a part of,</v>

2763
02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:32.660
<v Speaker 6>part of a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a part of that entire crazy</v>

<v Speaker 6>There's always that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have these teams.</v>

2766
02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:39.693
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times comedy teams are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer teams are one really funny guy </v>

2767
02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:44.580
<v Speaker 1>and the other guy who writes the funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit down,</v>

2768
02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:48.270
<v Speaker 1>totally got the funny guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanders around the office,</v>

2769
02:04:48.330 --> 02:04:51.270
<v Speaker 1>scratches his beard and the other guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing shit down.</v>

2770
02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:55.640
<v Speaker 6>Even if you watch six days to air,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it's so fucking,</v>

2771
02:04:55.641 --> 02:04:56.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>matt and trey,</v>

2772
02:04:56.931 --> 02:04:59.270
<v Speaker 6>period.</v>
<v Speaker 6>While those other people are,</v>

2773
02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:01.640
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>writers,</v>

2774
02:05:01.641 --> 02:05:05.270
<v Speaker 6>but you barely tagging anything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can totally see the vision.</v>

2775
02:05:05.271 --> 02:05:08.630
<v Speaker 6>Just puking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>puking it out of his head,</v>

2776
02:05:08.631 --> 02:05:11.570
<v Speaker 6>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're both laughing and adding to each</v>

2777
02:05:11.571 --> 02:05:12.404
<v Speaker 6>other's thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then there's these other people that </v>

2778
02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:14.973
<v Speaker 6>know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People are like,</v>

2779
02:05:15.050 --> 02:05:15.883
<v Speaker 1>they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that you need them to in that </v>

2780
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:19.303
<v Speaker 1>environment I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you need like the occasional </v>

2781
02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:23.540
<v Speaker 1>dusting and sprinkling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally,</v>

2782
02:05:23.570 --> 02:05:25.890
<v Speaker 1>but that's a different situation because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a super genius.</v>

2783
02:05:25.891 --> 02:05:26.724
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That trey parker dudes a super genius </v>

2784
02:05:29.950 --> 02:05:32.840
<v Speaker 1>and so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing,</v>

2785
02:05:32.841 --> 02:05:36.290
<v Speaker 1>but like those sitcoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're working on a sitcom,</v>

2786
02:05:36.291 --> 02:05:39.530
<v Speaker 1>that's when it becomes really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really apparent and it's also one of the</v>

2787
02:05:39.531 --> 02:05:44.120
<v Speaker 1>weird things about comedy writers is </v>
<v Speaker 1>some comedy writers or standup comics,</v>

2788
02:05:44.121 --> 02:05:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but most of them are not so like were </v>
<v Speaker 1>they practicing all this comedy?</v>

2789
02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't perform it,</v>

2790
02:05:51.201 --> 02:05:53.270
<v Speaker 1>but you know what's funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sure?</v>

2791
02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>

2792
02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:56.333
<v Speaker 1>It was funny because I write a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things down that I think is going to be </v>

2793
02:05:57.621 --> 02:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>funny and then not really funny like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you practice?</v>

2794
02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:04.010
<v Speaker 6>You don't you get taken by people like </v>
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>

2795
02:06:04.011 --> 02:06:08.300
<v Speaker 6>They get added to the writer's room and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you get fucking house and it makes these</v>

2796
02:06:08.301 --> 02:06:10.190
<v Speaker 6>people have to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean you get taken?</v>

2797
02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:11.653
<v Speaker 6>I come in and all of a sudden I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>writing the jokes that are making it to </v>

2798
02:06:14.901 --> 02:06:17.630
<v Speaker 6>the actual episode.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>

2799
02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:22.040
<v Speaker 6>like let's got to be some funny people </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're working with to totally,</v>

2800
02:06:22.250 --> 02:06:23.400
<v Speaker 6>totally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're.</v>

2801
02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:25.760
<v Speaker 6>Those people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Normally by the way,</v>

2802
02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:29.210
<v Speaker 6>are standup comedians as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a few gurus,</v>

2803
02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:30.530
<v Speaker 6>but occasionally</v>

2804
02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>people have ideas that are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not performers that had just,</v>

2805
02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>they just write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just are comedy writers and you just go,</v>

2806
02:06:37.041 --> 02:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>what is going on with this?</v>

2807
02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:41.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people were continuously.</v>

2808
02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:46.360
<v Speaker 6>Some people are bs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a very interesting business.</v>

2809
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.863
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's a couple of people that get </v>

2810
02:06:48.971 --> 02:06:50.720
<v Speaker 6>by on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how I.</v>

2811
02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:51.793
<v Speaker 6>It shocks me sometimes when I see a </v>
<v Speaker 6>certain couple people in another </v>

2812
02:06:54.971 --> 02:06:57.420
<v Speaker 6>writer's room making writer's guild </v>
<v Speaker 6>medicine</v>

2813
02:06:57.870 --> 02:07:01.010
<v Speaker 1>loan is a fascinating enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2814
02:07:01.070 --> 02:07:01.903
<v Speaker 1>making things up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting down in front of a computer and </v>

2815
02:07:03.981 --> 02:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>making up scenarios,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making people,</v>

2816
02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>making up stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a plot,</v>

2817
02:07:10.670 --> 02:07:15.650
<v Speaker 1>making the twists in the plot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and it's fucking crazy way to</v>

2818
02:07:15.651 --> 02:07:16.420
<v Speaker 1>make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

2819
02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:17.253
<v Speaker 6>is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like use your mind to formulate a </v>

2820
02:07:20.651 --> 02:07:22.090
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2821
02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:24.880
<v Speaker 6>it's continuously asking yourself </v>
<v Speaker 6>questions.</v>

2822
02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:28.150
<v Speaker 6>You're like writing a trivia game and </v>
<v Speaker 6>answering it at the same time.</v>

2823
02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:29.890
<v Speaker 6>Who's the character?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What would he do?</v>

2824
02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:32.200
<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What would it smell like?</v>

2825
02:07:32.201 --> 02:07:33.820
<v Speaker 6>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What would he say?</v>

2826
02:07:34.090 --> 02:07:36.060
<v Speaker 6>That's why comedy teams totally makes</v>

2827

<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've met the comedy guy from the </v>

2858
02:08:50.261 --> 02:08:52.390

<v Speaker 1>why would you do in that?</v>

2859
02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to be whack was you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have exploding tie like you gotta look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2861
02:08:59.170 --> 02:09:01.570
<v Speaker 1>what is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he think is actually funny?</v>

2862
02:09:02.110 --> 02:09:06.490
<v Speaker 1>He gave us a script and it was the worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of shit I've ever read.</v>

2863
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:08.650
<v Speaker 1>It was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so bad.</v>

2864
02:09:08.651 --> 02:09:09.484
<v Speaker 1>It was stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so bad that the network who </v>

2865
02:09:10.601 --> 02:09:11.434
<v Speaker 1>recommended him and theY gave him a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic development deal after he left </v>

2866
02:09:14.201 --> 02:09:15.034
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sitcom might've left friends and went </v>

2867
02:09:17.110 --> 02:09:18.250
<v Speaker 1>to another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was,</v>

2868
02:09:18.670 --> 02:09:21.910
<v Speaker 1>but they gave this cat a gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>network deal,</v>

2869
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:22.833
<v Speaker 1>like a huge development deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was the first thing that he </v>

2870
02:09:25.001 --> 02:09:27.370
<v Speaker 1>delivered off this huge deal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>

2871
02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:28.233
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when the concept of the </v>

2872
02:09:31.061 --> 02:09:33.820
<v Speaker 1>comedy team became apparent to me what </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

2873
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Two of them are the funny one and left </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy behind and he's like,</v>

2874
02:09:37.331 --> 02:09:38.980
<v Speaker 1>fuck this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

2875
02:09:38.981 --> 02:09:39.251
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2876
02:09:39.251 --> 02:09:41.110
<v Speaker 1>He's very funny too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most importantly,</v>

2877
02:09:41.111 --> 02:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>you understand story structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got an a.</v>

2878
02:09:44.110 --> 02:09:45.160
<v Speaker 1>he's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2879
02:09:45.161 --> 02:09:46.510
<v Speaker 1>this is definitely not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2880
02:09:46.511 --> 02:09:47.344
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a first draft and you have to </v>

2881
02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:49.690
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

2882
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:52.840
<v Speaker 1>this is a terrible concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the concept was awful.</v>

2883
02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:55.930
<v Speaker 1>It was about a guy who time travels and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2884
02:09:56.290 --> 02:09:57.220
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's immortal.</v>

2885
02:09:57.550 --> 02:09:58.301

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2886

<v Speaker 1>usually like cursed in ancient Egypt so </v>
<v Speaker 1>he can never die.</v>

2889

2894

<v Speaker 1>There's things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get pitched every day,</v>

2895
02:10:25.690 --> 02:10:26.523
<v Speaker 1>there's some guy who comes into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>office and I've had some fucking </v>

2896
02:10:28.001 --> 02:10:28.834
<v Speaker 1>terrible ideas myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had some terrible ideas that I </v>

2897
02:10:30.881 --> 02:10:33.590
<v Speaker 1>thought were good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write them out like this is it,</v>

2898
02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:35.430
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll put it down for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weeks,</v>

2899
02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:37.940
<v Speaker 1>come back to it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was I thinking?</v>

2900
02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>

2901
02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:41.213
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of ideas that you start </v>

2902
02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:43.134
<v Speaker 1>out with that you bring to the stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually wind up making it onto a </v>

2903
02:10:46.521 --> 02:10:49.220
<v Speaker 1>special or making it into your act </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently?</v>

2904
02:10:51.150 --> 02:10:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it even half?</v>

2905
02:10:54.010 --> 02:10:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Probably about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably a little.</v>

2906
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Probably about half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2907
02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I think so because I really don't try it</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless I really,</v>

2908
02:11:03.250 --> 02:11:04.083
<v Speaker 1>really think it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in think that it fits with my tone </v>

2909
02:11:08.951 --> 02:11:09.784
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rub you have the possibility of working </v>

2910
02:11:11.861 --> 02:11:13.950
<v Speaker 1>those things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2911
02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:14.793
<v Speaker 1>hammering them out on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to really knock it out of the park </v>

2912
02:11:17.471 --> 02:11:20.970
<v Speaker 1>with a comedy script and not ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

2913
02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Like that's one of the things that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>south park so particularly special.</v>

2914
02:11:25.090 --> 02:11:29.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're not even practicing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and turning it into like it's best form.</v>

2915
02:11:29.770 --> 02:11:32.490
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of coming at you with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

2916
02:11:32.491 --> 02:11:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Like the initial idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

2917
02:11:35.101 --> 02:11:36.610
<v Speaker 1>they've honed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've cut it down,</v>

2918
02:11:36.611 --> 02:11:38.560
<v Speaker 1>they've edited it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone over it,</v>

2919
02:11:38.561 --> 02:11:40.180
<v Speaker 1>they've made it funnier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure,</v>

2920
02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:41.493
<v Speaker 1>but like they don't get to do it for six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months in front of various crowds and </v>

2921
02:11:46.571 --> 02:11:50.840
<v Speaker 1>watch it come to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 12>he's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he's like a vegetable.</v>

2970
02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:15.270
<v Speaker 12>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 12>I think he had a stroke.</v>

2971
02:14:15.650 --> 02:14:20.250
<v Speaker 12>He had a really bad stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 12>no one really talks about that either.</v>

2972
02:14:20.251 --> 02:14:22.560
<v Speaker 12>You don't really know that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like I saw him in an interview and I was</v>

2973
02:14:22.561 --> 02:14:24.360
<v Speaker 12>like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what the fuck happened to tim curry?</v>

2974
02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:25.580
<v Speaker 12>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's a palmer.</v>

2975
02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:26.693
<v Speaker 12>I didn't know that.</v>

2976
02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:28.113
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>richard dawkins had a stroke to the </v>

2977
02:14:29.991 --> 02:14:30.824
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The selfish mean you don't know that </v>

2978
02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:35.633
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a pretty famous atheist and </v>

2979
02:14:38.630 --> 02:14:43.130
<v Speaker 1>scientist and I'm author and he had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke,</v>

2980
02:14:43.131 --> 02:14:46.880
<v Speaker 1>but he recovered and it didn't affect </v>
<v Speaker 1>his cognitive function,</v>

2981
02:14:46.881 --> 02:14:49.190
<v Speaker 1>but it did affect the way your hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved.</v>

2982
02:14:49.191 --> 02:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>He can't play the piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also affected.</v>

2983
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:56.300
<v Speaker 1>He can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't sing anymore.</v>

2984
02:14:56.330 --> 02:14:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

2985
02:14:58.820 --> 02:15:00.980
<v Speaker 1>he's diminished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he still speaks,</v>

2986
02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:01.993
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The part of his brain that was affected </v>

2987
02:15:05.331 --> 02:15:06.164
<v Speaker 1>by the stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't fuck them up to the point </v>

2988
02:15:08.721 --> 02:15:09.554
<v Speaker 1>where he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't sing anymore or he can't talk </v>

2989
02:15:11.241 --> 02:15:12.074
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks Just as well as they always </v>

2990
02:15:13.131 --> 02:15:15.350
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes really lucid points.</v>

2991
02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Still very smart.</v>

2992
02:15:16.690 --> 02:15:20.600
<v Speaker 12>It's nuts how it's probably like a </v>
<v Speaker 12>microscopic fraction of a difference,</v>

2993
02:15:20.601 --> 02:15:23.060
<v Speaker 12>like a stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What it hits and what it doesn't hit.</v>

2994
02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:24.490
<v Speaker 12>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Look,</v>

2995
02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:28.130
<v Speaker 12>could hit any portion of your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but the portion that it hit on his brain</v>

2996
02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:32.180
<v Speaker 12>just affect motor skills apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Fortunately for him.</v>

2997
02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:34.430
<v Speaker 12>But fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What a weird</v>

2998
02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:39.180
<v Speaker 1>feelIng to know that your bodies as kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like short circuiting that you blew a</v>

2999
02:15:39.181 --> 02:15:40.560
<v Speaker 1>fuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3000
02:15:41.790 --> 02:15:43.830
<v Speaker 1>like I'd be a blue a circuit the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

3001
02:15:44.220 --> 02:15:46.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you plug something in,</v>

3002
02:15:46.111 --> 02:15:47.460
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>

3003
02:15:47.730 --> 02:15:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Then you go out to the circuit court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh god,</v>

3004
02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:50.393
<v Speaker 1>this fucking flip out for the flip that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucker over and then it starts working </v>

3005
02:15:53.161 --> 02:15:55.080
<v Speaker 1>again and you gotta think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3006
02:15:55.380 --> 02:16:00.380
<v Speaker 1>that's kinda like your brain's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a biological circuit board.</v>

3007
02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:02.133
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of electricity going </v>

3008
02:16:03.751 --> 02:16:04.584
<v Speaker 1>through there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of neurons firing all these cells </v>

3009
02:16:06.571 --> 02:16:08.940
<v Speaker 1>in there and every now and then one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them goes,</v>

3010
02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:15.870

<v Speaker 3>three d.</v>

3086
02:19:11.521 --> 02:19:14.540
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe that might've been it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was so boring that I just.</v>

3087
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:16.530
<v Speaker 3>And there was no three d going on,</v>

<v Speaker 3>my eyes are getting tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just need to sleep.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I thought it was just me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I thought it was something like I </v>

3093

02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:54.390
<v Speaker 12>I shouldn't say good.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It was really,</v>

3106
02:19:54.391 --> 02:19:56.050
<v Speaker 12>it was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It wasn't great.</v>

3107
02:19:56.430 --> 02:19:57.700
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that movie split,</v>

3108
02:19:57.730 --> 02:19:58.563
<v Speaker 12>which is getting a lot of news right now</v>
<v Speaker 12>because I'm a ding dong movie did </v>

3109
02:20:01.391 --> 02:20:03.500
<v Speaker 12>surprisingly well.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I guess it was,</v>

3110
02:20:03.550 --> 02:20:05.350
<v Speaker 12>keeps tricking me.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It wasn't a,</v>

<v Speaker 12>it wasn't one of those kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>oh,</v>

3112
02:20:06.881 --> 02:20:07.714
<v Speaker 12>there's a big twist at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Everyone is saying there's a twist at </v>

3113
02:20:09.281 --> 02:20:10.114
<v Speaker 12>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's not that big of a fucking surprise </v>

3114
02:20:11.591 --> 02:20:12.424
<v Speaker 12>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But the movie itself was pretty </v>

3115
02:20:14.021 --> 02:20:15.790
<v Speaker 12>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's about people with did,</v>

3116
02:20:15.791 --> 02:20:19.720
<v Speaker 12>which is disassociative disassociative </v>
<v Speaker 12>identity disorder,</v>

3117
02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:23.650
<v Speaker 12>which is fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I looked up some more stuff on it.</v>

3118
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:25.383
<v Speaker 12>If it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the way that this movie depicts it </v>

3119
02:20:28.090 --> 02:20:30.020
<v Speaker 12>fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But</v>

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

02:20:57.911 --> 02:20:59.500
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk out to the road.</v>

3132

02:23:56.401 --> 02:23:58.050
<v Speaker 4>house and he takes.</v>

3199
02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:00.063
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know that happens with every </v>

3200
02:24:01.281 --> 02:24:03.410
<v Speaker 7>presidential change.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I read a whole thing about that.</v>

3201
02:24:03.470 --> 02:24:05.680
<v Speaker 7>They take the lbgt archive everything.</v>

3202
02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:09.750
<v Speaker 6>They take everything from everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing and completely scratch it</v>

3203
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:12.360
<v Speaker 4>and then they put up the new page,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the new president.</v>

3204
02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:16.170
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't give a fuck about lbgt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who doesn't give a fuck about you?</v>

3205
02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:18.940
<v Speaker 7>Climate change and it doesn't give a </v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck about civil rights.</v>

3206
02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.910
<v Speaker 7>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Still the same thing no matter what,</v>

3207
02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:25.270
<v Speaker 7>like what he decided to remove and </v>
<v Speaker 7>replace,</v>

3208
02:24:25.510 --> 02:24:28.380
<v Speaker 7>but I think it's like a process that </v>
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>

3209
02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:29.253
<v Speaker 7>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think they would have a website </v>

3210
02:24:30.491 --> 02:24:31.040
<v Speaker 7>in place.</v>

3211
02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:34.070
<v Speaker 6>I read a whole thing and maybe I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

3212
02:24:34.071 --> 02:24:36.560
<v Speaker 6>I can't cite the source because like I </v>
<v Speaker 6>told jerry earlier,</v>

3213
02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:40.250
<v Speaker 6>smoking twice as much as I ever have </v>
<v Speaker 6>before in my life.</v>

3214
02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:41.113
<v Speaker 6>So like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I read that that's the thing that </v>

3215
02:24:43.341 --> 02:24:44.174
<v Speaker 6>happened when barack took office.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like a lot of this stuff by the way </v>

3216
02:24:46.971 --> 02:24:51.500
<v Speaker 6>that's happening is stuff that is a very</v>
<v Speaker 6>regular thing,</v>

3217
02:24:51.650 --> 02:24:54.080
<v Speaker 6>like people are freaking out about his </v>
<v Speaker 6>cabinet picks,</v>

3218
02:24:54.081 --> 02:24:56.510
<v Speaker 6>but I read a whole thing on that where </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

3219
02:24:56.511 --> 02:25:00.110
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's how this stuff works still to get</v>

3220
02:25:00.111 --> 02:25:01.130
<v Speaker 6>approved by this and it.</v>

3221
02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:04.320
<v Speaker 4>His cabinet picks tell a lot about his </v>
<v Speaker 4>intentions.</v>

3222
02:25:04.321 --> 02:25:05.041
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the guy,</v>

3223
02:25:05.041 --> 02:25:07.010
<v Speaker 4>the former exxon ceo and.</v>

3224
02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:11.030
<v Speaker 6>But don't you think that's sort of good </v>
<v Speaker 6>to have a.</v>

3225
02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:12.033
<v Speaker 6>Do you know that you put a five year,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he's the first president to say </v>

3226
02:25:14.521 --> 02:25:17.830
<v Speaker 6>that you can't just go join lobbies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't be a light switch,</v>

3227
02:25:17.850 --> 02:25:18.683
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to get rich off of me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think maybe if that guy who he </v>

3228
02:25:22.441 --> 02:25:24.880
<v Speaker 6>interviewed who's trump known for hiring</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

3229
02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:29.940
<v Speaker 6>that's what his specialty is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It if he hired that guy for a reason and</v>

3230
02:25:30.791 --> 02:25:33.880
<v Speaker 6>if it's because he's such a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>freak that he might be one of the people</v>

3231
02:25:33.881 --> 02:25:34.714
<v Speaker 6>that fix the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look how much money you made mobile </v>

3232
02:25:36.491 --> 02:25:37.324
<v Speaker 6>exxon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying that if he's right then </v>

3233
02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:41.050
<v Speaker 6>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That'd be so great.</v>

3234
02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:44.080
<v Speaker 6>I'm rooting for the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems scary,</v>

3235
02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:46.403
<v Speaker 4>right about what the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knows is a real transparent </v>

3236
02:25:49.501 --> 02:25:50.334
<v Speaker 4>deal that obama blocked or exxon was </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to drill and they were trying to </v>

3237
02:25:54.781 --> 02:25:57.440
<v Speaker 4>make this deal with Russia and exxon </v>
<v Speaker 4>got,</v>

3238
02:25:57.520 --> 02:25:58.353
<v Speaker 4>they got cock blocked by obama and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>that obama's out and then the Former </v>

3239
02:26:01.831 --> 02:26:06.831
<v Speaker 4>exxon ceo is in like and people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>wondering like,</v>

3240
02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:11.610
<v Speaker 4>are they doing something that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environmentalist thing could potentially</v>

3241
02:26:11.611 --> 02:26:15.240
<v Speaker 4>be a huge disaster and then they doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>it for profit.</v>

3242
02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:17.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't follow it enough.</v>

3243
02:26:17.790 --> 02:26:20.970
<v Speaker 4>That's when I'm not optimistic though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when I get nervous,</v>

3244
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:22.103
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then again Like things like this </v>

3245
02:26:22.741 --> 02:26:24.300
<v Speaker 4>dakota pipeline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know about that,</v>

3246
02:26:24.301 --> 02:26:26.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dakota pipeline,</v>

3247
02:26:26.011 --> 02:26:27.840
<v Speaker 4>they were trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they fucking did man.</v>

3248
02:26:27.841 --> 02:26:30.510
<v Speaker 4>They arrested people for trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>protest them.</v>

3249
02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:34.740
<v Speaker 4>This government decided and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>easement,</v>

3250
02:26:34.890 --> 02:26:38.360
<v Speaker 4>they decided to put through people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>private land that these are.</v>

3251
02:26:38.370 --> 02:26:39.203
<v Speaker 4>THese guys had ranchers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a river that runs through them </v>

3252
02:26:41.441 --> 02:26:45.310
<v Speaker 4>and they wanted a drill this pipeline </v>
<v Speaker 4>right under the river and if it blue,</v>

3253
02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:47.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they do all the time.</v>

3254
02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:48.653
<v Speaker 4>If it goes bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole river system gets totally </v>

3255
02:26:50.881 --> 02:26:54.240
<v Speaker 4>poisoned and they successfully blocked </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3256
02:26:54.241 --> 02:26:58.860
<v Speaker 4>but people had to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to put a lot of blood,</v>

3257
02:26:58.861 --> 02:27:01.860
<v Speaker 4>sweat and tears into it and had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>protest for a long time.</v>

3258
02:27:01.861 --> 02:27:05.430
<v Speaker 4>They got shot at with water hoses and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that cold weather</v>

3259
02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:07.280
<v Speaker 6>that happened under obama's watch </v>
<v Speaker 6>though,</v>

3260
02:27:07.281 --> 02:27:08.114
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>

3261
02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:09.290
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I mean,</v>

3262
02:27:09.291 --> 02:27:10.760
<v Speaker 6>it's one of those things where it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3263
02:27:10.850 --> 02:27:11.683
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>At least we're learning that if you do </v>

3264
02:27:13.580 --> 02:27:14.413
<v Speaker 6>have to make some sacrifices and </v>
<v Speaker 6>protests and certain situation like </v>

3265
02:27:16.941 --> 02:27:18.560
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that maybe it will work.</v>

3266
02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:19.793
<v Speaker 4>I guess it is interesting that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened under obama's watch and he </v>

3267
02:27:21.631 --> 02:27:24.360
<v Speaker 4>didn't do jack shit about it and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't freak out.</v>

3268
02:27:24.390 --> 02:27:27.360
<v Speaker 4>He had to have been aware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had to know that these people are.</v>

3269
02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:29.640
<v Speaker 4>They're protesting a very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

3270
02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:32.400
<v Speaker 4>It's all fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3271
02:27:32.610 --> 02:27:35.520
<v Speaker 4>There's so much profit to be made and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then these guys have to think,</v>

3272
02:27:35.521 --> 02:27:36.420
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3273
02:27:36.421 --> 02:27:38.640
<v Speaker 4>if we don't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we're reliant upon the salt.</v>

3274
02:27:38.641 --> 02:27:40.740
<v Speaker 4>Number nine is gold underwear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3275
02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:42.630
<v Speaker 4>because that's the only place where </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get our oil from.</v>

3276
02:27:42.660 --> 02:27:43.493
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to get our oil from the middle </v>

3277
02:27:44.251 --> 02:27:45.750
<v Speaker 4>east.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should we get it ourselves?</v>

3278
02:27:45.751 --> 02:27:47.310
<v Speaker 4>Should we get it this way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that better?</v>

3279
02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:48.173
<v Speaker 4>Is it better for our country?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do we do it without fucking up the </v>

3280
02:27:50.071 --> 02:27:51.780
<v Speaker 4>environment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you prove to me that we're not going</v>

3281
02:27:51.781 --> 02:27:52.614
<v Speaker 4>to fuck up the environment and then they</v>
<v Speaker 4>think they do and then they go out and </v>

3282
02:27:54.871 --> 02:27:55.531
<v Speaker 4>they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh sir,</v>

3283
02:27:55.531 --> 02:27:56.364
<v Speaker 4>we've got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Earthquakes have increased by 500 </v>

3284
02:27:57.991 --> 02:28:00.780
<v Speaker 4>percent earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean earthquakes?</v>

3285
02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:03.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't anticipate this,</v>

3286
02:28:03.871 --> 02:28:06.660
<v Speaker 4>but apparently when you frack and drill </v>
<v Speaker 4>holes in the ground,</v>

3287
02:28:06.661 --> 02:28:07.494
<v Speaker 4>the earth shifts and we have some </v>
<v Speaker 4>serious earthquakes and unfortunately </v>

3288
02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:11.214
<v Speaker 4>because of that shifting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the shit has gotten into the </v>

3289
02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:13.473
<v Speaker 4>water and that's where.</v>
<v Speaker 4>THat's where they are right now in </v>

3290
02:28:17.251 --> 02:28:19.020
<v Speaker 4>Oklahoma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oklahoma,</v>

3291
02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 4>they're having a fuck ton of earthquakes</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they trying to figure</v>

3292
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.040
<v Speaker 1>out what to do because these guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just digging holes in the ground.</v>

3293
02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're crazy.</v>

3294
02:28:26.511 --> 02:28:27.344
<v Speaker 1>Monsters were like termites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Termites were digging holes into the </v>

3295
02:28:31.041 --> 02:28:34.190
<v Speaker 1>ground and we're sucking up all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>juicy stuff so we can light fires.</v>

3296
02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:38.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're lighting fires,</v>

3297
02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:42.080
<v Speaker 1>were leaded gas fires in oil fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just contain them inside these mental</v>

3298
02:28:42.081 --> 02:28:43.100
<v Speaker 1>blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3299
02:28:43.101 --> 02:28:47.210
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're doing the world were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need all this stuff for is combustion</v>

3300
02:28:47.211 --> 02:28:50.630
<v Speaker 1>engines and make the make plastics so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could choke birds.</v>

3301
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:53.750
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're choking birds,</v>

3302
02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:55.790
<v Speaker 1>choking birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened fires.</v>

3303
02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:56.793
<v Speaker 12>They're going to tap our natural </v>
<v Speaker 12>resources on federal lands according to </v>

3304
02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:06.520
<v Speaker 12>the first energy plan on the white house</v>
<v Speaker 12>website says we have a quote from,</v>

3305
02:29:06.521 --> 02:29:09.220
<v Speaker 12>we must take advantage of the estimated </v>
<v Speaker 12>$50,000,000,000,000</v>

3306
02:29:09.221 --> 02:29:11.380
<v Speaker 12>and untapped shale oil,</v>
<v Speaker 12>natural gas reserves,</v>

3307
02:29:11.381 --> 02:29:14.110
<v Speaker 12>especially those on the federal lands </v>
<v Speaker 12>that the american people own.</v>

3308
02:29:15.990 --> 02:29:17.220
<v Speaker 12>That's super interesting.</v>

3309
02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:20.250
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible thing.</v>
