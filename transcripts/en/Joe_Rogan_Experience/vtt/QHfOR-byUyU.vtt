<v Speaker 3>what'd you call yourself?</v>

137
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 3>A media analyst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which a theorist immediate Arthur.</v>

138
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 3>Mainly author mainly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

139
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:25.451
<v Speaker 3>And your new book is called present </v>
<v Speaker 3>shock when everything happens all at </v>

140
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 3>once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that everything happens now.</v>

141
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.860
<v Speaker 3>And then when everything happens now I </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw quite a few of your videos online.</v>

142
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 3>It really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

143
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 3>really interesting conversations and one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them that really struck me was,</v>

144
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:40.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

145
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 3>several of them that struck me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of them was your story of being </v>

146
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.540
<v Speaker 3>mugged and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you told people on an online room like </v>

147
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.630
<v Speaker 3>where you got mugged and people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>upset that you in telling them that you </v>

148
00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.191
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't telling the world that you got </v>

149
00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:00.191
<v Speaker 3>mugged there.</v>

150
00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:00.191
<v Speaker 3>It was lowering their property values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

151
00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:04.370
<v Speaker 3>That was a bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

152
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was one thing to get mugged.</v>

153
00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:09.070
<v Speaker 3>It was just kind of freaky in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

154
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 3>and whatever shaman weirdness goes with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

155
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.190
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

156
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I was trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean deep down was probably elicit,</v>

157
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>love and affection from people on my </v>

158
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.870
<v Speaker 3>list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

159
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 3>so I put up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you know,</v>

160
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.860
<v Speaker 3>and there was a social,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something social responsibility to it.</v>

161
00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:31.861
<v Speaker 3>So I put up where I got mugged because </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone should know this is maybe a </v>

162
00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 3>dangerous stretch here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to maybe get a light.</v>

163
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

164
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.130
<v Speaker 3>so I sent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent it out and then um,</v>

165
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.380
<v Speaker 3>the first two emails I got back from </v>
<v Speaker 3>this loving list of parents was how dare</v>

166
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 3>you see exactly where it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

167
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:46.240
<v Speaker 3>we live right across the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

168
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 3>what you're going to lower our property </v>
<v Speaker 3>values.</v>

169
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 3>Are you selling now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

170
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.650
<v Speaker 3>is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

171
00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:55.651
<v Speaker 3>we're not selling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was a really weird time when </v>

172
00:07:55.651 --> 00:07:58.271
<v Speaker 3>people needed their property values to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go up because they were trying to get </v>

173
00:07:58.271 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 3>bigger mortgages and pay down and do all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

174
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 3>And it was just like so panicky there </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that,</v>

175
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 3>that some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

176
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.770
<v Speaker 3>someone was afraid of what if a </v>
<v Speaker 3>newspaper covers it and it's bad and </v>

177
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird when one's and zero's </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump humanity,</v>

178
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that case,</v>

179
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ones and Zeros,</v>

180
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

181
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in two kinds of ones and Zeros,</v>

182
00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:23.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones and zeroes,</v>

183
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.500
<v Speaker 3>that money now and the ones and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>startup of digital technology,</v>

184
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:32.501
<v Speaker 3>which I think can create a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance that feeling the impact of </v>

185
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 3>saying that to someone's face here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

186
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 3>There's a weird communication that takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>place online.</v>

187
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 3>That's you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have any consequence,</v>

188
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

189
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:49.151
<v Speaker 3>you can do it anonymously and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like these barbs that you can just </v>

190
00:08:49.151 --> 00:08:50.910
<v Speaker 3>send out and illogically like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

191
00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:55.911
<v Speaker 3>in ways that you would never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had to deal with someone one on </v>

192
00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:55.911
<v Speaker 3>one because you would feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would look at that.</v>

193
00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 3>You would feel the response,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would be like,</v>

194
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 3>why are you saying this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

195
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 3>like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you being such an asshole?</v>

196
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:05.331
<v Speaker 3>But because you are anonymous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people are just like in this </v>

197
00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:06.560
<v Speaker 3>unnatural communication thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

198
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 3>But then the part that worries me after </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is if you get used to doing it like</v>

199
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:16.101
<v Speaker 3>that in an anonymous way online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to start to make the behavior a bit</v>

200
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 3>more normative when you're even with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your identity.</v>

201
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee it has to.</v>

202
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:24.800
<v Speaker 3>It has to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

203
00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 3>there's no free rides when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

204
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like your thoughts,</v>

205
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 3>you're kind like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was always a thing.</v>

206
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was someone in my school newspaper </v>

207
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.210
<v Speaker 3>wrote like a funny critique about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>boy scouts and one of the things that he</v>

208
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:44.211
<v Speaker 3>didn't like about the boy scouts was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they wanted you to keep your </v>

209
00:09:44.211 --> 00:09:44.211
<v Speaker 3>thoughts pure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

210
00:09:44.211 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

211
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 3>well my thoughts are my own thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

212
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.100
<v Speaker 3>as long as I don't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

213
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.100
<v Speaker 3>with my thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

214
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.080
<v Speaker 3>And that was really smartly argued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember reading that going,</v>

215
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kid's pretty clever.</v>

216
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.560
<v Speaker 3>But then I thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

217
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're thinking about creepy shit,</v>

218
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 3>you probably are kind of creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

219
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:04.370
<v Speaker 3>and it's not going to get any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

220
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just gonna eventually one day </v>

221
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 3>going to snap and then going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

222
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Maybe thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

223
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 3>If you really are like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

224
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean everyone has their own definition</v>
<v Speaker 3>of thoughts being pure,</v>

225
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a more lenient person might allow a</v>

226
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:23.121
<v Speaker 3>lot of healthy sexual things and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of thoughts being pure as long as </v>

227
00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 3>it's not creeping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's other people that would just</v>

228
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:25.650
<v Speaker 3>sit around and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

229
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 3>let me just think about creepy shit all </v>
<v Speaker 3>day and not do it and I'm fine,</v>

230
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.810
<v Speaker 3>but there's no free ride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There may be though you think.</v>

231
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what you're describing like </v>

232
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 3>you're describing is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of an absolute police state</v>

233
00:10:38.941 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 3>as long as it was always right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

234
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 3>that's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

235
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

236
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 3>you can always get your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my narrative report,</v>

237
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:51.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just maybe they're running really </v>

238
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.410
<v Speaker 3>subscribing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that you've been,</v>

239
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 3>you can't have really shitty thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get through.</v>

240
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 3>And I think that if you're really shitty</v>
<v Speaker 3>online,</v>

241
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 3>if you have those thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's only online,</v>

242
00:10:57.241 --> 00:11:00.750
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that negative energy </v>
<v Speaker 3>genuinely shitty.</v>

243
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:02.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just how do you decide </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

244
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.080
<v Speaker 3>what's shitty and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

245
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.870
<v Speaker 3>now it's people when their demeanor you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are online without your face,</v>

246
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:14.871
<v Speaker 3>the meaning you can be online with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>face on the meaning you can get in real </v>

247
00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:18.040
<v Speaker 3>life until you just got mean people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you investigate pupils to it?</v>

248
00:11:18.041 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone sends you something </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird on twitter,</v>

249
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:25.071
<v Speaker 3>do you go to their twitter page and see </v>
<v Speaker 3>just all their country shit that they </v>

250
00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:25.071
<v Speaker 3>write to everybody and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

251
00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:29.500
<v Speaker 3>they're just crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will admit I focus way more on the </v>

252
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.191
<v Speaker 3>content tweets and emails and things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the ones that are 10 emails.</v>

253
00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your book was great.</v>

254
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

255
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 3>You've changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My children worship at your altar.</v>

256
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.820
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delete,</v>

257
00:11:41.821 --> 00:11:42.300
<v Speaker 3>delete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delete,</v>

258
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:45.230
<v Speaker 3>delete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With this guy.</v>

259
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the biggest piece of Shit I've </v>

260
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:53.050
<v Speaker 3>ever read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I need 10,000</v>

261
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.970
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Loved it more than life itself,</v>

262
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 3>but I'll spend the rest of my week </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to convince this one guy.</v>

263
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

264
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 3>I am not a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

265
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:03.480
<v Speaker 3>The book is actually okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta learn the Internet well now.</v>

266
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's inevitable.</v>

267
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.970
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard not to engage people because </v>

268
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.530
<v Speaker 3>they're like a person saying it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very similar and to have someone </v>

269
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 3>who's public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're out there,</v>

270
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 3>you have your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your name is out there in the videos are</v>

271
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:22.741
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone can find out about you and see </v>

272
00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:25.231
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can reach you to and reaching you </v>

273
00:12:25.231 --> 00:12:25.231
<v Speaker 3>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

274
00:12:25.231 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 3>they can send you some shitty thing just</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get a arise from you and then they're</v>

275
00:12:28.721 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 3>just making you dance and you're dancing</v>
<v Speaker 3>dancing's to someone else's spell.</v>

276
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to learn how to just look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at yourself and go,</v>

277
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:37.630
<v Speaker 3>does this make sense?</v>

278
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:45.090
<v Speaker 3>And be able to leave it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to be able to do that to </v>

279
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 3>the point where where it's healthy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not beyond.</v>

280
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.560
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At some point,</v>

281
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:52.200
<v Speaker 3>if everybody's going to wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your bug needs to be this.</v>

282
00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:52.880
<v Speaker 3>When it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

283
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.520
<v Speaker 3>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do this,</v>

284
00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:56.190
<v Speaker 3>but you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

285
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the end of the sale,</v>

286
00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 3>the market would tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the market will tell you,</v>

287
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 3>but you're not a dumb guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd never do that.</v>

288
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Never make a book like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was so often out of line.</v>

289
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:09.230
<v Speaker 3>You would look at yourself along the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

290
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 3>I can tell him talking to you for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

291
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:13.600
<v Speaker 3>You're not that Kinda guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the kind of guy that would do that,</v>

292
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's certain people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are functional,</v>

293
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:21.481
<v Speaker 3>crazy and they can like figure some </v>
<v Speaker 3>things out and chase some things down </v>

294
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:26.490
<v Speaker 3>and then they'll get stuck in some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a weird Rut and you can't talk them </v>

295
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:26.490
<v Speaker 3>out of it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize,</v>

296
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.700
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was crazy all the time.</v>

297
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.710
<v Speaker 3>He just figured out how to get through </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

298
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.160
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the ones that will go off on </v>

299
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:35.160
<v Speaker 3>crazy tangents and people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

300
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Because the guy wasn't really nuts in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>

301
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.180
<v Speaker 3>You're not nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

302
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:43.530
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just need to keep people around you to </v>

303
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 3>keep telling you you're not insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

304
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.500
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a good thing that comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>from criticism though,</v>

305
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.740
<v Speaker 3>because it's even really harsh criticism</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because if they're ridiculous and if </v>

306
00:13:55.961 --> 00:14:00.961
<v Speaker 3>you look at what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's ridiculous and mean and it </v>

307
00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:02.260
<v Speaker 3>really reveals far more about them than </v>
<v Speaker 3>it really does about you,</v>

308
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.890
<v Speaker 3>but look at what they're saying and is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there any merit to it at all?</v>

309
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Does it make any sense or is it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense?</v>

310
00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:10.900
<v Speaker 3>It's just a guy being an asshole or if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you weren't,</v>

311
00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:12.670
<v Speaker 3>you could you find merit in it?</v>

312
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Like I've found criticism from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest assholes,</v>

313
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 3>but it was like there was like a hair of</v>
<v Speaker 3>accuracy into it.</v>

314
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.930
<v Speaker 3>It made me reconsider certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

315
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.590
<v Speaker 3>in the most valuable thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

316
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:26.830
<v Speaker 3>it's entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It to some extent is just.</v>

317
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.650
<v Speaker 3>It makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes me more flexible.</v>

318
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

319
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.910
<v Speaker 3>as a thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

320
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 3>if you can wrap your head around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

321
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where am I wrong?</v>

322
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 3>It can make you a little indecisive </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like,</v>

323
00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:38.590
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's right and he's also write this,</v>

324
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.400
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes things are complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

325
00:14:42.401 --> 00:14:43.420
<v Speaker 3>but that's the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

326
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

327
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:46.000
<v Speaker 3>the object of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I keep writing.</v>

328
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing about that now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>present,</v>

329
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 3>being present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're actually present,</v>

330
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.930
<v Speaker 3>you have to be present with yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 3>be president who you're with and that's </v>

331
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 3>the thing that everybody looks to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>avoiding one way or another,</v>

332
00:14:59.330 --> 00:14:59.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether,</v>

333
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:04.961
<v Speaker 3>whether they're doing it cold because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to earn money or they're doing it </v>

334
00:15:04.961 --> 00:15:04.961
<v Speaker 3>because they got to check a device.</v>

335
00:15:04.961 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's the constant assessing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just.</v>

336
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.740
<v Speaker 3>I see so few people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walk into rooms now and I feel like I </v>

337
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 3>don't feel like I'm in a room with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

338
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:17.930
<v Speaker 3>There's no sort of social cohesion in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not really present.</v>

339
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 3>They're each in their own little </v>
<v Speaker 3>segment,</v>

340
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>connected with the internet or friends.</v>

341
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then not connected with,</v>

342
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.180
<v Speaker 3>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

343
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

344
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a net fan.</v>

345
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I've been since the late eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>

346
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:36.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pro bling bling or cyberpunk type </v>

347
00:15:36.731 --> 00:15:36.731
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

348
00:15:36.731 --> 00:15:40.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep feeling like rather than using </v>

349
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.851
<v Speaker 3>these things to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reach out to other people and </v>

350
00:15:42.851 --> 00:15:42.851
<v Speaker 3>connect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

351
00:15:42.851 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Speaker 3>we're using these things for business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've gotten super aggressive,</v>

352
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:49.760
<v Speaker 3>behavior's gotten way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't even think it's our fault.</v>

353
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.820
<v Speaker 3>I honestly think it's in these cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because we're living on this,</v>

354
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:56.220
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

355
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an operating system,</v>

356
00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:02.891
<v Speaker 3>but an economic operating system that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just needs to feed off the net when </v>

357
00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:04.190
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be our space,</v>

358
00:16:04.191 --> 00:16:05.600
<v Speaker 3>not the economy space.</v>

359
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

360
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.960
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we're in a stage of </v>

361
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.400
<v Speaker 1>progression for this interconnectivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>progression where we're starting off </v>

362
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:15.910
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.220
<v Speaker 1>we were starting off with just regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>telephones and that is moved to cellular</v>

364
00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which everybody carries,</v>

365
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.600
<v Speaker 1>which is going to move into some google </v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses type thing which is going to </v>

366
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:25.600
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

367
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 1>down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you extrapolate 100 years or whatever</v>

368
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:34.001
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be some really crazy </v>

369
00:16:34.001 --> 00:16:36.941
<v Speaker 1>interconnectivity that people share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this stage that we're going </v>

370
00:16:36.941 --> 00:16:40.961
<v Speaker 1>through right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anonymous stage of being able to </v>

371
00:16:40.961 --> 00:16:43.991
<v Speaker 1>like make a twitter account or some fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>name and just start saying mean things </v>

372
00:16:43.991 --> 00:16:46.130
<v Speaker 1>to random people like that ability is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go away.</v>

373
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.650
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have this anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 1>portal like I,</v>

374
00:16:49.651 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I just think if you look at the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

375
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the way I look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

376
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like the thing that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>really scarce is secrets.</v>

377
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect with each other in some way that</v>

378
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 1>we probably can't even imagine right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

379
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's some neuro chip or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you embed in your body,</v>

380
00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:12.290
<v Speaker 1>whether it's nanotechnology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

381
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.860
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna come a day where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like completely</v>

382
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.480
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the beauty of that though is if it </v>

383
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.651
<v Speaker 3>really worked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would bring us back to the now that </v>

384
00:17:25.651 --> 00:17:28.441
<v Speaker 3>we've been avoiding all this time with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>face to face live interaction where you </v>

385
00:17:28.441 --> 00:17:30.010
<v Speaker 3>can't fuck with each other because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're here.</v>

386
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.930
<v Speaker 3>You know there's this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange way to look at it.</v>

387
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:34.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met this guy,</v>

388
00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:39.181
<v Speaker 3>this show guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a stage magician guy who could tell </v>

389
00:17:39.181 --> 00:17:42.841
<v Speaker 3>when people are lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever seen this </v>

390
00:17:42.841 --> 00:17:44.701
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like worked for the FBI and stuff </v>

391
00:17:44.701 --> 00:17:44.701
<v Speaker 3>and he can like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does all these tricks.</v>

392
00:17:44.701 --> 00:17:45.190
<v Speaker 3>He lines up 10 people and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

393
00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:48.550
<v Speaker 3>one of you think and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can really tell period when people go</v>

394
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 3>online and I was thinking if he can tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are lying because he's got </v>

395
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.681
<v Speaker 3>this talent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means that on some level we all know </v>

396
00:17:57.681 --> 00:17:57.681
<v Speaker 3>we all have that ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

397
00:17:57.681 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 3>So we all on some level know when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other one's lying to us.</v>

398
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.450
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're actually in the moment,</v>

399
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.300
<v Speaker 3>it's all exposed anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

400
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a weird feeling that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get when someone's being deceptive.</v>

401
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a weird feeling you get where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

402
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Speaker 3>there's a sense of disturbance when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're communicating with them,</v>

403
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 3>you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't put it into tangible.</v>

404
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.060
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

405
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 3>it was x amount of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here I know this is a real thing.</v>

406
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:22.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

407
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:23.790
<v Speaker 3>I'll put it on a scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

408
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.390
<v Speaker 3>but there's some weird thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens when you,</v>

409
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:32.391
<v Speaker 3>when you're with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can tell if someone's upset at </v>

410
00:18:32.391 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 3>you and not saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can be saying all the right words,</v>

411
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 3>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain,</v>

412
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:39.710
<v Speaker 3>there's a coldness or a lack of warmth </v>
<v Speaker 3>or there's a little something I wrote </v>

413
00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 3>about the women in a.</v>

414
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.510
<v Speaker 3>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The housewives of Orange County.</v>

415
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.740
<v Speaker 3>I got obsessed with them because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were just having all of these awful </v>

416
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:51.740
<v Speaker 3>disagreements all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

417
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.090
<v Speaker 3>the communications guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to figure out what,</v>

418
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:58.190
<v Speaker 3>why is there communication breaking down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so this is what I do.</v>

419
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.680
<v Speaker 3>So I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I concluded in the end that is </v>

420
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.091
<v Speaker 3>because they've put so much botox in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their faces that they can't actually </v>

421
00:19:08.091 --> 00:19:12.530
<v Speaker 3>execute facial expressions in an honest </v>
<v Speaker 3>way anymore in a way that the other </v>

422
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.560
<v Speaker 3>person organically can react to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My God.</v>

423
00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:18.561
<v Speaker 3>These women in trying to kind of freeze </v>
<v Speaker 3>time at age 29 ended up making </v>

424
00:19:18.571 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 3>themselves inaccessible to the now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in,</v>

425
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.140
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see one,</v>

426
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.690
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

427
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:25.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

428
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughter,</v>

429
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.170
<v Speaker 3>I think she might have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other one like,</v>

430
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been in a smile.</v>

431
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:32.040
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

432
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.400
<v Speaker 3>So then we go to the first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

433
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I told her my daughter </v>
<v Speaker 3>has cancer.</v>

434
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:39.360
<v Speaker 3>And the other one she says she's sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can tell she's not of.</v>

435
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's just a metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's true.</v>

436
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.600
<v Speaker 3>They're like stuffing cotton in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth and they can't.</v>

437
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:47.190
<v Speaker 3>You can't understand what they're saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

438
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:52.310
<v Speaker 3>They're ruining the facial communication</v>
<v Speaker 3>expressions of facial communication is </v>

439
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.000
<v Speaker 3>we live in the woods shooting poison in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their face to freeze it,</v>

440
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.060
<v Speaker 3>but they're to freeze it in time is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to stop time and that's </v>

441
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:04.260
<v Speaker 3>like A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand the urge to stop time,</v>

442
00:20:04.261 --> 00:20:06.330
<v Speaker 3>but when you stop time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose the moment.</v>

443
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.540
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of the whole point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm making second the net.</v>

444
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.780
<v Speaker 3>It can stop time in a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to lose certain moments</v>

445
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:20.241
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm all for being on the net and </v>

446
00:20:20.241 --> 00:20:21.030
<v Speaker 3>having a net moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

447
00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:21.780
<v Speaker 3>even here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

448
00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:26.781
<v Speaker 3>I've heard you do those ads before for </v>
<v Speaker 3>those sponsors and you could just cut </v>

449
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 3>and paste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

450
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.710
<v Speaker 3>you could cycle seven of them and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>people wouldn't even know.</v>

451
00:20:31.711 --> 00:20:32.730
<v Speaker 3>It's the same ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

452
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.130
<v Speaker 3>you could cut and paste from another </v>
<v Speaker 3>show and throw it in.</v>

453
00:20:35.131 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 3>But you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

454
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:39.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually going to sit here and read </v>
<v Speaker 3>these three ads with my friends.</v>

455
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't do that,</v>

456
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.140
<v Speaker 3>I'd be really bored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never want to just read an ad.</v>

457
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 3>So we always do it that</v>

458
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.590
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've always money you make.</v>

459
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 1>And the model of the industrial age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course is to make print out more.</v>

460
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way we would,</v>

461
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 1>the only way we could even do any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>

462
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:03.630
<v Speaker 1>the way we're doing this because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have anybody that we have to </v>

463
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.630
<v Speaker 1>approve it with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

464
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.140
<v Speaker 1>knowing that I don't have to go to NBC </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

465
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're thinking of doing.</v>

466
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:12.151
<v Speaker 1>I know you have these commercials but </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just going to talk shit and </v>

467
00:21:12.151 --> 00:21:12.151
<v Speaker 1>occasionally we'll get to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the commercial,</v>

468
00:21:12.151 --> 00:21:16.681
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ironically on the long run it ends </v>

469
00:21:16.681 --> 00:21:19.981
<v Speaker 1>up making more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly more money for the people who </v>

470
00:21:19.981 --> 00:21:19.981
<v Speaker 1>are actually doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

471
00:21:19.981 --> 00:21:21.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe by the other system you can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>more total money,</v>

472
00:21:21.761 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

473
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.060
<v Speaker 1>God knows what does that mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution.</v>

474
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

475
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:31.490
<v Speaker 1>so the fact that it is that it is live </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is a what an MP3.</v>

476
00:21:31.721 --> 00:21:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Mainly it is mainly a podcast you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the first hand,</v>

477
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:39.460
<v Speaker 1>because I'm looking to do make her kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of radio choice myself and it's like,</v>

478
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 1>well I can do this for the man and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>this amount of money kind of guaranteed,</v>

479
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to have to stay between </v>
<v Speaker 1>these site lines and I can go to this </v>

480
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.200
<v Speaker 1>other road and actually do the thing I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

481
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not even a choice.</v>

482
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.050
<v Speaker 1>They're not in this day and age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily,</v>

483
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.630
<v Speaker 1>it's they used to be a time where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to choose,</v>

484
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this internet thing,</v>

485
00:22:01.061 --> 00:22:04.140
<v Speaker 1>who knows if it's gonna work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's crazy like you,</v>

486
00:22:04.141 --> 00:22:09.141
<v Speaker 1>you have an option to immediately jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and get a gigantic group of people </v>

487
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:12.160
<v Speaker 1>that are going to start retweaking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting and listening to your stuff and</v>

488
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:17.161
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll develop a giant following in no </v>

489
00:22:17.161 --> 00:22:17.161
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

490
00:22:17.161 --> 00:22:20.190
<v Speaker 1>And as that's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you're doing is you're selling ads </v>

491
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.320
<v Speaker 1>for companies that you actually believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

492
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.400
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could.</v>

493
00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.210
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way you should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck working for some company that tells</v>

494
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:29.200
<v Speaker 1>you not to swear or not to do this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to discuss that or you know,</v>

495
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:32.440
<v Speaker 1>that's not the stance we're taking on is</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly complicated issue.</v>

496
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

497
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the enemy of real thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The enemy of real thought,</v>

498
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 1>his committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

500
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Everything you say has to go through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>committee before it comes out of your </v>

501
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.001
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what the fuck you're </v>

502
00:22:51.001 --> 00:22:51.001
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

503
00:22:51.001 --> 00:22:51.580
<v Speaker 1>and especially in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sense of a radio show,</v>

504
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy on the radio,</v>

505
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:55.600
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be like,</v>

506
00:22:55.601 --> 00:22:57.520
<v Speaker 1>even Djs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to be,</v>

507
00:22:57.521 --> 00:23:02.521
<v Speaker 1>this Dj likes this music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this sauce or broadcasting from the </v>

508
00:23:02.521 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 1>same city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that urn,</v>

509
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.940
<v Speaker 1>that clear channel took over and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

510
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.280
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting a recording that's done by</v>

511
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:11.500
<v Speaker 1>computer miles away.</v>

512
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.210
<v Speaker 1>This is my local rock and roll stations </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes Jack Fms,</v>

513
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:19.390
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially like playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>shuffle when you're on your ipad.</v>

514
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

515
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:25.020
<v Speaker 1>it could be anything of a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they approve and they </v>

516
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:25.900
<v Speaker 1>pretend we're wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't have any rules.</v>

517
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

518
00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:30.070
<v Speaker 1>we're Jack FM and that's like a standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

519
00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:35.071
<v Speaker 1>There's like 100 Jack's across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and probably even more than </v>

520
00:23:35.071 --> 00:23:35.071
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

521
00:23:35.071 --> 00:23:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I think radio's completely on its way </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

522
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I think they're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's like a,</v>

523
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:44.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a silly way to do it and no one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to stick with it after a while.</v>

524
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Like why you're going to have Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>access in your car within no time.</v>

525
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>

526
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:54.791
<v Speaker 1>They could do that right now I already </v>
<v Speaker 1>get that with podcasts on the iphone </v>

527
00:23:54.791 --> 00:23:56.180
<v Speaker 1>because I have my iphone bluetooth to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

528
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.340
<v Speaker 1>so I'll just immediately say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

529
00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to listen to a Duncan trussell </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and inner.</v>

530
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I've done it at a red light where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so easy at a red light.</v>

531
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:06.840
<v Speaker 1>It's one to Dunkin donuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

532
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.700
<v Speaker 1>There is the one aspect of radio that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like I would miss.</v>

533
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Is that local terrestrial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality of it,</v>

534
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

535
00:24:14.691 --> 00:24:15.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could still have,</v>

536
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

537
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.600
<v Speaker 1>you can have an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a la channel and I could have a,</v>

538
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:25.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this part in New York channel and you </v>

539
00:24:25.601 --> 00:24:28.591
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could do that technically with </v>

540
00:24:28.591 --> 00:24:28.591
<v Speaker 1>digital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

541
00:24:28.591 --> 00:24:29.660
<v Speaker 1>where you'd pick your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your so called regional thing.</v>

542
00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:34.661
<v Speaker 1>It'll be local stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the medium is not biased towards </v>

543
00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:34.661
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The medium is,</v>

544
00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:35.870
<v Speaker 1>it's all equivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

545
00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 1>and I wonder would we drift further away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

546
00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.860
<v Speaker 1>from local and kind of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter to us in the here and now or um,</v>

547
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will we choose that stuff?</v>

548
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:24:51.471 --> 00:24:56.471
<v Speaker 1>instead of like a local radio station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a million people in</v>

550
00:24:57.411 --> 00:25:00.770
<v Speaker 1>la making their own music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making their own,</v>

551
00:25:00.771 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 1>putting their own shit out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can choose from,</v>

552
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a music list,</v>

553
00:25:05.361 --> 00:25:10.361
<v Speaker 1>like a Pandora list or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone puts together or whether </v>

554
00:25:10.361 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 1>it's podcasting.</v>

555
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I just think the idea of a local </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative was always gross and it </v>

556
00:25:15.711 --> 00:25:20.711
<v Speaker 1>was always grows wolf man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack was always gross because for every </v>

557
00:25:20.711 --> 00:25:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Wolf Man Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a million other dudes.</v>

558
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:24.200
<v Speaker 1>It probably had interesting ideas as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well and they had no outlet.</v>

559
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.190
<v Speaker 1>So you have one guy has this outlet from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular time.</v>

560
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.480
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy that that idea sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The I,</v>

561
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.980
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we're dealing with now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>way better.</v>

562
00:25:33.981 --> 00:25:37.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like a billion outlet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>6 billion outlets and,</v>

563
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:42.780
<v Speaker 1>and there's no local anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are in that town </v>

564
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.121
<v Speaker 1>that'll tell you about things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone's more connected than ever </v>

565
00:25:46.121 --> 00:25:47.240
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because they are,</v>

566
00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean the economy as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also has to go away to,</v>

567
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're 26 billion people doing </v>

568
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:55.800
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

569
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:55.810
<v Speaker 1>you've got 2 billion left doing farming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

570
00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:01.120
<v Speaker 1>did all the businesses go and you also </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose those iconic figures like the wolf </v>

571
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.590
<v Speaker 1>man Jack or like Howard stern or like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mate?</v>

572
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

573
00:26:05.181 --> 00:26:10.181
<v Speaker 1>I think you could still choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would just have major every once in </v>

574
00:26:10.181 --> 00:26:11.340
<v Speaker 1>a while something major would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

575
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.270
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be,</v>

576
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.990
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be that one guy who's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>town's Guy.</v>

577
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I grew up in Boston,</v>

578
00:26:16.851 --> 00:26:19.340
<v Speaker 1>it was Charles Laquidara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Laquidara.</v>

579
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:23.210
<v Speaker 1>And the big mattress was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would call this morning show.</v>

580
00:26:23.211 --> 00:26:25.400
<v Speaker 1>It's called the big mattress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a great guy.</v>

581
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Lockwood era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really Nice Guy.</v>

582
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Met Him to eventually put he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

583
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:29.670
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

584
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.140
<v Speaker 1>he was like the number one radio DJ in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston.</v>

585
00:26:33.141 --> 00:26:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would go to,</v>

586
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.710
<v Speaker 1>when I was doing construction and go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>job sites,</v>

587
00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:38.600
<v Speaker 1>people would turn up or turn on the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>mattress,</v>

588
00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:41.190
<v Speaker 1>listen to Lockwood era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

589
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.530
<v Speaker 1>that was a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like that was shell.</v>

590
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And the only</v>

591
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 3>way to get a show like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

592
00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 3>and not have a lot of options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

593
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 3>to have a show that everybody agrees </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all gonna listen to,</v>

594
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of the only like three </v>

595
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:55.700
<v Speaker 3>options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No disco,</v>

596
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:55.720
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not listening to this go,</v>

597
00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:00.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't like the Internet quality </v>

598
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:00.900
<v Speaker 3>options that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

599
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.780
<v Speaker 3>that changes the whole game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's never going to be a CBS </v>

600
00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.290
<v Speaker 3>radio on the Internet and it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will.</v>

601
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 3>And it's going to replace everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrestrial,</v>

602
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean on every sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're saying,</v>

603
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.280
<v Speaker 3>we're saying everything's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>replaced,</v>

604
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.740
<v Speaker 3>everything terrestrials going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>replaced first it's radio,</v>

605
00:27:16.741 --> 00:27:21.741
<v Speaker 3>then it's other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All we have to make sure then is before </v>

606
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:26.781
<v Speaker 3>we lose all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we're going to inevitably lose to </v>

607
00:27:26.781 --> 00:27:26.781
<v Speaker 3>say to ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

608
00:27:26.781 --> 00:27:31.560
<v Speaker 3>what is it we value about those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we want to bring into these digital</v>

609
00:27:31.561 --> 00:27:34.440
<v Speaker 3>things before we're untethered in there.</v>

610
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before it's all the way.</v>

611
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we want our cake and we want to eat</v>

612
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:42.861
<v Speaker 3>it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want the digital era and we still </v>

613
00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:45.171
<v Speaker 3>want mom and pop stores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to like keep it all </v>

614
00:27:45.171 --> 00:27:48.531
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the question is can you get </v>

615
00:27:48.531 --> 00:27:48.531
<v Speaker 3>both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

616
00:27:48.531 --> 00:27:48.531
<v Speaker 3>so can you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

617
00:27:48.531 --> 00:27:52.730
<v Speaker 3>very traditional narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20th century industrial age culture live</v>

618
00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 3>right aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

619
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:59.961
<v Speaker 3>this sort of steady state economy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>peer to peer currencies and local CSA as</v>

620
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:06.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we have an iphone and organic chard </v>

621
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.510
<v Speaker 3>and no slavery in Africa to get either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

622
00:28:09.511 --> 00:28:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Is that possible open?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we moved towards it or not,</v>

623
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:19.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like that's what a great </v>

624
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.130
<v Speaker 3>percentage of the world would like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

625
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:23.580
<v Speaker 3>we've made shackling little progress and</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving towards that potentially utopia.</v>

626
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>

627
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.870
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as we got a hope or try to </v>

628
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.450
<v Speaker 3>envision that would say okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

629
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:36.590
<v Speaker 3>but this shift that we're undergoing now</v>
<v Speaker 3>from an analog era to a digital one is a</v>

630
00:28:38.221 --> 00:28:43.221
<v Speaker 3>bigger shift than just than just that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole different digital media </v>

631
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:44.700
<v Speaker 3>environment that we've gone into.</v>

632
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:49.910
<v Speaker 3>So we've gone into this from this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This time is money expansionist economy </v>

633
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:55.850
<v Speaker 3>live by the clock universe to one that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially asynchronous.</v>

634
00:28:56.521 --> 00:29:00.540
<v Speaker 3>That's just off that off that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when the net first came up,</v>

635
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:01.660
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

636
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in Austin and slackers and cyber </v>

637
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.861
<v Speaker 3>punks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea was that the net was going to </v>

638
00:29:09.861 --> 00:29:09.861
<v Speaker 3>give us more slack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

639
00:29:09.861 --> 00:29:14.210
<v Speaker 3>and it's ended up for most people kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of doing the opposite because they're </v>

640
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.420
<v Speaker 3>always on and working and being </v>
<v Speaker 3>monitored and all that and distracted.</v>

641
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.250
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if we,</v>

642
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.900
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

643
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.250
<v Speaker 3>take command of the way we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>programming these things,</v>

644
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 3>then we can use them to sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to create,</v>

645
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gorgeous culture,</v>

646
00:29:28.051 --> 00:29:29.840
<v Speaker 3>slack to create,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

647
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:35.120
<v Speaker 3>what a few of us are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are kind of discovering we can do like </v>

648
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.120
<v Speaker 3>you're doing with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

649
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.690
<v Speaker 3>You're just doing your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

650
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:41.810
<v Speaker 3>I think we're trying to resist the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inevitable and that inevitable is the </v>

651
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:46.761
<v Speaker 3>symbiotic computer relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be some sort of bio </v>

652
00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:52.270
<v Speaker 3>mechanical connections as when men </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to another man with that funds </v>

653
00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:57.770
<v Speaker 3>to a million people listening in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>car or wherever the fuck they are </v>

654
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:01.580
<v Speaker 3>asynchronous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't feel like we can stop </v>

655
00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.191
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the things that we got so </v>

656
00:30:05.191 --> 00:30:07.831
<v Speaker 3>excited by as as these higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>functioning primates are these new </v>

657
00:30:07.831 --> 00:30:12.301
<v Speaker 3>things that we've created that input us </v>
<v Speaker 3>or give us input in a way that our </v>

658
00:30:12.301 --> 00:30:16.470
<v Speaker 3>bodies completely not designed to to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>like through your ear phones,</v>

659
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.560
<v Speaker 3>like like listening to a podcast like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the computer itself,</v>

660
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.620
<v Speaker 3>the ability to watch a video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to go to the movies.</v>

661
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:26.260
<v Speaker 3>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the stimuli that's coming at us.</v>

662
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:28.420
<v Speaker 3>It's just we're not designed for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

663
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:33.430
<v Speaker 3>But it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's reconfiguring itself to be as </v>

664
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.430
<v Speaker 3>seductive as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

665
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.330
<v Speaker 3>because it's not what it's for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

666
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:40.350
<v Speaker 3>It's to seduce us into itself so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the companies behind it can make money </v>

667
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.340
<v Speaker 3>and because we moved constantly in to in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a path of progression,</v>

668
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.520
<v Speaker 3>and if you look at the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always going to move into a </v>

669
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.661
<v Speaker 3>stronger grip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were never satisfied with any </v>

670
00:30:54.661 --> 00:30:54.661
<v Speaker 3>particular result at any particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

671
00:30:54.661 --> 00:30:55.670
<v Speaker 3>More choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

672
00:30:55.671 --> 00:30:58.540
<v Speaker 3>We want more choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want it to be powerful more fast.</v>

673
00:30:58.541 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 3>We want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want better graphics,</v>

674
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:02.620
<v Speaker 3>we want bigger boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not realistic enough.</v>

675
00:31:02.621 --> 00:31:04.190
<v Speaker 3>Let's take it to the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

676
00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:09.220
<v Speaker 3>it's in this desire to get these </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences were pushing the technology.</v>

677
00:31:09.221 --> 00:31:14.221
<v Speaker 3>Like ultimately that's what's getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting to me about that is </v>

678
00:31:14.221 --> 00:31:18.060
<v Speaker 3>while all that's pushing ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we get in a digital media </v>

679
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.661
<v Speaker 3>environment is we ended up retrieving </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird medieval values.</v>

680
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:27.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get burning man and etsy and people </v>

681
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 3>doing peer to peer stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to have their local currencies,</v>

682
00:31:28.721 --> 00:31:31.300
<v Speaker 3>which they haven't had since medieval </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

683
00:31:31.301 --> 00:31:36.301
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the stuff that gets her </v>

684
00:31:36.301 --> 00:31:36.301
<v Speaker 3>treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paganism,</v>

685
00:31:36.301 --> 00:31:37.020
<v Speaker 3>men and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

686
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.140
<v Speaker 3>mashing up a route to heal yourself of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

687
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:45.180
<v Speaker 3>maker culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these things are what we've lost </v>

688
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.751
<v Speaker 3>over the last thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the renaissance and the </v>

689
00:31:48.751 --> 00:31:48.751
<v Speaker 3>industrial age was about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

690
00:31:48.751 --> 00:31:50.110
<v Speaker 3>stamping that out and putting everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

691
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:53.920
<v Speaker 3>on the assembly line at Ford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's fun that as we move forward,</v>

692
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.790
<v Speaker 3>we get these great old recurrences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which to me is reassuring.</v>

693
00:31:57.791 --> 00:32:00.930
<v Speaker 3>It means that we are bringing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>with us into,</v>

694
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:06.050
<v Speaker 3>into this next place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also that the current </v>

695
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:09.451
<v Speaker 3>system is so flawed that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to try anything and that they're</v>

696
00:32:10.331 --> 00:32:14.140
<v Speaker 3>actually actively thinking about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>can we do differently?</v>

697
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.450
<v Speaker 3>Can we make a local local currency?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to know him,</v>

698
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.500
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting because like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>two places I've gotten emails from him </v>

699
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.160
<v Speaker 3>the last many years of people doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>social currency,</v>

700
00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:25.800
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either from a place like Ithaca,</v>

701
00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.970
<v Speaker 3>New York where they're doing it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

702
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange and trying to try something </v>

703
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.921
<v Speaker 3>weird and good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or like Lansing Michigan where there's </v>

704
00:32:34.921 --> 00:32:38.131
<v Speaker 3>no GM plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no bank that's going to give </v>

705
00:32:38.131 --> 00:32:38.890
<v Speaker 3>money to a factory to open up to hire </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and they're desperate.</v>

706
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.770
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

707
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 3>I've got skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how to fix a fridgerator and they</v>

708
00:32:42.531 --> 00:32:47.531
<v Speaker 3>have needs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so can't we just make an economy that </v>

709
00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:47.531
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

710
00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:48.850
<v Speaker 3>those are the places where people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually asking the,</v>

711
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.290
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the where they're ready.</v>

712
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I just don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Readiness seems to involve being just so</v>

713
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm not just fed up but uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

714
00:32:58.701 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 3>that you've got to do something.</v>

715
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're clearly going through change.</v>

716
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:09.690
<v Speaker 3>We're clearly going through a change as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a culture that we weren't prepared for </v>

717
00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:13.121
<v Speaker 3>and we're sort of making our way as we </v>
<v Speaker 3>go along and there's a lot of mistakes </v>

718
00:33:14.121 --> 00:33:16.880
<v Speaker 3>along the way and the evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 3>points to it.</v>

719
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.060
<v Speaker 3>One of the best pieces as your story </v>
<v Speaker 3>about people getting upset at you </v>

720
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 3>because you got mugged and called in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>story and said the location.</v>

721
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:29.390
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the best examples of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like losing the script like along</v>

722
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:34.391
<v Speaker 3>the way in this crazy thing that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing where we developed currency and </v>

723
00:33:34.391 --> 00:33:39.280
<v Speaker 3>and then there's things called property </v>
<v Speaker 3>values and those mortgages and equity </v>

724
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.970
<v Speaker 3>and all this crazy shit along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

725
00:33:40.971 --> 00:33:42.610
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

726
00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:46.190
<v Speaker 3>how to stay human and when you see like </v>
<v Speaker 3>instant failure,</v>

727
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.240
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

728
00:33:47.241 --> 00:33:47.840
<v Speaker 3>I got mugged.</v>

729
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.950
<v Speaker 3>You fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you?</v>

730
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Why'd you say the place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

731
00:33:51.141 --> 00:33:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I made it in every single one of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>books and I've written like 12 now.</v>

732
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

733
00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.500
<v Speaker 3>they're all finally about how do we </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring humanity into this thing that </v>

734
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.380
<v Speaker 3>seems to have lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did it for,</v>

735
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:03.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

736
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 3>for business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it for,</v>

737
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:11.051
<v Speaker 3>for the economy with Life Inc is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>book you're talking about did it for </v>

738
00:34:11.051 --> 00:34:11.660
<v Speaker 3>Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something called nothing sacred.</v>

739
00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:13.610
<v Speaker 3>St Judaism should be this ongoing </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

740
00:34:13.611 --> 00:34:14.990
<v Speaker 3>Keep it alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep it human,</v>

741
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.810
<v Speaker 3>don't let it lock down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now this one,</v>

742
00:34:17.811 --> 00:34:22.811
<v Speaker 3>it's weird because it's like I'm kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>admitting that it's what I guess I'm </v>

743
00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:22.970
<v Speaker 3>realized it myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm kind of saying,</v>

744
00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:24.290
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a humanist.</v>

745
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.520
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a humanist and a technology </v>

746
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.771
<v Speaker 3>enthusiast hadn't how do you be both </v>
<v Speaker 3>because so many of the other folks who </v>

747
00:34:32.771 --> 00:34:35.420
<v Speaker 3>are sort of pro technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of my posse and they're all sort of</v>

748
00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:40.421
<v Speaker 3>talking about not human beings being </v>
<v Speaker 3>enabled by technology but technology </v>

749
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.030
<v Speaker 3>surpassing us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

750
00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:46.340
<v Speaker 3>some singularity or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

751
00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:51.370
<v Speaker 3>some moment in the future where </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers get smarter than us and then </v>

752
00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:51.890
<v Speaker 3>we're not really needed anymore.</v>

753
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.750
<v Speaker 3>It might not be that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

754
00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.520
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about it a lot lately</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things I think is why do </v>

755
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.851
<v Speaker 3>we have this idea of competition and why</v>
<v Speaker 3>would the computer enjoy that idea with </v>

756
00:35:03.851 --> 00:35:08.531
<v Speaker 3>us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our idea is based entirely on our </v>

757
00:35:08.531 --> 00:35:11.231
<v Speaker 3>biological makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our need to reproduce or need to prove </v>

758
00:35:11.231 --> 00:35:12.320
<v Speaker 3>ourselves to our mate or need to protect</v>
<v Speaker 3>against strangers.</v>

759
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.800
<v Speaker 3>All these instincts that a computer's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to have at home.</v>

760
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 3>So the idea of competition with humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>for resources or the even the idea that </v>

761
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 3>survival is imperative and that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

762
00:35:24.951 --> 00:35:25.360
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

763
00:35:25.361 --> 00:35:28.070
<v Speaker 3>you have an ego and you can't die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to have any of that.</v>

764
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.470
<v Speaker 3>So why would they be in competition with</v>
<v Speaker 3>us?</v>

765
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:34.910
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't it just be like any new?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be because of them.</v>

766
00:35:34.911 --> 00:35:37.290
<v Speaker 3>It'd be because of the program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The program</v>

767
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 1>though that that's really wouldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad thing.</v>

768
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why not keep us around,</v>

769
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.960
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even not.</v>

770
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:50.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not a matter of them being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that because I don't even think they </v>

771
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they can.</v>

772
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.400
<v Speaker 1>It's more a matter of people in the here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now saying that human beings are </v>

773
00:35:56.131 --> 00:36:01.131
<v Speaker 1>really only important insofar as we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the shepherds and organizers of </v>

774
00:36:01.131 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Information is the thing that's evolving</v>

775
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:08.100
<v Speaker 1>towards greater states of complexity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>once human beings are no longer the best</v>

776
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>at making complex information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but computers are the best at it,</v>

777
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.880
<v Speaker 1>then there's just no need for humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore with the computers kill us or </v>

778
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.421
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they give us a good </v>

779
00:36:20.421 --> 00:36:20.421
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

780
00:36:20.421 --> 00:36:20.421
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

781
00:36:20.421 --> 00:36:23.580
<v Speaker 1>just the whole idea that we should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing technology with this in mind.</v>

782
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno it,</v>

783
00:36:25.991 --> 00:36:29.220
<v Speaker 1>it negates what I think is an essential </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us anyway,</v>

784
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:34.280
<v Speaker 1>centrality of humanity in the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I think people don't recognize how</v>

785
00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:41.211
<v Speaker 1>much we need each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't recognize how important </v>

786
00:36:41.211 --> 00:36:45.771
<v Speaker 1>positive interaction is with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to your health and the way you </v>

787
00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:49.131
<v Speaker 1>feel about life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's clearly a relationship that </v>

788
00:36:49.131 --> 00:36:53.991
<v Speaker 1>people have to each other that were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>denial about the lock ourselves up in </v>

789
00:36:53.991 --> 00:36:58.071
<v Speaker 1>our apartments or our homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we shut our car doors and we rolled </v>

790
00:36:58.071 --> 00:37:01.431
<v Speaker 1>down the window and that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why people are willing to give </v>

791
00:37:01.431 --> 00:37:01.431
<v Speaker 1>people the finger when they're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

792
00:37:01.431 --> 00:37:05.241
<v Speaker 1>He would never do that in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're in some sort of a </v>

793
00:37:05.241 --> 00:37:05.440
<v Speaker 1>contained world and even though you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even anonymous,</v>

794
00:37:05.441 --> 00:37:06.840
<v Speaker 1>who still like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

795
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you know how many people do give the fan</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real life?</v>

796
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once a year I'll give somebody the </v>

797
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.941
<v Speaker 1>finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody does something crazy and they </v>

798
00:37:16.941 --> 00:37:16.941
<v Speaker 1>beep at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

799
00:37:16.941 --> 00:37:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

800
00:37:16.981 --> 00:37:21.981
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know that eventually I think we </v>

801
00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:28.551
<v Speaker 1>have to accept the fact that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>only happy when the people around us are</v>

802
00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:34.341
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're in harmony with the people </v>

803
00:37:34.341 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 1>around us were not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we're in conflict,</v>

804
00:37:34.561 --> 00:37:35.580
<v Speaker 1>we're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

805
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.230
<v Speaker 1>when we're not happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we fuck people over.</v>

806
00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Like I know people that have done bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in business and bad things </v>

807
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:43.260
<v Speaker 1>ethically and bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

808
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.890
<v Speaker 1>And they're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

809
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But then in the current culture they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>compensate for that with medicine.</v>

810
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Say that type of presence that gets them</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the night,</v>

811
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:54.810
<v Speaker 1>like you have to hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

812
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I always do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to vain hope.</v>

813
00:37:56.821 --> 00:38:00.300
<v Speaker 1>I hope that the people who do bad stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>but then make up for it with drugs still</v>

814
00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:01.440
<v Speaker 1>feel worse than I do.</v>

815
00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Not taking those drugs and trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>good stuff and you don't want to believe</v>

816
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:06.960
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

817
00:38:06.961 --> 00:38:09.170
<v Speaker 1>these kind of guys I used to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

818
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I won't even say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those millionaires down at Knicks</v>

819
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Games and I had always think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sure hope he's not happy.</v>

820
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:18.450
<v Speaker 1>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't very fair.</v>

821
00:38:18.451 --> 00:38:23.451
<v Speaker 1>But a while hold he's doing is playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>some really crazy game that was around </v>

822
00:38:23.451 --> 00:38:27.261
<v Speaker 1>before he was ever born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just got into it and got really good </v>

823
00:38:27.261 --> 00:38:27.261
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game itself,</v>

824
00:38:27.261 --> 00:38:30.090
<v Speaker 1>it's bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the stock market itself.</v>

825
00:38:30.091 --> 00:38:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Just the idea that the wealth of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

826
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>of a person can vary day by</v>

827
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 3>day because of confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

828
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.580
<v Speaker 3>confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer,</v>

829
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.500
<v Speaker 3>consumer confidence in a product can </v>
<v Speaker 3>shift and change with recall.</v>

830
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 3>And then watching these numbers go up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and down like what the fuck are you even</v>

831
00:38:48.731 --> 00:38:51.220
<v Speaker 3>talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the explanations you see,</v>

832
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:56.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched these business sites and the </v>

833
00:38:56.221 --> 00:38:56.221
<v Speaker 3>market will go down and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh mark it down because of such and such</v>

834
00:38:56.221 --> 00:38:57.070
<v Speaker 3>in London.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like,</v>

835
00:38:57.071 --> 00:39:02.071
<v Speaker 3>by the time that piece comes out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>markets actually back up and they're </v>

836
00:39:02.071 --> 00:39:02.071
<v Speaker 3>already constructing their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

837
00:39:02.071 --> 00:39:04.330
<v Speaker 3>let's tie market going back up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>another random feature.</v>

838
00:39:04.331 --> 00:39:05.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the,</v>

839
00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:10.231
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the explanations after the fact to have </v>

840
00:39:10.231 --> 00:39:12.931
<v Speaker 3>so little to do with whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some algorithm decided it was going to </v>

841
00:39:12.931 --> 00:39:15.580
<v Speaker 3>suddenly ultra fast trade something and </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw the stock up.</v>

842
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like at this point it's,</v>

843
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 3>it truly is.</v>

844
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:23.060
<v Speaker 3>That's the best place to see humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>combating machines on the market where </v>

845
00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:27.061
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's human traders </v>
<v Speaker 3>competing with these programmed </v>

846
00:39:27.061 --> 00:39:28.270
<v Speaker 3>algorithms and the algorithms are </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly winning the war.</v>

847
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.520
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at their screens while </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

848
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 3>while they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is almost like code.</v>

849
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.260
<v Speaker 3>Like the average person who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand it,</v>

850
00:39:35.261 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know what the fuck the stock </v>
<v Speaker 3>market saying the symbols.</v>

851
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:39.370
<v Speaker 3>And the essay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

852
00:39:39.371 --> 00:39:41.230
<v Speaker 3>and this and that and the ones and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zeros.</v>

853
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.270
<v Speaker 3>You look at all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no idea what that is.</v>

854
00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:48.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is that really different than a </v>

855
00:39:48.271 --> 00:39:48.271
<v Speaker 3>computer code that you're reading me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's essentially like a,</v>

856
00:39:48.271 --> 00:39:49.630
<v Speaker 3>a way that people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

857
00:39:49.631 --> 00:39:50.020
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

858
00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:55.060
<v Speaker 3>are tapping into this bizarre system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was at one time the sort of </v>

859
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.030
<v Speaker 3>the price of something had to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some thing.</v>

860
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a factory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh it's factory went slower today in the</v>

861
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:01.630
<v Speaker 3>rain.</v>

862
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.150
<v Speaker 3>The market will go down on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like real,</v>

863
00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:09.340
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's gotten certainly </v>

864
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.730
<v Speaker 3>further and further from whatever is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in that company or their </v>

865
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:12.640
<v Speaker 3>earnings are the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

866
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:17.641
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely abstracted to the point </v>

867
00:40:17.641 --> 00:40:17.641
<v Speaker 3>now where people don't even invest in </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>

868
00:40:17.641 --> 00:40:22.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You invest in something like when </v>

869
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.001
<v Speaker 3>facebook went public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people bought it at like nine in the </v>

870
00:40:24.001 --> 00:40:24.001
<v Speaker 3>morning at like nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>

871
00:40:24.001 --> 00:40:25.030
<v Speaker 3>They're all pissed off that it hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone up.</v>

872
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:26.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

873
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:29.770
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to my well my wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

874
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:30.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

875
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.520
<v Speaker 3>You don't make money on the trade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to make money on when </v>

876
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:35.520
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you've done it,</v>

877
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.580
<v Speaker 3>but now we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

878
00:40:36.581 --> 00:40:41.581
<v Speaker 3>derivatives and derivatives of </v>
<v Speaker 3>derivatives and derivatives of </v>

879
00:40:41.581 --> 00:40:41.581
<v Speaker 3>derivatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of derivatives on there,</v>

880
00:40:41.581 --> 00:40:43.660
<v Speaker 3>which is just a way of kind of shrinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

881
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Explain that for people don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>that means.</v>

882
00:40:46.081 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 3>So if you buy a stock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

883
00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:52.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you buy stock and hope it goes up and </v>

884
00:40:52.801 --> 00:40:54.661
<v Speaker 3>then you sell it in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you'd rather make up that time right </v>

885
00:40:54.661 --> 00:40:56.380
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can sell it in the future right now,</v>

886
00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:01.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can basically sell that future sale </v>

887
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.080
<v Speaker 3>because I think that sales is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a good one now.</v>

888
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can say,</v>

889
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:04.990
<v Speaker 3>what if I did that trait?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna,</v>

890
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna have it now,</v>

891
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.030
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

892
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.350
<v Speaker 3>one of I trading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm trading.</v>

893
00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:18.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm trading on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on an abstraction from what something's </v>

894
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:18.380
<v Speaker 3>going to be worse at some moment in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

895
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:23.630
<v Speaker 3>So it's like I'm trading on the stock </v>
<v Speaker 3>over time and then someone else will </v>

896
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.630
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

897
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to trade on the abstraction of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

898
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:28.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to trade on whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>people think the stock in the future is </v>

899
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:29.700
<v Speaker 3>going to be worth more next minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then this minute it's like,</v>

900
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.780
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>

901
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 3>So basically what you're doing is you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>buying stock over time,</v>

902
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 3>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over time.</v>

903
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're creating these things,</v>

904
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:41.510
<v Speaker 3>these derivatives of whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>original investment was,</v>

905
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.120
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of just a derivative of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing,</v>

906
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the pork belly,</v>

907
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:46.940
<v Speaker 3>this derivative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pork belly derivatives,</v>

908
00:41:46.941 --> 00:41:48.860
<v Speaker 3>and the derivatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Derivatives of derivatives,</v>

909
00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:50.210
<v Speaker 3>of the derivatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the derivatives,</v>

910
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:55.450
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all ever tighter ways of saying what is </v>

911
00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:55.450
<v Speaker 3>pork belly going to be worth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

912
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 3>on February third,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that legal?</v>

913
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's legal because what it.</v>

914
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Because the economy requires it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

915
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Speaker 3>We have a kind of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

916
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:09.761
<v Speaker 3>That has a clock in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's lent into existence and has to be </v>

917
00:42:09.761 --> 00:42:13.121
<v Speaker 3>paid back more than got lent out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our economy needs to expand by hook </v>

918
00:42:13.641 --> 00:42:18.641
<v Speaker 3>or by Crook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somehow it has to grow in order for it </v>

919
00:42:18.641 --> 00:42:21.521
<v Speaker 3>to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way central currency </v>

920
00:42:21.521 --> 00:42:24.041
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need to find more surface area for </v>

921
00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.550
<v Speaker 3>the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More ways for people to buy stuff.</v>

922
00:42:25.551 --> 00:42:28.610
<v Speaker 3>So instead of just having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough of a company to buy,</v>

923
00:42:28.611 --> 00:42:32.990
<v Speaker 3>so now we can bet on how that company's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do in some future date.</v>

924
00:42:32.991 --> 00:42:34.820
<v Speaker 3>We can bid on that or we can bet on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

925
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what we're really doing is trying to</v>

926
00:42:37.011 --> 00:42:42.011
<v Speaker 3>kind of compress all of this time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right onto like the head of a pin so we </v>

927
00:42:42.011 --> 00:42:42.290
<v Speaker 3>can bet on that.</v>

928
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.300
<v Speaker 3>So I don't have to sit and wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

929
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:49.301
<v Speaker 3>3000 years for facebook to be worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>something I can trade on his future </v>

930
00:42:49.301 --> 00:42:52.010
<v Speaker 3>worth now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the whole joke of that is people who</v>

931
00:42:52.011 --> 00:42:57.011
<v Speaker 3>are trading that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are these computers that are </v>

932
00:42:57.011 --> 00:42:57.011
<v Speaker 3>trading faster than them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I put in one of my super fast,</v>

933
00:42:57.011 --> 00:42:57.890
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

934
00:42:57.891 --> 00:42:59.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>derivative trade.</v>

935
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:02.960
<v Speaker 3>Goldman Sachs sees that order coming in </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the computer.</v>

936
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 3>They're so close to the exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can execute an order before my </v>

937
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.731
<v Speaker 3>order even goes through based on having </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen that I was going to do what I'm </v>

938
00:43:12.731 --> 00:43:16.331
<v Speaker 3>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they can literally trade in my </v>

939
00:43:16.331 --> 00:43:16.331
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

940
00:43:16.331 --> 00:43:17.740
<v Speaker 3>I am in their past though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

941
00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.110
<v Speaker 3>that's digital time shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like it's cheating.</v>

942
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.280
<v Speaker 3>That's like someone running a quick </v>
<v Speaker 3>server and they're local and then you </v>

943
00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.890
<v Speaker 3>have like 150 paying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

944
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.910
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit.</v>

945
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.690
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be so bullshit.</v>

946
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.890
<v Speaker 3>The irony of it is it's gotten so big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

947
00:43:33.891 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 3>Derivative trading is bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular trading,</v>

948
00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.640
<v Speaker 3>so the New York Stock Exchange actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>just got bought.</v>

949
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.450
<v Speaker 3>The exchange itself got bought by its </v>
<v Speaker 3>derivative exchange,</v>

950
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:47.360
<v Speaker 3>so it's almost just like the proof's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pudding.</v>

951
00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:50.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like the derivative owns the market</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this point,</v>

952
00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:56.080
<v Speaker 3>but that's allowed that how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could the government even ever deny </v>

953
00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.150
<v Speaker 3>how incompetent they are when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed that,</v>

954
00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:04.410
<v Speaker 3>like that alone to like someone should </v>
<v Speaker 3>just have a broadcast on national </v>

955
00:44:04.911 --> 00:44:09.911
<v Speaker 3>television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a one of those town hall sort of events </v>

956
00:44:09.911 --> 00:44:11.990
<v Speaker 3>where you sit down with the main people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that run the country and go,</v>

957
00:44:11.991 --> 00:44:13.880
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck are you allowing this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>

958
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:14.900
<v Speaker 3>How will you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not,</v>

959
00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:19.901
<v Speaker 3>fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you ever try to do anything </v>

960
00:44:19.901 --> 00:44:21.650
<v Speaker 3>else before you fix this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they made the decision,</v>

961
00:44:21.651 --> 00:44:26.651
<v Speaker 3>they genuinely thought it would be good </v>
<v Speaker 3>for business in the short term.</v>

962
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 3>I will never understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big business people promise them,</v>

963
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:34.490
<v Speaker 3>figure it out before it got really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

964
00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.270
<v Speaker 3>we'll figure it out before it got really</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

965
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.000
<v Speaker 3>How much bigger is the derivative </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy?</v>

966
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seemed.</v>

967
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.650
<v Speaker 3>I was looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find out what the,</v>

968
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.690
<v Speaker 3>what the sort of trading was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed,</v>

969
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:51.020
<v Speaker 3>from what I could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 94 percent of trades are now </v>

970
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.050
<v Speaker 3>derivative because they're in because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

971
00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:57.240
<v Speaker 3>Because there's such a bigger volume,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's insane.</v>

972
00:44:57.241 --> 00:44:59.340
<v Speaker 3>No one's gonna like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to buy 10,000</v>

973
00:44:59.341 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 3>shares of Honeywell today because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

974
00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

975
00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:03.690
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>$60,000</v>

976
00:45:03.691 --> 00:45:05.670
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you could buy like 10,000</v>

977
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.460
<v Speaker 3>futures on Honeywell because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh really?</v>

978
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Gee God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is so crazy.</v>

979
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Percent of the trades are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how many more?</v>

980
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:19.950
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's ultra fast.</v>

981
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Two is a whole other.</v>

982
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:24.570
<v Speaker 3>There's sort of two different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two different realms.</v>

983
00:45:24.571 --> 00:45:25.590
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to huge.</v>

984
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:31.070
<v Speaker 3>They must all be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone involved in the must know that </v>

985
00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.360
<v Speaker 3>they're bringing on the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They must know that they're there.</v>

986
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:35.280
<v Speaker 3>They're the first steps before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>digital machine takes over.</v>

987
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:40.490
<v Speaker 3>They must know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They must know that there's no humanity </v>

988
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:40.490
<v Speaker 3>in that stock market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

989
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.300
<v Speaker 3>That's chaos and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

990
00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:44.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't want digital technology to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>blamed for this,</v>

991
00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:50.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the real operating system </v>

992
00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:50.120
<v Speaker 3>they're promoting is not the digital </v>
<v Speaker 3>operating system.</v>

993
00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.200
<v Speaker 3>It's the economic operating system </v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath it.</v>

994
00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 3>It's this 13th century central currency </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest bearing,</v>

995
00:45:55.471 --> 00:46:00.471
<v Speaker 3>debt based economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and none of the guys who I thought we'd </v>

996
00:46:00.471 --> 00:46:01.320
<v Speaker 3>get us out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Evan Williams with twitter,</v>

997
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.420
<v Speaker 3>Mark Zuckerberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with facebook,</v>

998
00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.010
<v Speaker 3>the kids from Google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

999
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 3>They're getting the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each of them had a real shot.</v>

1000
00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:12.930
<v Speaker 3>Even Bill Gates at breaking the central </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy and and flipping things the </v>

1001
00:46:13.951 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 3>other way.</v>

1002
00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Not going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going public,</v>

1003
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.870
<v Speaker 3>not be good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not doing it with venture capital.</v>

1004
00:46:18.871 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Saying if I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1005
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:25.290
<v Speaker 3>if Google can hack web search,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if facebook can hack social,</v>

1006
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Speaker 3>if twitter can hack everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't they?</v>

1007
00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:32.520
<v Speaker 3>If they're so busy disintermediating all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these different things,</v>

1008
00:46:32.521 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 3>why doesn't anyone of them yet want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>disintermediate central banking and say,</v>

1009
00:46:36.691 --> 00:46:37.470
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>

1010
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Chase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't actually need you.</v>

1011
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:40.650
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna do our whole thing through </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickstarter.</v>

1012
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Say like one of your didn't want to hear</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1013
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:46.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting point of view.</v>

1014
00:46:46.171 --> 00:46:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I think they probably would never want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to take that stand because they would be</v>

1015
00:46:49.441 --> 00:46:54.441
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine there's a lot of money </v>

1016
00:46:54.441 --> 00:46:54.550
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1017
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:59.710
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in them not being successful with that </v>

1018
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.710
<v Speaker 3>quest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1019
00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 3>to the point at which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1020
00:47:02.491 --> 00:47:03.680
<v Speaker 3>you're doing paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1021
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna let people do individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>transactions.</v>

1022
00:47:06.601 --> 00:47:11.601
<v Speaker 3>That was their original model and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were going to make money on the float </v>

1023
00:47:11.601 --> 00:47:12.330
<v Speaker 3>and then the banks came to them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1024
00:47:12.331 --> 00:47:13.560
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to do that.</v>

1025
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.020
<v Speaker 3>You're not a bank paypal kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be,</v>

1026
00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:21.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I just start as a bank or you're </v>

1027
00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:21.100
<v Speaker 3>going to have to be connected to one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us and that's when,</v>

1028
00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:25.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay pal kind of becomes part of Ebay </v>

1029
00:47:25.311 --> 00:47:25.311
<v Speaker 3>rather than whatever these crazy guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>might've done.</v>

1030
00:47:25.311 --> 00:47:28.480
<v Speaker 3>And I suppose there's this point where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1031
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.940
<v Speaker 3>innocently these companies that get </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger and bigger and bigger,</v>

1032
00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:32.740
<v Speaker 3>hoping to do the right things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it's like,</v>

1033
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:39.270
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not gonna let you do this if you </v>

1034
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.640
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't play by our rules.</v>

1035
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:45.030
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also feel like there's companies that </v>

1036
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're willing to go smaller,</v>

1037
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.160
<v Speaker 3>if you're willing to let it grow a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit slower,</v>

1038
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:53.640
<v Speaker 3>that you can scale up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can become a big ethical </v>

1039
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:53.920
<v Speaker 3>corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1040
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always wondering why a big </v>

1041
00:47:59.490 --> 00:47:59.490
<v Speaker 3>corporation couldn't be ethical.</v>

1042
00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't you have a big corporation </v>

1043
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:03.120
<v Speaker 3>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good ideology behind it?</v>

1044
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:08.580
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's really because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shareholders and shareholders are </v>

1045
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.490
<v Speaker 3>inpatient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shareholders are there.</v>

1046
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 3>They're not really there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1047
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.240
<v Speaker 3>They're distant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're shareholders are,</v>

1048
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:17.050
<v Speaker 3>are people who just want to see a number</v>
<v Speaker 3>go up by the next quarter.</v>

1049
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:20.050
<v Speaker 3>And if you have to make a number go up </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the next quarter,</v>

1050
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:23.290
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to have to be thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about something other than doing good in</v>

1051
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:28.291
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You if it is ones and Zeros at all </v>

1052
00:48:28.291 --> 00:48:30.130
<v Speaker 3>costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's the game you're playing and if</v>

1053
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.500
<v Speaker 3>you've got shareholders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to throw you in jail.</v>

1054
00:48:32.501 --> 00:48:37.501
<v Speaker 3>If you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's your fiduciary </v>

1055
00:48:37.501 --> 00:48:39.541
<v Speaker 3>responsibility and it's a fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that a corporation can do </v>

1056
00:48:39.541 --> 00:48:41.200
<v Speaker 3>something that an individual would be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>total piece of shit to do.</v>

1057
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.590
<v Speaker 3>If it was one person that was involved </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this one guy,</v>

1058
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 3>what he did was he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1059
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:49.450
<v Speaker 3>he gave the loans to the Third World </v>
<v Speaker 3>Company,</v>

1060
00:48:49.451 --> 00:48:51.190
<v Speaker 3>the countries that they couldn't pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1061
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:56.220
<v Speaker 3>He went over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>monopolize our natural resources </v>

1062
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:56.220
<v Speaker 3>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dug the oil,</v>

1063
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.520
<v Speaker 3>lie himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>polluted the river himself,</v>

1064
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raped and killed the villagers himself.</v>

1065
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:05.730
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ locked that fucking guy in </v>

1066
00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:05.890
<v Speaker 3>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's making people work for $5 a week.</v>

1067
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.460
<v Speaker 3>You know that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There he is there he is holding down,</v>

1068
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because it's a corporation,</v>

1069
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:12.310
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1070
00:49:12.311 --> 00:49:13.900
<v Speaker 3>they're making money for their.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1071
00:49:13.901 --> 00:49:16.180
<v Speaker 3>And how many people who on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1072
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:19.710
<v Speaker 3>we'll read a good magazine or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>or listen to us and,</v>

1073
00:49:19.711 --> 00:49:22.930
<v Speaker 3>and NPR and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and be all sad about that stuff.</v>

1074
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Still has a 401k plan with stocks in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>very companies that are doing those </v>

1075
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:29.770
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're the ones who actually own the</v>

1076
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:34.771
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the shareholder who wants to </v>

1077
00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:34.771
<v Speaker 3>think to go up so they could send their </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid to college.</v>

1078
00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:34.771
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1079
00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:36.760
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting how circular it gets.</v>

1080
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.720
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1081
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.690
<v Speaker 3>for how unvirtuous that circle is </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

1082
00:49:39.691 --> 00:49:43.150
<v Speaker 3>I think unwinding it is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just as easy.</v>

1083
00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:44.050
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1084
00:49:44.051 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 3>instead of doing these sort of long </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance,</v>

1085
00:49:46.001 --> 00:49:49.210
<v Speaker 3>longterm disconnected investments in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mining companies,</v>

1086
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:54.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to invest my money where I see</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and people actually know in the place</v>

1087
00:49:54.281 --> 00:49:56.290
<v Speaker 3>where I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are trying to do something,</v>

1088
00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bring it,</v>

1089
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:59.020
<v Speaker 3>bring it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not,</v>

1090
00:49:59.021 --> 00:50:00.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not local,</v>

1091
00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:04.210
<v Speaker 3>at least at least into your present,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least into your,</v>

1092
00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.060
<v Speaker 3>into your visible reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:50:07.061 --> 00:50:08.900
<v Speaker 3>And it really is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1094
00:50:08.901 --> 00:50:13.901
<v Speaker 3>the pursuit of the end goal of simply </v>
<v Speaker 3>only ones and zeros done through a </v>

1095
00:50:13.901 --> 00:50:17.420
<v Speaker 3>corporate way is really anti human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the,</v>

1096
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:22.500
<v Speaker 3>that's the real anti human aspect of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it will engage human suffering </v>

1097
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:27.690
<v Speaker 3>as long as it's willing to extract ones </v>
<v Speaker 3>and zeroes from that elected calculates </v>

1098
00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.440
<v Speaker 3>how much human suffering are we willing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to cause,</v>

1099
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 3>how much devastation to the environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>or are we willing to cross so much,</v>

1100
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:34.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why.</v>

1101
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Then the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in the nightmare scenario then is</v>

1102
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.460
<v Speaker 3>you invest that into technology so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your robots,</v>

1103
00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not in competition with us,</v>

1104
00:50:45.651 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 3>but they are playing the corporate </v>
<v Speaker 3>program.</v>

1105
00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:51.710
<v Speaker 3>They have no desire other than to </v>
<v Speaker 3>extract,</v>

1106
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:56.990
<v Speaker 3>extract value and meaning from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those computers running algorithms </v>

1107
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:59.330
<v Speaker 3>recognize trends in the marketplace </v>
<v Speaker 3>before a human could ever see it coming.</v>

1108
00:50:59.331 --> 00:51:01.550
<v Speaker 3>And then round countered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And meanwhile,</v>

1109
00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:06.610
<v Speaker 3>as we're making ourselves dumber about </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology or I'm wearing this code </v>

1110
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:06.610
<v Speaker 3>academy tee shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1111
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:10.870
<v Speaker 3>Want people to learn to code.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As we become more stupid about our </v>

1112
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:16.511
<v Speaker 3>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our computers are getting smarter about </v>

1113
00:51:16.511 --> 00:51:17.300
<v Speaker 3>us doing big data repositories of every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every keystroke,</v>

1114
00:51:17.301 --> 00:51:18.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every are there.</v>

1115
00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:20.860
<v Speaker 3>They know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know stuff about,</v>

1116
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:25.460
<v Speaker 3>I think knew some teenage girl was </v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnant before family did and you know,</v>

1117
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:28.100
<v Speaker 3>they know when kids are going to be gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they know themselves,</v>

1118
00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:32.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like things got really smart and I.</v>

1119
00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:37.330
<v Speaker 3>You go to a google when you google </v>
<v Speaker 3>something or look for things,</v>

1120
00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:42.200
<v Speaker 3>certain things online and then say you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to youtube and there's ads for things</v>

1121
00:51:42.201 --> 00:51:45.980
<v Speaker 3>that you've recently looked at is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tantalizing ads.</v>

1122
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh I see you're into jeeps.</v>

1130
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:14.910

<v Speaker 3>We're accepting it slowly accepting the </v>

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:19.421
<v Speaker 3>needle and to our vein pumps in nano </v>
<v Speaker 3>cells that eventually replace human </v>

1132
00:52:19.421 --> 00:52:24.131
<v Speaker 3>tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's going to be a commercial is </v>

1135
00:52:26.161 --> 00:52:29.260
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life gets even better as you get a buyer</v>

1136
00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.380
<v Speaker 3>buyer little nanobots to from like the </v>

<v Speaker 3>it's like they get bought by google and </v>

<v Speaker 3>No data.</v>

1148
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:59.030
<v Speaker 3>You have enough for two people to phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

1149
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Your emergency 911 phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your phone.</v>

1150
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:07.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not registered at only relate to </v>
<v Speaker 3>call nine.</v>

1151
00:53:07.491 --> 00:53:09.020
<v Speaker 3>One one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll be the same thing.</v>

1152
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should've paid your bill,</v>

1153
00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Mr Rushkoff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why he didn't want to pay </v>

1154
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:15.610
<v Speaker 3>your bill and here you are with no </v>
<v Speaker 3>recourse.</v>

1155
00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to look at a shiny guy from</v>

1156
00:53:18.711 --> 00:53:21.200
<v Speaker 3>the future of thousand years old and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks great,</v>

1157
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.120
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be all artificial.</v>

1158
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

1159
00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 3>it's not with all that artificial knees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessarily,</v>

1160
00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:32.661
<v Speaker 3>although it may be it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily the technology </v>

1161
00:53:32.661 --> 00:53:35.121
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem in this equation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the company that owns the </v>

1162
00:53:35.121 --> 00:53:35.280
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1163
00:53:35.281 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately what's getting done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technology's getting pushed.</v>

1164
00:53:38.311 --> 00:53:43.311
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be the case in every </v>
<v Speaker 3>single situation and ultimately at the </v>

1165
00:53:43.311 --> 00:53:47.631
<v Speaker 3>top of the execution food chain where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at like what is being done at </v>

1166
00:53:47.631 --> 00:53:47.631
<v Speaker 3>the end level.</v>

1167
00:53:47.631 --> 00:53:50.700
<v Speaker 3>That's really the game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The technology constantly increases with</v>

1168
00:53:50.701 --> 00:53:55.701
<v Speaker 3>every overtake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with every new gigantic invention and </v>

1169
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.340
<v Speaker 3>bundles of money that go along with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the people that got fucked over.</v>

1170
00:53:59.341 --> 00:54:04.341
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technology keeps moving forward and </v>

1171
00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:04.880
<v Speaker 3>it keeps getting stronger and stronger </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stronger and it's.</v>

1172
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:07.160
<v Speaker 3>But it's not just stronger that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1173
00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:09.030
<v Speaker 3>it's fundamentally different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1174
00:54:09.031 --> 00:54:11.670
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that Mcluhan was trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring up in Marshall Mcluhan,</v>

1175
00:54:11.671 --> 00:54:13.320
<v Speaker 3>the media theorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was looking at that,</v>

1176
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:15.450
<v Speaker 3>the different environments that </v>
<v Speaker 3>different media,</v>

1177
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:17.950
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of technology create.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1178
00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.870
<v Speaker 3>fire had a change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a media environment,</v>

1179
00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:23.340
<v Speaker 3>had a technological environment with </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>

1180
00:54:23.341 --> 00:54:28.341
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people could go live further north in </v>

1181
00:54:28.341 --> 00:54:29.280
<v Speaker 3>colder places and little apes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1182
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:34.340
<v Speaker 3>who were smart enough to have fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could get away from big dumb apes who </v>

1183
00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:34.410
<v Speaker 3>couldn't travel north to chase them.</v>

1184
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:39.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got different races and all sorts of </v>

1185
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:40.911
<v Speaker 3>things happen because it's sounding like</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire or the invention of text or the </v>

1186
00:54:40.911 --> 00:54:45.171
<v Speaker 3>invention of text changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well for me it changed the way we look </v>

1187
00:54:45.171 --> 00:54:45.171
<v Speaker 3>at time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1188
00:54:45.171 --> 00:54:49.491
<v Speaker 3>Because now I can write something now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm going to be accountable for </v>

1189
00:54:49.491 --> 00:54:49.830
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can have contract with text.</v>

1190
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:54.831
<v Speaker 3>We got history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got the Judeo Christian line of </v>

1191
00:54:54.831 --> 00:54:57.180
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got law and ethics,</v>

1192
00:54:57.181 --> 00:54:59.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got our,</v>

1193
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:00.970
<v Speaker 3>we got the calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1194
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:03.510
<v Speaker 3>then that all went along and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed.</v>

1195
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.570
<v Speaker 3>Then we get the printing press and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>get the clock right now,</v>

1196
00:55:06.571 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 3>the clock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden we go,</v>

1197
00:55:07.801 --> 00:55:12.801
<v Speaker 3>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we can actually break down the day </v>

1198
00:55:12.801 --> 00:55:14.571
<v Speaker 3>into these little pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We put one up at the town square and </v>

1199
00:55:14.571 --> 00:55:14.610
<v Speaker 3>that's when time became money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was like,</v>

1200
00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:19.611
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you can work for an hour for me </v>

1201
00:55:19.611 --> 00:55:19.611
<v Speaker 3>instead of making a thing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to and selling it to me,</v>

1202
00:55:19.611 --> 00:55:21.150
<v Speaker 3>now you can work for the hour or two </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours or three hours.</v>

1203
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:24.480
<v Speaker 3>We got to standard and now we get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>digital media environment,</v>

1204
00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:29.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just as different as the </v>

1205
00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:29.810
<v Speaker 3>industrial age media environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

1206
00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:31.290
<v Speaker 3>And the clock was from the printing </v>
<v Speaker 3>press,</v>

1207
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.780
<v Speaker 3>from the written text,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1208
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:34.790
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1209
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:36.780
<v Speaker 3>from even fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1210
00:55:36.781 --> 00:55:39.280
<v Speaker 3>and in the digital media environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this,</v>

1211
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just more tech,</v>

1212
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:43.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more,</v>

1213
00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.760
<v Speaker 3>it's more of a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of moving through time and a choice.</v>

1214
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Two choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two choice two choice way.</v>

1215
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:55.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we just have more choices than we </v>

1216
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:56.130
<v Speaker 3>know what to do if we spend more time </v>
<v Speaker 3>processing choice itself than we do.</v>

1217
00:55:56.131 --> 00:55:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Getting the things that we've chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1218
00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:03.070
<v Speaker 3>it's like the call waiting is almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the typical kind of digital choice.</v>

1219
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.670
<v Speaker 3>It just ended our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking to this level and I've got a</v>

1220
00:56:05.671 --> 00:56:08.040
<v Speaker 3>call waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do I do?</v>

1221
00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:09.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to be put in that,</v>

1222
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:14.780
<v Speaker 3>just to be put yourself in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that interrupted state is very </v>

1223
00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.741
<v Speaker 3>digital because you want to have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice because that person wants to </v>

1224
00:56:18.741 --> 00:56:18.741
<v Speaker 3>reach you.</v>

1225
00:56:18.741 --> 00:56:19.020
<v Speaker 3>But how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1226
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:22.210
<v Speaker 3>how that interrupts what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1227
00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.680
<v Speaker 3>what used to be a more continuous way </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1228
00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 3>of just moving through life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:32.750
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it certainly gives us more options and </v>

1230
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:35.281
<v Speaker 3>we're naturally designed to handle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the more people have on their </v>

1231
00:56:35.711 --> 00:56:40.711
<v Speaker 3>facebook page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more likely they really have zero </v>

1232
00:56:40.711 --> 00:56:40.711
<v Speaker 3>connection to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1233
00:56:40.711 --> 00:56:41.590
<v Speaker 3>the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>

1234
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:43.900
<v Speaker 3>like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're designed for Dunbar's number,</v>

1235
00:56:43.901 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred 50 people and you get,</v>

1236
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 3>get 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on your facebook page.</v>

1237
00:56:48.161 --> 00:56:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck does that mean?</v>

1238
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Who are you talking about marketing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1239
00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:54.970
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of interaction that you really</v>

1240
00:56:54.971 --> 00:56:55.700
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1241
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a human to human interaction.</v>

1242
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.430
<v Speaker 3>The other weird thing that facebook for </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1243
00:57:00.431 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's how it compresses time,</v>

1244
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:04.630
<v Speaker 3>so it's like there are these people from</v>
<v Speaker 3>like second and third grade.</v>

1245
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:06.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1246
00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:11.100
<v Speaker 3>45,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever years away from that and then </v>

1247
00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like two weeks ago from second </v>
<v Speaker 3>grade,</v>

1248
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:14.550
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1249
00:57:14.551 --> 00:57:16.840
<v Speaker 3>I'd finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd left that behind me.</v>

1250
00:57:16.841 --> 00:57:17.480
<v Speaker 3>It's unmarked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:57:17.481 --> 00:57:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who she is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's I was or who she relates to.</v>

1252
00:57:20.351 --> 00:57:25.351
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in the past for a reason and now </v>

1253
00:57:25.351 --> 00:57:29.611
<v Speaker 3>it's here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then on the front end I've got the </v>

1254
00:57:29.611 --> 00:57:31.891
<v Speaker 3>computer on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>calculating everything about my </v>

1255
00:57:31.891 --> 00:57:33.640
<v Speaker 3>keystrokes so they know my future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know who's going to be pregnant,</v>

1256
00:57:33.641 --> 00:57:34.480
<v Speaker 3>who's going to be gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is going to be,</v>

1257
00:57:34.481 --> 00:57:35.590
<v Speaker 3>this can be that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like,</v>

1258
00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:40.650
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like my past is all in here </v>

1259
00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:42.900
<v Speaker 3>and now my future is all in here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's just sort of crushed in on </v>

1260
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:42.900
<v Speaker 3>me there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel.</v>

1261
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel autonomous anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like I have agency.</v>

1262
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:51.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel I'm in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get away from anything and I </v>

1263
00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:52.990
<v Speaker 3>can't actually be moving towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything with a sense of free will,</v>

1264
00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.960
<v Speaker 3>but can you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>

1265
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:59.800
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of in control of how much to</v>
<v Speaker 3>interact with it,</v>

1266
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:03.490
<v Speaker 3>how much you choose to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I dropped facebook.</v>

1267
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:04.880
<v Speaker 3>You dropped it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>

1268
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.900
<v Speaker 3>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you still use twitter?</v>

1269
00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:08.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1270
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:10.130
<v Speaker 3>What's there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stays there.</v>

1271
00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.330
<v Speaker 3>Facebook problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Facebook is a problem that will.</v>

1272
00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 3>A real problem with facebook is I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>in charge of what I do on facebook.</v>

1273
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because Mark Zuckerberg can use me or my</v>

1274
00:58:22.721 --> 00:58:26.180
<v Speaker 3>likeness in an ad of something that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even know what it is.</v>

1275
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.990
<v Speaker 3>He can't do that anymore than I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1276
00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:34.020
<v Speaker 3>He undid that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was something that wasn't </v>

1277
00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:34.020
<v Speaker 3>supposed to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Supposedly.</v>

1278
00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Are they backtracked about that?</v>

1279
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:37.330
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go two steps forward,</v>

1280
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.100
<v Speaker 3>one step back just to forward one step </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1281
00:58:39.101 --> 00:58:41.680
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of an ever evolving user </v>
<v Speaker 3>agreement.</v>

1282
00:58:41.681 --> 00:58:46.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're the part that I had gotten </v>

1283
00:58:46.681 --> 00:58:46.681
<v Speaker 3>concerned about what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on there as an author.</v>

1284
00:58:46.681 --> 00:58:46.681
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on there,</v>

1285
00:58:46.681 --> 00:58:47.830
<v Speaker 3>buy my book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love me.</v>

1286
00:58:47.831 --> 00:58:49.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like my ideas,</v>

1287
00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:52.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do that.</v>

1288
00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:56.590
<v Speaker 3>I can't solicit the likes of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have readers,</v>

1289
00:58:56.690 --> 00:59:00.820
<v Speaker 3>people who I'm supposedly a advising </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this stuff,</v>

1290
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:04.570
<v Speaker 3>especially about sort of media ethics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and integrity.</v>

1291
00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:09.690
<v Speaker 3>I can't invite them to like my page when</v>
<v Speaker 3>that very active liking is making them </v>

1292
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:14.641
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable to marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be passing through me </v>

1293
00:59:14.641 --> 00:59:19.470
<v Speaker 3>beyond my control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes and no because they're also </v>

1294
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:23.521
<v Speaker 3>providing you with this excellent </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection with all these people that's </v>

1295
00:59:23.521 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 3>available through facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which not as limited as twitter with 140</v>

1296
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:30.221
<v Speaker 3>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to pay for the privilege to </v>

1297
00:59:30.221 --> 00:59:32.951
<v Speaker 3>reach those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not willing to have them and </v>

1298
00:59:32.951 --> 00:59:36.830
<v Speaker 3>their likenesses used to represent </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1299
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:41.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that they understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What liking makes someone vulnerable to,</v>

1300
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:43.730
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1301
00:59:43.731 --> 00:59:48.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean on some senses is patronizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I'm saying is I think I </v>

1302
00:59:48.731 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 3>know stuff about this technology that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>

1303
00:59:49.131 --> 00:59:54.131
<v Speaker 3>If they all knew really how this worked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they all knew the implications of </v>

1304
00:59:54.131 --> 00:59:55.340
<v Speaker 3>what they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I would say,</v>

1305
00:59:55.341 --> 00:59:56.480
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go for it.</v>

1306
00:59:56.490 --> 01:00:01.490
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately the worst consequences is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what marketing they're going to be </v>

1307
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:05.261
<v Speaker 3>marketed to going to be represented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So their image would then be put on </v>

1308
01:00:05.261 --> 01:00:05.261
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1309
01:00:05.261 --> 01:00:06.190
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

1310
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that I'm 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure they didn't.</v>

1311
01:00:09.051 --> 01:00:11.810
<v Speaker 3>They dropped that thing of using their </v>
<v Speaker 3>photos and advertising.</v>

1312
01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 3>And you're not going to profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not allowed to just take your </v>

1313
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 3>photos and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1314
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:17.500
<v Speaker 3>just photos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1315
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:22.540
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With your photos that you're talking </v>

1316
01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:22.540
<v Speaker 3>about is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you talking about the photo,</v>

1317
01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:26.690
<v Speaker 3>the photo thing they bought?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about using,</v>

1318
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:32.040
<v Speaker 3>but for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were saying like using it for </v>

1319
01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 3>advertising sponsored stories and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>they use people in a sponsored story.</v>

1320
01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:35.910
<v Speaker 3>At least the day that I quit at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>point it would not.</v>

1321
01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can turn that off.</v>

1322
01:00:37.071 --> 01:00:37.630
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1323
01:00:37.631 --> 01:00:42.631
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's things like that that are </v>

1324
01:00:42.631 --> 01:00:42.631
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's ways</v>

1325
01:00:42.631 --> 01:00:42.631
<v Speaker 3>turn them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm confused.</v>

1326
01:00:42.631 --> 01:00:45.200
<v Speaker 3>There are sponsored story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you mean people don't know?</v>

1327
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:47.420
<v Speaker 3>I feel like most people don't know and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just to be there,</v>

1328
01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:52.490
<v Speaker 3>it just didn't seem like it also because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I so don't trust who they are.</v>

1329
01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:53.990
<v Speaker 3>And what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're about.</v>

1330
01:00:53.991 --> 01:00:57.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust them as a company the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to trust the kinds of companies I</v>

1331
01:00:57.411 --> 01:01:02.411
<v Speaker 3>let get bigger and bigger and deeper and</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeper into my lives and eventually put </v>

1332
01:01:02.411 --> 01:01:05.441
<v Speaker 3>probes in my brain and do not trust them</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Justin timberlake played him in </v>

1333
01:01:05.441 --> 01:01:06.210
<v Speaker 3>a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one,</v>

1334
01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:10.420
<v Speaker 3>he played a Shauna to put the good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1335
01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:15.460
<v Speaker 3>he played the mindspace story and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much of it is about coke and horse for </v>

1336
01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:18.090
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I would have with those guys and</v>

1337
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:19.870
<v Speaker 3>they just take that money crazy.</v>

1338
01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.990
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to take facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to say you,</v>

1339
01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:25.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't trust facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't trust twitter.</v>

1340
01:01:25.591 --> 01:01:28.170
<v Speaker 4>You can't trust google.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't trust any of the snow.</v>

1341
01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:33.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware right now I'm aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways that twitter is broadcast.</v>

1342
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:38.900
<v Speaker 3>I feel in control of how I'm tweeted and</v>
<v Speaker 3>retweeted.</v>

1343
01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Almost</v>

1344
01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.880
<v Speaker 4>worse though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're actually to the point </v>

1345
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:44.880
<v Speaker 4>where you try to go back in time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your timeline.</v>

1346
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.530
<v Speaker 4>You can see there gets a cutoff point </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can't download your own tweets</v>

1347
01:01:49.601 --> 01:01:54.601
<v Speaker 4>unless you know the exact link.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they end up giving you your </v>

1348
01:01:54.601 --> 01:01:54.601
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>

1349
01:01:54.601 --> 01:01:58.150
<v Speaker 4>I still can't do it on mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the same with like twit picks</v>

1350
01:01:58.151 --> 01:01:59.810
<v Speaker 4>are all these photo ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some of them.</v>

1351
01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:01.420
<v Speaker 4>Now you're saying that some inches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1352
01:02:01.421 --> 01:02:06.421
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that you want your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to do tweets you want or</v>

1353
01:02:07.871 --> 01:02:09.580
<v Speaker 4>should have been an addition for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>free,</v>

1354
01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:14.760
<v Speaker 4>for your free tweeting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want them to maintain an archive of </v>

1355
01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.830
<v Speaker 4>you and everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1356
01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1357
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:21.340
<v Speaker 4>I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I personally don't have a problem with </v>

1358
01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:21.340
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I'm saying</v>

1359
01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 3>is that that's kind of more ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me than facebook.</v>

1360
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:24.890
<v Speaker 3>The fact that I can't even access stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've,</v>

1361
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:29.400
<v Speaker 3>that I've totally different thing I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned about.</v>

1362
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:31.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what in the book I call </v>
<v Speaker 3>it digit Phrenia,</v>

1363
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:33.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the problem with,</v>

1364
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:38.390
<v Speaker 3>with digital for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not this idea of information </v>

1365
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:41.271
<v Speaker 3>overload,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's too much stuff coming at </v>

1366
01:02:41.271 --> 01:02:41.271
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>

1367
01:02:41.271 --> 01:02:43.850
<v Speaker 3>they can't maintain more than one online</v>
<v Speaker 3>persona a simultaneously.</v>

1368
01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:49.020
<v Speaker 3>There's too many sort of individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>instances of us and if you're going to </v>

1369
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.581
<v Speaker 3>have different instances of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know even your email inbox is an </v>

1370
01:02:52.581 --> 01:02:53.760
<v Speaker 3>instance of a sort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're gonna have all these different</v>

1371
01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:56.430
<v Speaker 3>different things out there filling up or</v>
<v Speaker 3>interacting,</v>

1372
01:02:56.610 --> 01:03:01.410
<v Speaker 3>you want to be damn well sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in charge of each one of them and</v>

1373
01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:06.411
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like facebook was now doing </v>

1374
01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:06.411
<v Speaker 3>things on my behalf.</v>

1375
01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:10.670
<v Speaker 3>I was like one step of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you make a very good point in that </v>

1376
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.370
<v Speaker 3>having more than one version of yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes very problematic.</v>

1377
01:03:14.371 --> 01:03:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're involved in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>like real.</v>

1378
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure you probably interact </v>
<v Speaker 3>with quite a few people every day and to</v>

1379
01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:24.600
<v Speaker 3>do that on twitter's semi manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it to do it when you can,</v>

1380
01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:27.030
<v Speaker 3>but to do that on twitter and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to hop over to facebook too.</v>

1381
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:30.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like you should have one portal in </v>
<v Speaker 3>one portal.</v>

1382
01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:34.620
<v Speaker 3>At least one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one that I was always sad,</v>

1383
01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:35.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't really.</v>

1384
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:40.550
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go to facebook much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go there and they'd be like some </v>

1385
01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:40.550
<v Speaker 3>relative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1386
01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:40.550
<v Speaker 3>who said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1387
01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:45.321
<v Speaker 3>I just heard of your mom's passing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like six months have gone by </v>

1388
01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:48.111
<v Speaker 3>before I found that message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to console them or </v>

1389
01:03:48.111 --> 01:03:48.111
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1390
01:03:48.111 --> 01:03:48.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1391
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:50.610
<v Speaker 3>it's just such a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's for me,</v>

1392
01:03:50.611 --> 01:03:52.980
<v Speaker 3>it was such an awful interface anyway </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was just losing,</v>

1393
01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.900
<v Speaker 3>losing stuff there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1394
01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:59.901
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's just has to do with </v>

1395
01:03:59.901 --> 01:03:59.901
<v Speaker 3>how I get more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1396
01:03:59.901 --> 01:04:00.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correspondence from other people.</v>

1397
01:04:00.811 --> 01:04:03.060
<v Speaker 3>So I've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to limit it more than others.</v>

1398
01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it really has to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1399
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:09.180
<v Speaker 3>well if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's at least I'm the canary in the cage</v>

1400
01:04:09.181 --> 01:04:12.560
<v Speaker 3>for what's coming for everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1401
01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will need to get one or two </v>

1402
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 3>emails and now it's just streaming in </v>
<v Speaker 3>for everybody.</v>

1403
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:19.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you send me something on Facebook,</v>

1404
01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:22.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't read it just to let everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>know because they pile up.</v>

1405
01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't have time to read them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm with you in a certain way.</v>

1406
01:04:25.621 --> 01:04:29.400
<v Speaker 3>I still use facebook to put up links,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's connected to my twitter and I'm</v>

1407
01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:30.530
<v Speaker 3>pretty cognizant of that.</v>

1408
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.110
<v Speaker 3>So when I put a tweet up on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I put a link up on facebook,</v>

1409
01:04:34.111 --> 01:04:36.930
<v Speaker 3>I make sure it's short enough to fit </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a tweet with,</v>

1410
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:37.990
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1411
01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:40.200
<v Speaker 3>with twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

1412
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:45.260
<v Speaker 3>you understand what you're putting out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put out this little hundred 40 </v>

1413
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.621
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it went to your people and those words </v>

1414
01:04:48.621 --> 01:04:50.100
<v Speaker 3>are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a tool like facebook.</v>

1415
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:55.970
<v Speaker 3>You don't really have the same sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ownership over what's going and you </v>

1416
01:04:58.891 --> 01:05:00.720
<v Speaker 3>don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't actually have it.</v>

1417
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.250
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your picture is used.</v>

1418
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.440
<v Speaker 3>Douglas went into starbucks just now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1419
01:05:04.441 --> 01:05:07.530
<v Speaker 3>I could turn it off so everyone should </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn it off.</v>

1420
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1421
01:05:10.201 --> 01:05:12.360
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's a useful,</v>

1422
01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:13.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a useful tool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1423
01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of the untrustworthiness of</v>

1424
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>a good portion of the net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that with someone else being</v>

1426
01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>in control of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1427
01:05:25.331 --> 01:05:30.331
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interaction and someone else being </v>

1428
01:05:30.331 --> 01:05:32.311
<v Speaker 1>controlled ultimately of like when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign a user agreement and you have all </v>

1429
01:05:32.311 --> 01:05:32.850
<v Speaker 1>this information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just sort of put up online.</v>

1430
01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:37.860
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're entrusting it to them and then </v>

1431
01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:37.860
<v Speaker 1>turn their marketing to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1432
01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.780
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good clean relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as they don't fuck you.</v>

1433
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:42.580
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1434
01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:43.710
<v Speaker 1>and there's a point at which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1435
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let Netflix and it,</v>

1436
01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>whoever's in behind my TV remote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean now they know all that stuff,</v>

1437
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1438
01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll let them craft commercials around </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1439
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:54.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1440
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll accept in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this little,</v>

1441
01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrangement we have with business.</v>

1442
01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:01.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll accept anything incoming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1443
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.840
<v Speaker 1>but don't use me for your outgoing know.</v>

1444
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you're taking the person's identity</v>

1445
01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:07.930
<v Speaker 1>and then saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1446
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:10.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alice down the street like this,</v>

1447
01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:12.400
<v Speaker 1>a Sitcom to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should watch that.</v>

1448
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:17.520
<v Speaker 1>And then my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm watching is getting broadcast </v>

1449
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:17.520
<v Speaker 1>to them or what they think I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>

1450
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.670
<v Speaker 1>That's where it starts to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1451
01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:21.220
<v Speaker 1>now I'm being disembodied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm being taken.</v>

1452
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's facebook is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular websites online and it's also </v>

1453
01:06:29.501 --> 01:06:34.501
<v Speaker 1>one of the best ways to waste time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can waste a day easily just </v>

1454
01:06:34.501 --> 01:06:36.550
<v Speaker 1>looking at people that you used to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex with you and I'll just fire them and</v>

1455
01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:37.540
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this picture up to?</v>

1456
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1457
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you know you could do that all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go through that all day.</v>

1458
01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:45.430
<v Speaker 1>That could be entertained and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting shit done.</v>

1459
01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:49.960
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I try to use twitter.</v>

1460
01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the things that I do with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when we're.</v>

1461
01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Whenever someone sends me something </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating and a link,</v>

1462
01:06:55.601 --> 01:07:00.601
<v Speaker 1>I retweet it and because of that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>become like a portal for cool shit and </v>

1463
01:07:01.181 --> 01:07:02.770
<v Speaker 1>people know that if they send me cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1464
01:07:02.771 --> 01:07:06.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll retweet it and so you get all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool shit just starts coming to you.</v>

1465
01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:10.660
<v Speaker 1>When you sort of have that idea and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you send it,</v>

1466
01:07:10.661 --> 01:07:15.661
<v Speaker 1>they send it to you and then it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>this really exponentially expanding </v>

1467
01:07:15.661 --> 01:07:16.690
<v Speaker 1>thing where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1468
01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:21.130
<v Speaker 1>you have this like a radio channel or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like an information dump.</v>

1469
01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.400
<v Speaker 1>What percent of the tweets that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think you would pass on?</v>

1470
01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that high percentage because </v>

1471
01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:30.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not always filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1472
01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1473
01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it's really interesting I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>

1474
01:07:33.791 --> 01:07:35.140
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they'll send you something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

1475
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:36.430
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nonsense.</v>

1476
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking?</v>

1477
01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Did you see where this came from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you read the link,</v>

1478
01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:42.220
<v Speaker 1>know that is not big foot and that guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator.</v>

1479
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up and stop telling me </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1480
01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>But what that makes you a reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A reliable filter.</v>

1481
01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just retweet things,</v>

1482
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:53.320
<v Speaker 1>but I do read occasionally if someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>sends something really preposterous,</v>

1483
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.630
<v Speaker 1>will retweet it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to see how people react.</v>

1484
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's um,</v>

1485
01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 1>or if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people get mad at me,</v>

1486
01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll retweet it just to see how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>react.</v>

1487
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:06.070
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just we live in strange times.</v>

1488
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.030
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1489
01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:08.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1490
01:08:08.481 --> 01:08:11.110
<v Speaker 1>the twitter interface is a very bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1491
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you only give them 140 </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and people abuse the shit out</v>

1492
01:08:15.351 --> 01:08:20.351
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people will send me like 30 </v>

1493
01:08:20.351 --> 01:08:20.351
<v Speaker 1>tweets in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like explaining something to me,</v>

1494
01:08:20.351 --> 01:08:25.181
<v Speaker 1>like to stop the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things like snapchat.</v>

1495
01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>You played with that or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

1496
01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>The one where you take a picture and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1497
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:33.410
<v Speaker 1>you can send it but it dissolves in like</v>
<v Speaker 1>three seconds or five seconds.</v>

1498
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:36.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's like kids apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the dark secret.</v>

1499
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Kids are leaving facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1500
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:40.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demographic,</v>

1501
01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:45.131
<v Speaker 1>the younger like thing or in the 16 it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like falling totally off and they're </v>

1502
01:08:45.131 --> 01:08:46.460
<v Speaker 1>doing things like snapchat because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want,</v>

1503
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:48.890
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to be putting everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing on their permanent record.</v>

1504
01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:53.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're finally kind of accepted </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can show someone they're </v>

1505
01:08:53.891 --> 01:08:53.891
<v Speaker 1>posting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only lasts for three minutes.</v>

1506
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:55.970
<v Speaker 1>You screenshot it though and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>save it,</v>

1507
01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:57.470
<v Speaker 1>upload it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he knows,</v>

1508
01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.020
<v Speaker 1>but if you screenshot it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it at least tells them that they've,</v>

1509
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:01.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1510
01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:04.580
<v Speaker 1>so it's been defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you screen save it,</v>

1511
01:09:04.581 --> 01:09:08.180
<v Speaker 1>they at least the person who sent you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing knows that you did,</v>

1512
01:09:08.181 --> 01:09:10.580
<v Speaker 1>that they've given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given their control.</v>

1513
01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just this quest for truly uh,</v>

1514
01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Julie present based non archivable </v>
<v Speaker 1>silliness,</v>

1515
01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's because when we were silly we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to do in the parking lot of the </v>

1516
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 1>seven slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1517
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:26.120
<v Speaker 1>and there was no camera in the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

1518
01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:28.850
<v Speaker 1>It was really just it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens in the standard seven,</v>

1519
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.810
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

1520
01:09:29.811 --> 01:09:30.530
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1521
01:09:30.531 --> 01:09:33.200
<v Speaker 1>now it's like every single silly thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did,</v>

1522
01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:35.570
<v Speaker 1>if they didn't post about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their friend posted about it.</v>

1523
01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:36.920
<v Speaker 1>So it was still up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1524
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:42.100
<v Speaker 1>may as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pitched passion to the side of the </v>

1525
01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Parthenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

1526
01:09:42.381 --> 01:09:47.381
<v Speaker 1>but the ideas behind what you can and </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do or enforced by these archaic </v>

1527
01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:51.440
<v Speaker 1>laws that were written when none of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital technology was available.</v>

1528
01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:54.560
<v Speaker 1>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he get a lot of weird shit happens.</v>

1529
01:09:54.561 --> 01:09:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Like there's one girl who got charged </v>
<v Speaker 1>with child pornography because shape,</v>

1530
01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>she was sending photos of her naked body</v>
<v Speaker 1>to boys in her class and so the cops </v>

1531
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:06.080
<v Speaker 1>arrested her and charged this young </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

1532
01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:11.080
<v Speaker 1>She was 15 years old with child </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography sending pictures.</v>

1533
01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you talk about losing the </v>

1534
01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:16.760
<v Speaker 1>scripts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1535
01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 1>that's really losing the script for </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1536
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the nuttiest shit ever.</v>

1537
01:10:20.631 --> 01:10:21.010
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1538
01:10:21.011 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you found a child porn king pin,</v>

1539
01:10:23.361 --> 01:10:25.880
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There happens to be a child.</v>

1540
01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:27.050
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1541
01:10:27.051 --> 01:10:28.640
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero tolerance son.</v>

1542
01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:32.600
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if she's a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her vagina doesn't matter son.</v>

1543
01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.910
<v Speaker 1>She's a criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's victimizing probation is rape.</v>

1544
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Exactly younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's feeding the dark hunger,</v>

1545
01:10:39.711 --> 01:10:42.380
<v Speaker 1>so we need to discourage this in a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1546
01:10:42.381 --> 01:10:47.381
<v Speaker 1>Solitary confinement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's really just a temporal lag </v>

1547
01:10:47.381 --> 01:10:47.381
<v Speaker 1>hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1548
01:10:47.381 --> 01:10:49.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think in our last then catch up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we.</v>

1549
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:51.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also,</v>

1550
01:10:51.871 --> 01:10:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean in some sense a lack of privacy </v>
<v Speaker 1>could help that along too.</v>

1551
01:10:54.921 --> 01:10:59.921
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Google cameras finding like tens of </v>

1552
01:10:59.921 --> 01:11:03.221
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people who are just smoking</v>
<v Speaker 1>joints in the streets of every American </v>

1553
01:11:03.221 --> 01:11:03.221
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1554
01:11:03.221 --> 01:11:03.890
<v Speaker 1>some point they have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1555
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:07.530
<v Speaker 1>let people smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let gays get married.</v>

1556
01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the pod thing.</v>

1557
01:11:09.951 --> 01:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>There's money in enforcing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest issue,</v>

1558
01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:15.750
<v Speaker 1>more money in enforcing it or being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling it?</v>

1559
01:11:15.751 --> 01:11:17.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be two different people and</v>

1560
01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:22.731
<v Speaker 1>you have to pry it from the hands of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are making money by keeping </v>

1561
01:11:22.731 --> 01:11:27.471
<v Speaker 1>it illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's the private prison </v>

1562
01:11:27.471 --> 01:11:28.200
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the prison guards unions,</v>

1563
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:33.630
<v Speaker 1>whether it's different pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that would stand to lose </v>

1564
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.900
<v Speaker 1>profits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1565
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:37.710
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be a bunch of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to stop anything,</v>

1566
01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:40.980
<v Speaker 1>any change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially changes in legalities because</v>

1567
01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:44.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a big business in locking people</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for shit I know,</v>

1568
01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:49.960
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to have to maintain a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an illegal population to stay alive.</v>

1569
01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:56.661
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to rest more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more if they're going to have corporate </v>

1570
01:11:56.661 --> 01:11:58.731
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greater greater percentage of America </v>

1571
01:11:58.731 --> 01:11:59.610
<v Speaker 1>has to be in prison every single year </v>
<v Speaker 1>until it's an Asam Tata curb and there's</v>

1572
01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:00.390
<v Speaker 1>one guy left.</v>

1573
01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.310
<v Speaker 1>That becomes a really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>

1574
01:12:02.311 --> 01:12:06.180
<v Speaker 1>If marijuana does become legal and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can trade on the future of marijuana,</v>

1575
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:10.200
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want.</v>

1576
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:12.450
<v Speaker 1>It does have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some stocks that are marijuana</v>

1577
01:12:12.451 --> 01:12:15.810
<v Speaker 1>stocks really at that people trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>

1578
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the companies that I guess that </v>

1579
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I've already laid out a marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy or are they ready for it?</v>

1580
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Look at that percentage of the US prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>population that are non violent drug </v>

1581
01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:33.021
<v Speaker 1>offenders in the 1980 and then in 2012 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent and in 2012,</v>

1582
01:12:33.781 --> 01:12:35.520
<v Speaker 1>it's 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1583
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:38.040
<v Speaker 1>the war on drugs folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're winning.</v>

1584
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:43.400
<v Speaker 1>More people are in jail I guess is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're winning and no,</v>

1585
01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:46.500
<v Speaker 1>as long as we have a private prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

1586
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:49.020
<v Speaker 1>it's good for the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

1587
01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:51.510
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the.</v>

1588
01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:56.700
<v Speaker 1>The fact that in this day and age you </v>
<v Speaker 1>still can't make a logical argument as </v>

1589
01:12:57.121 --> 01:12:59.460
<v Speaker 1>to why certain things are legal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

1590
01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Certain things that are legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are devastating to your health,</v>

1591
01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.120
<v Speaker 1>and then when you find out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>information has been withheld and that </v>

1592
01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.380
<v Speaker 1>companies may have new known about </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain risks,</v>

1593
01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.410
<v Speaker 1>no one seems to go to jail if anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

1594
01:13:13.411 --> 01:13:18.411
<v Speaker 1>people get find a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if that was an individual person </v>

1595
01:13:18.411 --> 01:13:18.411
<v Speaker 1>that did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1596
01:13:18.411 --> 01:13:21.270
<v Speaker 1>there would be a horrible human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a personal person.</v>

1597
01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:25.950
<v Speaker 1>One person who's responsible for all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths that came from aspirin alone.</v>

1598
01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:28.440
<v Speaker 1>You would want to add what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's some,</v>

1599
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.050
<v Speaker 1>there's some ways to get more conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it though,</v>

1600
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:32.160
<v Speaker 1>because it's all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1601
01:13:32.161 --> 01:13:35.220
<v Speaker 1>It's all of us who are part of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>system are owning that corporation,</v>

1602
01:13:35.221 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 1>has shareholders or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are these things like,</v>

1603
01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:42.891
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen that slavery </v>

<v Speaker 1>You got to do it when you're feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>good about yourself though.</v>

1607
01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:45.490
<v Speaker 1>What it does is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1613
01:13:58.570 --> 01:14:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Getting the Molybdenum for your iphone </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is or you know,</v>

1614
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:06.270
<v Speaker 1>losing their fingers in some molybdenum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>molybdenum,</v>

1615
01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Molybdenum to metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a rare,</v>

1616
01:14:09.481 --> 01:14:10.620
<v Speaker 1>rare metal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1617
01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I never that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just recently heard a cold Tan.</v>

1618
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the stuff that they get in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congo than for self.</v>

1619
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Something that's really good with </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity or something to do with the </v>

1620
01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:25.060
<v Speaker 1>electronic connectivity in the use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phones.</v>

1621
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:26.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1622
01:14:26.591 --> 01:14:31.591
<v Speaker 1>I've found that to be so bizarre and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the more bizarre things in life that </v>

1623
01:14:31.591 --> 01:14:34.670
<v Speaker 1>the most complex stuff that we use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cell phones,</v>

1624
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the very base of it,</v>

1625
01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:39.130
<v Speaker 1>the origins early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a mine,</v>

1626
01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 1>there's a hole in the ground.</v>

1627
01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Also human suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I don't like the idea that </v>

1628
01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:50.281
<v Speaker 1>my computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could really do everything I </v>

1629
01:14:50.281 --> 01:14:53.671
<v Speaker 1>needed to do is rendered obsolete by </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes in operating systems that really</v>

1630
01:14:54.341 --> 01:14:56.470
<v Speaker 1>are unnecessary except to sell another </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

1631
01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference does not,</v>

1632
01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think necessarily because </v>

1633
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.911
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to continue to improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the product and they're continuing to </v>

1634
01:15:05.911 --> 01:15:09.031
<v Speaker 1>add more functionality and believing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that or at least at the rate at which </v>

1635
01:15:09.031 --> 01:15:10.170
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes feel like there's a,</v>

1636
01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.320
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be sort of windows and Intel </v>

1637
01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:18.090
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>windows and make it complex operating </v>

1638
01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:18.090
<v Speaker 1>systems so that you'd have to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next intel chip and then Intel would,</v>

1639
01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:20.620
<v Speaker 1>we'd create a tweak on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes you the next,</v>

1640
01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:25.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next Windows operating system that they </v>

1641
01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:26.990
<v Speaker 1>sort of would leapfrog each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it feels like that with them.</v>

1642
01:15:27.370 --> 01:15:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1643
01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:28.540
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1644
01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:30.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're iphone is better things now.</v>

1645
01:15:30.821 --> 01:15:35.821
<v Speaker 1>Then three iphone to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about all these iphones in the </v>

1646
01:15:35.821 --> 01:15:40.080
<v Speaker 1>garbage and all these people who lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff and the amount of time </v>

1647
01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.400
<v Speaker 1>compressed into one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these devices is really intense.</v>

1648
01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:45.220
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that at least one of our,</v>

1649
01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:50.221
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our goals when we're developing new </v>

1650
01:15:50.221 --> 01:15:50.221
<v Speaker 1>technologies and new technology pathway </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be,</v>

1651
01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:55.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the one that's going to actually </v>

1652
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:55.870
<v Speaker 1>require the sales of the lease up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fewest amount of computers.</v>

1653
01:15:55.871 --> 01:15:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many people are going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could we sell?</v>

1654
01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.170
<v Speaker 1>How could we need to sell less computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that we're,</v>

1655
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't have to throw out these old</v>

1656
01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:05.380
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen those photos of Cuba,</v>

1657
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.880
<v Speaker 1>of the old cars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Cuba doesn't get new cars.</v>

1658
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:14.370
<v Speaker 1>They have cars from like the fifties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties and they are gorgeous.</v>

1659
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:17.110
<v Speaker 1>They're beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do drive like shit.</v>

1660
01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:22.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you drive like a modern day BMW and </v>

1661
01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.310
<v Speaker 1>then you go back to willow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid Chevy's from the 19 fifties,</v>

1662
01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.520
<v Speaker 1>those things are dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They break terrible.</v>

1663
01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:32.521
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they handle like a horse on roller </v>

1664
01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:32.521
<v Speaker 1>skates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their ridiculous cars.</v>

1665
01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:36.600
<v Speaker 1>They're so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how to be thrown into rebel </v>

1666
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:36.600
<v Speaker 1>without a cause today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you hopped in that car.</v>

1667
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.600
<v Speaker 1>It will not be that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be.</v>

1668
01:16:37.601 --> 01:16:39.490
<v Speaker 1>The experience were thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're talking shit.</v>

1669
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:42.460
<v Speaker 1>They're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could with a prius,</v>

1670
01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:45.490
<v Speaker 1>you could easily get away from some guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a 55 chevy.</v>

1671
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:49.360
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are terrible.</v>

1672
01:16:49.361 --> 01:16:53.470
<v Speaker 1>They can't take corners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The breaks of his stupid drum brakes.</v>

1673
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean they might as well have a rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you throw out that's attached to a </v>

1674
01:16:58.650 --> 01:16:58.650
<v Speaker 1>rope to slow your car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell you,</v>

1675
01:16:58.650 --> 01:17:02.010
<v Speaker 1>take a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take a 57 t bird over a segue.</v>

1676
01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1677
01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Over just because it could rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1678
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I liked the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1679
01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:16.540
<v Speaker 1>they've managed to recycle these cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep them working and keep them </v>

1680
01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:19.280
<v Speaker 1>running and it's really cool to see it </v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetically.</v>

1681
01:17:19.281 --> 01:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gorgeous.</v>

1682
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:25.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a modern street in this day and age and </v>

1683
01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.991
<v Speaker 1>you see these beautiful like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell they're proud people </v>

1684
01:17:28.991 --> 01:17:32.561
<v Speaker 1>because these are shiny cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're painted nice and they're done </v>

1685
01:17:32.561 --> 01:17:34.760
<v Speaker 1>well and they're restored well or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least maintained well.</v>

1686
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:40.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many miles some of </v>

1687
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.030
<v Speaker 1>these cars have on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do look,</v>

1688
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 1>it does look amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there is that,</v>

1689
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:46.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a hunger for stuff,</v>

1690
01:17:46.251 --> 01:17:51.251
<v Speaker 1>not just fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also started to sixties madmen </v>

1691
01:17:51.251 --> 01:17:51.860
<v Speaker 1>period that this Dahlia for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

1692
01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.980
<v Speaker 1>that's right before this digital age </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

1693
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:58.010
<v Speaker 1>That's like the height of the TV agents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1694
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:59.930
<v Speaker 1>putting satellites in space.</v>

1695
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.940
<v Speaker 1>There was that innocence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1696
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because people look at these </v>

1697
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.110
<v Speaker 1>kinds of shows and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1698
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>decadence.</v>

1701
01:18:09.711 --> 01:18:10.310
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1702
01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it's about their innocence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1703
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:14.150
<v Speaker 1>they believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got,</v>

1704
01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that,</v>

1705
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:17.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go around La,</v>

1706
01:18:17.691 --> 01:18:22.691
<v Speaker 1>it's like everybody's got hayward </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wakefield in their house and trying to </v>

1707
01:18:22.691 --> 01:18:23.510
<v Speaker 1>get those old g frigerators with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of rounded coverage.</v>

1708
01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:25.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that longing for a,</v>

1709
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:28.340
<v Speaker 1>like the industrial age just feels so </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

1710
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:30.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a solid when people made stuff,</v>

1711
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:32.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just kind of printed,</v>

1712
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:34.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1713
01:18:34.011 --> 01:18:36.980
<v Speaker 1>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also like when you see those cars,</v>

1714
01:18:36.981 --> 01:18:40.100
<v Speaker 1>there's such a human element in that old</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1715
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Like even like sixties muscle cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those were sort of like human </v>

1716
01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.850
<v Speaker 1>created works of art as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1717
01:18:46.851 --> 01:18:49.160
<v Speaker 1>you look at like a new Mazda or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

1718
01:18:49.161 --> 01:18:54.161
<v Speaker 1>a real modern car and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like something that just came </v>

1719
01:18:54.161 --> 01:18:54.161
<v Speaker 1>out of a machine.</v>

1720
01:18:54.161 --> 01:18:55.700
<v Speaker 1>They screwed it together and came out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a machine.</v>

1721
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 1>You looked at like a 69 chevy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like a Chevy Camaro.</v>

1722
01:18:59.481 --> 01:19:04.481
<v Speaker 1>Sixty nine Camaro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something somebody fucking </v>

1723
01:19:04.481 --> 01:19:04.880
<v Speaker 1>screwed together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some men work in behind that.</v>

1724
01:19:04.881 --> 01:19:09.200
<v Speaker 1>There's some people put tires on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheel and bolted in place.</v>

1725
01:19:09.201 --> 01:19:11.450
<v Speaker 1>There's some guys who work some </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrenches.</v>

1726
01:19:11.451 --> 01:19:16.451
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at that thing that's a </v>

1727
01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 1>mechanical creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a a computer creation and we're</v>

1728
01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:22.871
<v Speaker 1>slowly moving towards the Prius and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine with computer creation aesthetic if</v>

1729
01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:28.910
<v Speaker 1>it means that we don't have to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>

1730
01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:35.140
<v Speaker 1>So they get rid of all those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screw it in the screws and then let them</v>

1731
01:19:35.601 --> 01:19:38.800
<v Speaker 1>stay in their houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck ended up,</v>

1732
01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:43.900
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys have to pick up a lot of </v>

1733
01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:43.900
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to evolve with the times.</v>

1734
01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:44.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1735
01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:45.800
<v Speaker 1>so now we have.</v>

1736
01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.630
<v Speaker 1>The big problem in America is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment.</v>

1737
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Obama talking about getting jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

1738
01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Jobs are people who wants a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a job.</v>

1739
01:19:53.091 --> 01:19:54.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't want jobs.</v>

1740
01:19:54.621 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 1>People want this stuff that you get when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a job.</v>

1741
01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.870
<v Speaker 1>They want the money that you get for </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a job,</v>

1742
01:19:59.871 --> 01:20:01.070
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want the jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1743
01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.830
<v Speaker 1>So meanwhile though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got more than enough stuff.</v>

1744
01:20:03.831 --> 01:20:06.470
<v Speaker 1>We're burning food every week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you keep market prices high.</v>

1745
01:20:06.471 --> 01:20:11.471
<v Speaker 1>We're tearing down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bank of America is tearing down houses </v>

1746
01:20:11.471 --> 01:20:11.471
<v Speaker 1>in California because they're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreclosure.</v>

1747
01:20:11.471 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 1>You can't just let someone live in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to bring price down.</v>

1748
01:20:14.701 --> 01:20:16.590
<v Speaker 1>They tear them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they tear them down?</v>

1749
01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Because they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would have to sell at distressed prices </v>

1750
01:20:21.710 --> 01:20:25.161
<v Speaker 1>that would then lower prices of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>properties that they're trying to keep </v>

1751
01:20:25.161 --> 01:20:26.570
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it would cost them more money.</v>

1752
01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:30.620
<v Speaker 1>If you own 10 houses in a town and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to sell,</v>

1753
01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:35.640
<v Speaker 1>you'd rather a tear it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if the bank comes along and create </v>

1754
01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.980
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a program to give houses to</v>
<v Speaker 1>needy people,</v>

1755
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:40.680
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to lower the real estate</v>
<v Speaker 1>values of the,</v>

1756
01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.620
<v Speaker 1>of the mortgages that they've invested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that are already teetering.</v>

1757
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:47.070
<v Speaker 1>So they can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So charity itself becomes unprofitable.</v>

1758
01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:51.540
<v Speaker 1>It's never been quite profitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's like less than unpalatable.</v>

1759
01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:56.580
<v Speaker 1>What if we figured out that okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only need rather than having </v>

1760
01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:59.751
<v Speaker 1>everybody work 40 hour weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is based on a clock and the </v>

1761
01:20:59.751 --> 01:21:02.601
<v Speaker 1>industrial age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much can we have people working at </v>

1762
01:21:02.601 --> 01:21:02.601
<v Speaker 1>weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if people don't really have to work</v>

1763
01:21:02.601 --> 01:21:03.360
<v Speaker 1>that much for us to have everything we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want?</v>

1764
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:05.730
<v Speaker 1>But what if 10 percent of people could </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

1765
01:21:05.731 --> 01:21:10.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two days a week and we get everything </v>

1766
01:21:10.731 --> 01:21:10.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1767
01:21:10.731 --> 01:21:10.731
<v Speaker 1>So you go in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do your work.</v>

1768
01:21:10.731 --> 01:21:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do my work in April 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1769
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.770
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to go again in March.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it got that?</v>

1770
01:21:13.771 --> 01:21:18.771
<v Speaker 1>You really didn't need everybody working</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time for everybody to have </v>

1771
01:21:18.771 --> 01:21:19.230
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't deal with that.</v>

1772
01:21:19.231 --> 01:21:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Not because we don't have technologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

1773
01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:24.000
<v Speaker 1>We can't deal with it because we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an economy.</v>

1774
01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:25.950
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to divvy up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoils.</v>

1775
01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:31.210
<v Speaker 1>You know the reason that you have a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so that you can be entitled to a </v>

1776
01:21:31.210 --> 01:21:31.560
<v Speaker 1>share of what's actually in them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>abundance,</v>

1777
01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:33.570
<v Speaker 1>but because there's not enough jobs for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1778
01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:38.690
<v Speaker 1>we've got to rip up stuff and ruin stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in abundance because we can't </v>

1779
01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:42.831
<v Speaker 1>give it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also the social issue of not </v>

1780
01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:45.591
<v Speaker 1>having jobs when people don't feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've made their own way or pulled </v>

1781
01:21:46.581 --> 01:21:47.400
<v Speaker 1>their own weight.</v>

1782
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.470
<v Speaker 1>They feel unworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel,</v>

1783
01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.860
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta replace employment with </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1784
01:21:55.861 --> 01:21:57.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>employment is a new invention.</v>

1785
01:21:57.331 --> 01:21:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Employment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1786
01:21:58.201 --> 01:22:03.201
<v Speaker 1>industrial age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to work for each other and </v>

1787
01:22:03.201 --> 01:22:03.201
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only got jobs when we got the clock.</v>

1788
01:22:03.201 --> 01:22:06.300
<v Speaker 1>When we could work on the clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're employed or but we don't have</v>

1789
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:09.120
<v Speaker 1>to be employed in order to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to have meaning.</v>

1790
01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:11.340
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have to have your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't stop,</v>

1791
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:14.700
<v Speaker 1>so you just have to find a new niche </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the system.</v>

1792
01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:19.710
<v Speaker 1>You have to find a new thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute to your to the world.</v>

1793
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree with that,</v>

1794
01:22:22.551 --> 01:22:27.551
<v Speaker 1>but too many people find sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>preexisting way to interact and they </v>

1795
01:22:28.261 --> 01:22:32.190
<v Speaker 1>don't create their own way to interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in doing so,</v>

1796
01:22:32.191 --> 01:22:37.191
<v Speaker 1>you oftentimes miss on one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>things which is accomplishing things,</v>

1797
01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:42.620
<v Speaker 1>whether it's accomplishing starting your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own restaurant and keeping it open and </v>

1798
01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.221
<v Speaker 1>in or having a car shop that only fixes </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain type of automobile that you </v>

1799
01:22:46.221 --> 01:22:47.340
<v Speaker 1>really love to work on.</v>

1800
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:50.610
<v Speaker 1>You know when you can figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do something that you actually have a</v>

1801
01:22:50.611 --> 01:22:52.280
<v Speaker 1>passion for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the the,</v>

1802
01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.720
<v Speaker 1>the old cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stops becoming work.</v>

1803
01:22:54.721 --> 01:22:56.980
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes you're you.</v>

1804
01:22:57.010 --> 01:23:02.010
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a thing that you love and </v>

1805
01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:05.170
<v Speaker 1>you're in flow at that point and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people have that and that's problem</v>

1806
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.900
<v Speaker 1>is you can't have it in this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

1807
01:23:07.901 --> 01:23:12.901
<v Speaker 1>You can have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have this kind of education </v>

1808
01:23:12.901 --> 01:23:12.901
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have it.</v>

1809
01:23:12.901 --> 01:23:15.050
<v Speaker 1>What about just real naturally dull </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that need to be pushed in certain</v>

1810
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:16.330
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1811
01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:21.360
<v Speaker 1>so not everyone has to be the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures out how to do the new method of </v>

1812
01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 1>biodynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rudolph Steiner farming on their organic</v>

1813
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:30.240
<v Speaker 1>community supported agriculture plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone can just go there and plant </v>

1814
01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:35.360
<v Speaker 1>plant carrots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the issue of how human beings </v>

1815
01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:38.431
<v Speaker 1>are raised in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so huge and not really </v>

1816
01:23:38.431 --> 01:23:38.431
<v Speaker 1>addressed the.</v>

1817
01:23:38.431 --> 01:23:42.830
<v Speaker 1>The reason why some of these people fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>into these mindless jobs is because </v>

1818
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:45.110
<v Speaker 1>never along the line of they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulated neverland,</v>

1819
01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.800
<v Speaker 1>one by their family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the school systems,</v>

1820
01:23:47.801 --> 01:23:49.870
<v Speaker 1>by their environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by their atmosphere,</v>

1821
01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:50.890
<v Speaker 1>by their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1822
01:23:50.891 --> 01:23:53.470
<v Speaker 1>their fellow knuckleheads in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1823
01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:58.290
<v Speaker 1>They're all just surrounded by people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are either likeminded or less or you</v>

1824
01:23:58.291 --> 01:24:01.120
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or support it and you kind of fucked.</v>

1825
01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.660
<v Speaker 1>And then when something comes along that</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminates that job for that guy,</v>

1826
01:24:04.661 --> 01:24:09.661
<v Speaker 1>that robot job when he was 45 years old </v>
<v Speaker 1>or 50 years old and he has to start </v>

1827
01:24:09.661 --> 01:24:14.581
<v Speaker 1>again and sort of reignite some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>passion and curiosity or die off like a </v>

1828
01:24:14.581 --> 01:24:15.490
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard too,</v>

1829
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.620
<v Speaker 1>because he was liking the thing he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1830
01:24:17.621 --> 01:24:20.020
<v Speaker 1>if he's a toll collector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1831
01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:22.480
<v Speaker 1>and you get better and better at it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start,</v>

1832
01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then test to see how many people you can</v>

1833
01:24:24.521 --> 01:24:29.521
<v Speaker 1>make eye contact with when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the towels and the how many </v>

1834
01:24:29.521 --> 01:24:29.521
<v Speaker 1>lives can you change with that?</v>

1835
01:24:29.521 --> 01:24:29.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

1836
01:24:29.521 --> 01:24:32.350
<v Speaker 1>he can be that you could live the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodhisattva life as a toll collector.</v>

1837
01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take that away from him and it's </v>

1838
01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:37.850
<v Speaker 1>not just that he can't be retrained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have motivation,</v>

1839
01:24:37.851 --> 01:24:42.851
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not his fault that they broke his </v>

1840
01:24:42.851 --> 01:24:45.421
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have a show where a guy's a </v>

1841
01:24:45.421 --> 01:24:47.590
<v Speaker 1>toll collector and just see how he </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacts with people and then give them</v>

1842
01:24:47.591 --> 01:24:48.540
<v Speaker 1>projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1843
01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:53.580
<v Speaker 1>today you're just going to casually </v>
<v Speaker 1>mention your penis and let's see how </v>

1844
01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:56.590
<v Speaker 1>many people freak out back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to your reality roots.</v>

1845
01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be funny.</v>

1846
01:24:58.941 --> 01:25:00.910
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do a toll collector.</v>

1847
01:25:00.911 --> 01:25:02.480
<v Speaker 1>You got to do it pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

1848
01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:07.980
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a weird way to experiment how </v>
<v Speaker 1>people interact when they don't have to.</v>

1849
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:09.850
<v Speaker 1>It was really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1850
01:25:09.851 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 1>how many people treat you like shit?</v>

1851
01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:12.400
<v Speaker 1>How many people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing?</v>

1852
01:25:12.401 --> 01:25:13.240
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

1853
01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right man.</v>

1854
01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Take care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this.</v>

1855
01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.510
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get a broad variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people interacted with you.</v>

1856
01:25:19.511 --> 01:25:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that'll be kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't like hold up as a series,</v>

1857
01:25:23.230 --> 01:25:26.530
<v Speaker 1>but maybe a one hour special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tall guy.</v>

1858
01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1859
01:25:27.670 --> 01:25:29.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have a guy and you have,</v>

1860
01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:32.770
<v Speaker 1>we have to do like break it up with like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sit down.</v>

1861
01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chairs and then have a discussion </v>

1862
01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:38.120
<v Speaker 1>about the last couple of ones that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen and what it really means.</v>

1863
01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.700
<v Speaker 1>People love that fast track thing now </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1864
01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:40.740
<v Speaker 1>they won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to pay it.</v>

1865
01:25:40.741 --> 01:25:45.741
<v Speaker 1>Totally want to put that little thing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they just go through like New </v>

1866
01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:49.890
<v Speaker 1>York is one of the weirdest scenarios </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever because somewhere along the line </v>

1867
01:25:49.890 --> 01:25:51.280
<v Speaker 1>they just decided to make people pay to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the city.</v>

1868
01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:55.090
<v Speaker 1>It used to be that they were paying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the bridge built,</v>

1869
01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:58.990
<v Speaker 1>but they paid that fucking thing off a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>

1870
01:25:58.991 --> 01:26:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Every bridge got paid off a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

1871
01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:06.080
<v Speaker 1>but revenue is so intoxicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just kept with it.</v>

1872
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.070
<v Speaker 1>We can understand that in California </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't really have a plate.</v>

1873
01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:12.080
<v Speaker 1>We could get anywhere it was bitches </v>
<v Speaker 1>were built,</v>

1874
01:26:12.081 --> 01:26:15.830
<v Speaker 1>but now they got to all be rebuilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuilt.</v>

1875
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hudson bridge.</v>

1876
01:26:17.481 --> 01:26:22.481
<v Speaker 1>They were building and building and </v>
<v Speaker 1>building and by the time they've </v>

1877
01:26:22.481 --> 01:26:22.481
<v Speaker 1>finished they had to start rebuilding it</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1878
01:26:22.481 --> 01:26:25.280
<v Speaker 1>It was that many years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two reasons why that's nonsense.</v>

1879
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:30.470
<v Speaker 1>The big one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the dumbest way to make traffic.</v>

1880
01:26:30.650 --> 01:26:33.950
<v Speaker 1>You have a spot where everyone has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop on the way into the city.</v>

1881
01:26:33.951 --> 01:26:38.951
<v Speaker 1>That is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you are going from Long Island to </v>

1882
01:26:38.951 --> 01:26:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the most maddening shit to do at</v>

1883
01:26:41.871 --> 01:26:42.950
<v Speaker 1>8:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

1884
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you want to fucking kill somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so stupid box.</v>

1885
01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.940
<v Speaker 1>You should make people pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1886
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:54.860
<v Speaker 1>either either you could justify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of the bridge,</v>

1887
01:26:54.861 --> 01:26:59.861
<v Speaker 1>the maintaining of the bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they should pay for through their </v>

1888
01:26:59.861 --> 01:27:02.111
<v Speaker 1>taxes and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There shouldn't be a spot we have to </v>

1889
01:27:02.111 --> 01:27:03.860
<v Speaker 1>stop because that's fucking dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why you would want to do</v>

1890
01:27:03.861 --> 01:27:08.861
<v Speaker 1>that is you want to check cars for bombs</v>
<v Speaker 1>are nutty people or are you just trying </v>

1891
01:27:08.861 --> 01:27:09.200
<v Speaker 1>to discourage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1892
01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess maybe try to discourage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get people onto the lirr and do rapid </v>

1893
01:27:14.230 --> 01:27:19.091
<v Speaker 1>transit the way God intended and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourage people from coming into the </v>

1894
01:27:19.091 --> 01:27:19.091
<v Speaker 1>city because the easier it is to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the city,</v>

1895
01:27:19.091 --> 01:27:21.140
<v Speaker 1>the more the traffic sucks and it sucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

1896
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:26.230
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible when make it suck and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge for making it knapsack stuck.</v>

1897
01:27:28.090 --> 01:27:32.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't fix the suck that way you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck $20.</v>

1898
01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:33.260
<v Speaker 1>We'll give you the green light.</v>

1899
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you live in Manhattan now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you live in New York?</v>

1900
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I live in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in Westchester County.</v>

1901
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I lived in new Rochelle for a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Hudson.</v>

1902
01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

1903
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful area.</v>

1904
01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.330
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole Westchester.</v>

1905
01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.660
<v Speaker 1>It's got some nice pots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1906
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:53.270
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little snooty.</v>

1907
01:27:53.271 --> 01:27:58.271
<v Speaker 1>Some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a couple of towns in </v>

1908
01:27:58.271 --> 01:27:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Westchester that kind of retained some </v>
<v Speaker 1>little shit to reality,</v>

1909
01:27:58.851 --> 01:28:01.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just westchester is a weird.</v>

1910
01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:03.830
<v Speaker 1>It is though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be in a neighborhood where you're</v>

1911
01:28:03.831 --> 01:28:08.831
<v Speaker 1>seeing these mansions with these giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawns and then you'll go a half a mile </v>

1912
01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:13.190
<v Speaker 1>and you're in the projects and projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a little more.</v>

1913
01:28:13.191 --> 01:28:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Jersey Jersey ask drive through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oranges.</v>

1914
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

1915
01:28:17.031 --> 01:28:18.590
<v Speaker 1>you get that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1916
01:28:18.591 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 1>most of Westchester is pretty a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>affluent at this point,</v>

1917
01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:23.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1918
01:28:23.961 --> 01:28:25.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not as affluent as Manhattan.</v>

1919
01:28:26.710 --> 01:28:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan is the most affluent and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1920
01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:29.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1921
01:28:29.361 --> 01:28:30.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

1922
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:33.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're inside Bloomberg's bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you made it in there somehow,</v>

1923
01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:35.600
<v Speaker 1>you know when you entered the apartment </v>
<v Speaker 1>was Amelia and I,</v>

1924
01:28:35.601 --> 01:28:37.970
<v Speaker 1>you've got $10,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>of real estate or something,</v>

1925
01:28:38.450 --> 01:28:39.230
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1926
01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:41.720
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else doesn't quite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite that.</v>

1927
01:28:41.721 --> 01:28:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Those places are madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those multimillion dollar apartments,</v>

1928
01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:50.780
<v Speaker 1>like the way of living in the big city </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is so alien.</v>

1929
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It's only exists in Manhattan where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have so many people living in apartments</v>

1930
01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:59.120
<v Speaker 1>and it creates a different community and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1931
01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:03.650
<v Speaker 1>in the sense it's more than than Los </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles.</v>

1932
01:29:04.210 --> 01:29:04.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1933
01:29:04.601 --> 01:29:06.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most things about it are,</v>

1934
01:29:06.670 --> 01:29:11.670
<v Speaker 3>are kind of more consonant with our era </v>
<v Speaker 3>in our digital economy and all that.</v>

1935
01:29:12.071 --> 01:29:15.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a better carbon footprint is stack </v>
<v Speaker 3>people up like that,</v>

1936
01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:17.710
<v Speaker 3>that they have everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in lawns and fertilizer and whatever</v>

1937
01:29:17.711 --> 01:29:19.450
<v Speaker 3>else they get in the suburbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1938
01:29:19.451 --> 01:29:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1939
01:29:19.891 --> 01:29:21.790
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good on,</v>

1940
01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:26.850
<v Speaker 3>on most of those levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just New York itself is so crazy </v>

1941
01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:27.040
<v Speaker 3>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1942
01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:30.130
<v Speaker 3>through God knows what sort of real </v>
<v Speaker 3>estate shenanigans are done.</v>

1943
01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:33.400
<v Speaker 3>That's what sort of then for me colors </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1944
01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:36.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the experience of urban joy there,</v>

1945
01:29:36.431 --> 01:29:39.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no one is an artist or a writer.</v>

1946
01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Regular of a regular means could live </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1947
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets really crazy when </v>

1948
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:49.290
<v Speaker 1>you see a small apartment is like 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks a month and you're like,</v>

1949
01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:51.180
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just nuts.</v>

1950
01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:53.830
<v Speaker 1>That means a guy who makes $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

1951
01:29:53.831 --> 01:29:56.640
<v Speaker 1>it has to give up three quarters of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>income to pay his fucking rent.</v>

1952
01:29:56.970 --> 01:29:57.810
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

1953
01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.320
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

1954
01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:01.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you need crime,</v>

1955
01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:03.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make it better,</v>

1956
01:30:03.821 --> 01:30:06.640
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd go back to the era of,</v>

1957
01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:08.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basquiat,</v>

1958
01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.150
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't live in Manhattan and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1959
01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:16.200
<v Speaker 3>none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of the folks from then one of the </v>

1960
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:16.200
<v Speaker 3>ramones or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they were queens actually,</v>

1961
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:16.600
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1962
01:30:16.601 --> 01:30:20.000
<v Speaker 3>or Warhol or any of his 42nd street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real.</v>

1963
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:22.670
<v Speaker 3>But that's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like exhausting.</v>

1964
01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.070
<v Speaker 3>It was criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1965
01:30:24.071 --> 01:30:25.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was awful.</v>

1966
01:30:25.450 --> 01:30:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1967
01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:27.880
<v Speaker 3>It was terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

1968
01:30:27.881 --> 01:30:30.160
<v Speaker 3>there's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some part that wax nostalgic,</v>

1969
01:30:30.161 --> 01:30:33.340
<v Speaker 3>but that's not a good old days that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really want to return to either.</v>

1970
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:38.550
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you have a New York that works </v>

1971
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:41.440
<v Speaker 3>and is still artistic and alive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>vibrant and fertile and not have people,</v>

1972
01:30:41.441 --> 01:30:42.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting stabbed in the stomach.</v>

1973
01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how can you have so many rich people</v>

1974
01:30:45.231 --> 01:30:50.231
<v Speaker 1>live in together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you have to be rich to live </v>

1975
01:30:50.231 --> 01:30:50.231
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1976
01:30:50.231 --> 01:30:51.770
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really difficult to pull off living</v>

1977
01:30:51.771 --> 01:30:54.910
<v Speaker 1>in Manhattan if you don't have at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1978
01:30:55.690 --> 01:30:59.330
<v Speaker 1>upper middle class income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1979
01:30:59.510 --> 01:31:01.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange place.</v>

1980
01:31:01.101 --> 01:31:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Unlike any place in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1981
01:31:03.351 --> 01:31:08.351
<v Speaker 1>there's no place in the country that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so overvalued and you can get a decent </v>

1982
01:31:08.351 --> 01:31:11.441
<v Speaker 1>apartment in San Francisco for half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you'd spend on an apartment in </v>

1983
01:31:11.441 --> 01:31:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco now has gotten worse.</v>

1984
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Something one of those lists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1985
01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:20.680
<v Speaker 1>look the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some places outside of San </v>

1986
01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Francisco that are just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're,</v>

1987
01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm near Stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1988
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:24.350
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1989
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called Atherton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the highest real estate in the </v>

1990
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.470
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1991
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:33.610
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at these people that I know </v>

1992
01:31:33.610 --> 01:31:36.011
<v Speaker 1>have this house up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an acre and a half is worth </v>

1993
01:31:36.011 --> 01:31:37.520
<v Speaker 1>$15,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fucking look into this.</v>

1994
01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

1995
01:31:39.441 --> 01:31:44.441
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like everybody in that </v>

1996
01:31:44.441 --> 01:31:44.441
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood is all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all tech people.</v>

1997
01:31:44.441 --> 01:31:49.060
<v Speaker 1>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all made insane amounts of money </v>

1998
01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:50.150
<v Speaker 1>and the various tech bubbles and booms </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the years and all that.</v>

1999
01:31:50.151 --> 01:31:55.151
<v Speaker 1>Google money's up there and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple money's up there and there's just </v>

2000
01:31:55.151 --> 01:31:57.920
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fucking people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible amounts of cash up there.</v>

2001
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 1>So real estate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need houses.</v>

2002
01:31:59.831 --> 01:32:04.831
<v Speaker 1>This is what they live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So real estate's through the fucking </v>

2003
01:32:04.831 --> 01:32:04.831
<v Speaker 1>roof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2004
01:32:04.831 --> 01:32:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Like you will look if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

2005
01:32:06.181 --> 01:32:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy doing that sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like could I live in Phoenix?</v>

2006
01:32:09.431 --> 01:32:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2007
01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:15.380
<v Speaker 1>what the neighborhoods are like in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix and I'll go look at real estate </v>

2008
01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:17.841
<v Speaker 1>in Phoenix for a goof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look in Atherton and what's </v>

2009
01:32:17.841 --> 01:32:17.841
<v Speaker 1>$11,000,000?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll like,</v>

2010
01:32:17.841 --> 01:32:17.980
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>

2011
01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:22.980
<v Speaker 1>That's $11,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they got to be bike distance from </v>

2012
01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:26.220
<v Speaker 1>facebook or wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing bubble of,</v>

2013
01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:31.260
<v Speaker 1>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this strange one of really strange </v>

2014
01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:34.771
<v Speaker 1>one because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go a mile over and we've stopped at </v>

2015
01:32:34.771 --> 01:32:35.740
<v Speaker 1>this Wendy's and it was like a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>sketchy Wendy's.</v>

2016
01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this place is kind of fucking dirt </v>

2017
01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.760
<v Speaker 1>baggish to be a mile away from a $15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollar house.</v>

2018
01:32:42.761 --> 01:32:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so strange how there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle anymore.</v>

2019
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of got,</v>

2020
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:48.200
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got spun out in the,</v>

2021
01:32:48.210 --> 01:32:52.030
<v Speaker 1>in the spin cycle at the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This industrial age here.</v>

2022
01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Well you can't say there's none,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean just and certainly a </v>

2023
01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:57.440
<v Speaker 1>diminished very little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very little.</v>

2024
01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:58.610
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're saying no,</v>

2025
01:32:58.611 --> 01:32:59.750
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

2026
01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:03.520
<v Speaker 1>if that lower 98 percent or 99 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

2027
01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:08.940
<v Speaker 1>a gets fed up enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll network with itself rather than </v>

2028
01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:10.060
<v Speaker 1>trying to get something down from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>

2029
01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't even fed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like we only act when we forced</v>

2030
01:33:13.271 --> 01:33:15.370
<v Speaker 1>to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need a desperation.</v>

2031
01:33:15.371 --> 01:33:15.980
<v Speaker 1>We need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2032
01:33:16.050 --> 01:33:21.050
<v Speaker 1>we need to have no options and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>move into this new stage of </v>

2033
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.050
<v Speaker 1>understanding what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem.</v>

2034
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:22.750
<v Speaker 1>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's different.</v>

2035
01:33:22.810 --> 01:33:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2036
01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole point of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being in the president of </v>

2037
01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:31.411
<v Speaker 1>presenteeism is that instead of going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Long March on some other 20th </v>

2038
01:33:31.411 --> 01:33:35.791
<v Speaker 1>century movement or this eyes on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prize and just the means justify the </v>

2039
01:33:35.791 --> 01:33:37.540
<v Speaker 1>means battle to the future thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go,</v>

2040
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:39.430
<v Speaker 1>screw all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just want it now.</v>

2041
01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:41.320
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

2042
01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:43.150
<v Speaker 1>So encouraging about the occupy </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

2043
01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:45.190
<v Speaker 1>What are your demands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from us?</v>

2044
01:33:45.191 --> 01:33:46.390
<v Speaker 1>We didn't want anything from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2045
01:33:46.391 --> 01:33:47.770
<v Speaker 1>it was like we're not going to stay at </v>
<v Speaker 1>our demands.</v>

2046
01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Were going to actually do this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2047
01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2048
01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll do what thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there the real issue,</v>

2049
01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:58.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To try to occupy the world in which we </v>

2050
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.610
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

2051
01:33:58.610 --> 01:34:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I liked in the occupy movement to white </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood cells.</v>

2052
01:34:01.290 --> 01:34:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Like they recognize there's an issue and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gather around it and you know,</v>

2053
01:34:05.531 --> 01:34:08.300
<v Speaker 1>it's like if calls attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue and you know,</v>

2054
01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:09.500
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

2055
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:11.680
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gathering around a six spot.</v>

2056
01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean that they know there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong here.</v>

2057
01:34:14.771 --> 01:34:15.860
<v Speaker 1>And so everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2058
01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:17.860
<v Speaker 1>this is the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all going down right there.</v>

2059
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:21.910
<v Speaker 1>They try to educate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do teach ends and learn about stuff</v>

2060
01:34:21.911 --> 01:34:26.911
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people know more about these </v>

2061
01:34:26.911 --> 01:34:28.951
<v Speaker 1>issues now than did before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they see it as a super longterm </v>

2062
01:34:28.951 --> 01:34:29.290
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2063
01:34:29.291 --> 01:34:32.530
<v Speaker 1>this year they did an occupied debt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the debt jubilee.</v>

2064
01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So what they're doing is buying pennies </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the dollar,</v>

2065
01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:36.600
<v Speaker 1>the debt of people like you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2066
01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.370
<v Speaker 1>health bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't pay and all that because it's</v>

2067
01:34:38.371 --> 01:34:43.371
<v Speaker 1>just owned by credit companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they buy the debt and just believe </v>

2068
01:34:43.371 --> 01:34:43.371
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2069
01:34:43.371 --> 01:34:43.371
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2070
01:34:43.371 --> 01:34:48.270
<v Speaker 1>they take $10 in relief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thousand bucks a debt and it's </v>

2071
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.270
<v Speaker 1>well worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2072
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:52.771
<v Speaker 1>That's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a great community </v>

2073
01:34:52.771 --> 01:34:56.221
<v Speaker 1>idea that there's a lot of people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that I have a spare $5 or a spare </v>

2074
01:34:56.221 --> 01:34:57.830
<v Speaker 1>$10 you won't even think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you get of those people,</v>

2075
01:34:57.831 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 1>you can</v>

2076
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.800
<v Speaker 3>enact some real change and really help </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2077
01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think is like what,</v>

2078
01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:08.680
<v Speaker 3>what is the best way besides podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>besides books and besides having actual </v>

2079
01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:12.320
<v Speaker 3>conversations with people where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>explore these ideas,</v>

2080
01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:17.650
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the best way to get people to </v>

2081
01:35:17.650 --> 01:35:20.291
<v Speaker 3>understand that true happiness really </v>
<v Speaker 3>does come from a sense of community </v>

2082
01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:23.950
<v Speaker 3>where one of the interviews that I saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you,</v>

2083
01:35:23.951 --> 01:35:27.170
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about your youth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about living in a place</v>

2084
01:35:27.171 --> 01:35:32.171
<v Speaker 3>where you all shared a large backyard </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it became sort of a community thing </v>

2085
01:35:32.171 --> 01:35:36.311
<v Speaker 3>where everybody would get together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have like a barbecue and then queens and</v>

2086
01:35:36.771 --> 01:35:41.771
<v Speaker 3>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like one barbecue pit at the end </v>

2087
01:35:41.771 --> 01:35:41.771
<v Speaker 3>of the block that was just on all </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend.</v>

2088
01:35:41.771 --> 01:35:44.030
<v Speaker 3>That's when we were lower middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad got a better job.</v>

2089
01:35:44.031 --> 01:35:46.390
<v Speaker 3>We leave Queens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd go to Larchmont in scarsdale.</v>

2090
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:46.910
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2091
01:35:46.911 --> 01:35:48.340
<v Speaker 3>these Westchester towns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>

2092
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like you don't barbecue with </v>

2093
01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:53.530
<v Speaker 3>the Joneses anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you barbecue it against the Jones.</v>

2094
01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:55.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like every single family has got </v>
<v Speaker 3>its own,</v>

2095
01:35:55.431 --> 01:35:59.480
<v Speaker 3>like $300 a weber grill in the backyard </v>
<v Speaker 3>and no one would think,</v>

2096
01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:04.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you can invite someone over I </v>

2097
01:36:04.650 --> 01:36:06.251
<v Speaker 3>suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that barbecuing was this </v>

2098
01:36:06.251 --> 01:36:08.351
<v Speaker 3>solo family activity and I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about as far as the grill company's </v>

2099
01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:10.130
<v Speaker 3>concern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's better.</v>

2100
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:15.310
<v Speaker 3>They'd rather everyone have a grill and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody grilled together because then </v>

2101
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:17.000
<v Speaker 3>they get to sell more grills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2102
01:36:17.001 --> 01:36:18.420
<v Speaker 3>but what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2103
01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:20.210
<v Speaker 3>I've looked in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2104
01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.860
<v Speaker 3>not the neighborhood I'm in now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but never.</v>

2105
01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:26.900
<v Speaker 3>I almost went to because like everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the block had a snowblower and I'm </v>

2106
01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:30.431
<v Speaker 3>thinking that's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like 10 houses with 10 </v>

2107
01:36:30.431 --> 01:36:33.221
<v Speaker 3>snowblowers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many snowbirds do you need per </v>

2108
01:36:33.221 --> 01:36:33.221
<v Speaker 3>driveway?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that.</v>

2109
01:36:33.221 --> 01:36:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Every two houses share one for every </v>
<v Speaker 3>four houses shared one.</v>

2110
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Want to get up in the morning and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to talk to Mr Johnson can use</v>

2111
01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:44.750
<v Speaker 3>the snowblower first because you got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be at work at 7:30.</v>

2112
01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:48.210
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to talk to Mr Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the phase a Douche bag?</v>

2113
01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:53.620
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you should be able to have your </v>

2114
01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:55.001
<v Speaker 3>own snowblower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a huge bag is because he's </v>

2115
01:36:55.001 --> 01:36:56.070
<v Speaker 3>working overtime to save up for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2116
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:04.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's not a lot of people that </v>

2117
01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.961
<v Speaker 3>are happy out there as the roads quote </v>
<v Speaker 3>that most men live lives of silent </v>

2118
01:37:07.961 --> 01:37:12.371
<v Speaker 3>desperation today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Loud desperation and Marshall McLuhan's </v>

2119
01:37:12.371 --> 01:37:17.021
<v Speaker 3>quote that humans are the sex organs of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the machine world and that has this </v>

2120
01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:21.230
<v Speaker 3>desire to keep up with the Joneses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to pay for those Weber grills,</v>

2121
01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the disconnects us,</v>

2122
01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:26.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walk in a room now and I feel it feels</v>

2123
01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:28.550
<v Speaker 3>different when I see people sitting on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their devices.</v>

2124
01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:33.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you used to walk into a room with a </v>

2125
01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.261
<v Speaker 3>bunch of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You walk in here and you guys have </v>

2126
01:37:35.261 --> 01:37:35.261
<v Speaker 3>devices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can feel the family,</v>

2127
01:37:35.261 --> 01:37:38.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can feel you guys are on an animal </v>

2128
01:37:38.710 --> 01:37:38.710
<v Speaker 3>level in touch with each other's vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2129
01:37:38.710 --> 01:37:42.710
<v Speaker 3>On whatever that subtle level is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go into rooms now and I don't feel</v>

2130
01:37:42.711 --> 01:37:47.711
<v Speaker 3>the same group dynamic group presence </v>
<v Speaker 3>than I used to even teach in a class,</v>

2131
01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:50.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago versus going into one today</v>

2132
01:37:50.391 --> 01:37:53.300
<v Speaker 3>when everybody's reading what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>

2133
01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:55.880
<v Speaker 3>It's just different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's worse,</v>

2134
01:37:55.881 --> 01:37:56.060
<v Speaker 3>so though</v>

2135
01:37:56.060 --> 01:38:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a qualitatively different </v>

2136
01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.820
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have more choice over what they do.</v>

2137
01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.860
<v Speaker 1>They can divide their attention the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want,</v>

2138
01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.080
<v Speaker 1>they have more autonomy over all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2139
01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:12.081
<v Speaker 1>but they're losing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's out there on the net </v>

2140
01:38:12.081 --> 01:38:12.270
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe by the time we're in the great,</v>

2141
01:38:12.271 --> 01:38:14.710
<v Speaker 1>great second life we reconnect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

2142
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:19.750
<v Speaker 1>they're missing a certain subtle animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact that we don't yet fully </v>

2143
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:20.310
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he just needs to be mitigated.</v>

2144
01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:25.311
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe we need to just understand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explore like the ethics of a when to and</v>

2145
01:38:27.271 --> 01:38:32.271
<v Speaker 1>not to use cell phones when to and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to connect and encourage more connection</v>

2146
01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:34.860
<v Speaker 1>and like let people know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2147
01:38:34.861 --> 01:38:36.990
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is an impulse.</v>

2148
01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Just like washing your hands too a or </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like there's like a lack of </v>

2149
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:46.221
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction in the satisfying or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>completion of that impulse to check </v>

2150
01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:47.280
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

2151
01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.630
<v Speaker 1>You check your twitter checking twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2152
01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:53.800
<v Speaker 1>what are you getting out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not pay attention to the person </v>

2153
01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:56.121
<v Speaker 1>who's in front of you but you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it so like a nutty person washes their </v>

2154
01:38:56.121 --> 01:38:56.121
<v Speaker 1>hands 100 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point.</v>

2155
01:38:56.121 --> 01:39:01.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole reason I write in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>books are that book before this one is </v>

2156
01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.450
<v Speaker 1>called program or be programmed and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea was just to give people sort of the</v>

2157
01:39:03.451 --> 01:39:08.451
<v Speaker 1>10 biases of digital media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're really good for doing </v>

2158
01:39:08.451 --> 01:39:11.421
<v Speaker 1>things far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be doing things </v>

2159
01:39:11.421 --> 01:39:11.421
<v Speaker 1>with someone in the same room because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>

2160
01:39:11.421 --> 01:39:13.200
<v Speaker 1>They're just really simple stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that or this time idea,</v>

2161
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:16.710
<v Speaker 1>which is that digital technologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>asynchronous,</v>

2162
01:39:16.711 --> 01:39:21.711
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't live in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't you try to keep up with it </v>

2163
01:39:21.711 --> 01:39:22.410
<v Speaker 1>because it's not in your temporal </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

2164
01:39:22.411 --> 01:39:23.910
<v Speaker 1>It's in its own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2165
01:39:23.911 --> 01:39:27.660
<v Speaker 1>and you can make it conformed to yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly don't run and chase it.</v>

2166
01:39:27.690 --> 01:39:28.590
<v Speaker 1>It's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of,</v>

2167
01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.500
<v Speaker 1>it's at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's education,</v>

2168
01:39:31.501 --> 01:39:34.080
<v Speaker 1>it's just having the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting people.</v>

2169
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they become more aware than you know,</v>

2170
01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:45.050
<v Speaker 1>then they stand a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly think a lot of these things </v>

2171
01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:47.991
<v Speaker 1>is sort of snuck up on us and we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>all do with a lesson or at least an idea</v>

2172
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:52.200
<v Speaker 1>of how to manage them more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2173
01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:53.830
<v Speaker 1>More humanly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2174
01:39:53.831 --> 01:39:58.831
<v Speaker 1>In the trick is for people not to see it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this has been my whole thing not to </v>

2175
01:39:58.831 --> 01:40:00.210
<v Speaker 1>see the messenger of this as the one who</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2176
01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff's so bad.</v>

2177
01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the children are turning more </v>

2178
01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:06.710
<v Speaker 1>violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2179
01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:09.051
<v Speaker 1>that whole kind of pbs ish hand wringing</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that so many writers are out </v>

2180
01:40:09.391 --> 01:40:09.720
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2181
01:40:09.721 --> 01:40:12.030
<v Speaker 1>are you for technology or against it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it or against it.</v>

2182
01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:13.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're not just going,</v>

2183
01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Yay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go business.</v>

2184
01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.320
<v Speaker 1>They think you're against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2185
01:40:16.321 --> 01:40:16.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2186
01:40:16.621 --> 01:40:21.621
<v Speaker 1>I'm for technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just against the way were happened </v>

2187
01:40:21.621 --> 01:40:22.500
<v Speaker 1>to be using it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any.</v>

2188
01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a coincidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are.</v>

2189
01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I think fundamentally less happy now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think than they have been in a long </v>

2190
01:40:31.441 --> 01:40:32.910
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the amount of people that</v>

2191
01:40:32.911 --> 01:40:37.911
<v Speaker 1>are on medication for happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really what it is and if you're on </v>

2192
01:40:37.911 --> 01:40:42.591
<v Speaker 1>an antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially you're on a medication for </v>

2193
01:40:42.591 --> 01:40:44.310
<v Speaker 1>happiness and whether or not that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of a chemical imbalance that you</v>

2194
01:40:44.311 --> 01:40:49.311
<v Speaker 1>suffer from or because of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your job sucks in your life sucks and </v>

2195
01:40:49.311 --> 01:40:49.311
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

2196
01:40:49.311 --> 01:40:53.691
<v Speaker 1>you're just filled with suck every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're responding to the well for </v>

2197
01:40:53.691 --> 01:40:53.860
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at those numbers,</v>

2198
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:56.380
<v Speaker 3>one or two things is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably both.</v>

2199
01:40:56.470 --> 01:41:01.470
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting fucked over by these </v>

2200
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:02.680
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical companies and they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>unethical doctors to prescribe that shit</v>

2201
01:41:02.710 --> 01:41:06.310
<v Speaker 3>with impunity and there's that for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's also like,</v>

2202
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:08.620
<v Speaker 3>people are not connected to this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

2203
01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.370
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't feel satisfied in great pain.</v>

2204
01:41:12.371 --> 01:41:15.220
<v Speaker 3>It's better to only be in moderate pain </v>
<v Speaker 3>or mild pain.</v>

2205
01:41:15.221 --> 01:41:16.720
<v Speaker 3>If you can take a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2206
01:41:16.730 --> 01:41:18.760
<v Speaker 3>what's hard to do is to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

2207
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:21.260
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually that pain is,</v>

2208
01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:24.610
<v Speaker 3>is kind of a good sign because it means </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we all need to kind of work here to</v>

2209
01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:26.860
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to change the way the world is and,</v>

2210
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:27.640
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2211
01:41:27.641 --> 01:41:30.550
<v Speaker 3>and take some action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pain is trying to get you to change.</v>

2212
01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:35.780
<v Speaker 3>The paint is trying to get you to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pain and you should use your logic </v>

2213
01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:35.780
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2214
01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:35.780
<v Speaker 3>what's causing this pain?</v>

2215
01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:36.280
<v Speaker 3>But there's a disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2216
01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not emotionally satisfied.</v>

2217
01:41:38.441 --> 01:41:40.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm not connecting with my fellow </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans.</v>

2218
01:41:40.241 --> 01:41:43.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm missing something unless you're up </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the wall and there's nothing you</v>

2219
01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:47.020
<v Speaker 3>can do to change your circumstances and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wishing to take the pill.</v>

2220
01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:50.350
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the danger there.</v>

2221
01:41:50.351 --> 01:41:53.050
<v Speaker 3>But I do think that more people can </v>
<v Speaker 3>start to get in touch.</v>

2222
01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:54.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it's these rhythms,</v>

2223
01:41:54.911 --> 01:41:56.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rhythms of life,</v>

2224
01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:58.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 28 day lunar cycle and the fact that</v>

2225
01:41:58.811 --> 01:42:01.810
<v Speaker 3>each week of a lunar cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your neurotransmitters change,</v>

2226
01:42:02.050 --> 01:42:07.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have siedel Coleen week followed </v>

2227
01:42:07.050 --> 01:42:07.050
<v Speaker 3>by a serotonin week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>filed by a dopamine.</v>

2228
01:42:07.050 --> 01:42:09.400
<v Speaker 3>We followed by a norepinephrine week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like every month is one bump,</v>

2229
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:10.600
<v Speaker 3>bump bump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know that,</v>

2230
01:42:10.810 --> 01:42:11.590
<v Speaker 3>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2231
01:42:11.591 --> 01:42:13.810
<v Speaker 3>this is the dopamine week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I feel like this.</v>

2232
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Or I'm getting strangely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2233
01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.120
<v Speaker 3>we go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a website,</v>

2234
01:42:19.121 --> 01:42:21.340
<v Speaker 3>someone space.org</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's got it,</v>

2235
01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.480
<v Speaker 3>he's got it laid out.</v>

2236
01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.430
<v Speaker 3>There was originally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an Olympic trainer,</v>

2237
01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.950
<v Speaker 3>irving Dardick who figured this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2238
01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:27.600
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2239
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:32.790
<v Speaker 3>doing exercising people at different </v>
<v Speaker 3>times of the day in different parts of </v>

2240
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.790
<v Speaker 3>the month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

2241
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:33.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been looking at bio,</v>

2242
01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:36.730
<v Speaker 3>a biological clocks for many years ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>since the,</v>

2243
01:42:36.731 --> 01:42:37.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Major League baseball,</v>

2244
01:42:37.961 --> 01:42:40.150
<v Speaker 3>pretty much discovered jetlag that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2245
01:42:40.151 --> 01:42:41.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get more jet lag when they traveled west</v>

2246
01:42:41.771 --> 01:42:46.771
<v Speaker 3>to east and east to west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they realize all these clocks are </v>

2247
01:42:46.771 --> 01:42:49.321
<v Speaker 3>not folklore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's actually something going on </v>

2248
01:42:49.321 --> 01:42:51.841
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So their circadian rhythms for the day </v>

2249
01:42:51.841 --> 01:42:51.841
<v Speaker 3>and the night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also all these other rhythms</v>

2250
01:42:51.841 --> 01:42:52.630
<v Speaker 3>controlled by different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2251
01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:54.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2252
01:42:54.221 --> 01:42:59.221
<v Speaker 3>whether an astronomical features and </v>
<v Speaker 3>traveling like that really does fuck </v>

2253
01:42:59.221 --> 01:42:59.320
<v Speaker 3>with those rhythms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2254
01:42:59.321 --> 01:43:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2255
01:43:00.670 --> 01:43:03.050
<v Speaker 3>But as people get in touch with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2256
01:43:03.190 --> 01:43:04.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it could help us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2257
01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:06.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of some of these,</v>

2258
01:43:06.570 --> 01:43:07.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2259
01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.750
<v Speaker 3>drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a drug relationships that we're having,</v>

2260
01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:15.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever you taking drugs in order to </v>

2261
01:43:15.751 --> 01:43:17.221
<v Speaker 3>compensate for those shifting </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitters because we're trying </v>

2262
01:43:17.221 --> 01:43:18.310
<v Speaker 3>to be on all the time.</v>

2263
01:43:18.670 --> 01:43:23.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm in sales so I got to be in sales </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm in dopamine week or in </v>

2264
01:43:23.670 --> 01:43:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2265
01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.120
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hard.</v>

2266
01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also the,</v>

2267
01:43:26.431 --> 01:43:30.820
<v Speaker 3>the arrogance of the human mind to think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I can manipulate the human mind,</v>

2268
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:32.910
<v Speaker 3>the human mind going like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2269
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:37.950
<v Speaker 3>like how things are running here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I am going to take over the </v>

2270
01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:41.401
<v Speaker 3>running of me and I'm going to invent </v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit that makes me run more to my </v>

2271
01:43:41.981 --> 01:43:44.380
<v Speaker 3>liking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather just be okay with everything.</v>

2272
01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be high all the time and okay </v>

2273
01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:49.820
<v Speaker 3>with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2274
01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:52.771
<v Speaker 3>can you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one day they're going to get </v>

2275
01:43:52.771 --> 01:43:52.771
<v Speaker 3>what you feel like when you're on </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecstasy and it's</v>

2276
01:43:52.771 --> 01:43:54.050
<v Speaker 1>going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it all day,</v>

2277
01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:56.720
<v Speaker 1>just all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoying the world.</v>

2278
01:43:56.721 --> 01:43:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never seen this guy,</v>

2279
01:43:57.711 --> 01:44:02.711
<v Speaker 1>this color blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be so happy to have </v>

2280
01:44:02.711 --> 01:44:02.711
<v Speaker 1>those though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like you genuinely have those</v>

2281
01:44:02.711 --> 01:44:06.461
<v Speaker 1>drugs because when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're as high as you are an ecstasy </v>

2282
01:44:06.461 --> 01:44:08.951
<v Speaker 1>or as high as you are pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start figuring things out and </v>

2283
01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:09.410
<v Speaker 1>then you start unwinding that </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and becoming less dependent</v>

2284
01:44:09.411 --> 01:44:13.880
<v Speaker 1>on Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could even just a shift in the levels</v>

2285
01:44:13.881 --> 01:44:16.420
<v Speaker 1>of things and the approach to things </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you a,</v>

2286
01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a new consciousness space that </v>

2287
01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:23.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm occupying here for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a brief moment or a long </v>

2288
01:44:23.141 --> 01:44:25.961
<v Speaker 1>drawn out crazy trip and it's different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the solar sort of palliative care </v>

2289
01:44:25.961 --> 01:44:28.400
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of Pharmaceutical.</v>

2290
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2291
01:44:29.451 --> 01:44:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

2292
01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:34.960
<v Speaker 1>that does the exact opposite is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that are available that you </v>

2293
01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:37.580
<v Speaker 1>could buy on a regular basis are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that bring you closer to the hive.</v>

2294
01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Drone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2295
01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to let you accept more and take </v>

2296
01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:45.860
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Caffeine and alcohol,</v>

2297
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such easier them to tolerate the one </v>

2298
01:44:50.910 --> 01:44:54.731
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of playing both sides of </v>

2299
01:44:54.731 --> 01:44:54.731
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the field here is adderall.</v>

2300
01:44:54.731 --> 01:44:58.870
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they use it to control a little </v>

2301
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.870
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adderall and Ritalin.</v>

2302
01:44:58.870 --> 01:45:00.110
<v Speaker 1>It's one of these add drugs that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>us kids from,</v>

2303
01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting out or a different class.</v>

2304
01:45:01.851 --> 01:45:04.430
<v Speaker 1>But also the counterculture is taking it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a,</v>

2305
01:45:05.230 --> 01:45:05.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to write,</v>

2306
01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:08.640
<v Speaker 1>to write or work or to get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2307
01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:11.960
<v Speaker 1>kind of a right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never fucked with it.</v>

2308
01:45:11.961 --> 01:45:15.860
<v Speaker 1>But the people that I know that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>said it kind of hampers creativity.</v>

2309
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2310
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's more for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a speed yet cramming for a test </v>

2311
01:45:22.570 --> 01:45:22.570
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:45:22.570 --> 01:45:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting work done.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was kind of a crazy story.</v>

2318
01:45:33.051 --> 01:45:38.051
<v Speaker 1>He picked up the wrong pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else's prescription and took an </v>

2319

<v Speaker 1>Quite a few friends who've had an issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

2335
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Several,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2336
01:46:12.411 --> 01:46:13.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

01:46:17.730 --> 01:46:22.730
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went crazy with it for like several </v>

2339
01:46:22.730 --> 01:46:24.880
<v Speaker 1>months and he was starting up a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>and working with a tech company and </v>

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:29.471
<v Speaker 1>there's was a lot of hours and he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>took a little adderall to help them </v>

2341
01:46:29.471 --> 01:46:30.350
<v Speaker 1>along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They do say this to sort of,</v>

2344
01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I think speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm speed use is the closest they </v>

2345
01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:42.611
<v Speaker 1>can model schizophrenia with drugs had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been on speed freak for a really long </v>

2346
01:46:42.611 --> 01:46:47.261
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get way closer than with any </v>

2347
01:46:47.261 --> 01:46:47.261
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2348
01:46:47.261 --> 01:46:48.350

<v Speaker 1>It just seems like it just red lines.</v>

2349
01:46:48.351 --> 01:46:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2350
01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Lohan's</v>

2351
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.350
<v Speaker 3>plead deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One string attached.</v>

2352
01:46:52.351 --> 01:46:55.320
<v Speaker 3>I want my adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that TMZ?</v>

2353
01:46:55.390 --> 01:47:00.390

<v Speaker 4>she's supposed to be in that prison or </v>

2354
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:01.900
<v Speaker 4>that Rehab for the next whatever 60 90 </v>
<v Speaker 4>days is.</v>

2355

<v Speaker 4>can be an adderall and wait a minute.</v>

2356
01:47:04.901 --> 01:47:06.700
<v Speaker 4>They're putting her in jail again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2357
01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.620
<v Speaker 4>What for this time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2358
01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:13.120
<v Speaker 4>I think it was for hit and run back in </v>
<v Speaker 4>2010 or something like that.</v>

2359
01:47:13.121 --> 01:47:16.300
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been following it.</v>

2360
01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another weird aspect of our new </v>

2361
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:22.690
<v Speaker 3>society that children become famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2362
01:47:23.490 --> 01:47:25.980
<v Speaker 3>back in the Shirley temple days when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they invented that.</v>

2363
01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who would've ever thought that you would</v>

2364
01:47:29.321 --> 01:47:33.280
<v Speaker 3>get a person like a Lindsay Lohan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We raised them from the time their child</v>

2365
01:47:33.281 --> 01:47:38.281
<v Speaker 3>and they never know anonymity and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>long to escape every day long you can </v>

2366
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:44.300
<v Speaker 3>get fucked up and just drift away in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>drunken stupor and not have to think </v>

2367
01:47:44.861 --> 01:47:45.990
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2368
01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:48.720
<v Speaker 3>And they can't leave it as the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're also to,</v>

2369
01:47:48.730 --> 01:47:49.980
<v Speaker 3>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to add.</v>

2370
01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you do leave it,</v>

2371
01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:57.360
<v Speaker 3>it's almost worse to Vin a husband than </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a never was.</v>

2372
01:47:57.730 --> 01:47:59.770
<v Speaker 3>It never was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see a person walking on the street,</v>

2373
01:47:59.771 --> 01:48:00.390
<v Speaker 3>you never go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2374

<v Speaker 3>He was never fast.</v>

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:03.360
<v Speaker 3>He just called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a gosh,</v>

2376
01:48:03.370 --> 01:48:06.010
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It reminds me there was this moment that</v>

2377
01:48:06.011 --> 01:48:07.750
<v Speaker 3>I still don't know exactly how I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2378
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:10.750
<v Speaker 3>When they did the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did the brady bunch reunion.</v>

2379
01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:12.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like 10 years after the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2380
01:48:12.731 --> 01:48:14.890
<v Speaker 3>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Jan didn't show up.</v>

2381
01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:18.670
<v Speaker 3>They had a different girl for Jan and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

2382
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.550
<v Speaker 3>coconut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

2383
01:48:21.551 --> 01:48:25.700
<v Speaker 3>she broke free and we'll move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd probably eat plums.</v>

2384
01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:26.450
<v Speaker 3>She probably got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2385
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:28.660
<v Speaker 3>all this crap for not going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people probably thought,</v>

2386
01:48:28.661 --> 01:48:30.220
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she's probably too screwed up or</v>

2387
01:48:30.221 --> 01:48:31.120
<v Speaker 3>some problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's something very sad about people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that live completely in the past.</v>

2396
01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:57.660
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were on a show in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies and you're still going to </v>

<v Speaker 3>tired.</v>

2398
01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:01.060
<v Speaker 3>I heard that it was Barbara Eden on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>radio,</v>

2399
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:02.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well Barbara Eden also was in a time </v>

2403
01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:15.331
<v Speaker 3>where you didn't make money like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't get that residual cash or people </v>

<v Speaker 3>She didn't get a slice back in those </v>

2407
01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:25.900
<v Speaker 3>Gilligan's island days.</v>
