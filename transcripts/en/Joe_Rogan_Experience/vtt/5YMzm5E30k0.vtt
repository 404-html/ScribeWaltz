<v Speaker 2>So instead of going to look for a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment over the weekend,</v>

25
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I go to my friend's Bachelor Party on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jersey Shore.</v>

26
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the Bachelor Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a drink at the bar and I see</v>

27
00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:18.370
<v Speaker 2>this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started chatting with her.</v>

28
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 2>She asked me where I live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told her actually,</v>

29
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 2>as of Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have nowhere to go.</v>

30
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 2>She takes out a Napkin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She writes her address on the Napkin.</v>

31
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm 21 years old and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's an emergency on Monday and</v>

32
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:31.450
<v Speaker 2>you're stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can come live with me.</v>

33
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Monday comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get kicked out of my friend's</v>

34
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 2>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have nowhere to go.</v>

35
00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an emergency.</v>

36
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.680
<v Speaker 2>I take out the Napkin and I live with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl and her roommate for six</v>

37
00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that her father is a big</v>

38
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur business man.</v>

39
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.610
<v Speaker 2>He owns a piece of the Yankees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dislike monster mogul.</v>

40
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I write this song for the New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knicks called [inaudible] and it becomes</v>

41
00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 2>a big success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember that song?</v>

42
00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.991
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

43
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

45
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a sports fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

46
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a big hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just realized that there's an</v>

47
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to write theme songs for all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these professional sports teams.</v>

48
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 2>But I don't have a penny to go in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>studio to do the demos,</v>

49
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 2>to shop him to the team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I need money.</v>

50
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 2>So I go to this music guy and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you $10,000 to go and do these</v>

51
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 2>songs for 10% of everything you make for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of your life.</v>

52
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 2>He wants to buy me like a style the rest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your life.</v>

53
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm 21 he's like the rest of the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

54
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will invest in you own an airplane</v>

55
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

56
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 2>He owns 10% yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forever.</v>

57
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to kill him then.</v>

58
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

59
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 2>you have to kill that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I need the 10 grand.</v>

60
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 2>So I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it.</v>

61
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 2>So before I take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to this girl's father for advice,</v>

62
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 2>this business mogul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm living with her and I sit down</v>

63
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 2>and I'd go to this guy's apartment</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

64
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:56.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm 21 he's got in his apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a swimming pool artwork like</v>

65
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 2>fancy fuck women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's macked out man.</v>

66
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anything like this in</v>

67
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Manhattan.</v>

68
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm just setting the stage of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and I go in and I tell him</v>

69
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 2>the story about the percent grant and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says to me,</v>

70
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I would trade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what he said to me.</v>

71
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 2>I will trade everything that I have for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to get out of my daughter's life.</v>

72
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outweighed everything I have for the one</v>

73
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>thing that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

74
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking broke.</v>

75
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 2>What he taught me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

76
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

77
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 2>youth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he had already gone through the</v>

78
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:43.261
<v Speaker 2>journey even though he had everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he already had gone through the process.</v>

79
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't that 20 year old that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about that whatever he had gone</v>

80
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had it all.</v>

81
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 2>He he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he missed the process.</v>

82
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:57.151
<v Speaker 2>The journey of being you coming up at 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not know like you know here you are.</v>

83
00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:59.910
<v Speaker 2>But it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were the years man.</v>

84
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 2>The first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first this like that.</v>

85
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes you like so,</v>

86
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 2>and that stuck with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

87
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 2>At 21 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stuck with me and realize that</v>

88
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:11.801
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

89
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 2>I got to enjoy the process and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really never rubbed off on me in front</v>

90
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:16.470
<v Speaker 2>of me.</v>

91
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why didn't that guy,</v>

92
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>how old was this guy at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The old rich dude,</v>

93
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

94
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 2>he must have been his sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did I just do?</v>

95
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Shit to a bunch of shoot day lounge</v>
<v Speaker 2>around his fucking swimming pool did.</v>

96
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.920
<v Speaker 2>And he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had an amazing,</v>

97
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 2>he was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had an amazing life.</v>

98
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 2>He had an amazing life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what did you wind up doing?</v>

99
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said the SEC,</v>

100
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 2>the second part of that conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

101
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.003
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

102
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 2>will you make this work on your own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

103
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I think I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

104
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't ask if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

105
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

106
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you make it work?</v>

107
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.713
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

108
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.040
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then go tell the guy to fuck off and</v>

109
00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:54.660
<v Speaker 2>make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it goes and go make it work.</v>

110
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.003
<v Speaker 2>And I did,</v>

111
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.330
<v Speaker 1>but it was only like occasionally like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

112
00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:00.740
<v Speaker 1>And I always felt like a loser for doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

113
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else would be getting</v>

114
00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>high and I'm but who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

115
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but I was probably already drunk anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.870
<v Speaker 1>like when I was 14 or 15 or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

117
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.310
<v Speaker 1>So maybe I smoked weed a handful of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

118
00:05:13.311 --> 00:05:18.170
<v Speaker 1>less than a dozen times until I was 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Eddie Bravo got me into it when</v>

119
00:05:18.171 --> 00:05:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I was 30 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were doing Jujitsu together and,</v>

120
00:05:21.231 --> 00:05:23.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was telling me how marijuana was</v>

121
00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:27.050
<v Speaker 1>helping his Jujitsu and helping his</v>
<v Speaker 1>music and his creativity.</v>

122
00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this guy talking about?</v>

123
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 1>My Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana just makes it stupid.</v>

124
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.761
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:05:32.961 --> 00:05:33.950

<v Speaker 1>just try it.</v>

127
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.010
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got high and,</v>

128
00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:38.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking like,</v>

129
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what it is.</v>

130
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

131
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I did not know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling.</v>

132
00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:48.291
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

133
00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:50.840
<v Speaker 1>why are you by yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

134
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just me and Eddie.</v>

135
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.663
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet.</v>

136
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

137
00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went and got something to eat.</v>

138
00:05:55.491 --> 00:05:56.750
<v Speaker 1>We're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>talked about all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

140
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember I started smoking</v>
<v Speaker 1>pot and getting on stage and got her,</v>

141
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:06.610

<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

143
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe how zoned in and gets</v>

144
00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:15.480

<v Speaker 1>smoking pot and hitting the bag to this</v>

145
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.580
<v Speaker 1>day is like one of my all time favorite</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

146
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I get paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get weirded out,</v>

147
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get freaked out,</v>

148
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.490
<v Speaker 1>but I just fucking wrap up my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on the timer and just,</v>

149
00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:28.950
<v Speaker 1>once that sweat starts flowing and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>tall</v>

150
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's almost like the paranoia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weirdness of it all,</v>

151
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you just fight it off by hitting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>

152
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

154
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.350
<v Speaker 1>you hear the bell that says 30 seconds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your flurry in and then you get that</v>

155
00:06:43.351 --> 00:06:48.351
<v Speaker 1>one minute off to think about life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future and the fuck can universe and</v>

156
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:52.130

<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

157
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.290
<v Speaker 1>the bell goes off again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got another three rounds,</v>

158
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 1>three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

159
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.180
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my like it's,</v>

160
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a psychedelic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cleansing experience hitting</v>

161
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:03.550
<v Speaker 1>the bag when you're high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

162
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.200
<v Speaker 1>I love shadowboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm hiring,</v>

163
00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a rip out at home and just sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

164
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 1>have a little mirror and I'll just</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadowbox don't even know how long.</v>

165
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I just can just shout a box for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

166
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what's weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you feel balance when you're high.</v>

167
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.390
<v Speaker 1>You feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe like if you got an injury,</v>

168
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.930
<v Speaker 1>you feel it more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like we're a laser off.</v>

169
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like for me,</v>

170
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel my transfer of power better when</v>

171
00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

172
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.440
<v Speaker 1>like certain techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

173
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I really get the timing of when to turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hip over.</v>

174
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 1>I feel it more when I'm high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

175
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I feel the connection with all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue,</v>

176
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.370
<v Speaker 1>all of it working together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is,</v>

177
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.830
<v Speaker 1>that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what's happening with,</v>

178
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:50.200
<v Speaker 1>with this Allah phrenia thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what it's called.</v>

179
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be remembering that incorrectly,</v>

180
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.390
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that being around his</v>

181
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:59.391
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever weird error or brain is</v>

182
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:02.890
<v Speaker 1>making your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain tunes into that air and you</v>

183
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:05.860
<v Speaker 1>start going crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as that shit made sense,</v>

184
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get the fuck out of here.</v>

185
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's harmless.</v>

186
00:08:11.641 --> 00:08:13.780
<v Speaker 1>He's never heard anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he still,</v>

187
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days he's what he's prop guy.</v>

188
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.430
<v Speaker 1>He's probably in his sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in any kind of shape,</v>

189
00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.860
<v Speaker 1>but back then when he still knew of</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts.</v>

190
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your stage,</v>

191
00:08:22.081 --> 00:08:24.310
<v Speaker 1>your man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he never hurt anybody,</v>

192
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:27.060
<v Speaker 1>but he knew how to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

193
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.160
<v Speaker 1>so one day there's eastern avenue in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baltimore's,</v>

194
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.970
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ventura Boulevard of Baltimore shops</v>

195
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:36.700
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was this one woman that had</v>

196
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:40.510
<v Speaker 1>cut his hair one time and for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

197
00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:43.690
<v Speaker 1>to touch his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a big deal for him.</v>

198
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:46.450
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he immediately fell in love with this</v>

199
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:48.280
<v Speaker 1>lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her name was Carissa.</v>

200
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.990
<v Speaker 1>So he went home and got his guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about this guitar,</v>

201
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>like this dude would pawn his bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his guitar,</v>

202
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.693
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

203
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.700
<v Speaker 3>But that guitar was always out of tune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly the same way.</v>

204
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

205
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So always fucked up,</v>

206
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:07.740
<v Speaker 3>but always consistently fucked up every</v>
<v Speaker 3>guitar he had.</v>

207
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 3>That's how he tuned it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how he heard it.</v>

208
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he writes her,</v>

209
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 3>he writes her a love song and he wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go up to her shop and now sing it for</v>

210
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he goes up and he stands out in front</v>

211
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 3>of the shop and he's gets her attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got his guitar and he's gone and</v>

212
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 3>starts off where he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

213
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you and Baltimore accents.</v>

214
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Car Name's Karissa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he says,</v>

215
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 3>Chrissa Okay Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you Chris.</v>

216
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 3>I need you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he goes,</v>

217
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all,</v>

219
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 3>And she's freaking out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

220
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your eyes.</v>

221
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 3>So they call the police,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets arrested.</v>

222
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he doesn't understand why he's</v>

223
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 3>arrested in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did I do wrong?</v>

224
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I just wrote a beautiful song for</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone I care about and I wanted to</v>

225
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:55.980
<v Speaker 3>share it with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my cousins,</v>

226
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 3>all of us were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we gotta go to court and watch this.</v>

227
00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 3>This is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he's got,</v>

228
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 3>he's got to go to court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they bring them out from the back.</v>

229
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he stands up and it's a,</v>
