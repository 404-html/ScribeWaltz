<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:02.920
<v Speaker 1>A lot of us get there,</v>

3
00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:03.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.050
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that we know came from a place where when they were really</v>

5
00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:08.860
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

6
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.491
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

7
00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:11.710
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on with the world?</v>

8
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

9
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

10
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.000
<v Speaker 1>how old were you?</v>

11
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you were when you had your first,</v>

12
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

13
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I think my parents might be fucking crazy thought.</v>

14
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.241
<v Speaker 1>What do you like?</v>

15
00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 1>These people are in charge of telling me what to do.</v>

16
00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>This is nonsense.</v>

17
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:22.751
<v Speaker 1>You make,</v>

18
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

19
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>you're talking crazy talk here.</v>

20
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>

21
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 2>It happened for me,</v>

22
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 2>the first time that I took a Lsd,</v>

24
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.641
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 2>and maybe before that,</v>

26
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 2>but when I took Lsd,</v>

27
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

28
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.580
<v Speaker 2>when I took LSD for the first time,</v>

29
00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 2>I can remember when,</v>

30
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 2>whenever you take Lsd,</v>

31
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.301
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:39.051
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>

33
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean at the,</v>

35
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 2>when I took Lsd,</v>

37
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.440
<v Speaker 2>what worries do I have?</v>

38
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm in fucking high school.</v>

39
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.511
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

40
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing in there.</v>

41
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:46.304
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to,</v>

42
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 2>there's no demons to come swimming out of my brain and taught me with like all</v>

43
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 2>the myriad of things you get when you're older.</v>

44
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 2>There's fucking nothing.</v>

45
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.300
<v Speaker 2>You were just open.</v>

46
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I might,</v>

47
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I might be upset cause like a cheerleader that came over to my house,</v>

48
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't figure out how to kiss her.</v>

49
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:04.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's like the biggest problem I'm having at the time.</v>

50
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

51
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.181
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

52
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:05.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

53
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:06.284
<v Speaker 2>at that time,</v>

54
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 2>when I did it for the first time and had that initial experience,</v>

55
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

57
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 2>when you go back to your parents who've never taken it,</v>

58
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 2>and if you mentioned it to them that you'd even taken it,</v>

59
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:18.710
<v Speaker 2>they might want to put you in a drug rehab or they think you're insane or they</v>

60
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 2>think you're getting down the wrong track.</v>

61
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 2>You're forced into this place of like,</v>

62
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.053
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

63
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.983
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

64
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.471
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

65
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 2>you w you guys don't even,</v>

66
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know you,</v>

67
00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 2>you don't even understand this,</v>

68
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 2>this a new way of experiencing life.</v>

69
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

70
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.610
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

71
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.520
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's a lot of people who spend their whole lives never knowing</v>

72
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 2>that you don't have to take psychedelics to get to that place.</v>

73
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:41.960
<v Speaker 2>There's other ways to get to that place.</v>

74
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:42.980
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

75
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:44.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a very strange thing.</v>

76
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.490
<v Speaker 2>And those people who never get to that place,</v>

77
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 2>they're the ones who are,</v>

78
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are,</v>

79
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.551
<v Speaker 2>are in control.</v>

80
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

81
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.940
<v Speaker 1>So your life took inexorable change when you did acid that was like the point</v>

82
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 1>where you look back and you said,</v>

83
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:58.640
<v Speaker 1>this is the point where I went off into this direction.</v>

84
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

85
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 2>well I know I'd say the,</v>

86
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

87
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

88
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.151
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

89
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:06.230
<v Speaker 2>that taking acid started with a series of like books.</v>

90
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 2>It started with contact with like,</v>

91
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

92
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 2>the whole weirdness.</v>

93
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.880
<v Speaker 2>My whole weird weirdness started with,</v>

94
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 2>as I recall,</v>

95
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:20.291
<v Speaker 2>it started with me coming upon this book that my mom had called Raja Yoga by</v>

96
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Yogi Rama terracotta,</v>

97
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 2>who by the way,</v>

98
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 2>it was never a Yogi was just some English mistake.</v>

99
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

100
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Wide about being a Yogi.</v>

101
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 2>But it's a fascinating story.</v>

102
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 2>But the book,</v>

103
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 2>that was the first time I'd ever read the idea.</v>

106
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.260
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

107
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.950
<v Speaker 2>you there that you're an observer observing yourself,</v>

108
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:43.670
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

109
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.040
<v Speaker 2>you aren't necessarily the you,</v>

110
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:46.851
<v Speaker 2>that you think the you,</v>

111
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 2>that can be observed is not you.</v>

112
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 2>You're the observer state,</v>

113
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 2>the mindfulness,</v>

114
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:52.521
<v Speaker 2>the watcher.</v>

115
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:52.941
<v Speaker 2>That's when I,</v>

116
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.430
<v Speaker 2>that's the first time I'd come upon the idea of what that's called,</v>

117
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 2>the amen.</v>

118
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 2>The thing that observes yourself.</v>

119
00:02:58.071 --> 00:02:58.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

120
00:02:58.281 --> 00:02:58.600
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

121
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.381
<v Speaker 2>you know someone say,</v>

122
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm really mad right now.</v>

123
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 2>The moment you say I'm mad,</v>

124
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 2>you're creating a distinction.</v>

125
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

126
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 2>between the thing that's observing that you're mad.</v>

127
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's mad.</v>

128
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 2>So that observer,</v>

129
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 2>that watcher,</v>

130
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.840
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that,</v>

131
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 2>that mindfulness is what,</v>

132
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 2>throughout my whole life,</v>

134
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:17.441
<v Speaker 2>I try to,</v>

135
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:17.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 2>go into that place of observing myself rather than being the thing.</v>

137
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's a game that you can play in.</v>

138
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:27.080
<v Speaker 2>It really is quite helpful with a variety of,</v>

139
00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:27.851
<v Speaker 2>of problems,</v>

140
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 2>especially if you get really angry.</v>

141
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.100
<v Speaker 2>If you get really angry and you can stop yourself and just watch and there's</v>

142
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.050
<v Speaker 2>tools you can use.</v>

143
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.431
<v Speaker 2>In that book.</v>

144
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.430
<v Speaker 2>I remember it said as you walk around,</v>

145
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 2>start thinking he is walking.</v>

146
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 2>That was like one of the tools,</v>

147
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 2>like it's in a book and you're a character in a book.</v>

148
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.380
<v Speaker 2>So when you're going around,</v>

149
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.000

<v Speaker 2>He's talking.</v>

153
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

154
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

155
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 2>these are activities designed to create this,</v>

156
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 2>like the watch or the state of presence of watching.</v>

157
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>So that started it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think I was in like fourth grade and they showed us a drug.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a guy in it.</v>

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a guy in a fucking,</v>

184
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.374
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

185
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 2>empty apartment and he's curled against the law and the fetal position and it's</v>

186
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 2>an LSD and it looks terrible.</v>

187
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 2>And then the narrator says,</v>

188
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Lsd can make you experience hallucinations.</v>

189
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 2>You can see dragons.</v>

190
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.771
<v Speaker 2>And I remember him saying,</v>

00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:51.604
<v Speaker 2>you could see drag.</v>

192
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.410

<v Speaker 2>Yeah there's definitely a Dunkin to that.</v>

215
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.560

221
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.240

223
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.750
<v Speaker 2>the best thing that can happen to use you get knocked off track.</v>

224
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the best thing that can happen to you in general.</v>

225
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Cause generally the track you're on has been set for you by people who never got</v>

226
00:05:52.461 --> 00:05:53.300
<v Speaker 2>off their track.</v>

227
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 2>You end up,</v>

228
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

229
00:05:54.411 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>you end up the child of someone who decided to have you in their twenties 2122</v>

230
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to know a lot of stuff.</v>

231
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to understand the universe that much unless they were like</v>

232
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>came from a really good family of artist are intelligent people.</v>

233
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Chances are they're scared,</v>

234
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.461
<v Speaker 2>hungry,</v>

235
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 2>desperate,</v>

236
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 2>angry.</v>

237
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be in the relationship anymore.</v>

238
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be monogamous anymore.</v>

239
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 2>The idea of non monogamy to them might just seem insane.</v>

240
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.701
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

241
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:19.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

242
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 2>like who the fuck knows?</v>

243
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 2>But you're born into that planet.</v>

244
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 2>That's the atmosphere you're born into.</v>

245
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're breathing when you're first born.</v>

246
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 2>And that can set you on a weird path.</v>

247
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very sad path that you can get on.</v>

248
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 2>And so hopefully if you're lucky,</v>

249
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:35.571
<v Speaker 2>you'll come across.</v>

250
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Somebody knocks you off that fucking path.</v>

251
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

295
00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:50.320
<v Speaker 2>White Blotter of lips,</v>

296
00:07:50.321 --> 00:07:50.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a million different names for the different types of acid,</v>

298
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:54.310
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

299
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.210
<v Speaker 2>so this is just white.</v>

300
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.991
<v Speaker 2>You who knows what it was,</v>

301
00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:59.470
<v Speaker 2>but it was really good and I can remember I took it</v>

302
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.020
<v Speaker 2>and you have to,</v>

303
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:02.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

304
00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:05.050
<v Speaker 2>it takes 30 to 45 minutes sometimes longer for it to kick in.</v>

305
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I still remember I was sitting in my friend's trailer in a trailer park in North</v>

306
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Carolina sitting in an empty bathtub,</v>

307
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.390
<v Speaker 2>like when it like an empty Jacuzzi tub that was in this trailer.</v>

308
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.080
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sitting there and they're watching star wars and I'm sitting in this</v>

309
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.260
<v Speaker 2>bathtub and all of a sudden the greatest,</v>

310
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:28.060
<v Speaker 2>it's the greatest feeling just started going through my legs and up into my</v>

311
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:28.690
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

312
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.580
<v Speaker 2>And it was a fucking sword fight.</v>

313
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.390
<v Speaker 2>It was a a lightsaber fight when I'm listening to that.</v>

314
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:36.790
<v Speaker 2>But all of a sudden now the sounds echoey,</v>

315
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.680
<v Speaker 2>like someone's turned an echo up on it.</v>

316
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:39.010
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

317
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:39.131
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

318
00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:39.964
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

319
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

320
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.580
<v Speaker 2>parents kind of bouncing around.</v>

321
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:43.810
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

322
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:46.870
<v Speaker 2>And I feel so fucking good started laughing.</v>

323
00:08:46.871 --> 00:08:47.890
<v Speaker 2>It seems so funny.</v>

324
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Then I went outside and lay in the grass.</v>

325
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm staring at the sky.</v>

326
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Everything's beautiful trails.</v>

327
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.030
<v Speaker 2>You put your hand in front,</v>

328
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 2>your face and it's just this rainbow of hands drifting in front of your face.</v>

329
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Everything's breathing.</v>

330
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Then my friends come running out because they knew this is the first time I was</v>

331
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 2>tripping and they all start jumping over me.</v>

332
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 2>They're like jumping over me as I'm laying there and they're laughing and we're</v>

333
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 2>all fucking laughing and it's just perfect.</v>

334
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Then I remember they pulled their cock out.</v>

335
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 2>That's when they pulled that.</v>

336
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 2>When we all started fucking,</v>

337
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.820
<v Speaker 2>we fucked and fucked and then a dog came by and we grabbed the dog and started</v>

338
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 2>fucking the dog.</v>

339
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

340
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 2>no know.</v>

341
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 2>It was beautiful.</v>

342
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Very now.</v>

343
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

344
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 2>there was no fucking happening.</v>

345
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of like laughing.</v>

346
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.840
<v Speaker 2>There is a,</v>

347
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I remember going into my friend's shitty high school car and like sitting and</v>

348
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Speaker 2>like pulling the seat back and looking at the ceiling and I'm looking at the</v>

349
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 2>ceiling and it's fucking hieroglyphics or some kind of like ancient writing,</v>

350
00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:50.521
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

351
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think I knew what Sanskrit was at the time,</v>

352
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 2>but I'd probably be like,</v>

353
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:53.551
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

354
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing Stan script.</v>

355
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Some kind of runes are glyphs all over my friend's car that she's kind of</v>

356
00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 2>breathing and warping and it's just beautiful.</v>

357
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.230
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

358
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:04.800
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>

359
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 2>that was the first time.</v>

360
00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:07.890
<v Speaker 2>And once you've had that experience,</v>

361
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 2>how do you go back to a world,</v>

362
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 2>a normal kind of world?</v>

363
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.350
<v Speaker 4>First time I ever did acid.</v>

364
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:13.660
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

365
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I've told you this before I met Kurt Cobain.</v>

366
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 4>How crazy was that?</v>

367
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.633
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

368
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.270
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

369
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 4>Tell the story again.</v>

370
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 4>I think I died this night,</v>

371
00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:22.141
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

372
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:23.210
<v Speaker 4>I have this very,</v>

373
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 4>that know that this is what made me think of a theory that like every time you</v>

374
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 4>die you don't know that you died.</v>

375
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:29.290
<v Speaker 4>But then you left this rural,</v>

376
00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:32.060
<v Speaker 4>then everyone else in this other parallel road,</v>

377
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

378
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 4>they think you die.</v>

379
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

380
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

381
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 4>went to the funeral.</v>

382
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.690
<v Speaker 4>And this is where I thought this one was.</v>

383
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

384
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.290
<v Speaker 4>the first time I did acid,</v>

385
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 4>me and my girlfriend at the time,</v>

386
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:40.344
<v Speaker 4>and it was Marissa.</v>

387
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:41.880
<v Speaker 4>We went to go see,</v>

388
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 4>we went to go see a nirvana and she had acid and I,</v>

389
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 4>I've never done it before.</v>

390
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:48.721
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>

391
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:50.250
<v Speaker 4>let's do acid and see nirvana.</v>

392
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Speaker 4>So we took acid and the opening band was on,</v>

393
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:53.191
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

394
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 4>which is some Asian band that just screamed the whole time.</v>

395
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>

396
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:56.840
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

397
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

398
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.953
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like,</v>

399
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:58.531
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

400
00:10:58.531 --> 00:10:59.364
<v Speaker 4>annoying.</v>

401
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.240
<v Speaker 4>So I was sitting next to the side of the stage and Kurt Cobain comes around the</v>

402
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 4>corner and it just comes out.</v>

403
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 4>It like it was really dark so no one could see it.</v>

404
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 4>And he's just standing right next to me.</v>

405
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:08.281
<v Speaker 4>I look over,</v>

406
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:08.491
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

407
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 4>oh my fucking God,</v>

408
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:10.410
<v Speaker 4>it's Kurt Cobain.</v>

409
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:11.131
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

410
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:11.281
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

411
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:11.701
<v Speaker 4>what's up?</v>

412
00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:12.001
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

413
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:12.600
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

414
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.460
<v Speaker 4>you went to Chico?</v>

415
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.020
<v Speaker 4>And he like,</v>

416
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.180
<v Speaker 4>like hold out his bag.</v>

417
00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:15.511

418
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:15.791
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

419
00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 4>And then so I held on the cheeto and then suddenly he just like,</v>

420
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:19.171
<v Speaker 4>somebody goes,</v>

421
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:19.801

422
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:22.070
<v Speaker 4>And then he just like throws all the Cheetos out in the crowd and the,</v>

423
00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:25.000
<v Speaker 4>they cause returns backstage and I'm holding this cheeto and I'm like,</v>

424
00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:25.840

425
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.490
<v Speaker 4>The crowd.</v>

426
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:26.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

427
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 4>Like he had a bag of Cheetos that he was eating for him.</v>

428
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:29.430
<v Speaker 4>He just threw it at the crowd.</v>

429
00:11:29.431 --> 00:11:29.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

430
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.110
<v Speaker 4>he just threw Cheetos everywhere.</v>

431
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>

432
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.050
<v Speaker 4>this is like a mosh pit in Dayton,</v>

433
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Ohio side of the stage,</v>

434
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:36.570
<v Speaker 4>like a rock club,</v>

435
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

436
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:37.831
<v Speaker 4>hair arena.</v>

437
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:40.920
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a fucking video of Dana white getting in a mosh pit.</v>
