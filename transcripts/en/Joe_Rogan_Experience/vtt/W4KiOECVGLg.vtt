1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.080
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up man?</v>

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.510
<v Speaker 2>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>

6
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 2>I walked in on a pool game that was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>barely squeaked it out.</v>

7
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 2>It was a very nice shot to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to end it though.</v>

8
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to end it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

9
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been reading your book man tribe.</v>

10
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good and it's,</v>

11
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

12
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 2>it resonates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting.</v>

13
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 2>I will into the first chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to move in with the native </v>

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was such a,</v>

15
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was one of the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting aspects of it was uh,</v>

16
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 2>something that I didn't know about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the European settlers that had</v>

17
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 2>been kidnapped and were living with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>native Americans and then when they were</v>

18
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 2>rescued,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them wanted to go back.</v>

19
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they would go into hiding so they </v>

20
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have to be repatriated to </v>
<v Speaker 3>colonial society.</v>

21
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.360
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to stay with their adopted </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribes.</v>

22
00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:01.430
<v Speaker 3>And then there was also a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

23
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 3>a lot of young white people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly white men and young women </v>

24
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.621
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who basically absconded across the </v>

25
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 3>frontier into tribal society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

26
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 3>they fled white society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't like it,</v>

27
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as Benjamin Franklin pointed out,</v>

28
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:20.911
<v Speaker 3>we have lots of call colonial colonial's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fleeing to the Indians and we have not </v>

29
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 3>one example of an Indian as they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>called fleeing to white society.</v>

30
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the more fascinating </v>

31
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 2>aspects of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't anticipate that.</v>

32
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.110
<v Speaker 2>I thought that there would be a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>native Americans,</v>

33
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 2>so it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

34
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 2>this is a way better look at all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>food looking at the houses.</v>

35
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:35.990
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

36
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean they had plenty of food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

37
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 3>whatever their success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>success,</v>

38
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 3>very successful society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact they were,</v>

39
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 3>they had better nutrition than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whites did a more varied diet,</v>

40
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a much,</v>

41
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 3>much more egalitarian society than </v>
<v Speaker 3>colonial society.</v>

42
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 2>That was also interesting about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

43
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.270
<v Speaker 2>when you were talking about the women </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had moved in with the native </v>

44
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Americans and we're expressing how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more freedom they experienced.</v>

45
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

46
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Indian Society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>native society wasn't crushed by a </v>

47
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Christian morality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could divorce,</v>

48
00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 3>you could marry as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can marry whom you wanted.</v>

49
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:13.030
<v Speaker 3>You could get divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do whatever you wanted.</v>

50
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 3>It was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very galatarian.</v>

51
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.270
<v Speaker 3>What they've shown is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

52
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 3>the in societies where everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary for food production,</v>

53
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 3>food production,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

54
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 3>everyone more or less equal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in an agrarian societies,</v>

55
00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 3>agricultural societies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>industrial societies,</v>

56
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.490
<v Speaker 3>you have large segments of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

57
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Often women who are not involved in food</v>
<v Speaker 3>production,</v>

58
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.980
<v Speaker 3>they are involved in reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they're,</v>

59
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>equality goes</v>

60
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

61
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like society as we've </v>

62
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.481
<v Speaker 2>created over the last couple of hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years is almost totally incompatible </v>

63
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with human genetics or with the human </v>

64
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 2>body or the human spirit or whatever.</v>

65
00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at,</v>

66
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetics is complicated.</v>

67
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously on some level,</v>

68
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 2>industrial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern society is very successful.</v>

69
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>We have 7 billion of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

70
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as wealth goes up in a society,</v>

71
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 2>as modernity goes up in a society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the suicide rate goes up,</v>

72
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.090
<v Speaker 2>the depression rate goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia goes up in urban </v>

73
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 2>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

74
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 2>they're not good for the human psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are designed.</v>

75
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 2>We evolve the lave in groups of 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 people in a harsh environment,</v>

76
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 2>totally reliant on one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For survival,</v>

77
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.770
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that creates a huge amount of equality </v>

78
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.770
<v Speaker 2>within a group and loyalty within a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

79
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what we are designed for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genetically.</v>

80
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 2>A modern society allows the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be independent from the group,</v>

81
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 2>which is in some ways a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberation,</v>

82
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other ways it can lead to a profound</v>

83
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 2>alienation and depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

84
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a confusing thing.</v>

85
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:55.950
<v Speaker 2>It seems for people to be amongst so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people,</v>

86
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.030
<v Speaker 2>but to be alone.</v>

87
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

88
00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:03.281
<v Speaker 3>we're not wired to be confronted with </v>
<v Speaker 3>strangers all day long and I live in New</v>

89
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.390
<v Speaker 3>York City and I love New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all day long you,</v>

90
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 3>you encounter strangers and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't recognize anybody so you </v>

91
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.710
<v Speaker 3>can be alone in a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not something that human beings</v>

92
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.440
<v Speaker 3>have experienced until quite recently in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their history.</v>

93
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

94
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.930
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the more disturbing parts</v>

95
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:28.931
<v Speaker 2>about this idea that these people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>kidnapped by the native Americans and </v>

96
00:04:29.181 --> 00:04:34.181
<v Speaker 2>wanted to stay with them was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that native American life was </v>

97
00:04:34.971 --> 00:04:36.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however they were living,</v>

98
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.870
<v Speaker 2>that just seemed to just resonate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

99
00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:41.810
<v Speaker 2>It seemed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to be what was right.</v>

100
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

101
00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 3>we're wired to want to feel like we </v>
<v Speaker 3>belong to a group.</v>

102
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 3>A native American society was a sexually</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite relaxed.</v>

103
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 3>I was quite a Galitary Ian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a hunter gatherer society.</v>

104
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:59.911
<v Speaker 3>You really can't accumulate wealth very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well because these societies are often </v>

105
00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:04.501
<v Speaker 3>nomadic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can only accumulate as much </v>

106
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:04.501
<v Speaker 3>wealth as you can carry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't much.</v>

107
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

108
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.900
<v Speaker 3>and ultimately in societies like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as in a platoon in combat,</v>

109
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 3>which is another part of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

110
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

111
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.460
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're primarily valued,</v>

112
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 3>valued for your contribution to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>

113
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 3>And that has been lost in modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

114
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:24.721
<v Speaker 3>People are enormously selfserving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism basically instructs us to do </v>

115
00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:24.860
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

116
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole other evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>imperative,</v>

117
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 3>which is also important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in our society is way out of whack.</v>

118
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:34.831
<v Speaker 3>So we are wired to serve ourselves and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we are wired to serve the group and in a</v>

119
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 3>healthy society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two,</v>

120
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 3>those two are in a dynamic tension with </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

121
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:40.810
<v Speaker 3>And in ballots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in modern society,</v>

122
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 3>there really is no group to serve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

123
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 3>and it leads to a really profound sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>of meaninglessness for a lot of people.</v>

124
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

125
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

126
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I also found it pretty fascinating that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were really young you,</v>

127
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were working,</v>

128
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I think you said you were working </v>
<v Speaker 2>construction,</v>

129
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>so it was a,</v>

130
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to remember the story you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were about to,</v>

131
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.400
<v Speaker 2>can you were just saying that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to someone that you're working </v>

132
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.350
<v Speaker 2>with and they were telling you to slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>down because some of us,</v>

133
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 2>some of us have to do this for.</v>

134
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.490
<v Speaker 3>That's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

135
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

136
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on a construction crew and it was </v>

137
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.150
<v Speaker 3>a highway department of my town and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

138
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these guys are kind of lifers </v>
<v Speaker 3>in our department.</v>

139
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Not a particularly challenging job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

140
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a sense,</v>

141
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you were on your feet all day long </v>

142
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.460
<v Speaker 3>in the sun or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

143
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.460
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

144
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a young guy and I,</v>

145
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to sort of prove my mettle or </v>

146
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:31.391
<v Speaker 3>whatever I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

147
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:34.750
<v Speaker 3>we were digging a trench and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>digging like crazy and a and an older </v>

148
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 3>guy came up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

149
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:37.360
<v Speaker 3>he's probably in his sixties and he came</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to me and clapped me on the shoulder.</v>

150
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son,</v>

151
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 3>you want to slow down there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

152
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 3>why some of us are going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this job our whole lives.</v>

153
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 3>And he knew I was a college kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew I wasn't going to.</v>

154
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

155
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.390
<v Speaker 3>just slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

156
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.780
<v Speaker 3>no one needs to work this past.</v>

157
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a really interesting that you </v>

158
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.320
<v Speaker 2>were longing for something you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying like almost to go wrong.</v>

159
00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:03.321
<v Speaker 2>So everybody had a band together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was a hurricane or something </v>

160
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:05.820
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mundane life of just work and doing</v>

161
00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:07.320
<v Speaker 2>things you don't really want to do.</v>

162
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

163
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:13.751
<v Speaker 3>the irony about modern society is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is removed hardship and danger from </v>

164
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:17.621
<v Speaker 3>everyday life and it's in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardship and danger that people come to </v>

165
00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 3>understand their value to their society </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a,</v>

166
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 3>they get their sense of meaning from </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

167
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 3>And so what you have is when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

168
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the blitz in London,</v>

169
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30,000</v>

170
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:33.491
<v Speaker 3>people were killed by German bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a horror show over the course of </v>

171
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:33.491
<v Speaker 3>six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was ghastly,</v>

172
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:37.901
<v Speaker 3>but people are sleeping shoulder to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder in the tube stations and </v>

173
00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:38.960
<v Speaker 3>putting out fires with bucket brigades </v>
<v Speaker 3>and digging people out of rubble.</v>

174
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 3>And they were acting as a unified </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

175
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.810
<v Speaker 3>And the English government was prepared </v>
<v Speaker 3>for mass psychiatric casualties because </v>

176
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.610
<v Speaker 3>as a civilian population getting bombed </v>
<v Speaker 3>at bets and the opposite happened.</v>

177
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:54.611
<v Speaker 3>Admissions to psych wards went down </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the blitz and then back up after </v>

178
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 3>the bombing stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

179
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then afterwards it was an enormous </v>

180
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 3>nostalgia in England for the blitz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For those days.</v>

181
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm as tragic as they were because </v>
<v Speaker 3>English society felt other people felt </v>

182
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 3>like they were together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Later I was,</v>

183
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:15.431
<v Speaker 3>I went back to Sarajevo where I'd been </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the siege of Sarajevo in the </v>

184
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:16.670
<v Speaker 3>early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And civilians would tell me,</v>

185
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is 20 years later,</v>

186
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 3>20 years after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

187
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of us miss the war because we were</v>

188
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:23.450
<v Speaker 3>better people back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We took care of each other.</v>

189
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about that with September </v>
<v Speaker 2>11th.</v>

190
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to New York City.</v>

191
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:33.191
<v Speaker 2>I'm about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was maybe six months after </v>

192
00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:33.191
<v Speaker 2>September 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

193
00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:37.670
<v Speaker 2>I was there a couple times and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the before September 11th,</v>

194
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 2>after September 11th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a very clear difference in the</v>

195
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:43.220
<v Speaker 2>way people were behaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People seem to be more,</v>

196
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 2>more friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more open.</v>

197
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 2>They were really appreciative of first </v>
<v Speaker 2>responders.</v>

198
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there once in a friend of mine.</v>

199
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:54.580
<v Speaker 2>She fainted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they called the fire department,</v>

200
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.870
<v Speaker 2>came to check her out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

201
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 2>and when the firemen showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

202
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 2>you would think fucking superhero showed</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

203
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was so happy to see him.</v>

204
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.390
<v Speaker 2>And it was in stark contrast to the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>people used to behave and treat each </v>

205
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.921
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was directly because of having </v>

206
00:09:12.921 --> 00:09:12.921
<v Speaker 2>experienced this horrific event.</v>

207
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adversity produces pro pro social </v>

208
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.100
<v Speaker 3>behaviors in people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adversity makes people act well.</v>

209
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.320
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lack of adversity,</v>

210
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.660
<v Speaker 3>safety and comfort allow people to act </v>
<v Speaker 3>selfishly.</v>

211
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so after nine slash 11,</v>

212
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.910
<v Speaker 3>the suicide rate went down in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

213
00:09:30.911 --> 00:09:33.220
<v Speaker 3>the violent crime rate went down in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York.</v>

214
00:09:33.221 --> 00:09:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam vets reported that their ptsd </v>
<v Speaker 3>symptoms went down after nine slash 11.</v>

215
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is people suddenly feel </v>

216
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.560
<v Speaker 3>that they're needed by their society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by their people,</v>

217
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:49.540
<v Speaker 3>and if you feel needed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are able to ignore your own personal</v>

218
00:09:49.541 --> 00:09:54.541
<v Speaker 3>troubles is when someone in England and </v>
<v Speaker 3>an efficient and English official said </v>

219
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:57.280
<v Speaker 3>during the blitz in London,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

220
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the chronic neurotics of </v>

221
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 3>peacetime driving ambulances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

222
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.270
<v Speaker 3>and if you think about in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution,</v>

223
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:07.180
<v Speaker 3>if adversity in danger produced bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>human behaviors,</v>

224
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.660
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't be here today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another way to say that is we are the </v>

225
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.310
<v Speaker 3>descendants of the individuals 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago who acted well in a crisis.</v>

226
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 3>The people that acted badly to crisis </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just took care of themselves and </v>

227
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.100
<v Speaker 3>didn't take care of their people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their group,</v>

228
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:22.570
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people,</v>

229
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.660
<v Speaker 3>those groups died out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's people,</v>

230
00:10:25.661 --> 00:10:28.810
<v Speaker 3>it's groups that encouraged a form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>altruism itself,</v>

231
00:10:28.811 --> 00:10:31.960
<v Speaker 3>self sacrifice of individuals for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>

232
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.030
<v Speaker 3>During a crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those groups survive.</v>

233
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.190
<v Speaker 3>That DNA gets passed onto us.</v>

234
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.630
<v Speaker 2>And did you gain a deeper appreciation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this because of your time as a war </v>

235
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:46.311
<v Speaker 2>journalist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it sort of manifests itself in your </v>

236
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:46.311
<v Speaker 2>mind because of that?</v>

237
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:46.311
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

238
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:51.081
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This book came to me and to sort of two </v>

239
00:10:51.081 --> 00:10:51.081
<v Speaker 3>step process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

240
00:10:51.081 --> 00:10:55.131
<v Speaker 3>when I was young man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a surrogate uncle figure in my </v>

241
00:10:55.131 --> 00:10:58.161
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very important person to be named Ellis </v>

242
00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Ellis settle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a half Lakota Sioux half Apache </v>

243
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 3>and he was born in Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>29 on a wagon out west.</v>

244
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 3>It live an extraordinary life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very,</v>

245
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 3>very educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>self educated,</v>

246
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 3>and at one point he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

247
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.180
<v Speaker 3>it's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All throughout the history of this </v>

248
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.461
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white people were always running off to </v>

249
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:16.461
<v Speaker 3>join the Indians and the Indians never </v>
<v Speaker 3>ran off to join the white people.</v>

250
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 3>And I filed that away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my mind,</v>

251
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 3>I kind of liked the idea of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was.</v>

252
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.650
<v Speaker 3>I hoped it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know if it was true and then </v>

253
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.500
<v Speaker 3>decades later I was with American </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers on a remote outpost in </v>

254
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called Restrepo and I made a documentary</v>

255
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 3>film by that name with my colleague Tim </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hetherington,</v>

256
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.650
<v Speaker 3>and there was almost daily combat.</v>

257
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.750
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no link to the outside world,</v>

258
00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:38.740
<v Speaker 3>no Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no electricity for awhile.</v>

259
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 3>They just slept in the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got shot at everyday.</v>

260
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.150
<v Speaker 3>We got shot at every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

261
00:11:43.151 --> 00:11:48.151
<v Speaker 3>there was no women out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing but combat and </v>

262
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:49.380
<v Speaker 3>Tarantulas and pallets of water and Mras</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Ammo.</v>

263
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 3>That was it for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those boys are out there for over a year</v>

264
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.650
<v Speaker 3>and they very psyched to come back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Italy where they're based at the end of </v>

265
00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.380
<v Speaker 3>their deployment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can imagine that had some pretty </v>

266
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:01.380
<v Speaker 3>good parties planned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But after that died down,</v>

267
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:06.210
<v Speaker 3>he real depression set in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the time I got caught up with </v>

268
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 3>them again in Vicenza and interviewed </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

269
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 3>many of them said that they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

270
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to come back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

271
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.940
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to go back out to restrepo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it reminded me of what Ellis had </v>

272
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.541
<v Speaker 3>said and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it that's why is it that no one </v>

273
00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:18.541
<v Speaker 3>wants to come home?</v>

274
00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:18.541
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

275
00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 3>And I realized it's not that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want war,</v>

276
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.380
<v Speaker 3>that they're not sociopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

277
00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:22.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

278
00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:27.661
<v Speaker 3>like they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to be out there killing </v>

279
00:12:27.661 --> 00:12:27.730
<v Speaker 3>people and getting shot at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They missed each other.</v>

280
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 3>They missed the intense communalism of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life in a platoon on a,</v>

281
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.330
<v Speaker 3>on a remote hilltop in combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

282
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.960
<v Speaker 3>and that's an inch and instruct me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I studied anthropology in college.</v>

283
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A platoon in combat effectively </v>

284
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.310
<v Speaker 3>reproduces our human evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

285
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:47.281
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we evolved to live in groups of that </v>

286
00:12:47.281 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 3>size and in a harsh environment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what a platoon is.</v>

287
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 3>And so of course it resonated with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resonated genetically with them.</v>

288
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

289
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:53.000
<v Speaker 3>I gotta say it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

290
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 3>as it was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a weird,</v>

291
00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.750
<v Speaker 3>also weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't quite want to call it a </v>

292
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.031
<v Speaker 3>euphoria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a strange sense of wellbeing out </v>

293
00:13:03.031 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 3>there that I missed enormously when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>left as well.</v>

294
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.710
<v Speaker 3>You missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

295
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.690
<v Speaker 3>enormously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

296
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Did you try to rationalize it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you try to,</v>

297
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.200
<v Speaker 3>when did you sit alone with it and try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure out what it was or did you </v>

298
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 3>just accept it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

299
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:17.260
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

300
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 3>I've been covering wars since the early </v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties.</v>

301
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:21.550
<v Speaker 3>I started going to Afghanistan in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mid nineties.</v>

302
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came back from,</v>

303
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.830
<v Speaker 3>from Restrepo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

304
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.490
<v Speaker 3>we were in a lot of combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost,</v>

305
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 3>almost killed a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had some sort of trauma issues.</v>

306
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody did a,</v>

307
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:37.060
<v Speaker 3>my marriage started to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was not coincidental by the way.</v>

308
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:39.340
<v Speaker 3>I now realized that the timing was </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant.</v>

309
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took me awhile to understand that and</v>

310
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.960
<v Speaker 3>I think and we're real depression and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>took me a while to understand that my </v>

311
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.081
<v Speaker 3>depression was partly connected to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that I was no longer part of a </v>

312
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:52.760
<v Speaker 3>group and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a,</v>

313
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:57.770
<v Speaker 3>but took a long time for me to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that out while I was experiencing all </v>

314
00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:57.770
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

315
00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:02.610
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like I was in some kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was behind bulletproof </v>

316
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 3>bulletproof plexiglass and I was on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside and everyone I cared about was on</v>

317
00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:12.421
<v Speaker 3>the other side of the plexiglass and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't reach them that they were </v>

318
00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:13.090
<v Speaker 3>somehow inaccessible to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't hear them,</v>

319
00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:18.091
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't touch them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was alone in this plexiglass cage and </v>

320
00:14:18.091 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 3>that's what it sort of felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was incredibly depressed.</v>

321
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:21.940
<v Speaker 3>And then Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my good friend and brother and colleague</v>

322
00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:26.941
<v Speaker 3>who I made Restrepo with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was killed in combat in Libya and </v>

323
00:14:26.941 --> 00:14:28.130
<v Speaker 3>that was the final blow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

324
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 3>I really crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My marriage ended.</v>

325
00:14:30.071 --> 00:14:31.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a real mess for awhile.</v>

326
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.990
<v Speaker 3>How did you pull out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

327
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:37.810
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

328
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:38.260
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

329
00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

330
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.960
<v Speaker 3>a year or so in the wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think psychologically and um,</v>

331
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans are evolved obviously to deal </v>

332
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 3>with trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

333
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 3>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

334
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:53.131
<v Speaker 3>if trauma was incapacitating to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>for years or lifetimes,</v>

335
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

336
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:55.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

337
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:56.460
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

338
00:14:56.461 --> 00:14:57.200
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

339
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.320
<v Speaker 3>our history as a species involved a huge</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of trauma.</v>

340
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.920
<v Speaker 3>So we are designed to react to trauma by</v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting ourselves emotionally and </v>

341
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.660
<v Speaker 3>physically for a certain amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>for some weeks or months,</v>

342
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.720
<v Speaker 3>maybe a year or two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the slowly come out of it and </v>

343
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:13.720
<v Speaker 3>continue functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what happened to me.</v>

344
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.580
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you get something out of it?</v>

345
00:15:17.581 --> 00:15:22.581
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously it's a terrible experience to </v>

346
00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:22.581
<v Speaker 4>be depressed for that long and to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>through all that.</v>

347
00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:24.900
<v Speaker 4>But did you get some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of yourself out of it?</v>

348
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

349
00:15:26.381 --> 00:15:26.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

350
00:15:26.771 --> 00:15:28.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

351
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some ways,</v>

352
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

353
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:31.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

354
00:15:31.921 --> 00:15:33.180
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

355
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.970
<v Speaker 3>my marriage ended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

356
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

357
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved out of my home,</v>

358
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was living in a very sort of a thread,</v>

359
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.270
<v Speaker 3>bare existence for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sort of gave up everything that,</v>

360
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.880
<v Speaker 3>that made me feel safe and protected in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

361
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:46.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>financially,</v>

362
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.250
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just sort of happened,</v>

363
00:15:48.251 --> 00:15:49.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>financially,</v>

364
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:50.620
<v Speaker 3>emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

365
00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:55.621
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't working as a reporter for a </v>

366
00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:58.920
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd stopped reporting after Tim got </v>

367
00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.860
<v Speaker 3>killed and I just sort of hit the reset </v>
<v Speaker 3>button on myself as a person.</v>

368
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:00.680
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

369
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:01.630
<v Speaker 3>and I sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

370
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.130
<v Speaker 3>when I came back from that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

371
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.380
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things I added to my life were very </v>

372
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:10.380
<v Speaker 3>solid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

373
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:10.380
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're very,</v>

374
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.190
<v Speaker 3>very good things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

375
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.770
<v Speaker 3>I sort of started from zero again and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that really kind of worked.</v>

376
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.130
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I also stopped.</v>

377
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:18.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean I didn't have a drinking problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

378
00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:23.791
<v Speaker 3>but I stopped drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped drinking alcohol and that the </v>

379
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.470
<v Speaker 3>drinking alcohol I made me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made me drink alcohol,</v>

380
00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:27.370
<v Speaker 3>made me feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

381
00:16:27.371 --> 00:16:28.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really happy drunk.</v>

382
00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:30.910
<v Speaker 3>And when I was depressed for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a bunch of reasons,</v>

383
00:16:30.911 --> 00:16:32.350
<v Speaker 3>if I drank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt great.</v>

384
00:16:32.351 --> 00:16:34.180
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a real incentive to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

385
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.780
<v Speaker 3>And I realized that it was depriving me </v>
<v Speaker 3>of experiencing my actual life.</v>

386
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Like my actual life was filled with some</v>
<v Speaker 3>very tough things at the moment.</v>

387
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.970
<v Speaker 3>And if you self medicate your way </v>
<v Speaker 3>through them,</v>

388
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.550
<v Speaker 3>you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things are taken from you.</v>

389
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.160
<v Speaker 3>It's your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life you're going through.</v>

390
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:56.170
<v Speaker 3>And if they were taking it and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized I might lose the experience of </v>

391
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:56.800
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

392
00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my ex wife and I are like quick,</v>

393
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.670
<v Speaker 3>good friends now and ended up partly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

394
00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:03.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided to try and experience the loss</v>

395
00:17:03.611 --> 00:17:06.190
<v Speaker 3>of the marriage as directly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that involved not drinking.</v>

396
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.600
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during this time of depression,</v>

397
00:17:10.601 --> 00:17:13.270
<v Speaker 4>did you consider or did you take any </v>
<v Speaker 4>antidepressants?</v>

398
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:13.730
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

399
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.450
<v Speaker 3>just likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

400
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.720
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

401
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.140
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

402
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:22.210
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to someone professional </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how I felt because I was a little </v>

403
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:22.210
<v Speaker 3>worried about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

404
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said to her,</v>

405
00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:24.190
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

406
00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:27.820
<v Speaker 3>if I was on antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might allow me to accept.</v>

407
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.240
<v Speaker 3>It might make me feel good enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>accept a life that isn't really working </v>

408
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:33.640
<v Speaker 3>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

409
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.360
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a person who's not depressed,</v>

410
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.650
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

411
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.500
<v Speaker 4>it's a slippery argument for me because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

412
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm just an outside observer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

413
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.840
<v Speaker 4>and when I talked to people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>depressed and I always wonder like,</v>

414
00:17:45.841 --> 00:17:50.841
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of what you're doing is life </v>

415
00:17:50.841 --> 00:17:50.841
<v Speaker 4>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much is it actual,</v>

416
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.120
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a mental imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a chemical imbalance that </v>

417
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 2>you just are unfortunately born with.</v>

418
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

419
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously there are people that </v>

420
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.040
<v Speaker 3>encountered their first impression is </v>
<v Speaker 3>teenagers and struggle with a very </v>

421
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:06.040
<v Speaker 3>dangerous illness their whole lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

422
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>

423
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>

424
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:14.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't circumstance nurture genetics </v>

425
00:18:14.991 --> 00:18:14.991
<v Speaker 3>involved in that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

426
00:18:14.991 --> 00:18:14.991
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

427
00:18:14.991 --> 00:18:19.731
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my depression was a very healthy </v>

428
00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:19.731
<v Speaker 3>reaction to some tough circumstances I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going through.</v>

429
00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 3>I was having a completely healthy self </v>
<v Speaker 3>protective reaction to what was going on</v>

430
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:29.271
<v Speaker 3>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you say you started putting </v>

431
00:18:29.271 --> 00:18:29.271
<v Speaker 3>positive things in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good solid things in your life,</v>

432
00:18:29.271 --> 00:18:30.300
<v Speaker 3>like what kind of things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A good relationship?</v>

433
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started working again.</v>

434
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.850
<v Speaker 3>I started being physically really active</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

435
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

436
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started boxing actually and,</v>

437
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.200
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was inspiring and stuff and </v>

438
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:45.200
<v Speaker 3>that was incredibly frightening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

439
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of is very,</v>

440
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:51.870
<v Speaker 3>very hard and among other things and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all that stuff really was really,</v>

441
00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:52.650
<v Speaker 3>really good for me.</v>

442
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:58.240
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>dwelling on a lot lately is how </v>

443
00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.420
<v Speaker 2>important struggle is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me personally,</v>

444
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

445
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of things and I do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I'm terrible at and uh,</v>

446
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:09.790
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the more happy I am is when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I just get slightly better at these </v>

447
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.500
<v Speaker 2>terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's when I feel like little bits</v>

448
00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:13.430
<v Speaker 2>of progress</v>

449
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:18.550
<v Speaker 3>that is exactly how we're wired to react</v>
<v Speaker 3>to success.</v>

450
00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.510
<v Speaker 3>And if you sort of think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about us as a species,</v>

451
00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:25.360
<v Speaker 3>as an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're presented with a challenge and</v>

452
00:19:25.361 --> 00:19:28.660
<v Speaker 3>you get a little dose of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of endorphins and dopamine,</v>

453
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.730
<v Speaker 3>some feel good chemicals when you do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>task well that will encourage you to </v>

454
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.890
<v Speaker 3>keep doing that task and keep looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>for success,</v>

455
00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:40.891
<v Speaker 3>small successes in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly how people adapt and </v>

456
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:41.320
<v Speaker 3>survive in harsh circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

457
00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 3>the problem with affluent modern society</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it takes away all of the tasks of </v>

458
00:19:47.531 --> 00:19:48.820
<v Speaker 3>survival,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

459
00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.090
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not no one in this room I don't think is</v>

460
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.920
<v Speaker 3>having to figure out every morning how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to literally physically survive where,</v>

461
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.580
<v Speaker 3>where am I going to get my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the berries,</v>

462
00:19:57.581 --> 00:20:00.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to eat today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go to kill something that</v>

463
00:20:00.281 --> 00:20:00.820
<v Speaker 3>I can eat.</v>

464
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.430
<v Speaker 3>How am I going to avoid the enemy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not thinking like that.</v>

465
00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.190
<v Speaker 3>And which is enormous blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

466
00:20:06.191 --> 00:20:11.191
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an enormous luxury to live like </v>

467
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:11.191
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The downside is you don't get this sense</v>

468
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:15.751
<v Speaker 3>of mastery over your circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You actually don't feel responsible for </v>

469
00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:19.150
<v Speaker 3>your own survival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel like you are earning your</v>

470
00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:21.670
<v Speaker 3>own survival in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like it's being handed to you.</v>

471
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 3>And I grew up in an affluent suburb and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had a sense as a young man that </v>

472
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.291
<v Speaker 3>I was contributing in any way to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that I was physically alive on the </v>

473
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:31.291
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>

474
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:31.540
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

475
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.080
<v Speaker 3>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very recent in human history that young,</v>

476
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.960
<v Speaker 3>young men could afford to feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

477
00:20:37.961 --> 00:20:39.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

478
00:20:39.101 --> 00:20:42.610
<v Speaker 3>it's a blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also a bit of a curse.</v>

479
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.590
<v Speaker 2>It's the most disconnected amongst us </v>
<v Speaker 2>are always spoiled rich kids that handed</v>

480
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:52.591
<v Speaker 2>everything to them and don't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an understanding at all about the </v>

481
00:20:52.591 --> 00:20:52.591
<v Speaker 2>consequences of their behavior.</v>

482
00:20:52.591 --> 00:20:52.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

483
00:20:52.591 --> 00:20:53.130
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

484
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of life is correlated with</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>

485
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

486
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

487
00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:58.870
<v Speaker 3>drug abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

488
00:20:58.871 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

489
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.290
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

490
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suicide rate is rising fastest among</v>

491
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 3>middle aged white men who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to some people,</v>

492
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:14.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are apparently arguably the demographic </v>

493
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 3>that they're are most privileged in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

494
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing the best with this civilization </v>

495
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.201
<v Speaker 2>that we've constructed during the wars </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically in terms of how they </v>

496
00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:25.201
<v Speaker 2>adapted it and psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

497
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The psychologically is a big part of the</v>

498
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:29.440
<v Speaker 2>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

499
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about this quest for </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

500
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things I thought was </v>

501
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.441
<v Speaker 2>really interesting in the book where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were outlining the key factors for </v>

502
00:21:40.441 --> 00:21:42.010
<v Speaker 2>happiness and that wealth is not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary one,</v>

503
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:47.011
<v Speaker 2>but being good at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being recognized for being good at </v>

504
00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:47.890
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a part of a group,</v>

505
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.990
<v Speaker 2>like all these things were primary.</v>

506
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

507
00:21:51.171 --> 00:21:52.970
<v Speaker 3>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

508
00:21:52.971 --> 00:21:54.950
<v Speaker 3>in evolutionary terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

509
00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.340
<v Speaker 3>we are safest when we are needed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

510
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.070
<v Speaker 3>So if you're in a group and the group </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs you,</v>

511
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:06.910
<v Speaker 3>your status in the group is secure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it had better be because humans do </v>

512
00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:11.951
<v Speaker 3>not survive alone in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A alone human in nature is a dead human,</v>

513
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're primates.</v>

514
00:22:14.391 --> 00:22:16.510
<v Speaker 3>We're social primates alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Primate in the,</v>

515
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:18.860
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in nature is a dead primate.</v>

516
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.140
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for most of the species.</v>

517
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.460
<v Speaker 3>And we get our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get our safety or protection from the</v>

518
00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:27.260
<v Speaker 3>fact that we worked very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very well in groups.</v>

519
00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:30.290
<v Speaker 3>We don't have long claws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a sharp teeth.</v>

520
00:22:30.291 --> 00:22:33.620
<v Speaker 3>We can't run very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't climb trees worth a damn.</v>

521
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Were extremely vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we get our safety and our dominance </v>

522
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.860
<v Speaker 3>in the natural world from our ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work in a group.</v>

523
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.080
<v Speaker 3>So if you're necessary to that group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're safe.</v>

524
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.680
<v Speaker 3>So people get very depressed when </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances in their life change and </v>

525
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.461
<v Speaker 3>they're suddenly not needed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when people get old and retire </v>

526
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:52.160
<v Speaker 3>there at very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high risk of depression.</v>

527
00:22:52.161 --> 00:22:53.990
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

528
00:22:53.991 --> 00:22:58.991
<v Speaker 3>when people lose their job and can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>find a job there at extremely high risk </v>

529
00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:03.461
<v Speaker 3>of depression and suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the economy takes a downturn as </v>

530
00:23:03.461 --> 00:23:04.490
<v Speaker 3>it did in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

531
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.060
<v Speaker 3>and the unemployment rate goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suicide rate immediately goes up.</v>

532
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.090
<v Speaker 3>It tracks the unemployment rate almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

533
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 3>And one of the points I make in my book </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a very small number of mostly </v>

534
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.191
<v Speaker 3>men collapsed the US economy in 2008 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them living on was working on </v>

535
00:23:21.561 --> 00:23:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a direct.</v>

536
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.680
<v Speaker 3>I read an article in an academic journal</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Epod,</v>

537
00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.370
<v Speaker 3>a epidemics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

538
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:37.790
<v Speaker 3>that there was a directly attributable </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the financial collapse.</v>

539
00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:43.030
<v Speaker 3>There were five or 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>additional suicides in the United </v>

540
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:43.370
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly middle aged white men.</v>

541
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sort of professional prefer </v>

542
00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:49.520
<v Speaker 3>professional people and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

543
00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 3>of all of all classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

544
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.660
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

545
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:59.500
<v Speaker 3>and I realized that that was almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the casualty rate from the two </v>

546
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:04.580
<v Speaker 3>wars from Iraq and Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

547
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:09.970
<v Speaker 3>something that happened at home </v>
<v Speaker 3>economically killed just as many </v>

548
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Americans as both wars did and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 3>went to prison.</v>

549
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Not One of those guys was prosecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people responsible for the collapse </v>

550
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.790
<v Speaker 3>of our economy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing happened to those guys.</v>

551
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.730
<v Speaker 3>And you could argue they kill just as </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people as,</v>

552
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our enemies did overseas.</v>

553
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 3>And there's a real injustice there.</v>

554
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people aren't even aware of</v>

555
00:24:28.811 --> 00:24:33.811
<v Speaker 2>how screw the whole thing was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a great documentary that I </v>

556
00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:34.150
<v Speaker 2>always recommend to people called an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside job.</v>

557
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>

558
00:24:35.681 --> 00:24:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that guy's starts questioning those</v>

559
00:24:37.661 --> 00:24:42.661
<v Speaker 2>economics professors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the guys who eventually got </v>

560
00:24:42.661 --> 00:24:46.441
<v Speaker 2>jobs in the government and he went from </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and got jobs at big corporations </v>

561
00:24:46.441 --> 00:24:50.941
<v Speaker 2>and you see them like folding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folding under the weight of the actual </v>

562
00:24:50.941 --> 00:24:51.690
<v Speaker 2>truth of what they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

563
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:52.510
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

564
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:53.770
<v Speaker 3>what was disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

565
00:24:53.771 --> 00:24:54.370
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were,</v>

566
00:24:54.371 --> 00:24:59.371
<v Speaker 3>I mean there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were companies that were getting </v>

567
00:24:59.371 --> 00:25:01.680
<v Speaker 3>bailed out by the taxpayer to the tune </v>
<v Speaker 3>of billions of dollars,</v>

568
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bailed out and the head,</v>

569
00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:11.570
<v Speaker 3>the corporate leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they corporate heads of those companies </v>

570
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.690
<v Speaker 3>who had bankrupted their countries and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ask the country to bail them out while </v>

571
00:25:15.791 --> 00:25:20.791
<v Speaker 3>they were getting bailed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These men were taking year end bonuses </v>

572
00:25:20.791 --> 00:25:20.791
<v Speaker 3>of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

573
00:25:20.791 --> 00:25:22.300
<v Speaker 3>$30,000,000.</v>

574
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was stunning.</v>

575
00:25:23.751 --> 00:25:26.810
<v Speaker 2>And then they were trying to put a cap </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the bonuses,</v>

576
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.080
<v Speaker 2>like instead of removing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to put a cap on the </v>

577
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.080
<v Speaker 2>bonus cap of 20 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

578
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>

579
00:25:32.151 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 2>St.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

580
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.520
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about that and um,</v>

581
00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:35.210
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

582
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:40.390
<v Speaker 3>in you makes you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me feel like we don't really </v>

583
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.781
<v Speaker 3>have a country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an entity it group that isn't </v>

584
00:25:43.781 --> 00:25:45.320
<v Speaker 3>willing to defend itself isn't really a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>

585
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were attacked by,</v>

586
00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:52.181
<v Speaker 3>in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were attacked by those people </v>

587
00:25:52.181 --> 00:25:52.181
<v Speaker 3>economically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

588
00:25:52.181 --> 00:25:55.660
<v Speaker 3>The actions of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the selfserving actions have a very </v>

589
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 3>small number of people cost this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

590
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:59.180
<v Speaker 3>$14,000,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

591
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.940
<v Speaker 3>There were no consequences for those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

592
00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:05.600
<v Speaker 3>They're actually rewarded and it makes a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person think like,</v>

593
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:07.520
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>

594
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:13.870
<v Speaker 3>is there something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there something called America like </v>

595
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.031
<v Speaker 3>the United States like innocent in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense that we'll defend ourselves if </v>

596
00:26:16.031 --> 00:26:16.031
<v Speaker 3>we're attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

597
00:26:16.031 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the definitions of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

598
00:26:17.691 --> 00:26:19.970
<v Speaker 3>of a group and we didn't defend </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>

599
00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:23.540
<v Speaker 3>And so you saw in the recent election,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of,</v>

600
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:25.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the confusion in the,</v>

601
00:26:25.461 --> 00:26:28.220
<v Speaker 3>in the population about what it means to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be an American.</v>

602
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Like who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

603
00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:34.611
<v Speaker 3>what do we belong to here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what do we owe our loyalty to an </v>

604
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:34.900
<v Speaker 3>enormous amount of confusion and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

605
00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.090
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in my opinion,</v>

606
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:37.580
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's increasing,</v>

607
00:26:37.581 --> 00:26:40.010
<v Speaker 3>not decreasing right now in the current </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>

608
00:26:40.011 --> 00:26:45.011
<v Speaker 3>but it comes from some of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions like we're in two that no </v>

609
00:26:45.011 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 3>one's paying attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

610
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we lost $14,000,000,000,000</v>

611
00:26:47.371 --> 00:26:52.371
<v Speaker 3>and nobody blinked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it that we belong to and </v>

612
00:26:52.371 --> 00:26:52.371
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

613
00:26:52.371 --> 00:26:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do seem to be in a deep state of </v>

614
00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.391
<v Speaker 3>confusion and I think one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing with people even like </v>

615
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 3>trump supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

616
00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:04.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are these online fraud people,</v>

617
00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little frog avatars,</v>

618
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things that they like</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it is that becomes,</v>

619
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.290
<v Speaker 3>they become a part of a troublesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little group.</v>

620
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

621
00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

622
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.380
<v Speaker 3>They have a sense of purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

623
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

624
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:18.690
<v Speaker 3>why do you think people join isis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these European,</v>

625
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in Europe joining Isis.</v>

626
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want a sense of purpose and you </v>

627
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.861
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been taken in by the propaganda </v>

628
00:27:27.861 --> 00:27:29.511
<v Speaker 3>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't realize it's a completely </v>

629
00:27:29.511 --> 00:27:29.520
<v Speaker 3>bloodthirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible criminal group,</v>

630
00:27:29.521 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they want a sense of meaning,</v>

631
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:33.000
<v Speaker 3>a sense of purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

632
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great band from out here about 15 years </v>

633
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:38.280
<v Speaker 3>ago called called Queens of the Stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>Age.</v>

634
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love those guys.</v>

635
00:27:39.071 --> 00:27:39.800
<v Speaker 3>You amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

636
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.230
<v Speaker 3>And one of the lines line in one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their songs started to quote rock lyrics</v>

637
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 3>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the lines is,</v>

638
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wanted something to die for it and </v>

639
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.410
<v Speaker 3>make it beautiful to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

640
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 3>That's a very profound insight into what</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes people feel like they're leading a</v>

641
00:27:58.411 --> 00:27:59.340
<v Speaker 3>worthy life.</v>

642
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of walking through a nerfed </v>

643
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.240
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

644
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

645
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:10.000
<v Speaker 3>So PROZAC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you walk around and ask people in </v>

646
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.000
<v Speaker 3>the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you die for?</v>

647
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

648
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:12.450
<v Speaker 3>or what idea would you die for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

649
00:28:12.451 --> 00:28:13.570
<v Speaker 3>people wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

650
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.330
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't have an answer for most of</v>

651
00:28:15.331 --> 00:28:16.820
<v Speaker 3>human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

652
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.450
<v Speaker 3>the immediate answer would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

653
00:28:18.451 --> 00:28:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I die for my people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

654
00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this and this.</v>

655
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Our encampment gets attacked by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>enemy.</v>

656
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:24.510
<v Speaker 3>I would die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would die defending this place,</v>

657
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

658
00:28:25.701 --> 00:28:27.990
<v Speaker 3>and know that no one has that answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

659
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:28.670
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

660
00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.250
<v Speaker 3>and which is shows that we live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>safety and luxury,</v>

661
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:37.251
<v Speaker 3>which is lovely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it deprives people of a sense of </v>

662
00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:37.890
<v Speaker 3>purpose and meaning not just safety and </v>
<v Speaker 3>luxury,</v>

663
00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:42.891
<v Speaker 3>but this staggering change and what has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been a normal way of living for people </v>

664
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:44.520
<v Speaker 3>for thousands and thousands of years.</v>

665
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:49.820
<v Speaker 3>When you were writing this book and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were thinking about all the ways that </v>

666
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 3>human beings have altered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment around them,</v>

667
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.490
<v Speaker 3>did you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you were saying that,</v>

668
00:28:56.491 --> 00:28:59.150
<v Speaker 3>and I've read this before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genetics essentially we're riding on</v>

669
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.930
<v Speaker 3>the same genetics that were 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago from 20,</v>

670
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:04.240
<v Speaker 3>25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

671
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.440
<v Speaker 3>or are we going to change that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like are we going to become more </v>

672
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.250
<v Speaker 3>compatible with this bizarre and </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial world that we've created?</v>

673
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 3>Or are we going to get deeper and deeper</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed?</v>

674
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:15.720
<v Speaker 3>Are we going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

675
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:20.930
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so our society or culture is changing </v>

676
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:21.480
<v Speaker 3>way faster than genetic change can </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

677
00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we haven't even adapted genetically </v>

678
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:27.840
<v Speaker 3>to the advent of agriculture 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

679
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.000
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

680
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:35.030
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the only way genetic change happens </v>

681
00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:38.061
<v Speaker 3>in a population is that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference in survival between people </v>

682
00:29:38.061 --> 00:29:38.850
<v Speaker 3>with one trait and people with another </v>
<v Speaker 3>trade.</v>

683
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:43.850
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you have a genetic trait and it </v>

684
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:48.430
<v Speaker 3>leads to you having fewer children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually 10,000</v>

685
00:29:48.431 --> 00:29:50.710
<v Speaker 3>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people with your genetic trait will tend</v>

686
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:52.870
<v Speaker 3>to die out because you're leaving fewer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

687
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:55.030
<v Speaker 3>you're passing on less DNA to the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>

688
00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.240
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you have a trait that allows you </v>

689
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.671
<v Speaker 3>to raise more children to maturity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they carry your DNA and then they'll be </v>

690
00:30:02.671 --> 00:30:04.840
<v Speaker 3>more successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that trade tends to spread.</v>

691
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:10.290
<v Speaker 3>So does human unhappiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's unhappiness lead to lower </v>

692
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.980
<v Speaker 3>fertility rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably not.</v>

693
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.330
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean,</v>

694
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.020
<v Speaker 3>often a depression starts in midlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

695
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:21.220
<v Speaker 3>by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people have a one or two children,</v>

696
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've passed on their DNA.</v>

697
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 3>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it only acts through reproductive rights</v>

698
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.900
<v Speaker 3>is something happened to us then there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there must be some way where human </v>

699
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.090
<v Speaker 3>beings are going to become going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become accustomed to this bizarre way.</v>

700
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:40.340
<v Speaker 3>We're living stacked on top of each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other constantly and traffic.</v>

701
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:41.410
<v Speaker 3>We are accustomed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

702
00:30:41.411 --> 00:30:43.450
<v Speaker 3>humans are very adaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptable.</v>

703
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:43.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

704
00:30:43.961 --> 00:30:48.961
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can put people in solitary </v>

705
00:30:48.961 --> 00:30:48.961
<v Speaker 3>confinement in jail and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy.</v>

706
00:30:48.961 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 3>They're extremely depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there it will physically survive for</v>

707
00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:52.750
<v Speaker 3>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

708
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:53.650
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

709
00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:56.740
<v Speaker 3>evolution doesn't promise happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that will evolve towards</v>

710
00:30:56.741 --> 00:31:01.741
<v Speaker 3>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means that we will adapt so that we </v>

711
00:31:01.741 --> 00:31:03.430
<v Speaker 3>can re reproduce our DNA for the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>

712
00:31:03.431 --> 00:31:08.431
<v Speaker 3>That's all evolution means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always just looked at all this </v>

713
00:31:08.431 --> 00:31:11.490
<v Speaker 3>reliance on electronics and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascination with innovation and I've </v>

714
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.850
<v Speaker 3>wondered if that's where we're headed if</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

715
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like it's priming us for </v>

716
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.900
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a symbiotic relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>with machines that were asked.</v>

717
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
<v Speaker 3>We become more reliant on technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>stack more and more people into places </v>

718
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.570
<v Speaker 3>make it easier and easier to survive.</v>

719
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the one constant is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly embedded in technology.</v>

720
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

721
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:36.130
<v Speaker 3>technology is a tool of like the bow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrow was and,</v>

722
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.940
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

723
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep in mind the,</v>

724
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.500
<v Speaker 3>the segment of the world population </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is deeply intertwined with high </v>

725
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.530
<v Speaker 3>tech is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very small.</v>

726
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Most of humanity lives in a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple and very,</v>

727
00:31:47.321 --> 00:31:52.321
<v Speaker 3>very poor way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're talking about the human </v>

728
00:31:52.321 --> 00:31:52.321
<v Speaker 3>race as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

729
00:31:52.321 --> 00:31:52.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about southern </v>
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

730
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the human race as a whole,</v>

731
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this technology happened yesterday,</v>

732
00:31:57.521 --> 00:31:58.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it happened 10 years ago,</v>

733
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:01.160
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago in 20 years is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

734
00:32:01.161 --> 00:32:02.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

735
00:32:02.051 --> 00:32:03.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what's coming down the pike.</v>

736
00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

737
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.080
<v Speaker 3>that's not even a blanket of an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an eye in evolutionary terms.</v>

738
00:32:08.081 --> 00:32:09.010
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even exist.</v>

739
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:09.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

740
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.430
<v Speaker 3>evolution happens over the course of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,000</v>

741
00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when you living this life,</v>

742
00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:19.390
<v Speaker 3>when you are a war journalist and urine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these insane places,</v>

743
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:23.770
<v Speaker 3>and then you come back to New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of like a decompression period</v>

744
00:32:23.771 --> 00:32:25.610
<v Speaker 3>do you have to go through?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

745
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:26.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often the,</v>

746
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 3>the developing world that I've worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

747
00:32:29.021 --> 00:32:34.021
<v Speaker 3>I'm no longer covering wars by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by the developing world is often a </v>

748
00:32:34.021 --> 00:32:35.000
<v Speaker 3>very chaotic urban mix of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

749
00:32:35.001 --> 00:32:40.001
<v Speaker 3>poverty and cars and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pollution and buildings that are </v>

750
00:32:40.001 --> 00:32:40.001
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

751
00:32:40.001 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is not necessarily not urban.</v>

752
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

753
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:46.540
<v Speaker 3>but what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I would say is that there's a,</v>

754
00:32:46.541 --> 00:32:51.541
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something I would describe as a </v>

755
00:32:51.541 --> 00:32:53.980
<v Speaker 3>kind of disappointment to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

756
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:59.750
<v Speaker 3>if you wake up in the morning and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>survival is a kind of question mark and </v>

757
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to act well and,</v>

758
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:01.050
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

759
00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:06.510
<v Speaker 3>and with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with sort of clarity and precision and </v>

760
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.150
<v Speaker 3>quickness in order to survive.</v>

761
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.130
<v Speaker 3>That is intoxicating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

762
00:33:10.131 --> 00:33:15.131
<v Speaker 3>The challenge of that is intoxicating </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you feel like you're sort of in a </v>

763
00:33:15.131 --> 00:33:18.521
<v Speaker 3>way earning your existence and when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave that it's a relief,</v>

764
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:24.460
<v Speaker 3>but it's also a disappointment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're no longer earning </v>

765
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:24.460
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

766
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:29.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's a relief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also kind of disappointing and </v>

767
00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:29.290
<v Speaker 3>in that disappointment you can get quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed.</v>

768
00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:33.401
<v Speaker 3>So I know that the depression rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when Pete Been Peace Corps </v>

769
00:33:33.401 --> 00:33:36.020
<v Speaker 3>volunteers come back from two years </v>
<v Speaker 3>service overseas,</v>

770
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.540
<v Speaker 3>they're not in war zones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're in the developing world,</v>

771
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 3>are living in small communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're living at a much more difficult,</v>

772
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:45.410
<v Speaker 3>physically difficult existence than </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in our system.</v>

773
00:33:45.411 --> 00:33:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Most people in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they come back to America,</v>

774
00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:54.210
<v Speaker 3>the land of cars and everything you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could want in a superstore in a </v>

775
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.200
<v Speaker 3>supermarket in Nice beds and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you think people want.</v>

776
00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.590
<v Speaker 3>When Peace Corps volunteers come back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this lovely environment,</v>

777
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 3>around 25 percent of them get profoundly</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed.</v>

778
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So clearly what wakes people feel good </v>

779
00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.730
<v Speaker 3>is challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not ease.</v>

780
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the conclusion I draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not just challenged,</v>

781
00:34:13.631 --> 00:34:15.920
<v Speaker 3>but challenged in the context of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>community of people.</v>

782
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we have ease in the,</v>

783
00:34:18.531 --> 00:34:19.030
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

784
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.520
<v Speaker 3>in the context of oneself or one's </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual family,</v>

785
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.050
<v Speaker 3>but not in the context of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

786
00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:28.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at catastrophes,</v>

787
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Hurricane Katrina was just in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi and I was amazed,</v>

788
00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:34.130
<v Speaker 3>not amazed actually in some ways to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have many people say,</v>

789
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really Miss Hurricane Katrina.</v>

790
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.300
<v Speaker 3>We were all so close afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

791
00:34:38.301 --> 00:34:40.940
<v Speaker 3>is this a society with a lot of racial </v>
<v Speaker 3>division and all kinds of stuff.</v>

792
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.310
<v Speaker 3>None of that mattered after Hurricane </v>
<v Speaker 3>Katrina.</v>

793
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Everyone cooperated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone helped each other,</v>

794
00:34:45.411 --> 00:34:48.350
<v Speaker 3>make people feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what human beings want.</v>

795
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.320
<v Speaker 4>So what we've done by making things too </v>
<v Speaker 4>safe,</v>

796
00:34:51.321 --> 00:34:51.890
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>

797
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:56.950
<v Speaker 4>we've dropped off the hills and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>made everything flat and people long for</v>

798
00:34:57.771 --> 00:34:59.060
<v Speaker 4>those hills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

799
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:04.240
<v Speaker 4>There's a group of friends that I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are bow hunters and one of the </v>

800
00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.471
<v Speaker 4>things that people have gotten really </v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted to his solo hunting where even </v>

801
00:35:08.471 --> 00:35:11.270
<v Speaker 4>regular bow hunting is not quite </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult enough for these psychos.</v>

802
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:12.980
<v Speaker 4>So they go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>

803
00:35:12.981 --> 00:35:17.981
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 miles plus into the wilderness by </v>

804
00:35:17.981 --> 00:35:20.861
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things they say about it </v>

805
00:35:20.861 --> 00:35:23.891
<v Speaker 4>as how profoundly lonely and sad it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even though they know they could </v>

806
00:35:24.621 --> 00:35:27.320
<v Speaker 4>walk those 20 plus miles back anytime </v>
<v Speaker 4>they want,</v>

807
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:32.530
<v Speaker 4>but there's something about being out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there by themselves that when they do </v>

808
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.990
<v Speaker 4>return,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just feel invigorated and alive and</v>

809
00:35:35.991 --> 00:35:38.670
<v Speaker 4>energized and they feel like they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplished something,</v>

810
00:35:38.671 --> 00:35:40.950
<v Speaker 4>especially if they come back with an </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

811
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well listen to me,</v>

812
00:35:42.271 --> 00:35:43.610
<v Speaker 3>that's an ancient narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

813
00:35:43.611 --> 00:35:48.611
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hunter goes out and kills game and </v>

814
00:35:48.611 --> 00:35:48.611
<v Speaker 3>brings it back and feeds his people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

815
00:35:48.611 --> 00:35:53.001
<v Speaker 3>that's a beautiful story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is kept human beings alive for </v>

816
00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 3>offered on hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

817
00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:01.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some hunting is well done in groups and </v>

818
00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:01.060
<v Speaker 3>some hunting is a solo enterprise </v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on the animal.</v>

819
00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.810
<v Speaker 3>And there absolutely is a role for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of Solo endeavor.</v>

820
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Scouts are often work by themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I mean,</v>

821
00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:11.600
<v Speaker 3>in a native and native context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

822
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:16.640
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American Indians scouts often work </v>

823
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:16.640
<v Speaker 3>by themselves because they were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>harder to detect.</v>

824
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.750
<v Speaker 3>And if Tara,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a terrifying endeavor,</v>

825
00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're doing it for your people and </v>

826
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come back from that,</v>

827
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that solo experience,</v>

828
00:36:26.071 --> 00:36:27.450
<v Speaker 3>which is so frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

829
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:32.451
<v Speaker 3>we're social species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so being alone in a and in danger is </v>

830
00:36:32.451 --> 00:36:35.811
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You come back from that to your </v>

831
00:36:35.811 --> 00:36:37.821
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've served your community and your </v>

832
00:36:37.821 --> 00:36:37.821
<v Speaker 3>among your people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

833
00:36:37.821 --> 00:36:39.060
<v Speaker 3>I must be completely intoxicating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I envy those people.</v>

834
00:36:39.061 --> 00:36:39.660
<v Speaker 3>That experience.</v>

835
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just having the experience of being in </v>

836
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.990
<v Speaker 4>danger and then coming back and being at</v>
<v Speaker 4>peace makes you appreciate that piece,</v>

837
00:36:45.991 --> 00:36:49.410
<v Speaker 4>but constantly and consistently being at</v>
<v Speaker 4>peace has a numbing effect.</v>

838
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:54.860
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like constantly and consistently </v>

839
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:54.860
<v Speaker 3>being well fed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

840
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad to feel hungry once in a </v>

841
00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:57.700
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you really appreciate food,</v>

842
00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.130
<v Speaker 3>safety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>

843
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.150
<v Speaker 3>warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm being rested or tired.</v>

844
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:04.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean w w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w,</v>

845
00:37:04.631 --> 00:37:08.610
<v Speaker 3>w were adapted to to get through </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations where we don't have enough of</v>

846
00:37:08.611 --> 00:37:10.860
<v Speaker 3>what we want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we need and if we,</v>

847
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:15.900
<v Speaker 3>if we're not deprived of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we stop appreciating them and those </v>

848
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 3>things are what make up life so we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually losing.</v>

849
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.600
<v Speaker 3>We're losing our appreciation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our enjoyment of the things that make </v>

850
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 3>life what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was a real irony there.</v>

851
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 3>There is a real irony there.</v>

852
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Did you feel compelled at all to come up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a solution,</v>

853
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean in deeply describing and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going over the various aspects of these </v>

854
00:37:36.791 --> 00:37:40.030
<v Speaker 4>problems that we're facing as a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a society?</v>

855
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.810
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you have some sort of a lead?</v>

856
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:44.890
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

857
00:37:44.891 --> 00:37:46.390
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I thought,</v>

858
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.150
<v Speaker 3>if there was a solution that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of thinking of,</v>

859
00:37:49.151 --> 00:37:54.151
<v Speaker 3>I would have put it in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either I'm not smart enough or there's </v>

860
00:37:54.151 --> 00:37:55.090
<v Speaker 3>no solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

861
00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:00.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some things we can do </v>

862
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:00.780
<v Speaker 3>around the edges that will help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

863
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.500
<v Speaker 3>but we're talking about a systemic </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem in society that has,</v>

864
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.960
<v Speaker 3>that has that got it's start 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and really got it started.</v>

865
00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:14.970
<v Speaker 3>The industrial revolution and really got</v>
<v Speaker 3>really got going into the technological </v>

866
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:15.120
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're knocking,</v>

867
00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to ban the car,</v>

868
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Amish in Pennsylvania don't use </v>

869
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a very low rate of suicide and</v>

870
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.340
<v Speaker 3>depression because they spend most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives within their community,</v>

871
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:29.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That buffers that are from suicide and </v>

872
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.430
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to abandon the car,</v>

873
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

874
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.770
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to burn down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>suburbs,</v>

875
00:38:29.771 --> 00:38:32.050
<v Speaker 3>living lean tos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd probably be happier if we did,</v>

876
00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.640
<v Speaker 3>but we're not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

877
00:38:33.641 --> 00:38:38.641
<v Speaker 3>But what can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest that we have is the nation </v>

878
00:38:38.641 --> 00:38:41.671
<v Speaker 3>is the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think one thing that would help </v>

879
00:38:41.671 --> 00:38:43.981
<v Speaker 3>enormously is to treat our nation as if </v>
<v Speaker 3>we all belong to it and as if we all </v>

880
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:46.660
<v Speaker 3>respected it and that it was meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 3>to all of us.</v>

881
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.720
<v Speaker 3>And which means among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means insisting that politicians who </v>

882
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.320
<v Speaker 3>denigrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

883
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 3>who denigrate other other politicians </v>
<v Speaker 3>who denigrate segments of the </v>

884
00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:02.851
<v Speaker 3>population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who rank American citizens in terms of </v>

885
00:39:02.851 --> 00:39:04.450
<v Speaker 3>value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of being quote,</v>

886
00:39:04.451 --> 00:39:05.830
<v Speaker 3>American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that means.</v>

887
00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Politicians who do that are undermining </v>
<v Speaker 3>our sense of national community.</v>

888
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.720
<v Speaker 3>And I think that has a trickle down </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect,</v>

889
00:39:13.721 --> 00:39:15.670
<v Speaker 3>which is extremely demoralizing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes,</v>

890
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.650
<v Speaker 3>gives you the equivalent of feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

891
00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:21.460
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're feeling like you're a child in</v>

892
00:39:21.461 --> 00:39:23.530
<v Speaker 3>a family that might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the parents might get divorced.</v>

893
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.500
<v Speaker 3>I remember during the campaign between </v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald and Hilary,</v>

894
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 3>I sort of felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

895
00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:31.030
<v Speaker 3>or mom and dad split up like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening in this country.</v>

896
00:39:31.031 --> 00:39:32.680
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

897
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:33.640
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can argue,</v>

898
00:39:33.641 --> 00:39:38.641
<v Speaker 3>but you guys are really talking as if </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country's not going to stay </v>

899
00:39:38.641 --> 00:39:38.641
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

900
00:39:38.641 --> 00:39:42.910
<v Speaker 3>that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's extremely demoralizing and </v>

901
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.910
<v Speaker 3>unsettling for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

902
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.450
<v Speaker 3>it's also extremely irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the type of person that should be a</v>

903
00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:51.451
<v Speaker 3>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the type of person that puts </v>

904
00:39:51.451 --> 00:39:53.881
<v Speaker 3>that idea out there to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets into the zeitgeists and people </v>

905
00:39:53.881 --> 00:39:53.881
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

906
00:39:53.881 --> 00:39:54.640
<v Speaker 3>hey wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we really are in trouble.</v>

907
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Well exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think,</v>

908
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it it fearmongering it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

909
00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.990
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are ancient human behaviors and if</v>

910
00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 3>you tell your people that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>threat,</v>

911
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.750
<v Speaker 3>your people will rally behind you.</v>

912
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:08.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an,</v>

913
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.230
<v Speaker 3>it's an adaptive behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

914
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.300
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a politician,</v>

915
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:18.301
<v Speaker 3>if you tell your people that the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually the other political party,</v>

916
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:23.820
<v Speaker 3>you are effectively splitting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country and so you can act tribally all </v>

917
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:23.820
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

918
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.680
<v Speaker 3>tribal tribalism has a very negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>connotation as well.</v>

919
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.860
<v Speaker 3>You can act in that tribal way all you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

920
00:40:29.861 --> 00:40:32.110
<v Speaker 3>as long as you define your tribe as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

921
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.090
<v Speaker 3>the entire country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

922
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.750
<v Speaker 3>And if you start slicing off group parts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the country,</v>

923
00:40:37.751 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 3>demographic groups in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>political groups in the country,</v>

924
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:43.420
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually not really American,</v>

925
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.100
<v Speaker 3>like you really shouldn't be part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

926
00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.590
<v Speaker 3>When you start doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you destroy the country.</v>

927
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.050
<v Speaker 3>You're way more of a threat to our </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy than,</v>

928
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.150
<v Speaker 3>than Isis and al Qaeda is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

929
00:40:52.151 --> 00:40:53.680
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're such a powerful country.</v>

930
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:56.410
<v Speaker 3>We're the only force that can destroy </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

931
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.160
<v Speaker 3>No one else can touch us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can hurt us.</v>

932
00:40:58.161 --> 00:41:00.930
<v Speaker 3>So they can't really destroy us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can destroy us and we can,</v>

933
00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:05.940
<v Speaker 3>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will destroy ourselves through </v>

934
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.681
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was one of the things that was most </v>

935
00:41:07.681 --> 00:41:08.260
<v Speaker 3>disturbing about the debates when Donald</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump said that if Hillary Clinton won,</v>

936
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.840
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't necessarily accept the </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>

937
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:12.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

938
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:17.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was being a co that was completely </v>

939
00:41:17.161 --> 00:41:17.920
<v Speaker 3>antithetical to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

940
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.580
<v Speaker 3>to democracy and to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

941
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.440
<v Speaker 3>to the concept of a country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the concept of a democratic country.</v>

942
00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:25.120
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's a part of it.</v>

943
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:30.210
<v Speaker 3>So if she becomes the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's his president and we're all </v>

944
00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.421
<v Speaker 3>supposed to look at the president as </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the one person that we've </v>

945
00:41:33.421 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>elected as leader and what he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially saying it's either</v>

946
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.820
<v Speaker 4>me or nothing.</v>

947
00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:35.730
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>

948
00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.050
<v Speaker 3>and what I really am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a democrat.</v>

949
00:41:38.051 --> 00:41:39.530
<v Speaker 3>I didn't vote for Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

950
00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.260
<v Speaker 3>but I really didn't like it when some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my fellow Democrats after he was elected</v>

951
00:41:44.261 --> 00:41:45.580
<v Speaker 3>and he was elected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

952
00:41:45.581 --> 00:41:46.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one way or another.</v>

953
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.740
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

954
00:41:47.741 --> 00:41:50.110
<v Speaker 3>if you can investigate Russia if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want or whatever,</v>

955
00:41:50.111 --> 00:41:52.060
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact is that he,</v>

956
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:57.360
<v Speaker 3>he got the most electoral votes and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>our president and I really disliked it </v>

957
00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:57.460
<v Speaker 3>when my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of my fellow Democrats said,</v>

958
00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:00.490
<v Speaker 3>he's not my president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is actually.</v>

959
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:05.550
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>work harder next time and get someone </v>

960
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.680
<v Speaker 3>else elected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he gives you a president.</v>

961
00:42:05.681 --> 00:42:10.681
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was equally disgusting when the </v>

962
00:42:10.681 --> 00:42:14.071
<v Speaker 3>shoe was on the other foot with Barack </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama and some conservatives started </v>

963
00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.520
<v Speaker 3>saying that Barack Obama wasn't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>American,</v>

964
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:21.520
<v Speaker 3>or he wasn't really their president or </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was an enemy of the state,</v>

965
00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:26.550
<v Speaker 3>that he was a secret Muslim spy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to destroy Manchurian </v>

966
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.550
<v Speaker 3>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

967
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.550
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

968
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.080
<v Speaker 3>it's totally irresponsible and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's antithetic.</v>

969
00:42:29.081 --> 00:42:31.570
<v Speaker 3>It's the opposite of patriotism and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>revolting.</v>

970
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.300
<v Speaker 4>Do you think in that case it may be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good that we have a guy like Donald</v>

971
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Trump and the president because he is </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of like almost like a human </v>

972
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:40.300
<v Speaker 4>hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's something to rally against.</v>

973
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:44.621
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a problem that's occurred where there's </v>

974
00:42:44.621 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 4>the eroding confidence in the president </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

975
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:47.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's palpable.</v>

976
00:42:47.931 --> 00:42:50.150
<v Speaker 4>People know he lies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lies all the time.</v>

977
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:55.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just accused James Comey today of </v>

978
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.660
<v Speaker 4>lying under oath when he talked about </v>
<v Speaker 4>their conversations.</v>

979
00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:02.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Donald Trump is a very damaged </v>

980
00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:06.771
<v Speaker 3>and unhealthy person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he causes a lot of pain to </v>

981
00:43:06.771 --> 00:43:06.771
<v Speaker 3>people around him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

982
00:43:06.771 --> 00:43:10.791
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing that he's in an enormous </v>

983
00:43:10.791 --> 00:43:10.791
<v Speaker 3>amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of psychic pain himself,</v>

984
00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:16.050
<v Speaker 4>sense for all the hate tweets and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the things we constantly going after </v>

985
00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:16.480
<v Speaker 4>Rosie O'donnell and why?</v>

986
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I've learned in my life is that if </v>

987
00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:21.580
<v Speaker 3>someone's acting badly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in pain.</v>

988
00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

989
00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.470
<v Speaker 3>it's a really simple rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

990
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.200
<v Speaker 3>They're either scared or they're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>

991
00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:29.201
<v Speaker 3>I think he's both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on some level I feel kind of a kind </v>

992
00:43:29.201 --> 00:43:30.320
<v Speaker 3>of compassion for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I,</v>

993
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:31.890
<v Speaker 3>what I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

994
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:36.910
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he already is and will be a completely </v>

995
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:37.760
<v Speaker 3>failed president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he may actually help this country in</v>

996
00:43:37.761 --> 00:43:39.030
<v Speaker 3>his failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

997
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:44.650
<v Speaker 3>the gop I think has abandoned all of its</v>
<v Speaker 3>core values and core moral principles </v>

998
00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:51.170
<v Speaker 3>and decided that seems to have decided </v>
<v Speaker 3>that anything that will help the party </v>

999
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.920
<v Speaker 3>is more important than things that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>help the country.</v>

1000
00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.580
<v Speaker 3>And that is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very undemocratic way to think.</v>

1001
00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if,</v>

1002
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:03.950
<v Speaker 3>if Hillary Clinton had been elected and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things were coming out,</v>

1003
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.980
<v Speaker 3>the same kind of things about Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

1004
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:09.000
<v Speaker 3>are coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gop would be crossing her,</v>

1005
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.020
<v Speaker 3>prosecuting her up to her eyeballs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1006
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:17.200
<v Speaker 3>So they have a complete double standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I'm hoping is that the trump </v>

1007
00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.521
<v Speaker 3>administration is such a failure that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets the gop to reevaluate its policy of</v>

1008
00:44:22.851 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 3>partisan politics as a way to wind </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

1009
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:29.450
<v Speaker 3>And I hope it makes the entire country </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that the only way to really wind</v>

1010
00:44:29.451 --> 00:44:33.900
<v Speaker 3>power is through bipartisan politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can argue all you want,</v>

1011
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:38.901
<v Speaker 3>but you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to put the welfare of the </v>

1012
00:44:38.901 --> 00:44:41.061
<v Speaker 3>country first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read an amazing book called our </v>

1013
00:44:41.061 --> 00:44:41.061
<v Speaker 3>political selves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called,</v>

1014
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that about half of our political opinion</v>

1015
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:48.840
<v Speaker 3>is jen is genetically determined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So genetically determined.</v>

1016
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1017
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:50.400
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes sense.</v>

1018
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:55.401
<v Speaker 3>So liberalism and conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically liberalism is concerned with </v>

1019
00:44:55.401 --> 00:45:00.111
<v Speaker 3>fairness within the group and equality </v>
<v Speaker 3>within the group and an acceptance of </v>

1020
00:45:00.111 --> 00:45:01.320
<v Speaker 3>outsiders as possible for possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>inclusion in the group.</v>

1021
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Conservatism is focused on hierarchy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of law and order and a suspicion of</v>

1022
00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:10.500
<v Speaker 3>outsiders and they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very powerful evolutionary,</v>

1023
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:14.850
<v Speaker 3>adaptive evolutionary reasons for both </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those worldviews.</v>

1024
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:20.150
<v Speaker 3>And they've done studies with identical </v>
<v Speaker 3>twins that were adopted at birth and </v>

1025
00:45:20.581 --> 00:45:25.581
<v Speaker 3>compared them to fraternal twins and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a far higher concordance of a </v>

1026
00:45:25.581 --> 00:45:29.781
<v Speaker 3>political opinion in identical twins </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were adopted at birth and put in </v>

1027
00:45:30.241 --> 00:45:32.430
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of families than with </v>
<v Speaker 3>fraternal twins.</v>

1028
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:36.840
<v Speaker 3>So that means that our political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently it's around 50 percent of our</v>

1029
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:39.090
<v Speaker 3>political beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are genetically determined,</v>

1030
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:42.090
<v Speaker 3>which means that those beliefs had </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptive value in,</v>

1031
00:45:42.091 --> 00:45:43.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our evolutionary past,</v>

1032
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 3>which means that the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right,</v>

1033
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:48.210
<v Speaker 3>you're completely wrong and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't exist,</v>

1034
00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:53.211
<v Speaker 3>is a false argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the country actually needs both </v>

1035
00:45:53.211 --> 00:45:54.090
<v Speaker 3>parties very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very badly.</v>

1036
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:58.740
<v Speaker 3>And that a healthy society has </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatism and liberalism in a kind of</v>

1037
00:45:58.741 --> 00:46:01.350
<v Speaker 3>dynamic tension where yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might fight,</v>

1038
00:46:01.351 --> 00:46:06.351
<v Speaker 3>they might argue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are there roughly proportional </v>

1039
00:46:06.351 --> 00:46:07.500
<v Speaker 3>in the population and equal weight is </v>
<v Speaker 3>given to those two.</v>

1040
00:46:07.501 --> 00:46:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Competing values</v>

1041
00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.000
<v Speaker 4>wasn't taken into consideration that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when these people are adopted,</v>

1042
00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:13.550
<v Speaker 4>that growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adopted without your biological parents,</v>

1043
00:46:13.551 --> 00:46:18.551
<v Speaker 4>puts you in a certain mindset </v>
<v Speaker 4>automatically and that maybe it wasn't </v>

1044
00:46:18.551 --> 00:46:20.740
<v Speaker 4>necessarily a genetic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was a circumstantial or nurture.</v>

1045
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they compared identical twins who are </v>

1046
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.870
<v Speaker 3>genetically identical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1047
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:28.040
<v Speaker 3>that were adopted to fraternal twins who</v>
<v Speaker 3>were adopted.</v>

1048
00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:30.230
<v Speaker 3>You understand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1049
00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.780
<v Speaker 3>and fraternal twins are not genetically </v>
<v Speaker 3>identical,</v>

1050
00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.980
<v Speaker 3>but they still come from the same body </v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to come to.</v>

1051
00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Their DNA is different individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1052
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:44.030
<v Speaker 3>So both sets of twins were adopted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they all went through that.</v>

1053
00:46:44.031 --> 00:46:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1054
00:46:45.621 --> 00:46:47.600
<v Speaker 3>that process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the effects of that,</v>

1055
00:46:47.601 --> 00:46:50.930
<v Speaker 3>whatever they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One our one shared DNA,</v>

1056
00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:55.220
<v Speaker 3>exact duplicates of their DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other set of twins don't.</v>

1057
00:46:55.221 --> 00:46:56.870
<v Speaker 3>They're fraternal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1058
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.840
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the twins that shared identical DNA,</v>

1059
00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:04.870
<v Speaker 3>we're far more likely to have the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>political beliefs than the fraternal </v>

1060
00:47:05.511 --> 00:47:08.090
<v Speaker 3>twins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

1061
00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:13.091
<v Speaker 3>the genetic component was influencing </v>
<v Speaker 3>their beliefs and the environmental </v>

1062
00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:17.771
<v Speaker 3>component was not as much compared to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fraternal twins is an amazing book </v>

1063
00:47:17.771 --> 00:47:18.590
<v Speaker 3>and it really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

1064
00:47:18.591 --> 00:47:22.010
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like both worldviews clearly were needed</v>

1065
00:47:22.011 --> 00:47:24.260
<v Speaker 3>to keep our society healthy and strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and safe.</v>

1066
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:24.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1067
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:29.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a country that was run completely by </v>

1068
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:29.920
<v Speaker 3>liberals would get overrun by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1069
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.720
<v Speaker 3>the enemy state next door immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1070
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 3>A country that was completely run by </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives would never get overrun by</v>

1071
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:40.351
<v Speaker 3>the enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it will be a heartless and brutal </v>

1072
00:47:40.351 --> 00:47:41.890
<v Speaker 3>society where the poor weren't taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>care of and etc.</v>

1073
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:44.830
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't havE one or the other.</v>

1074
00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:46.930
<v Speaker 3>You need both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kind of dynamic tension.</v>

1075
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 3>So it makes genetic sense that it works </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

1076
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:54.090
<v Speaker 3>JuSt like there would be genetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>variations and all sorts of different </v>

1077
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:57.481
<v Speaker 3>aspects of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>height and personality and all those </v>

1078
00:47:57.481 --> 00:47:57.481
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1079
00:47:57.481 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sore character traits,</v>

1080
00:47:58.211 --> 00:47:58.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1081
00:47:58.781 --> 00:48:01.810
<v Speaker 3>they're partly genetic and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>partly determined by experience.</v>

1082
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:03.430
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1083
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:04.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>courage or whatever,</v>

1084
00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 3>generosity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sensation seeking,</v>

1085
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:08.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A is a genetic trait.</v>

1086
00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can,</v>

1087
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:16.800
<v Speaker 3>you can your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since your impulse towards sensation </v>

1088
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.550
<v Speaker 3>seeking is also determined by your </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences in life.</v>

1089
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the proportions are,</v>

1090
00:48:20.441 --> 00:48:23.200
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of political belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's roughly 50 slash 50.</v>

1091
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.440
<v Speaker 3>Your experience in life is about 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent responsible for your political </v>

1092
00:48:28.811 --> 00:48:31.240
<v Speaker 3>beliefs and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other 50 percent is genetics.</v>

1093
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.640
<v Speaker 3>We're always looking for one reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1094
00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:35.320
<v Speaker 3>We're always looking for nature or </v>
<v Speaker 3>nurture.</v>

1095
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:40.321
<v Speaker 3>We'll looking for one of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not looking at this just whole </v>

1096
00:48:40.321 --> 00:48:42.781
<v Speaker 3>soup of different entangled influences </v>
<v Speaker 3>that create a person.</v>

1097
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really interesting when I tell </v>

1098
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:47.880
<v Speaker 3>people that their genetics determine </v>
<v Speaker 3>half of their political view,</v>

1099
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:48.750
<v Speaker 3>they get really upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1100
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:50.530
<v Speaker 3>They want to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>self-determining,</v>

1101
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:55.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that people want to think that </v>

1102
00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:57.751
<v Speaker 3>they are completely w whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've created themselves and certainly</v>

1103
00:48:58.061 --> 00:48:59.740
<v Speaker 3>something as emotional as political </v>
<v Speaker 3>belief.</v>

1104
00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to think that is wired </v>
<v Speaker 3>into their dna at all.</v>

1105
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:03.300
<v Speaker 3>But You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1106
00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 3>that's the truth of it.</v>

1107
00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:06.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just determinism in general.</v>

1108
00:49:06.851 --> 00:49:11.851
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first time it was ever </v>

1109
00:49:11.851 --> 00:49:11.851
<v Speaker 3>really deeply explained to me by sam </v>
<v Speaker 3>harris.</v>

1110
00:49:11.851 --> 00:49:15.340
<v Speaker 3>I was rejecting it like almost instant </v>
<v Speaker 3>of realizing I was like,</v>

1111
00:49:15.341 --> 00:49:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to just be open minded </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1112
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.600
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to go to aa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>na.</v>

1113
00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:22.170
<v Speaker 3>You could pull yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could figure it out.</v>

1114
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:22.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do whaT your,</v>

1115
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:25.210
<v Speaker 3>your willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You decide what you want to do with your</v>

1116
00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:27.400
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not really necessarily.</v>

1117
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1118
00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 3>when I was young I was a really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance runner.</v>

1119
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I ran the half mile mile at up to </v>

1120
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:34.680
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>meters marathon,</v>

1121
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.500
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ran 4:12</v>

1122
00:49:35.501 --> 00:49:40.501
<v Speaker 3>for the mile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a pretty decent time and it's </v>

1123
00:49:40.501 --> 00:49:41.981
<v Speaker 3>very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really wanted it to be like the </v>

1124
00:49:41.981 --> 00:49:41.981
<v Speaker 3>fastest miler in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1125
00:49:41.981 --> 00:49:44.250
<v Speaker 3>And I trained as fast as anyone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever trained as,</v>

1126
00:49:44.251 --> 00:49:46.630
<v Speaker 3>as hard as anyone's ever trained and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>might.</v>

1127
00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.480
<v Speaker 3>My ceiling was poor 12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was genetically determined.</v>

1128
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:50.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

1129
00:49:50.491 --> 00:49:55.491
<v Speaker 3>Like you can run 130 miles a week like I</v>
<v Speaker 3>did for months on end and still not go </v>

1130
00:49:55.491 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 3>to the olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1131
00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.850
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt about it may not as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mixed martial arts commentator,</v>

1132
00:50:00.851 --> 00:50:04.150
<v Speaker 3>the the big factor that you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about his power.</v>

1133
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.320
<v Speaker 3>Some people are born with striking power</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1134
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.720
<v Speaker 3>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look exactly the Same.</v>

1135
00:50:10.721 --> 00:50:13.330
<v Speaker 3>They look just like a person who can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit nearly as hard as them.</v>

1136
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1137
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:19.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean my understanding is the sort of </v>

1138
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:19.500
<v Speaker 3>sequencing of muscle groups in </v>
<v Speaker 3>coordination that result in that kind of</v>

1139
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.520
<v Speaker 3>power is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bone structure as well.</v>

1140
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.290
<v Speaker 3>There's a level of variables is actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1141
00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:23.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1142
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:28.890
<v Speaker 3>the geometry of the shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how wide your shoulders are in </v>

1143
00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:28.890
<v Speaker 3>terms of the</v>

1144
00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 2>hip to waist ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of different factors.</v>

1145
00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:31.590
<v Speaker 2>Kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1146
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:36.910
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why men can </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit so much harder than women is </v>

1147
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 2>literally the shape of the hips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>women's hips are wider,</v>

1148
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:42.401
<v Speaker 2>the the legs go inward more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different sort of mechanical </v>

1149
00:50:42.401 --> 00:50:43.820
<v Speaker 2>advantage which is probably connected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speed.</v>

1150
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:47.630
<v Speaker 2>You can throw a baseball at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeletal.</v>

1151
00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently boys and girls can throw </v>

1152
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:53.040
<v Speaker 2>pretty much the same until puberty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it really splits,</v>

1153
00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1154
00:50:54.561 --> 00:50:56.220
<v Speaker 2>and so it's probably for that reason I </v>
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>

1155
00:50:56.390 --> 00:51:01.390
<v Speaker 2>That'd be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to see what they do with </v>

1156
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:03.290
<v Speaker 2>transgender women to men who start </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking testosterone.</v>

1157
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it changes the shape of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your pelvis.</v>

1158
00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:06.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the testosterone doesn't,</v>

1159
00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to change your.</v>

1160
00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:10.010
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

1161
00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:15.210
<v Speaker 2>It does have some effects on bone </v>
<v Speaker 2>density and I think the width of the </v>

1162
00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:17.380
<v Speaker 2>shoulders changes and certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters,</v>

1163
00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.980
<v Speaker 2>the face obviously changes.</v>

1164
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1165
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1166
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.270
<v Speaker 2>And Just the sort of muscle explosive </v>
<v Speaker 2>power of the muscles.</v>

1167
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Then as you get old you lose explosive </v>
<v Speaker 2>power as a man.</v>

1168
00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1169
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>historic key.</v>

1170
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:29.630
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1171
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:34.631
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at your peak in your early </v>

1172
00:51:34.631 --> 00:51:34.631
<v Speaker 2>twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1173
00:51:34.631 --> 00:51:34.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1174
00:51:34.631 --> 00:51:36.590
<v Speaker 2>what we're saying is that there really </v>
<v Speaker 2>are genetic limitations.</v>

1175
00:51:36.591 --> 00:51:40.970
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this idea of like a fair fight.</v>

1176
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:46.010
<v Speaker 2>There's sometimes it's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not going to be.</v>

1177
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:48.890
<v Speaker 2>And a with you as the mile with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1178
00:51:48.891 --> 00:51:50.660
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to hit hard.</v>

1179
00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.790
<v Speaker 2>It's some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just speed,</v>

1180
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:58.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you've ever seen like a floyd </v>

1181
00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.651
<v Speaker 2>mayweather fight is incredibly clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>that not only is he ridiculously </v>

1182
00:51:59.651 --> 00:52:03.581
<v Speaker 2>skillful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got some stupendous speed </v>

1183
00:52:03.581 --> 00:52:03.880
<v Speaker 2>advantage over most human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1184
00:52:03.881 --> 00:52:04.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1185
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.500
<v Speaker 2>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching his fight of his,</v>

1186
00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:07.790
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of slow mo.</v>

1187
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:12.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean I sort of slowed it down so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could really watch and he got hit full </v>

1188
00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:13.290
<v Speaker 2>in the face by somebody I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the face and his,</v>

1189
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.190
<v Speaker 2>his eyes never blink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:16.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

1191
00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean he couldn't get out of the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he watched that thing come in and </v>

1192
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.530
<v Speaker 2>hit him square in the face and his eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>never closed.</v>

1193
00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:23.270
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1194
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boxers can do that.</v>

1195
00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:26.240
<v Speaker 2>As they're getting punched in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>

1196
00:52:26.241 --> 00:52:28.700
<v Speaker 2>their eyes are wide open and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for the counter.</v>

1197
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.530
<v Speaker 2>It's really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1198
00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.790
<v Speaker 2>No flinch at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1199
00:52:31.791 --> 00:52:36.791
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely nothing amount of training </v>

1200
00:52:36.791 --> 00:52:36.791
<v Speaker 2>you would have to do to overcome the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

1201
00:52:36.791 --> 00:52:36.970
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them.</v>

1202
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.210
<v Speaker 2>More important reasons why it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical to learn striking in particular</v>

1203
00:52:41.211 --> 00:52:44.570
<v Speaker 2>at a very young age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body develops,</v>

1204
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.780
<v Speaker 2>some people can pick it up later in life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and still be really successful at it,</v>

1205
00:52:47.781 --> 00:52:52.781
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think you ever really get </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real elite boxer that doesn't </v>

1206
00:52:52.881 --> 00:52:55.840
<v Speaker 2>start training before puberty or around </v>
<v Speaker 2>puberty.</v>

1207
00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:01.560
<v Speaker 2>You're probably right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just something about the </v>

1208
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.990
<v Speaker 2>development of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your body growing and maturing with</v>

1209
00:53:02.991 --> 00:53:07.991
<v Speaker 2>this task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning how to strike and move and </v>

1210
00:53:07.991 --> 00:53:09.890
<v Speaker 2>explode with combinations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Likewise for music and languages,</v>

1211
00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:11.780
<v Speaker 2>and if you're not learning that before </v>
<v Speaker 2>puberty,</v>

1212
00:53:11.781 --> 00:53:14.450
<v Speaker 2>you will never be like at a top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>top,</v>

1213
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:15.990
<v Speaker 2>top world class level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1214
00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.200
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of languages,</v>

1215
00:53:18.201 --> 00:53:20.480
<v Speaker 2>you will not be able to speak with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect exit.</v>

1216
00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1217
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.670
<v Speaker 2>After puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1218
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>the brain is finished wiring itself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it cannot.</v>

1219
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:31.190
<v Speaker 3>It cannot exactly mimic a foreign accent</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you learn french or whatever at </v>

1220
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:32.730
<v Speaker 3>any language that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

1221
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:33.360
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

1222
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:37.050
<v Speaker 3>you can sound exactly like a native and </v>
<v Speaker 3>after puberty you can.</v>

1223
00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have kids?</v>

1224
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a three and a half month old </v>

1225
00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:44.420
<v Speaker 3>daughter.</v>

1226
00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:44.420
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they start talking to you,</v>

1227
00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:44.880
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when it gets weird.</v>

1228
00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

1229
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:47.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

1230
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:49.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>29 and a seven.</v>

1231
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:50.780
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

1232
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 4>what's really fascinating is watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1233
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:55.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1234
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:58.830
<v Speaker 4>the traits that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have come directly from dna,</v>

1235
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:04.100
<v Speaker 4>like parts of you emerge out of the kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe one kid and then the other </v>

1236
00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:06.990
<v Speaker 4>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of it,</v>

1237
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:12.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some of it will be your wife and </v>

1238
00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:12.630
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so strange to.</v>

1239
00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.200
<v Speaker 4>You try to piece it together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

1240
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:16.520
<v Speaker 4>what our instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1241
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 4>Why are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are dogs barking at snakes?</v>

1242
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:20.850
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what the fuck a snake </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1243
00:54:20.851 --> 00:54:25.851
<v Speaker 4>but they know something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something deep in their memorY </v>

1244
00:54:25.851 --> 00:54:28.911
<v Speaker 4>banks and say this is an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas a stuffed animal on the ground </v>

1245
00:54:28.911 --> 00:54:28.911
<v Speaker 4>is not an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1246
00:54:28.911 --> 00:54:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's rIght.</v>

1247
00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.180
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what that is entirely.</v>

1248
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell you what it is,</v>

1249
00:54:33.681 --> 00:54:38.681
<v Speaker 3>is that the dogs that weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflexively fearful of something that </v>

1250
00:54:38.681 --> 00:54:41.600
<v Speaker 3>looked like a snake died more often </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce offspring,</v>

1251
00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.900
<v Speaker 3>and so they'll bark at a crooked stick </v>
<v Speaker 3>to just to be on the safe side.</v>

1252
00:54:44.901 --> 00:54:46.100
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>likewise,</v>

1253
00:54:46.101 --> 00:54:48.380
<v Speaker 3>humans are scared of heights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1254
00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.370
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1255
00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:52.250
<v Speaker 3>if you're not scared of heights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're more likely to fall and you won't</v>

1256
00:54:52.251 --> 00:54:54.500
<v Speaker 3>pass on your genes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucy,</v>

1257
00:54:54.501 --> 00:54:57.570
<v Speaker 3>the famous early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early human skeleton in,</v>

1258
00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:00.550
<v Speaker 3>in east africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1259
00:55:00.551 --> 00:55:05.551
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do know lucy from your science </v>

1260
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:05.551
<v Speaker 3>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1261
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:06.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she died by falling out of a tree.</v>

1262
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:12.880
<v Speaker 3>They just figured that out from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fractures and stuff and her bone </v>

1264
00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:12.880
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1265
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That must have been incredibly common.</v>

1266
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.400
<v Speaker 4>It's just all the different things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are afraid of.</v>

1267
00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Arachnophobia video phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear of spiders and snakes.</v>

1268
00:55:21.851 --> 00:55:23.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean those are directly related to </v>
<v Speaker 4>poison.</v>

1269
00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm terrified of spiders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you feel as genetic,</v>

1270
00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:27.910
<v Speaker 4>like maybe someone in</v>

1271
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.670
<v Speaker 3>past or somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1272
00:55:29.671 --> 00:55:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1273
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:35.490
<v Speaker 3>the range of things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the common phobias that people have,</v>

1274
00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:38.780
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things have a,</v>

1275
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.280
<v Speaker 3>have a sort of survival significance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1276
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.730
<v Speaker 3>So people usually aren't phobIc of </v>
<v Speaker 3>chairs because chairs,</v>

1277
00:55:44.731 --> 00:55:48.180
<v Speaker 3>we're not a survival threat in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary past,</v>

1278
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.030
<v Speaker 3>but heights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiders,</v>

1279
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:52.910
<v Speaker 3>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1280
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.750
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're a,</v>

1281
00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:58.650
<v Speaker 3>we're a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when children get phobias,</v>

1282
00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:00.930
<v Speaker 3>they're choosing something that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic sense.</v>

1283
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why I chose spiders,</v>

1284
00:56:03.301 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just exposed to it.</v>

1285
00:56:05.251 --> 00:56:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Frightening spider at the wrong moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my insecure little life.</v>

1286
00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you were</v>

1287
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:13.630
<v Speaker 4>opposed to it or you think maybe is it </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible that someone in your past to </v>

1288
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:15.500
<v Speaker 4>some ancestor so far passed that through</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dna?</v>

1289
00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1290
00:56:15.921 --> 00:56:20.921
<v Speaker 3>we're all predisposed towards being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a reasonably fearful of those </v>

1291
00:56:21.081 --> 00:56:22.010
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1292
00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:27.460
<v Speaker 3>A phobia is a panic disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're all nervous around.</v>

1293
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:30.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm barking dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snakes,</v>

1294
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.380
<v Speaker 3>spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heights,</v>

1295
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:33.580
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1296
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be claustrophobia and being trapped in a</v>

1297
00:56:36.131 --> 00:56:41.131
<v Speaker 3>small space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all normal things to be worried </v>

1298
00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:43.321
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it crosses the threshold to a </v>

1299
00:56:43.321 --> 00:56:43.321
<v Speaker 3>phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a panic disorder.</v>

1300
00:56:43.321 --> 00:56:47.850
<v Speaker 3>And that is a function of something </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in your childhood where,</v>

1301
00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:50.830
<v Speaker 3>but is it absolutely in your childhood?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1302
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:55.860
<v Speaker 3>phobia start in childhood yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean is it possible that someone </v>

1303
00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:59.131
<v Speaker 3>could have a video phobia arachnophobia </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not have experienced spiders or </v>

1304
00:56:59.131 --> 00:57:03.751
<v Speaker 3>snakes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that happened to </v>

1305
00:57:03.751 --> 00:57:05.401
<v Speaker 3>me when I was hosting fear factor as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would see people that were pretty risk </v>

1306
00:57:05.401 --> 00:57:06.700
<v Speaker 3>taking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were and they would,</v>

1307
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.170
<v Speaker 3>they would be willing to do the heights.</v>

1308
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 3>They would be willing to jump a car off </v>
<v Speaker 3>the top of a building.</v>

1309
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:13.390
<v Speaker 3>They would take chances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were risk takers,</v>

1310
00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:17.740
<v Speaker 3>but you'd put them in front of a snake </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would freak the fuck out.</v>

1311
00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:20.800
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a deep cellular thing,</v>

1312
00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:23.680
<v Speaker 3>like you could see with some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1313
00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:27.730
<v Speaker 3>that they weren't cowards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't timid folks.</v>

1314
00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they would see that one thing,</v>

1315
00:57:30.161 --> 00:57:31.930
<v Speaker 3>whatever that thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1316
00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1317
00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:33.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1318
00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:34.030
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1319
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I will tell you though that once I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a television,</v>

1320
00:57:36.401 --> 00:57:41.401
<v Speaker 3>but I was in a hotel like I watch tv </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm traveling because I'm in a </v>

1321
00:57:41.401 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 3>hotel and I saw fear factor and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so keep in mind,</v>

1322
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:50.250
<v Speaker 3>I've been terrified of spiders my entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>life and there was one.</v>

1323
00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:53.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean this was actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>traumatizing to me.</v>

1324
00:57:53.381 --> 00:57:54.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like traumatizing,</v>

1325
00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.770
<v Speaker 3>like it affected me for days.</v>

1326
00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.730
<v Speaker 3>There was like a very hot young woman in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bikini and you put her in a glass,</v>

1327
00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:06.130
<v Speaker 3>like a glass box and you dumped a 55 </v>
<v Speaker 3>gallon drum of tranches onto her.</v>

1328
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that her boyfriend threw up,</v>

1329
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:11.880
<v Speaker 3>it was so and she finally stood up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>tarantulas,</v>

1330
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:16.890
<v Speaker 3>fallen off her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she couldn't take it and I was </v>

1331
00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:17.890
<v Speaker 3>like in the fetal position in the corner</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my hotel room.</v>

1332
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1333
00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:20.560
<v Speaker 3>It waS totally horrifying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1334
00:58:20.561 --> 00:58:25.561
<v Speaker 3>it really messed me up for a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so strange that there's </v>

1335
00:58:25.561 --> 00:58:25.810
<v Speaker 3>particular things that resonate like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1336
00:58:25.811 --> 00:58:28.570
<v Speaker 3>like particular things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a snake or a spider,</v>

1337
00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:31.800
<v Speaker 3>just a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1338
00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:36.930
<v Speaker 3>I really wonder if like the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings have and that also animals </v>

1339
00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:40.390
<v Speaker 3>have these instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we just don't totally understand what</v>

1340
00:58:40.391 --> 00:58:45.391
<v Speaker 3>memory is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't totally understand genetic </v>

1341
00:58:45.391 --> 00:58:45.391
<v Speaker 3>memories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1342
00:58:45.391 --> 00:58:45.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1343
00:58:45.391 --> 00:58:46.270

<v Speaker 3>that helped us survive.</v>

1344
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Those are all threats in our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our primordial passed.</v>

1359

1361
00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:26.570
<v Speaker 3>their website at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's airing on sunday.</v>

1362
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.060
<v Speaker 3>And what was your experience doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1363
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was home writing tribe actually.</v>

1364
00:59:30.831 --> 00:59:34.030
<v Speaker 3>And so I wasn't overseas and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't really get into Syria anyway.</v>

1365
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was a suicidal thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1366
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:38.600
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what we did,</v>

1367
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:40.880
<v Speaker 3>my colleague nick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was here earlier,</v>

1368
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:46.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we basically sort of work the border </v>

1369
00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:49.060
<v Speaker 3>border areas around Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for people who were living </v>

1370
00:59:49.071 --> 00:59:54.071
<v Speaker 3>in Syria who knew people in Syria who </v>
<v Speaker 3>could shoot for us and we found some </v>

1371
00:59:54.071 --> 00:59:57.611
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very brave people who documented their </v>

1372
00:59:57.611 --> 00:59:58.340
<v Speaker 3>lives under isis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives with the free syrian army.</v>

1373
00:59:58.341 --> 01:00:00.200
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1374
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:05.860
<v Speaker 3>and we accumulated about an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thousand hours of footage and </v>

1375
01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:09.011
<v Speaker 3>interviews we did with experts and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>put together a hell on earth trying to </v>

1376
01:00:09.011 --> 01:00:13.340
<v Speaker 3>explain how really quite peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic protests,</v>

1377
01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:18.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn into violent demonstrations and </v>

1378
01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.300
<v Speaker 3>finally into a civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course it's the,</v>

1379
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:20.950
<v Speaker 3>it was the repressive government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1380
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:24.290
<v Speaker 3>people protest in the street and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>met with machine gun fire and eventually</v>

1381
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:29.380
<v Speaker 3>civilians are going to get some machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>guns themselves and fight back and </v>

1382
01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:29.380
<v Speaker 3>that's how you get a civil war.</v>

1383
01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:33.960
<v Speaker 4>How do you take thousands of hours like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and boil it down to a one show?</v>

1384
01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:34.950
<v Speaker 3>YeAh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

1385
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:36.190
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hard.</v>

1386
01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1387
01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:41.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what filmmaking is and it's </v>

1388
01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.921
<v Speaker 3>figuring out what's the one percent that</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes into the film and how do I </v>

1389
01:00:43.921 --> 01:00:43.921
<v Speaker 3>structure it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1390
01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.660
<v Speaker 3>how much time does it take to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>

1391
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:46.420
<v Speaker 3>We had a really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1392
01:00:46.421 --> 01:00:48.520
<v Speaker 3>this is the first I've made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my fifth film.</v>

1393
01:00:48.521 --> 01:00:53.521
<v Speaker 3>Most of the films I've made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was me and an editor and so another </v>

1394
01:00:53.521 --> 01:00:53.650
<v Speaker 3>person in the room or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1395
01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:55.810
<v Speaker 3>We had a big team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we had some very,</v>

1396
01:00:55.811 --> 01:01:00.811
<v Speaker 3>very smart yoUng people who are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>through all this footage and </v>

1397
01:01:00.811 --> 01:01:00.811
<v Speaker 3>categorizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1398
01:01:00.811 --> 01:01:01.540
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a section about,</v>

1399
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this material is about whatever,</v>

1400
01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:07.420
<v Speaker 3>escaping isis and this is about trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to find whatever they would.</v>

1401
01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:12.690
<v Speaker 3>They would sort of put it into </v>
<v Speaker 3>categories and then I would start to </v>

1402
01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:13.330
<v Speaker 3>look through some of that material and </v>
<v Speaker 3>congratulate,</v>

1403
01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.040
<v Speaker 3>sort of build a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>build a structure,</v>

1404
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.490
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1405
01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:22.530
<v Speaker 4>the situation in Syria seems to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for someone who just hasn't studied it </v>

1406
01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:24.100
<v Speaker 4>that much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just looks at it from the outside.</v>

1407
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:28.720
<v Speaker 4>One of the bleaker darker situations </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have here in the world.</v>

1408
01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:33.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the tragic tragedy of this </v>

1409
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:33.940
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1410
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:34.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 400,000</v>

1411
01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:36.440
<v Speaker 3>syrians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly civilians have died.</v>

1412
01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:39.650
<v Speaker 3>The equivalent equivalent death toll in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country would be,</v>

1413
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:43.280
<v Speaker 3>I think seven or $8 million americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are equivalent amount of people.</v>

1414
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1415
01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:49.370
<v Speaker 3>and half the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half the syrian population has been </v>

1416
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:50.240
<v Speaker 3>displaced from their homes and millions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions or,</v>

1417
01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:50.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1418
01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:52.740
<v Speaker 3>outside the country's borders in europe </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1419
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.560
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even in this country.</v>

1420
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.530
<v Speaker 4>What did you take out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary?</v>

1421
01:01:57.531 --> 01:02:02.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like no one has a solution for </v>

1422
01:02:02.531 --> 01:02:02.531
<v Speaker 4>Syria.</v>

1423
01:02:02.531 --> 01:02:02.531
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1424
01:02:02.531 --> 01:02:04.320
<v Speaker 3>civil wards are tough that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1425
01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:09.940
<v Speaker 3>I think isis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isis eventually is going to be defeated </v>

1426
01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.320
<v Speaker 3>on the battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1427
01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:15.450
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hope they are because they're a </v>

1428
01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:18.400
<v Speaker 3>ghastly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutal group m and a side who is,</v>

1429
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.440
<v Speaker 3>who's killed way more people than isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just didn't do it publicly like they </v>

1430
01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:24.440
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1431
01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.510
<v Speaker 3>he's the leader of Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president of Syria,</v>

1432
01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.290
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's propped up by Iran and by Russia.</v>

1433
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:32.910
<v Speaker 3>And so he's not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1434
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:35.040
<v Speaker 3>if you have those two countries as your </v>
<v Speaker 3>allies,</v>

1435
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:40.041
<v Speaker 3>like you're not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think what's going to happen </v>

1436
01:02:40.041 --> 01:02:43.610
<v Speaker 3>ultimately is that isis will be defeated</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the country will be partitioned </v>

1437
01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:46.390
<v Speaker 3>along sectarian lines and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually.</v>

1438
01:02:46.391 --> 01:02:49.710
<v Speaker 3>There may be a kind of a delicate piece.</v>

1439
01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:55.790
<v Speaker 2>It seems like with all those middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>eastern countries or any country that's </v>

1440
01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.821
<v Speaker 2>run by a brutal dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as that dictators removed or as </v>

1441
01:02:58.821 --> 01:03:01.440
<v Speaker 2>soon as somebody dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this massive power vacuum.</v>

1442
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1443
01:03:02.431 --> 01:03:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean that would be the argument for </v>
<v Speaker 3>not trying to remove them.</v>

1444
01:03:04.471 --> 01:03:09.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a complete criminal and sadist and </v>

1445
01:03:09.471 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by these horrible.</v>

1446
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:11.190
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

1447
01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Was the argument for keeping saddam </v>
<v Speaker 2>hussein in power?</v>

1448
01:03:13.851 --> 01:03:16.040
<v Speaker 2>It was the argument for keeping kadafi </v>
<v Speaker 2>and power.</v>

1449
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1450
01:03:16.951 --> 01:03:21.360
<v Speaker 3>basically it's sort of utilitarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument from jaws doraville like what's</v>

1451
01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:26.370
<v Speaker 3>gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's gonna cause the least human </v>

1452
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:26.370
<v Speaker 3>suffering or promote the most human </v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness and,</v>

1453
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:26.840
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1454
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:28.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>

1455
01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:31.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can understand the reasoning behind,</v>

1456
01:03:31.651 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy's a dictator,</v>

1457
01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:37.731
<v Speaker 3>but we should leave him in place because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the alternative is a lot of other </v>

1458
01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:41.670
<v Speaker 3>innocent people suffering when we remove</v>
<v Speaker 3>him in the country collapses,</v>

1459
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:43.880
<v Speaker 3>this country has already collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the pro is,</v>

1460
01:03:43.881 --> 01:03:44.730
<v Speaker 3>or the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1461
01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:47.630
<v Speaker 3>we make a tentative peace deal with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll leave you empower.</v>

1462
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.220
<v Speaker 3>We won't try to topple you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1463
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.870
<v Speaker 3>but let's stop fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1464
01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:52.530
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1465
01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:54.390
<v Speaker 3>I could support that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1466
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:56.220
<v Speaker 3>Personally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1467
01:03:56.510 --> 01:04:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of keeping that guy in power </v>

1468
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:03.650
<v Speaker 2>just so less people suffer and you keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>a brutal murder as dictator in power.</v>

1469
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:05.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're better off that way.</v>

1470
01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1471
01:04:06.411 --> 01:04:06.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1472
01:04:06.921 --> 01:04:08.510
<v Speaker 3>the war killed almost half a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1473
01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.280
<v Speaker 3>so if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want that to continue,</v>

1474
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean those are the awful moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>choices.</v>

1475
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1476
01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.380
<v Speaker 2>it's very frustrating for people though </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it would like to see.</v>

1477
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.430
<v Speaker 2>We'd like to see some solution like on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tape,</v>

1478
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:22.160
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't seem</v>

1479
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:24.860
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a solution to the violence.</v>

1480
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:25.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

1481
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:27.870
<v Speaker 3>any peace deal is a solution to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

1482
01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.510
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the first thing that has to happen I</v>

1483
01:04:30.511 --> 01:04:33.270
<v Speaker 3>think is that the violence stops so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people stop dying.</v>

1484
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pursuit of justice,</v>

1485
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:40.290
<v Speaker 3>it is a secondary is important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a secondary matter after that.</v>

1486
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.230
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

1487
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I know you're running out of time here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm good.</v>

1488
01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:47.320
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what brings you,</v>

1489
01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:53.310
<v Speaker 2>what brings you satisfaction when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do something like this </v>

1490
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:54.760
<v Speaker 2>documentary or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or your book tribe?</v>

1491
01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really like the,</v>

1492
01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.010
<v Speaker 3>I liked the sort of game of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1493
01:05:03.011 --> 01:05:08.011
<v Speaker 3>Like I like exploring a topic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to make sense of it and </v>

1494
01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:09.100
<v Speaker 3>starting to see connections between </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1495
01:05:09.101 --> 01:05:11.700
<v Speaker 3>So when I was writing tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd started the,</v>

1496
01:05:11.701 --> 01:05:12.050
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1497
01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:17.070
<v Speaker 3>when the central thesis of it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>occurred to me and all these disparate </v>

1498
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:20.410
<v Speaker 3>suddenly align themselves in an orderly </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1499
01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:24.610
<v Speaker 3>And I felt like I'd shown a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of light onto the woRld and shown how it</v>

1500
01:05:24.611 --> 01:05:26.740
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's totally intoxicating to me.</v>

1501
01:05:26.741 --> 01:05:28.510
<v Speaker 3>And likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're making your documentary,</v>

1502
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.650
<v Speaker 3>you suddenly start to see themes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures in the film,</v>

1503
01:05:32.651 --> 01:05:35.920
<v Speaker 3>in human affairs that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of come out and,</v>

1504
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:41.630
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when it and when you work on that </v>

1505
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.630
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

1506
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:46.260
<v Speaker 3>To me it's like an incredibly gratifying</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that because that means that I've </v>

1507
01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.160
<v Speaker 3>now made sense of something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a disorderly,</v>

1508
01:05:48.161 --> 01:05:52.480
<v Speaker 3>confusing world and I've managed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>organize it in an understandable way and</v>

1509
01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:57.481
<v Speaker 3>that means other people can understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and then we can have a conversation </v>

1510
01:05:57.481 --> 01:05:58.000
<v Speaker 3>about how the world works and how people</v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1511
01:05:58.150 --> 01:06:03.150
<v Speaker 3>And that to me is the point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalism is the point of all </v>

1512
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 3>intellectual endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1513
01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:06.400
<v Speaker 3>and to be even a small part of it to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>is incredibly exciting.</v>

1514
01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you nailed it and you,</v>

1515
01:06:08.471 --> 01:06:13.471
<v Speaker 4>you definitely nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And with this the thing I was talking </v>

1516
01:06:13.471 --> 01:06:16.310
<v Speaker 4>about how when it just beginning the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first chapter,</v>

1517
01:06:16.311 --> 01:06:20.000
<v Speaker 4>I had a real urge to get out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>city.</v>

1518
01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.760
<v Speaker 4>I had a real urge to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this thought like,</v>

1519
01:06:22.761 --> 01:06:25.490
<v Speaker 4>could I live in the woods?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I live in a tribal society?</v>

1520
01:06:25.491 --> 01:06:26.930
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems,</v>

1521
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:33.470
<v Speaker 4>it seems like you were outlining like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost like a mathematical problem.</v>

1522
01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:35.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1523
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.010
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1524
01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:37.780
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1525
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:40.360
<v Speaker 3>or chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe even a chemical problem.</v>

1526
01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1527
01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:45.931
<v Speaker 3>I studied anthropology in college and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>my understanding of humans is that we </v>

1528
01:06:45.931 --> 01:06:50.581
<v Speaker 3>are social.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are social primates that prefer to </v>

1529
01:06:50.581 --> 01:06:51.940
<v Speaker 3>live in groups of about 50 people in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a challenging environment.</v>

1530
01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:55.370
<v Speaker 3>That's what human beings are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1531
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.970
<v Speaker 3>to the extent that we depart from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1532
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:59.490
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1533
01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:04.420
<v Speaker 3>lead lives of dissatisfaction and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and frustration.</v>

1534
01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:08.200
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I understand life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you manage that in your own life?</v>

1535
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:10.140
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1536
01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I,</v>

1537
01:07:12.421 --> 01:07:17.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was part of a communal group </v>

1538
01:07:17.421 --> 01:07:17.421
<v Speaker 3>fighting to survive in the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1539
01:07:17.421 --> 01:07:17.421
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1540
01:07:17.421 --> 01:07:22.191
<v Speaker 3>I had some taste of that with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>platoon that I was with and that was </v>

1541
01:07:22.191 --> 01:07:23.740
<v Speaker 3>intoxicating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has downsides obviously.</v>

1542
01:07:23.741 --> 01:07:25.170
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1543
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.770
<v Speaker 3>you can't stay out there forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1544
01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:31.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may be at least understand that the </v>

1545
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:32.350
<v Speaker 3>source of my dissatisfaction in life </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't internal.</v>

1546
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:33.880
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made sense.</v>

1547
01:07:33.881 --> 01:07:38.881
<v Speaker 3>It was that I was having a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction to circumstances in society </v>

1548
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that humans were not adapted for,</v>

1549
01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:46.020
<v Speaker 3>and even that was enough to bring a kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of peace of mind for me.</v>

1550
01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also very consciously and deliberately</v>

1551
01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:52.330
<v Speaker 3>try to live in places where there is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of,</v>

1552
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:53.610
<v Speaker 3>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1553
01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:58.730
<v Speaker 3>sort of close communal neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in a very poor neighborhood in </v>

1554
01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:02.401
<v Speaker 3>New York city at which for some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hassles at least has the sort of rich </v>

1555
01:08:02.401 --> 01:08:04.540
<v Speaker 3>fabric of human connection that you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get in wealthy neighborhoods.</v>

1556
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:06.250
<v Speaker 3>So you do it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1557
01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.850
<v Speaker 3>What I don't want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you want to say where you live?</v>

1558
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.850
<v Speaker 3>I live in lower east side manhattan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1559
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 3>he's not very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very poor,</v>

1560
01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:13.880
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a dominican,</v>

1561
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:19.020
<v Speaker 3>dominican neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have half the people in that </v>

1562
01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:19.020
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood really don't speak english </v>
<v Speaker 3>very well.</v>

1563
01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's not very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very rich or ethnic neighborhood.</v>

1564
01:08:21.141 --> 01:08:22.770
<v Speaker 3>People are quite poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1565
01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:27.780
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know everybody and everyone knows </v>

1566
01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:27.980
<v Speaker 3>each other by sight and we look out for </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and it's during hurricane,</v>

1567
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:31.130
<v Speaker 3>a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When hurricane sandy hit New York,</v>

1568
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:36.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of the people that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>young children had to leave because </v>

1569
01:08:36.490 --> 01:08:38.861
<v Speaker 3>there was no light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no water or the power was out </v>

1570
01:08:38.861 --> 01:08:41.591
<v Speaker 3>right to half of manhattan was </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely dark and it was really </v>

1571
01:08:41.591 --> 01:08:43.740
<v Speaker 3>actually quite dangerous at night in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark half of manhattan and uh,</v>

1572
01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:46.850
<v Speaker 3>where there was no streetlights and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this building,</v>

1573
01:08:46.851 --> 01:08:49.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a tenement building that I live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>with my wife and um,</v>

1574
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.070
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of the people left and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1575
01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.570
<v Speaker 3>they were worried about being robbed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are poor people,</v>

1576
01:08:56.571 --> 01:08:58.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not a wealthy building at all,</v>

1577
01:08:58.371 --> 01:08:59.720
<v Speaker 3>is quite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite poor building.</v>

1578
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:01.260
<v Speaker 3>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1579
01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:03.530
<v Speaker 3>they organized a guard shift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the people,</v>

1580
01:09:03.531 --> 01:09:08.531
<v Speaker 3>one of the women in the building had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>machete and they organized guard shifts </v>

1581
01:09:08.531 --> 01:09:08.690
<v Speaker 3>at the front door with a machete and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>

1582
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 3>the young men in the building took turns</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like two hours at a time guarding the</v>

1583
01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:13.580
<v Speaker 3>building with a machete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1584
01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.290
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1585
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't associated with the building at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that time,</v>

1586
01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:20.410
<v Speaker 3>but boy would that have made me feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>good to be part of that,</v>

1587
01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:21.890
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>

1588
01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:24.050
<v Speaker 3>like that is what human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they are.</v>

1589
01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:29.740
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you didn't see that in a wealthy </v>

1590
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.010
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partly because the wealthy neighborhoods</v>

1591
01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:36.011
<v Speaker 3>actually had light just seems weird to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the choice to live in a community </v>

1592
01:09:36.891 --> 01:09:38.720
<v Speaker 3>like that because of those factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1593
01:09:38.721 --> 01:09:40.160
<v Speaker 3>my wife lived there and I moved in with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

1594
01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:40.860
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1595
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:41.850
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1596
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:44.570
<v Speaker 3>the reason I was happy to move in with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

1597
01:09:44.571 --> 01:09:49.571
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons I was happy to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>in with her is precisely because it </v>

1598
01:09:49.571 --> 01:09:49.571
<v Speaker 3>wasn't an affluent neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the kind I grew up in.</v>

1599
01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:52.370
<v Speaker 3>That to me is just sold death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1600
01:09:52.371 --> 01:09:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in an affluent suburb and it's</v>

1601
01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:59.510
<v Speaker 3>just the most boring thing on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

1602
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:01.360
<v Speaker 3>Like it's deadlY to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1603
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:02.120
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1604
01:10:02.121 --> 01:10:07.121
<v Speaker 3>like had I not grown up like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'd be living in a neighborhood </v>

1605
01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:07.121
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1606
01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:10.801
<v Speaker 3>I get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did grow up like that and the one </v>

1607
01:10:10.801 --> 01:10:13.280
<v Speaker 3>thing that I just cannot survive is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of complacent affluence.</v>

1608
01:10:13.281 --> 01:10:18.281
<v Speaker 3>Like it just kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny because that's the one </v>

1609
01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:21.581
<v Speaker 3>thing that people try to achieve when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they grow up in that sort of poor </v>

1610
01:10:21.581 --> 01:10:25.630
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to get out and live in a big </v>

1611
01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:25.630
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The big yard.</v>

1612
01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:26.300
<v Speaker 3>Look at their suicide rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their addiction rates,</v>

1613
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:27.890
<v Speaker 3>their depression rates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1614
01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:28.500
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1615
01:10:28.501 --> 01:10:29.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at those,</v>

1616
01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:31.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcoholism,</v>

1617
01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide in affluent neighborhoods,</v>

1618
01:10:34.611 --> 01:10:35.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's astronomical.</v>

1619
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.520
<v Speaker 3>It's brutal boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but try to convince people to abandon </v>

1620
01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.860
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it's really odd.</v>

1621
01:10:42.861 --> 01:10:45.680
<v Speaker 3>It seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so counter intuitive to them.</v>

1622
01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:46.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1623
01:10:46.581 --> 01:10:46.880
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1624
01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:48.140
<v Speaker 3>you're going to live in a safe </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>

1625
01:10:48.141 --> 01:10:48.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1626
01:10:48.321 --> 01:10:49.420
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have a big house.</v>

1627
01:10:49.421 --> 01:10:50.720
<v Speaker 3>You gonna have a nice car and a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

1628
01:10:50.721 --> 01:10:51.680
<v Speaker 3>You're going to do great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1629
01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:53.510
<v Speaker 3>think about an evolutionary terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>

1630
01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:58.540
<v Speaker 3>The impulse towards safety and luxury is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a totally healthy one in a situation </v>

1631
01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.110
<v Speaker 3>where nature doesn't offer that very </v>
<v Speaker 3>often,</v>

1632
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:05.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're programmed to go for those </v>

1633
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.550
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1634
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:09.310
<v Speaker 3>What we're not prepared for is to go for</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things and have it happen all the </v>

1635
01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:10.760
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see what I'm saying?</v>

1636
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Like it's totally healthy instincts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>

1637
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we didn't involve in a world where </v>

1638
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:18.810
<v Speaker 3>you could actually achieve that 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the time.</v>

1639
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dogs are programmed,</v>

1640
01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:23.220
<v Speaker 3>a lot of dog species or program will </v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

1641
01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:26.910
<v Speaker 3>will eat until they've eaten so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they'll kill themselves eating.</v>

1642
01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:28.850
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because there wasn't enough food to</v>

1643
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:31.920
<v Speaker 3>like the programming to keep eating as </v>
<v Speaker 3>long as their food is great.</v>

1644
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:33.560
<v Speaker 3>If there's a scarcity of food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1645
01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:38.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as there's a plentitude of food </v>

1646
01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:39.090
<v Speaker 3>that becomes maladaptive and the dog </v>
<v Speaker 3>dies and you know,</v>

1647
01:11:39.091 --> 01:11:42.390
<v Speaker 3>likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people put fat on very easily because in</v>

1648
01:11:42.391 --> 01:11:45.990
<v Speaker 3>a harsh environment with not much food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to put fat on easily</v>

1649
01:11:45.991 --> 01:11:48.220
<v Speaker 3>or you'll die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now with the.</v>

1650
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:53.420
<v Speaker 3>The reason there's so many obese people </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because we have that impulse to eat </v>

1651
01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.310
<v Speaker 3>and eat and eat and the foods there to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it with,</v>

1652
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:58.230
<v Speaker 3>and we don't have the mechanism for </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopping it,</v>

1653
01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:00.200
<v Speaker 3>and so that's why there's so many happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1654
01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:03.740
<v Speaker 3>it's also sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big absolutely.</v>

1655
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:08.430
<v Speaker 3>But our taste for sugar and for fat is </v>
<v Speaker 3>programmed by evolution,</v>

1656
01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there wasn't much of those </v>

1657
01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.021
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now you can have as much as you want </v>

1658
01:12:15.021 --> 01:12:15.021
<v Speaker 3>and suddenly people weigh 350 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1659
01:12:15.021 --> 01:12:15.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1660
01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:20.260
<v Speaker 3>it's evolutionary programming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Run a muck in a world where there's too </v>

1661
01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:21.780
<v Speaker 3>much of something that was very good but</v>
<v Speaker 3>was very scarce.</v>

1662
01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:25.750
<v Speaker 4>You highlight some really profound </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues with culture in your book,</v>

1663
01:12:25.751 --> 01:12:30.280
<v Speaker 4>but I would wonder if how many people </v>
<v Speaker 4>come up to you after they've read it and</v>

1664
01:12:30.281 --> 01:12:31.600
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I do?</v>

1665
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:32.980
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>

1666
01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.450
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what do I do?</v>

1667
01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here I am.</v>

1668
01:12:35.661 --> 01:12:37.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have this house,</v>

1669
01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.890
<v Speaker 4>I have a mortgage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have kids,</v>

1670
01:12:38.891 --> 01:12:40.810
<v Speaker 4>I have a job that's good and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to leave it,</v>

1671
01:12:40.811 --> 01:12:42.280
<v Speaker 4>but what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you're right,</v>

1672
01:12:42.281 --> 01:12:43.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>

1673
01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:44.790
<v Speaker 4>what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1674
01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.270
<v Speaker 4>what do you tell those people?</v>

1675
01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1676
01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:52.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really a question of is the question </v>

1677
01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:55.840
<v Speaker 3>you can't have it all and I mean what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would say to them is sell your house,</v>

1678
01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.250
<v Speaker 3>move in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sell you car.</v>

1679
01:12:58.251 --> 01:13:03.251
<v Speaker 3>If you can move into a community where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be into reliant with the </v>

1680
01:13:03.251 --> 01:13:04.000
<v Speaker 3>people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a,</v>

1681
01:13:04.001 --> 01:13:09.001
<v Speaker 3>I have to interact with them everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is what makes people feel </v>

1682
01:13:09.001 --> 01:13:11.981
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is people are </v>

1683
01:13:11.981 --> 01:13:14.441
<v Speaker 3>understandably not willing to give up </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pleasures of an affluent life in </v>

1684
01:13:14.441 --> 01:13:14.600
<v Speaker 3>order to have social connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1685
01:13:14.601 --> 01:13:19.601
<v Speaker 3>I get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you really can't have both very </v>

1686
01:13:19.601 --> 01:13:19.601
<v Speaker 3>successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's extremely hard to.</v>

1687
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My who lived in venice and a real nice </v>

1689
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:28.750
<v Speaker 4>tight knit community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had this called the sac and </v>

1690
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.750
<v Speaker 4>everybody lived in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone,</v>

1691
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:30.170
<v Speaker 4>everyone knoW everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in a cul de sac right there.</v>

1692
01:13:30.171 --> 01:13:32.150
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he started doing well.</v>

1693
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:37.450
<v Speaker 4>And the first thing he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he moved out and you've got this really </v>

1694
01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:40.001
<v Speaker 4>nice house in this big yard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he fucking hates it and he's </v>

1695
01:13:40.001 --> 01:13:40.001
<v Speaker 4>miserable and we talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1696
01:13:40.001 --> 01:13:40.370
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1697
01:13:40.371 --> 01:13:41.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't know my neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1698
01:13:41.871 --> 01:13:45.080
<v Speaker 4>I have this big yard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just stare at it and go back inside my</v>

1699
01:13:45.081 --> 01:13:46.040
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1700
01:13:46.041 --> 01:13:48.880
<v Speaker 4>I used to know everyone on the block.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew everyone in the community.</v>

1701
01:13:48.881 --> 01:13:48.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1702
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:49.740
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1703
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.240
<v Speaker 3>that guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1704
01:13:52.241 --> 01:13:55.270
<v Speaker 3>that lifestyle is correlated with higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression and suicide rates.</v>

1705
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's literally a statistical risk,</v>

1706
01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:03.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>increased statistical risk of suicide </v>

1707
01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:03.220
<v Speaker 3>and depression because of that change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1708
01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:04.690
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

1709
01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 4>regardless of how much money you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>make,</v>

1710
01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:12.201
<v Speaker 4>you would always move into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood where people are relying </v>

1711
01:14:12.201 --> 01:14:12.201
<v Speaker 4>upon each other and tight to each other.</v>

1712
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1713
01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1714
01:14:14.970 --> 01:14:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even a.</v>

1715
01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

1716
01:14:17.561 --> 01:14:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even a choice.</v>

1717
01:14:19.241 --> 01:14:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1718
01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:20.310
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1719
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I just get instantly depressed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>affluent neighborhoods.</v>

1720
01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so crazy.</v>

1721
01:14:24.911 --> 01:14:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1722
01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I crash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean hard.</v>

1723
01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you accumulate any material </v>
<v Speaker 2>possessions?</v>

1724
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:34.081
<v Speaker 2>Are you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those dudes Was like a notebook </v>

1725
01:14:34.081 --> 01:14:34.081
<v Speaker 2>and a couple of pairs of shoes</v>

1726
01:14:34.081 --> 01:14:34.081
<v Speaker 3>mean minimally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1727
01:14:34.081 --> 01:14:36.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean we live in a very small apartment</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's not room for much.</v>

1728
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:37.240
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1729
01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you happy with that?</v>

1730
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:42.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1731
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:43.010
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean listen,</v>

1732
01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:48.011
<v Speaker 3>the less you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the happier you are at the end of the </v>

1733
01:14:48.011 --> 01:14:50.590
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could probably make that as a </v>

1734
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.590
<v Speaker 3>empirically true statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Empirically.</v>

1735
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.590
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really,</v>

1736
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:51.680
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't.</v>

1737
01:14:51.681 --> 01:14:54.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of food,</v>

1738
01:14:54.201 --> 01:14:59.201
<v Speaker 3>lack of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm obviously not talking about </v>

1739
01:14:59.201 --> 01:14:59.201
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about material</v>

1740
01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:02.670
<v Speaker 2>possession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped cars and boats and shit.</v>

1741
01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I always feel like once you get a boat </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably falling,</v>

1742
01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:08.640
<v Speaker 2>falling apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1743
01:15:08.641 --> 01:15:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Like unless you're a fisherman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1744
01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.570
<v Speaker 2>you're going out there and getting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boat.</v>

1745
01:15:12.571 --> 01:15:13.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

1746
01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:15.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

1747
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1748
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:17.310
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting like that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mature,</v>

1749
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:21.340
<v Speaker 3>those kind of material possessions also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mean again,</v>

1750
01:15:21.341 --> 01:15:22.150
<v Speaker 3>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1751
01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Like a particularly for males in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

1752
01:15:24.761 --> 01:15:27.040
<v Speaker 3>If you control resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1753
01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:32.160
<v Speaker 3>you have a reproductive advantage over </v>
<v Speaker 3>males that don't control resources and </v>

1754
01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:32.470
<v Speaker 3>you knoW,</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls will like you better.</v>

1755
01:15:32.471 --> 01:15:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you're an 18 year old boy,</v>

1756
01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.200
<v Speaker 3>the instinct to get a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get a boat baby one day to get a </v>

1757
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.530
<v Speaker 3>private area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what a private airplane,</v>

1758
01:15:41.531 --> 01:15:46.531
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That instinct has huge evolutionary </v>

1759
01:15:46.531 --> 01:15:46.900
<v Speaker 3>advantage because it gives you access to</v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

1760
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Not all women but enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a great strategy for meeting </v>

1761
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.350
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1762
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:56.790
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that once you're sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>further on in your life and you have </v>

1763
01:15:58.361 --> 01:16:00.340
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a family,</v>

1764
01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:06.870
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have a community and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have instead is a huge lawn and </v>

1765
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:11.341
<v Speaker 3>overpowered boat and a ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive car you have.</v>

1766
01:16:11.890 --> 01:16:14.080
<v Speaker 3>You have taken things that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were,</v>

1767
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.200
<v Speaker 3>that were a definite reproductive </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage at 18 and you have dragged </v>

1768
01:16:19.571 --> 01:16:23.650
<v Speaker 3>them into midlife where instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>making you feel good,</v>

1769
01:16:23.651 --> 01:16:25.400
<v Speaker 3>they will depress you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my opinion.</v>

1770
01:16:25.401 --> 01:16:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's What happens to those guys.</v>

1771
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:32.910
<v Speaker 3>So it was not that those things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>still a stupid idea at a earlier point </v>

1772
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:33.190
<v Speaker 3>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but definitely when you're 50 years old,</v>

1773
01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.240
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure like you could call if you did </v>

1774
01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:39.240
<v Speaker 3>a proper study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

1775
01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.490
<v Speaker 3>you could make a correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of material,</v>

1776
01:16:42.491 --> 01:16:44.870
<v Speaker 3>possession at alcohol abuse,</v>

1777
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:45.920
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide,</v>

1778
01:16:45.921 --> 01:16:50.921
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's the case with like </v>

1779
01:16:50.921 --> 01:16:53.390
<v Speaker 2>rappers and people that grow up in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor black communities that go onto have</v>

1780
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:58.450
<v Speaker 2>a insane material wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been fascinated by the </v>

1781
01:16:58.450 --> 01:17:03.080
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous hip hop culture of just giant</v>
<v Speaker 2>houses and 50 cars and throwing money up</v>

1782
01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:08.081
<v Speaker 2>into the air and just this celebration </v>
<v Speaker 2>of excess coming from a place of nothing</v>

1783
01:17:08.481 --> 01:17:10.730
<v Speaker 2>and having deep desire</v>

1784
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:15.730
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to achieve all those things that seemed </v>

1785
01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:15.730
<v Speaker 4>unattainable.</v>

1786
01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1787
01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:15.730
<v Speaker 3>I think athletes have the same problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

1788
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:16.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and particularly,</v>

1789
01:17:16.631 --> 01:17:21.631
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the fraternity of their team </v>

1790
01:17:21.631 --> 01:17:22.000
<v Speaker 3>until they retire and apparently retired</v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes,</v>

1791
01:17:22.001 --> 01:17:24.400
<v Speaker 3>professional athletes are real risk of </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>

1792
01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:25.550
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1793
01:17:25.690 --> 01:17:27.010
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1794
01:17:27.011 --> 01:17:32.011
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met a young woman who had survived </v>

1795
01:17:32.011 --> 01:17:32.260
<v Speaker 3>cancer and she said to me rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheepishly,</v>

1796
01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.400
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1797
01:17:33.401 --> 01:17:34.360
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was sick,</v>

1798
01:17:34.361 --> 01:17:36.580
<v Speaker 3>she was on a cancer ward and she knew </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the other cancer,</v>

1799
01:17:36.581 --> 01:17:41.581
<v Speaker 3>suffers service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffers on the ward and her family and </v>

1800
01:17:41.581 --> 01:17:41.581
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's her.</v>

1801
01:17:41.581 --> 01:17:45.391
<v Speaker 3>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her tribe rallied around her and she </v>

1802
01:17:45.391 --> 01:17:47.101
<v Speaker 3>didn't know if she was going to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would undergoing chemo and all that </v>

1803
01:17:47.101 --> 01:17:48.010
<v Speaker 3>awful awful stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she looked at me sheepishly and said</v>

1804
01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:53.020
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I survived and now I missed being </v>

1805
01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.100
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She missed the community of,</v>

1806
01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:57.670
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of cancer sufferers on that ward.</v>

1807
01:17:57.671 --> 01:18:00.160
<v Speaker 3>And in her own community that rallied </v>
<v Speaker 3>around her.</v>

1808
01:18:00.161 --> 01:18:05.161
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was lonely soldiers missing war and </v>

1809
01:18:05.161 --> 01:18:07.270
<v Speaker 3>cancer survivors are missing cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like something's missing.</v>

1810
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

1811
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:13.550
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a struggle that's missing for </v>

1812
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.550
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1813
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:14.170
<v Speaker 4>in my own life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

1814
01:18:14.171 --> 01:18:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a very addictive personality,</v>

1815
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:21.010
<v Speaker 4>addictive personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've found a lot of happiness in a </v>

1816
01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:23.860
<v Speaker 4>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things about martial arts</v>

1817
01:18:23.861 --> 01:18:25.210
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularlY in jujitsu,</v>

1818
01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:26.760
<v Speaker 4>because it's one of the rare martial </v>
<v Speaker 4>arts,</v>

1819
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:31.790
<v Speaker 4>you could practice going 100 percent and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really hurt each other too much </v>

1820
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:32.770
<v Speaker 4>because you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not hitting each other,</v>

1821
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:37.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just choking each other and tapping </v>

1822
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.830
<v Speaker 4>each other out and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this,</v>

1823
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:41.521
<v Speaker 4>there's A camaraderie and a bond between</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that choke each other all the </v>

1824
01:18:41.521 --> 01:18:43.960
<v Speaker 4>time that you just don't see with other </v>
<v Speaker 4>men or I don't see.</v>

1825
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:45.130
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1826
01:18:45.131 --> 01:18:45.900
<v Speaker 3>I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1827
01:18:45.901 --> 01:18:50.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean I started when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when my marriage started falling apart,</v>

1828
01:18:50.111 --> 01:18:51.460
<v Speaker 3>I started boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1829
01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.890
<v Speaker 3>And I just needed something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd always been a pretty intense athlete</v>

1830
01:18:53.891 --> 01:18:58.891
<v Speaker 3>when I was young that I was starting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke cigarettes and drank for a while </v>

1831
01:18:58.891 --> 01:19:02.161
<v Speaker 3>and then suddenly on my life's in crisis</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 15 and I started going to a boxing </v>

1832
01:19:02.161 --> 01:19:02.830
<v Speaker 3>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mendez boxing in New York city.</v>

1833
01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:05.130
<v Speaker 3>So I have 50 year learnIng how to box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1834
01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:09.190
<v Speaker 3>And I'd always had a pretty intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with my body as an athlete.</v>

1835
01:19:09.191 --> 01:19:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wasn't starting from zero.</v>

1836
01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.180
<v Speaker 3>I've always been in really good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1837
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.600
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had never boxed before and I'd </v>

1838
01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:18.670
<v Speaker 3>never done anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I loved about mendez,</v>

1839
01:19:18.671 --> 01:19:21.220
<v Speaker 3>it's an old gym in New York and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like leeson's.</v>

1840
01:19:21.221 --> 01:19:22.690
<v Speaker 3>It's in manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1841
01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:28.080
<v Speaker 3>what I loved about it is that there were</v>
<v Speaker 3>some very tough kids from the outer </v>

1842
01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:28.080
<v Speaker 3>boroughs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1843
01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.120
<v Speaker 3>There was like suits that would come in </v>
<v Speaker 3>from wall street at lunchtime to box.</v>

1844
01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:33.340
<v Speaker 3>There was women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was all kinds of people,</v>

1845
01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.140
<v Speaker 3>wealthy people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor people,</v>

1846
01:19:35.141 --> 01:19:35.710
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>

1847
01:19:35.711 --> 01:19:37.360
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every everyone's in there,</v>

1848
01:19:37.361 --> 01:19:39.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I loved about it is that no one,</v>

1849
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.430
<v Speaker 3>no one brought their street identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the,</v>

1850
01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.740
<v Speaker 3>into the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1851
01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:46.810
<v Speaker 3>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like a platoon in combat.</v>

1852
01:19:46.811 --> 01:19:49.540
<v Speaker 3>You weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were judged in there not for whether</v>

1853
01:19:49.541 --> 01:19:52.510
<v Speaker 3>you're young and black and poor or </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealthy and affluent and white,</v>

1854
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:55.000
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how you act in the gym.</v>

1855
01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:00.360
<v Speaker 3>And there was no prejudice that I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>see against the young black kids that </v>

1856
01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:03.361
<v Speaker 3>are in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also no prejudice against </v>

1857
01:20:03.361 --> 01:20:03.361
<v Speaker 3>the wealthy white guys break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you leave it at that street,</v>

1858
01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:09.300
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever you are in that space and you </v>

1859
01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.171
<v Speaker 3>get all the respect you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you act well and that is the deep </v>

1860
01:20:12.171 --> 01:20:15.471
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian ism of a tribal society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're judged by how you act and that's </v>

1861
01:20:15.471 --> 01:20:15.471
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1862
01:20:15.471 --> 01:20:20.420
<v Speaker 3>That's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which schools you're judged by your </v>

1863
01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:20.550
<v Speaker 3>effort and how well you can perform on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mats.</v>

1864
01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And don't listen.</v>

1865
01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:23.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm a middle aged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a middle aged guy,</v>

1866
01:20:23.221 --> 01:20:23.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1867
01:20:23.701 --> 01:20:25.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to win a championship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've never.</v>

1868
01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:30.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do professionally </v>

1869
01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:30.660
<v Speaker 3>with boxing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not happening,</v>

1870
01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:30.660
<v Speaker 3>but I woke up really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard.</v>

1871
01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not afraid to get hit like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have all the.</v>

1872
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:38.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean everyone in the gym knows me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I have all the respect I could ever </v>

1873
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:40.971
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And through that struggle also you </v>

1874
01:20:40.971 --> 01:20:42.390
<v Speaker 3>achieved some feeling of peace because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're strong.</v>

1875
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:44.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a brutal struggle.</v>

1876
01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:47.850
<v Speaker 3>Boxing for people who've never tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably exhausting.</v>

1877
01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:53.200
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I thought for 12 mile was the </v>

1878
01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.620
<v Speaker 3>hardest thing I could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea what a one hour session,</v>

1879
01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.040
<v Speaker 3>like a really intense one hour training </v>
<v Speaker 3>session was like much less sparring,</v>

1880
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:00.990
<v Speaker 3>much left getting hit in the liver.</v>

1881
01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1882
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean annihilating and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1883
01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:08.310
<v Speaker 3>but I was in a lot of psychic pain and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed.</v>

1884
01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like I'm especially </v>

1885
01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.911
<v Speaker 3>physical struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of people that are </v>

1886
01:21:16.911 --> 01:21:18.150
<v Speaker 3>averse to exercise and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't stress it enough.</v>

1887
01:21:18.330 --> 01:21:20.940
<v Speaker 3>I think the body needs physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle.</v>

1888
01:21:20.941 --> 01:21:25.941
<v Speaker 3>I think if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's an overflow of energy </v>

1889
01:21:25.941 --> 01:21:28.680
<v Speaker 3>and stress that's unmanaged and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifests itself in a very physical way.</v>

1890
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:31.110
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a study that I read of,</v>

1891
01:21:31.111 --> 01:21:33.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there were a few hundred gatherer</v>

1892
01:21:33.641 --> 01:21:38.641
<v Speaker 3>societies that are still in existence </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the average amount of physical </v>

1893
01:21:38.641 --> 01:21:41.190
<v Speaker 3>activity in subsistence level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunter gatherer societies,</v>

1894
01:21:41.191 --> 01:21:42.810
<v Speaker 3>which of course is our evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

1895
01:21:42.811 --> 01:21:45.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what we are designed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

1896
01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is something like two hours of hard </v>

1897
01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.900
<v Speaker 3>walking per day on average men and women</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved like vigorously for two hours a </v>

1898
01:21:54.721 --> 01:21:56.220
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually walking quickly.</v>

1899
01:21:56.370 --> 01:22:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what our bodies are designed for </v>

1900
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:03.990
<v Speaker 3>and it's what if we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're that we're tuned up at that level,</v>

1901
01:22:03.991 --> 01:22:05.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're where our mind feels good,</v>

1902
01:22:05.431 --> 01:22:07.770
<v Speaker 3>our bodies feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't do that,</v>

1903
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:09.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can lay around all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it will not.</v>

1904
01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:13.290
<v Speaker 3>You will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will experience a death,</v>

1905
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:15.900
<v Speaker 3>a psychological deficit and a physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficit.</v>

1906
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

1907
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:21.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no way to make people do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1908
01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:27.230
<v Speaker 3>but I think if you could give people </v>
<v Speaker 3>advice that would be one of the big </v>

1909
01:22:27.230 --> 01:22:27.230
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1910
01:22:27.230 --> 01:22:29.010
<v Speaker 3>in western society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the older you get,</v>

1911
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.230
<v Speaker 3>the more money you tend to have more </v>
<v Speaker 3>sedentary,</v>

1912
01:22:31.231 --> 01:22:36.231
<v Speaker 3>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a corresponding decline in </v>

1913
01:22:36.231 --> 01:22:36.630
<v Speaker 3>testosterone levels in males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1914
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:41.870
<v Speaker 3>What they found in these very mobile </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical societies is that testosterone </v>

1915
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:44.070
<v Speaker 3>levels in males really didn't decline </v>
<v Speaker 3>until the seventies,</v>

1916
01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:45.810
<v Speaker 3>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seventies.</v>

1917
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decline slowly,</v>

1918
01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:51.861
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't go off a cliff like it </v>
<v Speaker 3>does in our society at five or whatever </v>

1919
01:22:51.861 --> 01:22:55.191
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was a gradual decline and if </v>

1920
01:22:55.191 --> 01:22:55.191
<v Speaker 3>there was a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in the mid seventies.</v>

1921
01:22:55.191 --> 01:22:56.910
<v Speaker 3>And that's because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1922
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000
<v Speaker 3>the theory was that it was because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>constant intense physical activity </v>

1923
01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 3>testosterone allows for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that activity actually keeps those</v>

1924
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 4>levels high and it's a symbiotic </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>

1925
01:23:09.190 --> 01:23:10.690
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it completely makes sense for one of the</v>

1926
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:13.240
<v Speaker 4>things that they prescribed a middle </v>
<v Speaker 4>aged man is sprints,</v>

1927
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:16.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>run up hills like a carry heavy things.</v>

1928
01:23:16.211 --> 01:23:21.211
<v Speaker 4>Do squats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do things that stimulate your entire </v>

1929
01:23:21.211 --> 01:23:21.570
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're boxing or boxing.</v>

1930
01:23:21.571 --> 01:23:22.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those things.</v>

1931
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:24.070
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>on earth and it's available this sunday.</v>
