1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>I need fear tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This video will not get demonetized </v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.280
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting demonetized.</v>

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>What's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we going,</v>

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so stressful.</v>

5
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>What do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scare tactics because it takes me so</v>

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many threats,</v>

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so much pain to change my habits.</v>

8
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>But you're so self examined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Tory.</v>

9
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.310
<v Speaker 1>That's not the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called neurotic.</v>

10
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not very nice synonym for it.</v>

11
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were not getting anything done.</v>

12
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I would agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

13
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not paralyzing.</v>

14
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

15
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I come from such a dysfunctional nine in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word.</v>

16
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:38.544
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's lost its value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from a very sick family and I'm </v>

17
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:45.741
<v Speaker 1>very determined to not be sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm trying hard to.</v>

18
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.050
<v Speaker 1>You get a lot of shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

19
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with this.</v>

20
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of paralyzing.</v>

21
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.253
<v Speaker 1>It may hinder in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form or caused obstacles when </v>

22
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>you maneuver around those obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>

23
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky.</v>

24
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you.</v>

25
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I definitely would say it would identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>as self analytical,</v>

26
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:04.404
<v Speaker 1>but like do you think that's part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a good comedian is being able to </v>

27
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.334
<v Speaker 1>analyze yourself and your neuroses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know for sure if you can't see </v>

28
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:12.174
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be super hard to really </v>

29
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.723
<v Speaker 1>get other people to relate to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if there's some obvious blind </v>

30
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>spots that they see that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing,</v>

31
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>it's my nightmare to not be self aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have everybody knows something about</v>

32
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>me that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am in constant paranoia.</v>

33
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:28.104
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know people that don't know </v>

34
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:31.370
<v Speaker 1>themselves and who they can't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and it seems real.</v>

35
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>It terrifies me.</v>

36
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what bothers us about those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

37
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:34.944
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily those people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that knowing what it is is we're </v>

38
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:38.184
<v Speaker 1>terrified of seeing that in ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent because the antithesis of a </v>

39
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.024
<v Speaker 1>comedian as somebody who can't see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth and can't look in the mirror and </v>

40
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>like that's my nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I think we all know and I think anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows,</v>

42
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:48.384
<v Speaker 1>is trying to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you try and do when you're </v>

43
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>trying to start a business or write a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book or what you just did.</v>

44
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

45
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you're doing,</v>

46
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be.</v>

47
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It's going to test you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

48
00:01:58.141 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to be difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

49
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>no one is going to like get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it all in one incredibly smooth</v>

50
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:04.854
<v Speaker 1>linear process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like weird shit that </v>

51
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>happens on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

52
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:09.204
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone who's not doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly in your eyes or not doing it </v>

53
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>to the best of their abilities or </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking off or being delusional,</v>

54
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>it scares the shit out of him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

55
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

56
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.513
<v Speaker 1>That could be me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could lose a year of everything I've </v>

57
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:23.574
<v Speaker 1>been concentrating on to like deny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in denial I think for a long </v>

58
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:28.220
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

59
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.333
<v Speaker 1>I was sort of like sleepwalking through </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and kind of like unconscious I </v>

60
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:32.514
<v Speaker 1>think for like a lot of my teens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>early twenties due to like some fucked </v>

61
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>up shit that I saw and lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was all survival mechanisms,</v>

62
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:40.044
<v Speaker 1>but I just always want to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've disarmed those and [inaudible] and </v>

63
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like just being a puppet of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

64
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think like to give you more credit</v>

65
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:51.504
<v Speaker 1>than you give yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that self examine the </v>

66
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Tories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self-reflecting aspect of it,</v>

67
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:56.814
<v Speaker 1>which seems to you to like this be as </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant self criticism is just almost </v>

68
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.314
<v Speaker 1>like a watcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go watch her over your thoughts to </v>

69
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>make sure have you keep this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing together.</v>

70
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>You crazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

71
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.573
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But along the way I look all the things </v>

72
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you've accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think you've been.</v>

73
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean you haven't been impeded by it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much as you've been aware of it.</v>

74
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the idea.</v>

75
00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:22.650
<v Speaker 2>And I definitely think I need to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

76
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.590
<v Speaker 2>We live in this world of constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>feedback and I guess my thing is like,</v>

77
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.690
<v Speaker 2>I give myself enough feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't also need your feedback with the</v>

78
00:03:30.691 --> 00:03:34.320
<v Speaker 2>likes and the at replies and the trolls </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reddits and the whatever.</v>

79
00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:36.330
<v Speaker 2>So I think that that magnified it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

80
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.343
<v Speaker 2>And I had to do like a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media internet cleansing where I </v>

81
00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:45.081
<v Speaker 2>didn't sort of constantly let go down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wormhole of like people trashing</v>

82
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.040
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just good,</v>

83
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.883
<v Speaker 1>just as a matter of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you 24 hours seems like a lot of </v>

84
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>time until you start dissecting it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you actually enjoy doing.</v>

85
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:55.294
<v Speaker 1>And how much time do you actually really</v>
<v Speaker 1>have with eating and sleeping and </v>

86
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:00.240
<v Speaker 1>traveling and commuting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crying,</v>

87
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Punching the wall furiously.</v>

88
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Masturbating and crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the tub.</v>

89
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.720
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you really have law?</v>

91
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be careful with your time.</v>

92
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

93
00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:13.364
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty hardcore about protecting my </v>

94
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to not be before,</v>

95
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.710
<v Speaker 2>before I got a handle on like my </v>
<v Speaker 2>codependence,</v>

96
00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:20.210
<v Speaker 2>anyone who wanted to go on a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hike.</v>

97
00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I was at runyon every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was getting coffee and I just,</v>

98
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that shit anymore.</v>

99
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.860
<v Speaker 1>That's like one of the biggest problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>with conspiracy theories.</v>

100
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.233
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest problems with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that get involved in conspiracy </v>

101
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

102
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.270
<v Speaker 1>you remember what the fuck is his name </v>
<v Speaker 1>that come in?</v>

103
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

104
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Costner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin goes to JFK movie.</v>

105
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oliver Stone.</v>

106
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I wrote my seniors honors thesis on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern implications of JFK.</v>

107
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Did you really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about jails cleared?</v>

108
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a ton of thoughts on like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an authority on it.</v>

109
00:04:54.141 --> 00:04:54.974
<v Speaker 2>The movie is unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe at the time it had the most </v>

110
00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:59.900
<v Speaker 2>cuts of any movie and I was obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with postmodernism at the time,</v>

111
00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:00.734
<v Speaker 2>like Jean Baudrillard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was like obsessed with him using </v>

112
00:05:02.781 --> 00:05:03.614
<v Speaker 2>like archive footage and reenact of </v>
<v Speaker 2>footage and new footage and outfit and </v>

113
00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:08.420
<v Speaker 2>just the way that he told the story was </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>

114
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.033
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you mean jfk assassination was </v>

115
00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 2>actually thinking subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

116
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.343
<v Speaker 2>I just in the last couple days got </v>
<v Speaker 2>annoyed at JFK as the president and he </v>

117
00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:23.660
<v Speaker 2>was the most telegenic president and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first televised president basically.</v>

118
00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:24.494
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of.</v>

119
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely had been on tv that good </v>

120
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:28.654
<v Speaker 1>bunch of guys had been on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but TV was a different thing in 1963 </v>

121
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 1>then it wasn't 53.</v>

122
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.700
<v Speaker 2>He was the first like star handsome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the first president who was after</v>

123
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:41.394
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Presidents had to start being handsome </v>

124
00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:43.284
<v Speaker 2>and charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just in some arguments this </v>

125
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.741
<v Speaker 2>week where people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

126
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Hillary just wasn't charismatic and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

127
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.343
<v Speaker 2>who fucking cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like since when is that the number one </v>

128
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:53.154
<v Speaker 2>box that a president has to check?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not qualified or like we can't match </v>

129
00:05:56.901 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes we do.</v>

130
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.220
<v Speaker 1>We want cult leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

131
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.063
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want someone that comes out of </v>

132
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>nowhere that also doesn't want to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

133
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.983
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want someone that can figure it all </v>

134
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>out and it has all of these key </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes of a leader,</v>

135
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>but we don't want that leader conquer </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset.</v>

136
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to have our cake and eat it too.</v>

137
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but JFK was the first,</v>

138
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>like handsome precedent for presidents </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to look healthy.</v>

139
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my president look healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be tired and anemic.</v>

140
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to have been at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Martha's vineyard getting a Tan.</v>

141
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine a time where we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>president that everyone likes no means I</v>

142
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Speaker 1>kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>But that's just our tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

144
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>We're not really designed to live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes over like 60 people.</v>

145
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all just madness.</v>

146
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.743
<v Speaker 1>Total madness.</v>

147
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.270
<v Speaker 1>We're not designed for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're bad.</v>

148
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.253
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is it possible that someone can </v>

149
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:55.844
<v Speaker 1>achieve some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even if you achieve some Martin </v>

150
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Luther King Jr state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.330
<v Speaker 1>where you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that level of speaker in,</v>

152
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.533
<v Speaker 1>although you were a black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were so obviously super intelligent </v>

153
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:13.420
<v Speaker 1>and so spiritual that even racist had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go make it.</v>

154
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.190
<v Speaker 1>A lot of good kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a sexy guy.</v>

155
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 1>His fucking way of speaking was so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like a song.</v>

156
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like he had this,</v>

157
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>it was almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry to denigrate Marlin by saying,</v>

158
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>but he had the cadence of like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian who was like in the rhythm,</v>

159
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 1>like he was hypnotic in the way that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke.</v>

160
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.223
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not judge a man by the color of his </v>

161
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the content of his character.</v>

162
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:39.224
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

163
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where did that come from?</v>

164
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:43.934
<v Speaker 1>Preachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

165
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Is that like Jensen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

166
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like musical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was why kinison was so good.</v>

167
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Kinison was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Preacher.</v>

168
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.290
<v Speaker 1>He was one of those hell fire tent </v>
<v Speaker 1>preachers.</v>

169
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's video or at least audio,</v>

170
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:56.863
<v Speaker 1>maybe video as well of him doing a tent </v>
<v Speaker 1>revival and it's fucking incredible to </v>

171
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.713
<v Speaker 1>see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just all about the rhythm and the </v>

172
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also just the electricity,</v>

173
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.880
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.813
<v Speaker 1>people are always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I do comedy and how do we just </v>

175
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 1>stand up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I write jokes?</v>

176
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:11.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

177
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:12.830
<v Speaker 1>you can write jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this,</v>

178
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 1>you can do 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

179
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 1>you can get whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

180
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.050
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you deliver electricity on demand?</v>

181
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.123
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to teach you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't teach someone that know and </v>

182
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.903
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about a guy like </v>

183
00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Kennison too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what he was doing,</v>

184
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.823
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about the power of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord and the power of God and the power </v>

186
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:37.181
<v Speaker 1>of Jesus and say his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stopped around on stage and you know,</v>

187
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:39.050
<v Speaker 1>and then that God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is alive.</v>

188
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.483
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing it so good that he was </v>

189
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:44.684
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing it so good that the people </v>

190
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>who are watching got a feeling from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

191
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:54.281
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you and I are too skeptical.</v>

192
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.163
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

193
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we're fools because we can't just </v>
<v Speaker 3>give into it.</v>

194
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we're fools that we can't just sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and watch some guy go off.</v>

195
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we were fools that we don't just </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak in tongues.</v>

196
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 3>Just let it all go.</v>

197
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 4>I know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

198
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm too much of a fucking contract.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just a science freak.</v>

199
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what about I love the Lord.</v>

200
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 4>But like are there some metrics to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that?</v>

201
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Something's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are they getting so happy?</v>

202
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.520
<v Speaker 3>Obviously they're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's exciting.</v>

203
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:20.803
<v Speaker 3>He's inspiring them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's giving them some sort of almost </v>

204
00:09:23.241 --> 00:09:24.710
<v Speaker 3>like mental placebo effect.</v>

205
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do feel like there.</v>

206
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.913
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really do get dopamine from someone </v>

207
00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:31.060
<v Speaker 4>being a leader and taking charge.</v>

208
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.063
<v Speaker 3>So like just entertain the thought that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what God is a god is those </v>

209
00:09:36.371 --> 00:09:37.640
<v Speaker 3>moments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

210
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.523
<v Speaker 3>when they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're more and more extreme as we get </v>

211
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.133
<v Speaker 3>more and more evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those moments where people sort of </v>

212
00:09:43.631 --> 00:09:46.810
<v Speaker 3>figured out and get together and lock on</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that energy is,</v>

213
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.600
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes they on and they decided </v>
<v Speaker 4>to kill Jews.</v>

214
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't get together and look,</v>

215
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.810
<v Speaker 4>I have a good idea and it's a bad idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they all start locking on.</v>

216
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.673
<v Speaker 4>They don't do it on a post.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can use it for evil or you can use </v>

217
00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:01.160
<v Speaker 4>it for good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like.</v>

218
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Well definitely the whole biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>instinct of humans can go south.</v>

219
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 3>They can get Western with people real </v>
<v Speaker 3>quick,</v>

220
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:09.144
<v Speaker 3>which is why people should be really </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified of anybody who assumes any </v>

221
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:13.300
<v Speaker 3>sort of position of power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the state itself.</v>

222
00:10:13.301 --> 00:10:14.134
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what freaks me out of all these </v>

223
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:17.120
<v Speaker 3>people that want Marxism and socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you are.</v>

224
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.293
<v Speaker 3>You want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much money do you want to give the </v>

225
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:20.124
<v Speaker 3>taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you want people to pay 90 percent </v>

226
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:23.160
<v Speaker 3>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand that?</v>

227
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:24.930
<v Speaker 3>That means someone is getting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

228
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand that entity getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>that money?</v>

229
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 3>The government is going to want more of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

230
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 3>They grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just keep growing.</v>

231
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.470
<v Speaker 4>The only trick about that is like you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>so smart and you're like,</v>

232
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.830
<v Speaker 4>you the word understand it has no place </v>
<v Speaker 4>in people trying to feel safe.</v>

233
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.200
<v Speaker 4>Like we're just these visceral animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are just like,</v>

234
00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:39.921
<v Speaker 4>am I safe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Am I safe?</v>

235
00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:40.754
<v Speaker 4>Am I safe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was maybe like our brains are only </v>

236
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.283
<v Speaker 4>designed to keep us alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not designed to make us think </v>

237
00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:45.830
<v Speaker 4>logically and you're not safe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

238
00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:47.800
<v Speaker 4>one safe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're safe right now.</v>

239
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.870
<v Speaker 4>We are a trash bag full of blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>live texting and driving.</v>

240
00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:58.010
<v Speaker 4>We are about to die every 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make some good trash bags,</v>

241
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.780
<v Speaker 4>hefty law in there and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are,</v>

242
00:11:02.781 --> 00:11:04.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I can't,</v>

243
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:06.010
<v Speaker 4>but everyday I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did I make it through?</v>

244
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.883
<v Speaker 4>How did I survive this day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't I doing everything should </v>

245
00:11:09.411 --> 00:11:09.951
<v Speaker 4>kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

246
00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:11.690
<v Speaker 4>I think it was in that book Sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the idea that like,</v>

247
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much of our anxiety comes in the fact</v>

248
00:11:13.611 --> 00:11:14.444
<v Speaker 4>that we all know that we're only </v>
<v Speaker 4>subconsciously at the top of the food </v>

249
00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:16.874
<v Speaker 4>chain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we should not be at the top of the </v>

250
00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:19.700
<v Speaker 4>food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's only because we developed weapons,</v>

251
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.190
<v Speaker 4>like we know that at any point like we </v>
<v Speaker 4>deserve.</v>

252
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.650
<v Speaker 4>We deserve our life expectancy to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like 16,</v>

253
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.573
<v Speaker 4>but I think developing the weapons is </v>
<v Speaker 4>also what led to us getting like this </v>

254
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.500
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're so vulnerable,</v>

255
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.343
<v Speaker 3>but I'll think all this vulnerable stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>came along with the advent of </v>

256
00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:35.100
<v Speaker 3>inventions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

257
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.983
<v Speaker 3>I think that when we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I'm an idiot but don't listen </v>

258
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:38.784
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would think that when we didn't </v>

259
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:41.844
<v Speaker 3>have anything other than the other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what will the animals had our instincts </v>

260
00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:45.714
<v Speaker 3>clause and okay,</v>

261
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.593
<v Speaker 4>well we can't sleep outside overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long you're actually that whole </v>

262
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 4>month person I know who could probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>live outside a site.</v>

263
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.540
<v Speaker 4>Anybody can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not good for Elon.</v>

264
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean we are not anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

265
00:11:59.021 --> 00:11:59.854
<v Speaker 4>We're so infantilized at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're getting closer and closer </v>

266
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:04.510
<v Speaker 4>to those fucking gray aliens that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>see in the movies.</v>

267
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're going to be a giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>

268
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.103
<v Speaker 4>little skinny arms and that's what those</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are where they have vintage </v>

269
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:19.141
<v Speaker 4>glasses on instead of black eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a fucking great commercial.</v>

270
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.583
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it's for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a hipster and Danny trio and </v>

271
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.603
<v Speaker 4>and Danny Trejo is a bartender and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>hipster is asking for like this custom </v>

272
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:29.704
<v Speaker 4>craft beer that's like leather but not </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoes like a belt and he's like going </v>

273
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:36.650
<v Speaker 4>through all this like hit woody earthy </v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's going through all different.</v>

274
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.713
<v Speaker 4>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did a trio staring at him with his no </v>

275
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:43.100
<v Speaker 4>nonsense face dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tattooed up Mexican towns.</v>

276
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know Danny Trejo.</v>

277
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking hilarious commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can finally talk about this,</v>

278
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:50.074
<v Speaker 4>but it took me getting my ear bitten off</v>
<v Speaker 4>by a dog to realize how fucking </v>

279
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.770
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

280
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Speaker 4>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't eat.</v>

281
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see it come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just keep.</v>

282
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 4>My ear was gone and it seems as a rescue</v>
<v Speaker 4>dog that you have a dog that I.</v>

283
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 4>That was at the Carson shelter and was </v>
<v Speaker 4>about to be euthanized.</v>

284
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.133
<v Speaker 4>I just got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to grab any dogs that's going to </v>

285
00:13:09.241 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 4>be euthanized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He came in.</v>

286
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 4>He had been taken from his mother too </v>
<v Speaker 4>young.</v>

287
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:12.424
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't neutered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't have spacial intelligence yet it </v>

288
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.630
<v Speaker 4>wasn't his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't attack me.</v>

289
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:17.464
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their mouth is their hands and when </v>

290
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 4>they're taken from their mother too </v>
<v Speaker 4>young,</v>

291
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:21.910
<v Speaker 4>they don't learn manners basically.</v>

292
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.260
<v Speaker 4>So I also made the mistake of not </v>
<v Speaker 4>establishing myself as the alpha.</v>

293
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:27.094
<v Speaker 4>I was just felt so sorry for him and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>pitied him instead of doing the right </v>

294
00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all my dogs,</v>

295
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:33.520
<v Speaker 4>I established myself as the alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not allowed to lick me.</v>

296
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 4>They're not allowed to jump on me and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>let him do that.</v>

297
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.813
<v Speaker 4>Then I pushed him off me and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't allow your dog to look your </v>

298
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:43.300
<v Speaker 4>jump on you sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have to end it before they end it,</v>

299
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 4>but I genuinely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I generally don't.</v>

300
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's deep.</v>

301
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not ideal.</v>

302
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.463
<v Speaker 4>It's deep because every now and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do need them to really respect you when </v>

303
00:13:53.951 --> 00:13:54.784
<v Speaker 4>a car is coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they get out and it is a dominant </v>

304
00:13:56.771 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 4>thing to lick you and to jump on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's weird.</v>

305
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.293
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I never thought of that like </v>

306
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:03.814
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

307
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.620
<v Speaker 4>But I do have these moments with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>puppy of a puppy.</v>

308
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 4>I guess he's 10 months old now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe 11 neuter,</v>

309
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 4>not yet know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's just a super sweetheart.</v>

310
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.620
<v Speaker 4>Super Sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Golden,</v>

311
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.463
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

312
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 4>Just like humans and sometimes he </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to kiss me,</v>

313
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.693
<v Speaker 4>like sometimes shies away from kissing </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and then once he kisses me realize </v>

314
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:27.880
<v Speaker 4>that it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he kisses me a bunch and uh,</v>

315
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:28.893
<v Speaker 4>he's always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did climb on top of me except in a </v>

316
00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:34.360
<v Speaker 4>submissive position and climbs on top of</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and lifts his arms up in the air so I</v>

317
00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:36.100
<v Speaker 4>can rub his belly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is very good news.</v>

318
00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:36.934
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

319
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.790
<v Speaker 4>when you make eye contact with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does he look away a little bit?</v>

320
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.810
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you want.</v>

321
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:41.703
<v Speaker 4>You want it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whenever I have to ascertain whether </v>

322
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:43.594
<v Speaker 4>a dog is dominant or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look them in the eyes and if they </v>

323
00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:45.664
<v Speaker 4>don't look away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a dominant dog and that's a </v>

324
00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to do all these things.</v>

325
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:50.170
<v Speaker 4>You've got to like put them on their </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

326
00:14:50.171 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 4>You gotta like hold them down until they</v>
<v Speaker 4>exhale.</v>

327
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

328
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

329
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.090
<v Speaker 1>when they don't have an Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're designed to have a leader.</v>

330
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>They love discipline and when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

331
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.873
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's chaos and most people are not in </v>

332
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:05.080
<v Speaker 1>control of their animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

333
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.013
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do a lot of things like we make them </v>

334
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:08.504
<v Speaker 1>sit before he comes in the house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to stay with the door wide </v>

335
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:11.720
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love that.</v>

336
00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Put his food out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to stay,</v>

337
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.280
<v Speaker 1>walk through a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never walk around a dog.</v>

338
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Like if your dogs in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk right through them,</v>

339
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Speaker 1>just bumped him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just get them out of the way because</v>

340
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:22.064
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in my house instead of I'm going </v>

341
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:26.720
<v Speaker 1>to walk around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting to other dogs.</v>

342
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.170
<v Speaker 1>A massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

343
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a sweetie too.</v>

344
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.723
<v Speaker 1>My kids ride them like you can ride him </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's just like such a big teddy </v>

345
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:38.510
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>

346
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.343
<v Speaker 1>I have a great day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And pitbull who's like kind of looks </v>

347
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:45.611
<v Speaker 1>like Johnny cash is his name and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called a regency massive.</v>

348
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And the regency massive is half </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neapolitan.</v>

349
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Massive and half pit bull with a bread </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

350
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it has pitfalls.</v>

351
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:52.893
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who bread it was one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had had dogs if you brought on fear </v>

352
00:15:57.291 --> 00:16:00.440
<v Speaker 1>factor too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they used them as attack dogs and it</v>

353
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:01.274
<v Speaker 1>was fucking hilarious because we used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have people that they would get these </v>

354
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:08.861
<v Speaker 1>Belgian malinois on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People does dogs or police dogs.</v>

355
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Those dogs look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So different than any,</v>

356
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.523
<v Speaker 1>the dogs they have like a look of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>just give me the green light dance and </v>

357
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.470
<v Speaker 1>they grab and they shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

358
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I know someone who they grabbed face </v>
<v Speaker 1>shook his face.</v>

359
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

360
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a smaller dog,</v>

361
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 1>like a 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 pound dog.</v>

362
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.263
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll just have taught ball of wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these regency mastiffs are 140 in </v>

363
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:33.410
<v Speaker 1>their tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did Gypsy that stupid movie,</v>

364
00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 1>the Hulk with Eric with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

365
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Band bands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't have.</v>

366
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do one also.</v>

367
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his was better.</v>

368
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.550
<v Speaker 1>But the ban of one Nick Nolte D was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe we're talking about this</v>

369
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.993
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I forgot to bring up this one </v>

370
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.793
<v Speaker 1>crucial part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Nolte DC was Eric Ban his dad and </v>

371
00:16:55.311 --> 00:16:59.030
<v Speaker 1>he injected these dogs with this hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>serum.</v>

372
00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:01.970
<v Speaker 1>So these pitbulls became hulk pit bulls </v>
<v Speaker 1>do attack the hawk.</v>

373
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.163
<v Speaker 1>It was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the dog thing to model the hulk pit </v>

374
00:17:07.031 --> 00:17:12.031
<v Speaker 1>bull was curly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curly was my dogs dad tank of a dog.</v>

375
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the sweetest dog you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

376
00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:17.774
<v Speaker 1>That's like the image that they drew for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the renderings the actual dog looked </v>

377
00:17:23.601 --> 00:17:24.434
<v Speaker 1>like in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a giant hooked out pit bull </v>

378
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.600
<v Speaker 1>rescue that to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it right there.</v>

379
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I would let that dog in my bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>

380
00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:33.784
<v Speaker 1>I live right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there is something about </v>

381
00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:36.100
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So interesting that you have a couple of</v>

382
00:17:36.101 --> 00:17:39.140
<v Speaker 1>kinds of breeds because I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people usually see themselves in a breed</v>

383
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.430
<v Speaker 1>and that's their thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.780
<v Speaker 1>and if yours is massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what made you do a meathead?</v>

385
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.180
<v Speaker 1>He looked awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.163
<v Speaker 1>That's literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was awesome and he was super sweet </v>

387
00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 1>like he's this</v>

388
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 4>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Curly was the sweetest dog,</v>

389
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:53.154
<v Speaker 4>you know that the most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dogs that were bred to fight dogs </v>

390
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:56.574
<v Speaker 4>and they were also selected for the ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were the kindness to the owners </v>

391
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 4>because the dog fighters didn't tolerate</v>
<v Speaker 4>dogs that were violent towards people.</v>

392
00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.040
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of pit bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know the whole deal behind them.</v>

393
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.110
<v Speaker 4>The tragic irony is that they're trained</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be weapons,</v>

394
00:18:10.111 --> 00:18:12.570
<v Speaker 4>but they're trained to be very </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotionally attached to people's.</v>

395
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.433
<v Speaker 4>They're so attached to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those things give you is so intense and </v>

396
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 4>so unconditional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so intense.</v>

397
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:20.550
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

398
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:24.510
<v Speaker 4>there's so much more vibrant than a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of other dogs and the way they love you,</v>

399
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.533
<v Speaker 4>it's like so different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the ones that are rescued I think </v>

400
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:30.000
<v Speaker 4>also know on some level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

401
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.043
<v Speaker 4>I had this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wouldn't even let any other dogs </v>

402
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.173
<v Speaker 4>near me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I had to give her all the love of </v>

403
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:36.720
<v Speaker 4>the other dogs came near her.</v>

404
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.770
<v Speaker 4>Everybody got snapped at and backed off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to get all the love to her first.</v>

405
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

406
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 4>and they also gravitate towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable,</v>

407
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 4>so when I'm sick they get more </v>
<v Speaker 4>protective of me.</v>

408
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 4>When I had the injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when my ear was ripped off,</v>

409
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 4>they were all like when someone come in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they'd be like extra flexing on like</v>

410
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 4>the gardeners and stuff like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really empathic.</v>

411
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.140
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've learned so much from training dogs,</v>

412
00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 4>especially ones with low impulse </v>
<v Speaker 4>control.</v>

413
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:01.734
<v Speaker 4>They don't have a lot of impulse control</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to teach them impulse </v>

414
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:06.720
<v Speaker 4>control because they're designed not </v>
<v Speaker 4>only to fight but also to chase rats and</v>

415
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:09.180
<v Speaker 4>there's a root.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to bring it all back.</v>

416
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:11.640
<v Speaker 4>Johnny cash,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my two dogs,</v>

417
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:14.730
<v Speaker 4>brutus as much smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brutus is an English bulldog.</v>

418
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:15.564
<v Speaker 4>She inu mix and so many flaps and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're both going to enter into </v>

419
00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:23.904
<v Speaker 4>the house to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnny always knocks brutus or either </v>

420
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 4>way like pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>step aside,</v>

421
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>step aside,</v>

422
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have such a clear run how it works,</v>

423
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.590
<v Speaker 4>pecking order.</v>

424
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.410
<v Speaker 4>I told you about when I went to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

425
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.100
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I did the wolf sanctuary.</v>

426
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.280
<v Speaker 4>She did like how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

427
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.303
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to leave them alone and let </v>

428
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:43.620
<v Speaker 4>them have their pecking order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the Alpha,</v>

429
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:45.590
<v Speaker 4>the Beta and the mega.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to just leave them alone.</v>

430
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.230
<v Speaker 4>Like people like don't leave them alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let them work it out.</v>

431
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.513
<v Speaker 4>You can't interject into nature just </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're uncomfortable with your </v>

432
00:19:52.981 --> 00:19:54.390
<v Speaker 4>own mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

433
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.033
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell people to leave the dog park all </v>

434
00:19:57.301 --> 00:19:59.700
<v Speaker 4>the fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are so stupid with their dogs and</v>

435
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:00.534
<v Speaker 4>they project their shit onto their dogs </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're codependent with their dogs </v>

436
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.620
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

437
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:07.450
<v Speaker 4>the way to get pimples or to unlock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

438
00:20:07.451 --> 00:20:08.820
<v Speaker 4>to get dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

439
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.713
<v Speaker 4>So I'm just sticking my finger in </v>
<v Speaker 4>buttholes at the dog park constantly to </v>

440
00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:16.320
<v Speaker 4>get dogs to stop fighting because people</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to control their dogs.</v>

441
00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.990
<v Speaker 4>Most people that have those kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dogs,</v>

442
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:21.360
<v Speaker 4>they don't realize that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not like getting a lab.</v>

443
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.130
<v Speaker 4>You're getting a dangerous animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Loves to fight.</v>

444
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.033
<v Speaker 4>Loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fight the lock on each other and </v>

445
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.110
<v Speaker 4>wagtails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

446
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.640
<v Speaker 4>And you have to be able to ascertain the</v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between when things get real,</v>

447
00:20:32.641 --> 00:20:35.500
<v Speaker 4>like the hair on their back and went and</v>
<v Speaker 4>playful and you're.</v>

448
00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 4>And then the dog feels your fear and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they started to get protective.</v>

449
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:40.104
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't understand like all the </v>

450
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:41.724
<v Speaker 4>time when I'm walking my dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's like and they start pulling </v>

451
00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:46.710
<v Speaker 4>their dog away and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is you're feeling fear</v>

452
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.573
<v Speaker 4>now your dog's going to get aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're manifesting this dog fights </v>

453
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 4>with your fucking bullshit fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like get your shit together.</v>

454
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.283
<v Speaker 4>So frustrating.</v>

455
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the argument comes in.</v>

456
00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Do we really want those kinds of pets?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

457
00:20:59.751 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 3>do we really want people to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous doners pets?</v>

458
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a super responsibility.</v>

459
00:21:04.821 --> 00:21:06.680
<v Speaker 3>And I agree that many people could do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly,</v>

460
00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.520
<v Speaker 3>but it is a super responsibility to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a warrior animal.</v>

461
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.420
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

462
00:21:11.421 --> 00:21:12.254
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think that for a lot of these </v>

463
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:18.211
<v Speaker 4>animals that are just so unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 4>fast and you know,</v>

464
00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:19.534
<v Speaker 4>designed to do damage that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the same way we get driver's </v>

465
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:22.444
<v Speaker 4>license for cars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're operating something that can </v>

466
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:24.873
<v Speaker 4>injure people like you should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people should have big </v>

467
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.470
<v Speaker 4>dogs but big teeth without taking some </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of test prep.</v>

468
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.620
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who runs greyhounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have greyhounds and they have these</v>

469
00:21:36.021 --> 00:21:39.710
<v Speaker 3>dogs that they there are so fast and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

470
00:21:39.711 --> 00:21:43.490
<v Speaker 3>these things are so ferocious that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't even play with other dogs.</v>

471
00:21:43.491 --> 00:21:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Like if they find him another dog or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>coyote or a poodle or they'll kill it.</v>

472
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just immediately kill it.</v>

473
00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.100
<v Speaker 3>And that's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a bummer.</v>

474
00:21:52.101 --> 00:21:56.400
<v Speaker 3>And I had a buddy who rescued racing </v>
<v Speaker 3>greyhounds stimulus before pimples,</v>

475
00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.300
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

476
00:21:57.301 --> 00:21:58.760
<v Speaker 3>Hence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the ones that were there,</v>

477
00:21:58.761 --> 00:22:01.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean they weren't pets at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just existing to race.</v>

478
00:22:01.251 --> 00:22:03.800
<v Speaker 3>They were existing is gambling dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

479
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.110
<v Speaker 3>And that's a really common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

480
00:22:06.111 --> 00:22:08.560
<v Speaker 3>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he would rescue these dogs.</v>

481
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:09.763
<v Speaker 3>He rescued one of them and he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep it because it anytime it saw a cat </v>

482
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 3>or a small gods having a cheetah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

483
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.213
<v Speaker 4>we're just having this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean if you raise it from a puppy </v>

484
00:22:19.591 --> 00:22:20.970
<v Speaker 4>you can usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

485
00:22:20.971 --> 00:22:23.640
<v Speaker 4>No really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know a ton about greyhounds,</v>

486
00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:24.474
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can raise the lions from cubs and </v>

487
00:22:26.551 --> 00:22:28.140
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they seem on instagram.</v>

488
00:22:28.141 --> 00:22:30.120
<v Speaker 4>They're biting them and hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

489
00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.840
<v Speaker 3>But oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is going to sound weird,</v>

490
00:22:32.841 --> 00:22:36.080
<v Speaker 3>lions seem to be calmer than a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>other animals that we.</v>

491
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.700
<v Speaker 4>It's male lions for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

492
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.733
<v Speaker 4>Male lions are only awake two hours a </v>
<v Speaker 4>day and they don't do anything as long </v>

493
00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:43.030
<v Speaker 4>as you feed the female on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're nice to them all the time.</v>

494
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:45.760
<v Speaker 4>I think you can connect with these guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>on Instagram,</v>

495
00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:47.200
<v Speaker 4>black Jaguar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>white tiger,</v>

496
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:50.950
<v Speaker 4>you know the guy and they're snuggling </v>
<v Speaker 4>with fucking panther or something.</v>

497
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 4>I heard something that they have their </v>
<v Speaker 4>scent on them.</v>

498
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:57.010
<v Speaker 4>They put their urine on them like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>declaw them.</v>

499
00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't recall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even that's not going to help you if</v>

500
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.330
<v Speaker 3>the thing decides to bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a wrap.</v>

501
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you're going to survive.</v>

502
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:03.351
<v Speaker 4>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

503
00:23:03.351 --> 00:23:07.850
<v Speaker 4>member Tippi hedren.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She the hitchcock actress.</v>

504
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.913
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pulled it like the Tippi Hedren </v>

505
00:23:09.861 --> 00:23:11.420
<v Speaker 4>Shambala.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

506
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.283
<v Speaker 4>Melanie Griffith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grew up with 18 tigers and lions in the </v>

507
00:23:15.531 --> 00:23:17.490
<v Speaker 4>home in La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in La.</v>

508
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.403
<v Speaker 4>Right outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they did a documentary about it and </v>

509
00:23:20.391 --> 00:23:23.120
<v Speaker 4>everyone on the crew got attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got their scalp ripped off.</v>

510
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.330
<v Speaker 4>Melanie Griffith had some injury and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then tippy came out later and was like,</v>

511
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.640
<v Speaker 4>they are not pads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do not have them in their house.</v>

512
00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:30.290
<v Speaker 4>It's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is a bad idea.</v>

513
00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:35.640
<v Speaker 4>But she had 19 of them in Encino.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

514
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.410
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I was alive in the seven days.</v>

515
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.660
<v Speaker 4>People just didn't know how to live yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

516
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:43.150
<v Speaker 4>Or did they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

517
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 4>But if you raise them from infancy,</v>

518
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 5>if they're domesticated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a little different.</v>

519
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:50.580
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

520
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.613
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's still the potential for </v>

521
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:57.050
<v Speaker 5>something going sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also tricky because it's like,</v>

522
00:23:57.051 --> 00:23:59.120
<v Speaker 5>and this is like the work I do with </v>
<v Speaker 5>horses and dogs,</v>

523
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:04.121
<v Speaker 5>it's like if you get scared and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel it and if you run food runs right,</v>

524
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.233
<v Speaker 5>it's you fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really like you decide if they </v>

525
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:10.070
<v Speaker 5>attack you or not based on your energy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like baby,</v>

526
00:24:10.071 --> 00:24:13.880
<v Speaker 5>first generation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Viking animals.</v>

527
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.773
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you could get them and </v>

528
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:20.180
<v Speaker 5>raise a bear and then have the bear's </v>
<v Speaker 5>cubs and the bears,</v>

529
00:24:20.181 --> 00:24:21.014
<v Speaker 5>cubs cubs maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen any generation's </v>

530
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.060
<v Speaker 5>epigenetic imprinting of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've always been domesticated.</v>

531
00:24:26.061 --> 00:24:27.950
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that guy that swims at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>polar bear?</v>

532
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.433
<v Speaker 5>The fuck is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to keep that thing in </v>

533
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 5>Benadryl or what's happening?</v>

534
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.963
<v Speaker 5>Why is it in a swimming pool?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the best part of that video is the </v>

535
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 5>gate is like chicken wire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

536
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.200
<v Speaker 5>there's a neighbor who's just like in </v>
<v Speaker 5>his house who has not left in two years.</v>

537
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.340
<v Speaker 5>Your neighbor has a polar bear wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 5>up and chicken wire and what is,</v>

538
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.630
<v Speaker 5>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is that?</v>

539
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.080
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm a hundred percent sure of it.</v>

541
00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at that fence.</v>

542

<v Speaker 5>Where is that?</v>

544
00:25:04.081 --> 00:25:04.914
<v Speaker 5>It looks like Cincinnati.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well there was a guy in Ohio that had </v>

545
00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 5>his own zoo and then he shot himself </v>

573
00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's energy.</v>

574
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

575
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.600
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's sweet.</v>

576
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.100
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a different kind of.</v>

577
00:26:47.101 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Dogs are just like lifeguards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's weed is dogs.</v>

578
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.533
<v Speaker 1>They're just so nice stories about they </v>
<v Speaker 1>smell a fire and they get the kid and </v>

579
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:57.480
<v Speaker 1>they opened the door and they take it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shelter and they put it on a plane and</v>

580
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.170
<v Speaker 1>travel arrangements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

581
00:27:01.171 --> 00:27:03.990
<v Speaker 1>they help you get into college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're on a kayak.</v>

582
00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're just such incredible dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

583
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.900
<v Speaker 1>he gets a little silly sometimes because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's young,</v>

584
00:27:07.901 --> 00:27:08.734
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes will test you with things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and won't listen when you tell them to </v>

585
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:12.030
<v Speaker 1>do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals tests you.</v>

586
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I want to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you the leader?</v>

587
00:27:13.761 --> 00:27:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Are you the leader?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you the leader?</v>

588
00:27:14.961 --> 00:27:17.090
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's kind of what audiences do</v>

589
00:27:17.091 --> 00:27:17.781
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

590
00:27:17.781 --> 00:27:18.614
<v Speaker 2>we were talking earlier about self </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis and I am trying to stop with </v>

591
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:22.873
<v Speaker 2>that shit but it's just hard to turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>that off because it's like we get on </v>

592
00:27:24.691 --> 00:27:26.390
<v Speaker 2>stage and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you like me now?</v>

593
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.343
<v Speaker 2>Do you like me now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about now we do that for an hour </v>

594
00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:29.780
<v Speaker 2>every night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

595
00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:32.090
<v Speaker 2>and then I get off stage and I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to myself.</v>

596
00:27:32.091 --> 00:27:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Do I liked me now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I like me now?</v>

597
00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just a hard thing to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>shut off,</v>

598
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:40.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how do you negotiate on stage?</v>

599
00:27:40.251 --> 00:27:41.084
<v Speaker 2>Like getting feedback and using that </v>
<v Speaker 2>validation and then as soon as it's </v>

600
00:27:43.611 --> 00:27:44.960
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not needing it at all,</v>

601
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.370
<v Speaker 1>will you have like people that love you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a family and shit,</v>

602
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 1>you're answering for yourself and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about you?</v>

603
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.133
<v Speaker 1>I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think doing things that are more </v>

604
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:57.660
<v Speaker 1>difficult than that is a good way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>even that out.</v>

605
00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.860
<v Speaker 1>That is an unbelievably salient point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

606
00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:02.694
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the most difficult thing in </v>

607
00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:05.880
<v Speaker 1>your day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a.</v>

608
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 1>it's got extra weight that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to have on it.</v>

609
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.870
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

610
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:11.723
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there something more difficult than </v>

611
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:15.810
<v Speaker 1>standard of care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Everything is more difficult.</v>

612
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Standup is easy when it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

613
00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.173
<v Speaker 1>Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz said that stand up is the </v>

614
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:21.810
<v Speaker 1>easiest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest thing you'll ever do.</v>

615
00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

616
00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Way To describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

617
00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Joey said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

618
00:28:25.591 --> 00:28:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

619
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

620
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.033
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I read something recently about how </v>

621
00:28:29.571 --> 00:28:33.680
<v Speaker 2>the reason people hate are so scared of </v>
<v Speaker 2>public speaking,</v>

622
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.820
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were in that position,</v>

623
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.490
<v Speaker 2>public speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you speaking to hundreds of people,</v>

624
00:28:40.491 --> 00:28:43.490
<v Speaker 2>that meant that you were exiled from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe and you were defending yourself.</v>

625
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Whoa</v>

626
00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:46.653
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were ever like trying to get </v>

627
00:28:49.161 --> 00:28:50.660
<v Speaker 2>people to like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was saying,</v>

628
00:28:50.661 --> 00:28:53.300
<v Speaker 2>please don't kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't eat all the meat.</v>

629
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I didn't steal that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please spare me.</v>

630
00:28:55.701 --> 00:28:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Please spare me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

631
00:28:57.321 --> 00:28:59.330
<v Speaker 2>that makes so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much sense.</v>

632
00:28:59.331 --> 00:29:02.180
<v Speaker 2>So when we're up there on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason you feel that fear is because</v>

633
00:29:02.181 --> 00:29:03.014
<v Speaker 2>it used to be you were begging for </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgiveness and not to get speared to </v>

634
00:29:05.511 --> 00:29:09.560
<v Speaker 2>death or stoned to death or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes a lot of sense.</v>

635
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.590
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy because we always </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with being a leader who,</v>

636
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:15.180
<v Speaker 1>speaking to the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

637
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't kill me.</v>

638
00:29:17.911 --> 00:29:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Please don't kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

639
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it was.</v>

640
00:29:21.511 --> 00:29:22.344
<v Speaker 2>And tribal times at the same thing about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was that article in the </v>

641
00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:24.534
<v Speaker 2>Atlantic about how um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loneliness is now is bad for you as </v>

642
00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:27.534
<v Speaker 2>smoking because it used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were living alone in an </v>

643
00:29:29.641 --> 00:29:32.130
<v Speaker 2>apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a pod that meant you were exiled from</v>

644
00:29:32.131 --> 00:29:36.260
<v Speaker 2>the tribe and had no protection from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your brain stops producing serotonin.</v>

645
00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Endorphins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you basically just get depressed because</v>

646
00:29:38.461 --> 00:29:39.294
<v Speaker 2>it's like you feel so unsafe and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel so much anxiety designed to live </v>

647
00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:42.844
<v Speaker 2>together because that meant protections </v>
<v Speaker 2>before we had like alarm systems and </v>

648
00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:46.384
<v Speaker 2>locks and shit.</v>

649
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

650
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:51.150
<v Speaker 3>That totally makes sense as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like the,</v>

651
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.353
<v Speaker 3>the more people get advanced socially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the more we understand each other </v>

652
00:29:57.011 --> 00:29:57.844
<v Speaker 3>socially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we more and more will understand like </v>

653
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.183
<v Speaker 3>that there's all these causes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects that go on inside of human </v>

654
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:03.814
<v Speaker 3>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on both sides that make things go well </v>

655
00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:08.044
<v Speaker 3>or go bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And hopefully over generation after </v>

656
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:11.794
<v Speaker 3>generation of US studying this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>paying attention to the way that we </v>

657
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:14.314
<v Speaker 3>behave and talk to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think people talk to each </v>

658
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 3>other far differently today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We definitely do in media,</v>

659
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.253
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it didn't make the 19 thirties or </v>

660
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:24.700
<v Speaker 3>forties or fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a very crude,</v>

661
00:30:24.701 --> 00:30:25.534
<v Speaker 3>rudimentary form of communication that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's richer and weirder and more </v>

662
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 3>aware now today and I think it's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to continue to get better and better and</v>

663
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:34.774
<v Speaker 3>if it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe one day we'll get into a more </v>

664
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:38.374
<v Speaker 3>relaxed society place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we can ensure that more people </v>

665
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.453
<v Speaker 3>are nice and friendly and helping it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>honest and helpful and less people are </v>

666
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:50.140
<v Speaker 3>dangerous and fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But instead of doing that,</v>

667
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:52.570
<v Speaker 3>what we do is the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will I put a bigger walls,</v>

668
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.420
<v Speaker 3>lock things down more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>separate ourselves,</v>

669
00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.230
<v Speaker 3>ourselves further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

670
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.170
<v Speaker 3>secure our position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as a society,</v>

671
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 3>and this is total hippy talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

672
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:07.990
<v Speaker 3>But we have to figure out a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>less people live.</v>

673
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Sucky lives soon as you make less people</v>
<v Speaker 3>live,</v>

674
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 3>suck lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything becomes way less dangerous.</v>

675
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.473
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I was in Guatemala once and I </v>

676
00:31:16.551 --> 00:31:18.530
<v Speaker 2>remember looking around and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a sucky life,</v>

677
00:31:18.531 --> 00:31:20.390
<v Speaker 2>what a sucky life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I drive past people.</v>

678
00:31:20.391 --> 00:31:24.950
<v Speaker 2>They're sitting around laughing with no </v>
<v Speaker 2>teeth in hammocks in a shack,</v>

679
00:31:24.951 --> 00:31:26.870
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are they happier than me?</v>

680
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.093
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I gather it's because they're </v>

681
00:31:29.811 --> 00:31:30.800
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

682
00:31:30.801 --> 00:31:33.050
<v Speaker 2>so much of our communication is </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonverbal.</v>

683
00:31:33.051 --> 00:31:33.884
<v Speaker 2>They say like 80 percent of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication is nonverbal and I'm on </v>

684
00:31:35.361 --> 00:31:36.141
<v Speaker 2>here texting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>texting,</v>

685
00:31:36.141 --> 00:31:36.974
<v Speaker 2>texting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing the verbal but you're not </v>

686
00:31:38.061 --> 00:31:39.830
<v Speaker 2>seeing the nonverbal of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're safe.</v>

687
00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:40.664
<v Speaker 2>I'm connected to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or getting oxytocin for making eye </v>

688
00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:43.124
<v Speaker 2>contact and hugging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're communicating more and more </v>

689
00:31:44.781 --> 00:31:45.614
<v Speaker 2>and more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually reaching each other less </v>

690
00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:48.920
<v Speaker 2>and less and less on a chemical or </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurochemical level.</v>

691
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

692
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've got to figure the people that</v>

693
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:51.694
<v Speaker 3>are living in a village or some third </v>
<v Speaker 3>world country or they're living closer </v>

694
00:31:54.701 --> 00:31:58.120
<v Speaker 3>to the land of less electronic </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulation,</v>

695
00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.070
<v Speaker 3>less they're who they are as a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>and where they're living their life is,</v>

696
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.440
<v Speaker 3>is fitting into the world that they live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

697
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:06.503
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like those grooves I've already </v>

698
00:32:07.151 --> 00:32:07.984
<v Speaker 3>been cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's smooth and deep and everything </v>

699
00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:12.130
<v Speaker 3>just slides into place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's been doing it this way for a</v>

700
00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:13.130
<v Speaker 3>long ass time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

701
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.720
<v Speaker 3>When do you start factoring in all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit that we're after dealing with</v>

702
00:32:16.721 --> 00:32:17.554
<v Speaker 3>just with traffic and the sheer number </v>
<v Speaker 3>of humans clogged into this </v>

703
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:22.564
<v Speaker 3>intersection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trying to move forward and </v>

704
00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:27.190
<v Speaker 3>everybody being frustrated and honking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and cutting each other off.</v>

705
00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:28.100
<v Speaker 3>And that is</v>

706
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:34.140
<v Speaker 2>brain doesn't know what a car is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

707
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Like our primordial brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a lion running across,</v>

708
00:32:38.111 --> 00:32:40.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking horror,</v>

709
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like things coming at you </v>

710
00:32:42.531 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're kind of in fight or flight mode</v>

711
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the phone is the sun,</v>

712
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.113
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our brain basically think it's just </v>

713
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:48.973
<v Speaker 2>producing cortisol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're constantly looking into </v>

714
00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:51.944
<v Speaker 2>the sun all day and then we see just </v>
<v Speaker 2>things coming at us in our periphery </v>

715
00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:59.090
<v Speaker 2>constantly and it's depleting and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting us in fight or flight mode,</v>

716
00:32:59.091 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 2>which sets shuts down our frontal lobe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

717
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Which is like our feeling and decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>making sound though.</v>

718
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.920
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember reading this,</v>

719
00:33:05.921 --> 00:33:06.754
<v Speaker 3>but I don't remember what the answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it about the disassociative </v>

720
00:33:09.701 --> 00:33:10.534
<v Speaker 3>aspect of driving in a car that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>people aggressive to other people like </v>

721
00:33:13.631 --> 00:33:17.050
<v Speaker 3>verbally and giving them the finger and </v>
<v Speaker 3>get and the anonymity?</v>

722
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:17.741
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

723
00:33:17.741 --> 00:33:18.574
<v Speaker 3>I remember what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it is is they had concluded that </v>

724
00:33:22.031 --> 00:33:22.864
<v Speaker 3>you're in a heightened state of not </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily fear but reaction time when </v>

725
00:33:27.281 --> 00:33:28.114
<v Speaker 3>you were in a car because you realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are going 65 miles an hour and </v>

726
00:33:30.911 --> 00:33:31.744
<v Speaker 3>everything is happening fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be paying attention to </v>

727
00:33:33.491 --> 00:33:35.620
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in this heightened state,</v>

728
00:33:35.621 --> 00:33:38.020
<v Speaker 3>you're almost in like a heightened </v>
<v Speaker 3>altercation position.</v>

729
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Like you're ready for anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

730
00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:41.230
<v Speaker 3>What do we got?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we got it you.</v>

731
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:42.993
<v Speaker 3>You're ready to go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fucking Dick had just cut me off </v>

732
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.740
<v Speaker 3>like it's everything so ramped up.</v>

733
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.623
<v Speaker 2>But let me ask you a question because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in cars with people who are </v>

734
00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:51.630
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh sorry.</v>

735
00:33:51.631 --> 00:33:53.520
<v Speaker 2>And I've been in cars with people a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little fuck you.</v>

736
00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:57.150
<v Speaker 2>And to me it's like I feel like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>every guy turns it into a sport.</v>

737
00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.593
<v Speaker 3>You can do that if you let it get away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're competing and who's going faster </v>

738
00:34:02.201 --> 00:34:04.270
<v Speaker 3>and that sort of thing like does that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen to you?</v>

739
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.373
<v Speaker 3>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone's a total dick and you start </v>

740
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.530
<v Speaker 3>falling into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always best to think twice.</v>

741
00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:16.480
<v Speaker 3>It's always best just relax and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid because it's not worth.</v>

742
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:20.770
<v Speaker 3>There's no upside on that sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>involvement.</v>

743
00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.560
<v Speaker 3>There's no upside on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>K,</v>

744
00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.040
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

745
00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:25.390
<v Speaker 3>And been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a good idea.</v>

746
00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.300
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no upside.</v>

747
00:34:28.301 --> 00:34:32.770
<v Speaker 3>But the downside is gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actual violence.</v>

748
00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:34.930
<v Speaker 3>Like you could get shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could get stabbed,</v>

749
00:34:34.931 --> 00:34:37.210
<v Speaker 3>you get beat up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone could run you over,</v>

750
00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.193
<v Speaker 3>you could get into some terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>position where you hurt someone and you </v>

751
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.840
<v Speaker 3>have to pay for their medical bills and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their legal bills.</v>

752
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.680
<v Speaker 3>It could be devastating to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there something like,</v>

753
00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:47.523
<v Speaker 3>and you could feel terrible about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that he did it cause you did it in </v>

754
00:34:48.791 --> 00:34:50.800
<v Speaker 3>the heat of passion when you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even thinking straight.</v>

755
00:34:50.801 --> 00:34:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Stupid guys do dumb shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Changes their life.</v>

756
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I was in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

757
00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:00.290
<v Speaker 2>is it called Artesia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a place in California,</v>

758
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.000
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched a guy like two guys tailgating</v>

759
00:35:05.001 --> 00:35:06.200
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing some guy,</v>

760
00:35:06.201 --> 00:35:07.034
<v Speaker 2>fucking got out of his car with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball bat and like came in and they </v>

761
00:35:08.961 --> 00:35:10.640
<v Speaker 2>got in a fight and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to leave.</v>

762
00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:14.680
<v Speaker 3>There's a great video of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guy gets out of his car,</v>

763
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:15.723
<v Speaker 3>pulls a bat out of his car and smashes </v>
<v Speaker 3>other guy's car and the other guy gets </v>

764
00:35:19.211 --> 00:35:20.800
<v Speaker 3>out of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grabs them,</v>

765
00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:23.560
<v Speaker 3>gets them in a rear naked choke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puts them to sleep,</v>

766
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.500
<v Speaker 3>pushes them to the side of the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets in his car and drives off.</v>

767
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.280
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

768
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.133
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying is that I got into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and I know I was texting you about </v>

769
00:35:34.151 --> 00:35:36.280
<v Speaker 3>that calcium storico thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing in Florida,</v>

770
00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>you've got obsessed with that shit.</v>

771
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm I want to make a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying for years,</v>

772
00:35:41.011 --> 00:35:41.844
<v Speaker 2>but I'm obsessed with our need for </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence and if we didn't have violent </v>

773
00:35:47.221 --> 00:35:48.054
<v Speaker 2>sports and competitive sports where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>all just constantly be having baseball </v>

774
00:35:51.961 --> 00:35:53.490
<v Speaker 2>bats in each other's windshield's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

775
00:35:53.491 --> 00:35:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Like we have an inherent need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent.</v>

776
00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:55.944
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do we need to just sort of control </v>

777
00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 2>the reason I'm obsessed with Callisto </v>
<v Speaker 2>Storico,</v>

778
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.320
<v Speaker 2>which if you don't know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about it I think on the job</v>

779
00:36:01.321 --> 00:36:02.154
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like it's bare knuckle boxing </v>

780
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:04.164
<v Speaker 2>football essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the month that they do it in </v>

781
00:36:05.521 --> 00:36:06.354
<v Speaker 2>Florence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's virtually no crime because they </v>

782
00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:11.070
<v Speaker 2>purge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people purge and they get it out and not</v>

783
00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:13.100
<v Speaker 2>healthy ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least in controlled ways,</v>

784
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like are we designed to just be like </v>

785
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:18.870
<v Speaker 2>taking baseball bats to each other's </v>
<v Speaker 2>windshields?</v>

786
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:23.990
<v Speaker 3>I think what it represents is a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>valid release for primal instincts.</v>

787
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:25.284
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've been studying it most of my </v>

788
00:36:27.751 --> 00:36:28.501
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

789
00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:30.780
<v Speaker 3>most of my life I've been paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to martial arts,</v>

790
00:36:30.781 --> 00:36:33.660
<v Speaker 3>studying martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to be.</v>

791
00:36:33.661 --> 00:36:38.661
<v Speaker 3>I'm usually in the woods if I go a whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>day and I don't see someone fight,</v>

792
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I see it every day constantly,</v>

793
00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.310
<v Speaker 3>always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watch more Thai fights every day.</v>

794
00:36:44.311 --> 00:36:46.830
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch a wrestling match or watch a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu match.</v>

795
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:47.664
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly watching these things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I get out of all of it is what </v>

796
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.930
<v Speaker 3>these people were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's doing is,</v>

797
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.360
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're engaging in something incredibly</v>

798
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Speaker 3>difficult and when you engage with </v>
<v Speaker 3>something incredibly difficult,</v>

799
00:36:56.971 --> 00:37:00.930
<v Speaker 3>it's a great way for strong willed </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to find themselves.</v>

800
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.000
<v Speaker 3>They find themselves around this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

801
00:37:03.001 --> 00:37:03.834
<v Speaker 3>but it's you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're finding validation through </v>

802
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:07.890
<v Speaker 3>incredibly difficult acts like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm special.</v>

803
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 3>How do I prove I'm special?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I prove I'm special.</v>

804
00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.573
<v Speaker 3>Like choking out other trained killers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get to a place where I can </v>

805
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:18.450
<v Speaker 3>choke out all the experts like I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>just choking out regular people.</v>

806
00:37:18.451 --> 00:37:20.850
<v Speaker 3>I want to be able to choke out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experts and those guys who do that,</v>

807
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:21.953
<v Speaker 3>they find themselves in the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>exceptional minds and the most </v>

808
00:37:25.501 --> 00:37:26.850
<v Speaker 3>exceptional bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all,</v>

809
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.520
<v Speaker 3>it converges together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot have one without the other,</v>

810
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.593
<v Speaker 2>but it's so recent that were not choking</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other out in the streets all the </v>

811
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:36.870
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like 100 years or something.</v>

812
00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:37.704
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading our that our eyes evolved </v>

813
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.093
<v Speaker 2>to be sunken end because we were getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>punched in the face so much as a </v>

814
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:44.850
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why our eyes are sunken in.</v>

815
00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.380
<v Speaker 2>I swear to fucking God are our fists </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved to do this</v>

816
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.400
<v Speaker 3>so that we could use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps going with all the.</v>

817
00:37:51.401 --> 00:37:52.234
<v Speaker 3>I poked me supervisor get thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would give up like a little bit of </v>

818
00:37:56.231 --> 00:37:58.210
<v Speaker 3>vision to have like poke proof eyes.</v>

819
00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 2>The eyes are made of glass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

820
00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.210
<v Speaker 2>there was so weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

821
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.053
<v Speaker 2>we're pathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so it's so recent that we're not </v>

822
00:38:05.361 --> 00:38:06.194
<v Speaker 2>just constantly fighting each other and </v>
<v Speaker 2>choking each other out in a socially </v>

823
00:38:08.361 --> 00:38:09.194
<v Speaker 2>acceptable way.</v>

824
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:13.340
<v Speaker 3>But here's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I've noticed and everybody has.</v>

825
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's a work in progress.</v>

826
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

827
00:38:15.601 --> 00:38:19.110
<v Speaker 3>you want to judge someone by an argument</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you got with someone 10 years ago.</v>

828
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:23.880
<v Speaker 3>I think that's kind of ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're all capable of weird,</v>

829
00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive behavior and mistakes.</v>

830
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:28.343
<v Speaker 3>But the people that I know that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in martial arts are uniformly </v>

831
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.190
<v Speaker 3>some of the nicest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most peaceful,</v>

832
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 3>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't</v>

833
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 1>think they would be if they didn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

834
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

835
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I would hope not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I know.</v>

836
00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:43.443
<v Speaker 1>But it gives them something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives them a feeling of security and </v>

837
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:50.330
<v Speaker 1>it gives them an understanding of ego </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you lose a lot like the thing.</v>

838
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.453
<v Speaker 1>Most guys don't lose a lot of fights </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't get in a lot of </v>

839
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:55.270
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talk to an average person.</v>

840
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I might've been in my whole life like </v>
<v Speaker 1>street fights,</v>

841
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.070
<v Speaker 1>like three or four ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever really.</v>

842
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:03.963
<v Speaker 1>All my fights I had were in competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your thing is you learn how to avoid </v>

843
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:08.870
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

844
00:39:08.871 --> 00:39:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that drives you to need to do it.</v>

845
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.813
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't my choice like I was avoiding </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights because I was scared of getting </v>

846
00:39:15.431 --> 00:39:16.264
<v Speaker 1>my ass kicked and then I got into </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts completely because I was </v>

847
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:19.864
<v Speaker 1>scared to fight people and I moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>around a lot and I didn't really know </v>

848
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:25.870
<v Speaker 1>what I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point being that this,</v>

849
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.840
<v Speaker 1>this desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you understand,</v>

850
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:28.683
<v Speaker 1>you really know how to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit goes away and you're </v>

851
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:35.590
<v Speaker 1>friendly and you don't have the need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcompensate or prove anything because</v>

852
00:39:35.591 --> 00:39:37.340
<v Speaker 1>you proved it to yourself that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

853
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.063
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I actually felt like I was </v>

854
00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:46.501
<v Speaker 1>funny as a comedian talking into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>net value,</v>

855
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:52.990
<v Speaker 1>that smoking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember there was like 10 comics.</v>

856
00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:55.630
<v Speaker 1>They used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the nineties,</v>

857
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.230
<v Speaker 1>they'll Hashtag your banker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

858
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what I was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

859
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what we're talking about too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

860
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.233
<v Speaker 1>I was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I felt like I was actually </v>

861
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:06.214
<v Speaker 1>funny as a comedian onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped trying to be funny in my real </v>

862
00:40:08.441 --> 00:40:10.510
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't need to be right.</v>

863
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.500
<v Speaker 1>That makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably pretty similar.</v>

864
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably pretty similar for</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

865
00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I think also they get it out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and also they don't have this.</v>

866
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of male and male to male </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction happens just out of fear.</v>

867
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.013
<v Speaker 1>Like guys want the other guy to back </v>
<v Speaker 1>down because they're fucking terrified </v>

868
00:40:24.851 --> 00:40:25.870
<v Speaker 1>that they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to fight,</v>

869
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:26.973
<v Speaker 1>but when people are not afraid of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a terrifying thing to </v>

870
00:40:30.071 --> 00:40:30.460
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

871
00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.740
<v Speaker 1>There's more relaxation and less things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

872
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask you a really weird question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

873
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.830
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal to fight people.</v>

874
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Just in the street in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not in Washington state.</v>

875
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Washington state has something called a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutual combat law.</v>

876
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:46.324
<v Speaker 1>Will cops will actually stand by and </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch people beat the shit out of each </v>

877
00:40:50.171 --> 00:40:51.004
<v Speaker 1>other if they agree to and as long as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know there's no such thing as like </v>

878
00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.930
<v Speaker 1>assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is wild west Shit.</v>

879
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.560
<v Speaker 1>They literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trenton state Seattle in Seattle.</v>

880
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.890
<v Speaker 1>What if it's man versus woman who I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think you can do that.</v>

881
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

882
00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:06.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

883
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:09.330
<v Speaker 1>And what if you're you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that because you're allowed</v>

884
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.530
<v Speaker 1>to see a candle that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although isn't there a thing registering</v>

885
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.393
<v Speaker 1>yourself as web and of that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fighters had to go to town hall </v>

886
00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:20.380
<v Speaker 1>registered my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a human weapon.</v>

887
00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Speaker 1>My hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>

888
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Why have I heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real?</v>

889
00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Because people used to always say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

890
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:28.120
<v Speaker 1>If you're you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to fight the human on</v>

891
00:41:28.121 --> 00:41:29.110
<v Speaker 1>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to jail.</v>

892
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.510
<v Speaker 1>But if I hit someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get like an assault charge.</v>

893
00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody hits someone for no</v>

894
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.843
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to go to jail unless it's </v>

895
00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:39.320
<v Speaker 3>self defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're vandelay Silva and someone</v>

896
00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know it's vandelay Silva and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they go and pick a fight with him and he</v>

897
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:43.484
<v Speaker 3>beats the fuck out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not gonna get in trouble or some </v>

898
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:48.260
<v Speaker 3>sort of proof that these guys were </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting a fight with them.</v>

899
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.183
<v Speaker 3>He's defending himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I attack Ronda Rousey at whole </v>

900
00:41:52.151 --> 00:41:52.984
<v Speaker 3>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she flips you in your breaks my neck </v>

901
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.120
<v Speaker 3>with her finger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can she.</v>

902
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.370
<v Speaker 3>That was self defense 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

903
00:42:04.371 --> 00:42:06.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not our fault that she killed me.</v>

904
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:07.431
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>

905
00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:08.264
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be some crazy black belt in </v>

906
00:42:09.651 --> 00:42:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu who's insane once a </v>
<v Speaker 3>strangle or been lifting,</v>

907
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:15.973
<v Speaker 3>but there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's danger in interaction </v>

908
00:42:17.581 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 3>with new people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can get sued,</v>

909
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:21.703
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could always encounter someone that </v>

910
00:42:22.521 --> 00:42:23.354
<v Speaker 3>knows how to fight.</v>

911
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:24.051
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

912
00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:27.230
<v Speaker 3>when someone touches you or they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing with you are there in your face,</v>

913
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:28.850
<v Speaker 3>you have no idea what they're capable </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

914
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:29.803
<v Speaker 3>They might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're a martial artist that </v>

915
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:34.700
<v Speaker 3>they might be better than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

916
00:42:34.701 --> 00:42:35.534
<v Speaker 3>No one ever knows what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is this crazy idea that somehow or </v>

917
00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:41.540
<v Speaker 3>another you have to have your shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>together to be a fighter.</v>

918
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:42.583
<v Speaker 3>I've known a lot of fucking crazy people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were insane that we're really good </v>

919
00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:49.800
<v Speaker 3>at fighting really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of it though,</v>

920
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:55.120
<v Speaker 3>you have to be lacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not spect approach to or St Pierre isn't</v>

921
00:42:56.030 --> 00:43:01.030
<v Speaker 3>George St Pierre is super present and </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind and a fun guy to talk to.</v>

922
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.060
<v Speaker 3>A sweetheart just ultra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultra competitive.</v>

923
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:05.571
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

924
00:43:05.571 --> 00:43:05.940
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

925
00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.480
<v Speaker 3>He's like adrenaline addiction shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or when.</v>

926
00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:13.490
<v Speaker 3>My point is he's not a mean person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are mean crazy people that are</v>

927
00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:14.780
<v Speaker 3>also really good at fighting.</v>

928
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.203
<v Speaker 3>The idea that only good people are good </v>
<v Speaker 3>at fighting is a ridiculous know that </v>

929
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.833
<v Speaker 3>you have to be always careful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These hands and feet are registered as </v>

930
00:43:24.471 --> 00:43:27.530
<v Speaker 3>deadly weapons in Guam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guam,</v>

931
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Guam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do that at the bottom.</v>

932
00:43:29.661 --> 00:43:30.494
<v Speaker 3>There's a law about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you went to Guam and he </v>

933
00:43:32.811 --> 00:43:33.644
<v Speaker 3>registered karate or judo expert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who thereafter is charged with having </v>

934
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:41.060
<v Speaker 3>used his art in a physical assault on </v>
<v Speaker 3>some other person shall upon conviction.</v>

935
00:43:41.061 --> 00:43:41.894
<v Speaker 3>There have be deemed guilty of </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggravated assault upon conviction </v>

936
00:43:45.381 --> 00:43:49.010
<v Speaker 3>though that's a component that should </v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

937
00:43:49.011 --> 00:43:51.400
<v Speaker 3>I agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have been arrested already.</v>

938
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

939
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.860
<v Speaker 3>What I take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how I interpret that,</v>

940
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:55.723
<v Speaker 3>that if someone like say a Brendan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Schaub decided to pick on some guy who </v>

941
00:44:00.231 --> 00:44:01.064
<v Speaker 3>didn't know how to fight knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy didn't know how to fight and </v>

942
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.010
<v Speaker 3>Brendan would never do that.</v>

943
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:07.430
<v Speaker 3>He's the nicest guy ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but beat the shit out of this person.</v>

944
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.353
<v Speaker 3>They should be charged with like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>extra level of assault because it's not </v>

945
00:44:10.851 --> 00:44:13.160
<v Speaker 3>just a salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like assault with a weapon.</v>

946
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.370
<v Speaker 3>She told me that people come up to him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he'll be like,</v>

947
00:44:16.371 --> 00:44:17.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

948
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.680
<v Speaker 3>I used to fight and he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't say that.</v>

949
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.120
<v Speaker 3>They instigate and sometimes you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to leave DFP ever.</v>

950
00:44:22.121 --> 00:44:22.954
<v Speaker 3>I have people do that where you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to like leave because sometimes </v>

951
00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:25.394
<v Speaker 3>people are delusional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen it happened even to Chuck </v>

952
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.333
<v Speaker 3>Liddell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people come up to him when he </v>

953
00:44:28.821 --> 00:44:30.620
<v Speaker 3>was in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are crazy.</v>

954
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 3>There's always a certain ones</v>

955
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.843
<v Speaker 5>that people who come up to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean as a comic people come up to me </v>

956
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:35.030
<v Speaker 5>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's up?</v>

957
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:36.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to do this,</v>

958
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.310
<v Speaker 5>don't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't do that.</v>

959
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:39.330
<v Speaker 5>To like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey hooker.</v>

960
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:40.980
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't try to be funny.</v>

961
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go well for you practicing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that at home.</v>

962
00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.930
<v Speaker 5>Then when I see her tonight I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at yours.</v>

963
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:49.903
<v Speaker 5>The things people say to me are so like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think by reactions and be </v>

964
00:44:52.841 --> 00:44:53.674
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think I'm going to like crack up </v>

965
00:44:55.351 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 5>laughing and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's my phone number.</v>

966
00:44:56.971 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 5>Like what did you just drop your needs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did you think that was going to go?</v>

967
00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:07.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people also like maybe they have</v>

968
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:07.944
<v Speaker 5>an idea of what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of what will be funny and I think about </v>

969
00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:10.183
<v Speaker 5>a total of 15 seconds before they say </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's shocking and my favorite has been </v>

970
00:45:15.181 --> 00:45:17.600
<v Speaker 5>something that bores you with like a 15 </v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes,</v>

971
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.650
<v Speaker 5>the longest vagina monologue of all </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

972
00:45:19.651 --> 00:45:20.484
<v Speaker 5>Something just like terrible and awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just talk about like traffic and </v>

973
00:45:22.231 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 5>then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can have that one.</v>

974
00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 5>Can I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever notice like,</v>

975
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:31.290
<v Speaker 5>oh no material</v>

976
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.550
<v Speaker 2>or like you're talking to someone super </v>
<v Speaker 2>boring and they're like,</v>

977
00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.050
<v Speaker 2>are you going to put me in your act </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

978
00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.850
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking bombing.</v>

979
00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Say something funny and I'll think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

980
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.130
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the worst.</v>

981
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:42.720
<v Speaker 5>Every guy says that on dates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

982
00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Put it in your act.</v>

983
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

984
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:45.383
<v Speaker 5>Is that a part of the issue?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Guy I'm dating has never seen me to </v>

985
00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:50.820
<v Speaker 5>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm going to do.</v>

986
00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.800
<v Speaker 5>How long you been dating him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eight months.</v>

987
00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:56.350
<v Speaker 5>Keep them that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's kind of a light.</v>

988
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.070
<v Speaker 5>Never goes well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think guys love seeing girls and</v>

989
00:46:00.071 --> 00:46:03.180
<v Speaker 5>like an Alpha stance yelling about </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dick's.</v>

990
00:46:03.181 --> 00:46:08.181
<v Speaker 5>They've sucked in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to separate church and state like</v>

991
00:46:10.321 --> 00:46:11.670
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or do you think that that's delusional?</v>

992
00:46:11.671 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 5>That I can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's delusional at all.</v>

993
00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:15.630
<v Speaker 5>You've done it for eight months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight months.</v>

994
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:19.530
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you do it for eight years?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is as long as I ever want to be in</v>

995
00:46:19.531 --> 00:46:20.440
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

996
00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:22.480
<v Speaker 5>But it seems like it's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

997
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's what makes you comfortable and</v>

998
00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:25.410
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't give a shit.</v>

999
00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:28.680
<v Speaker 5>I think comedy's for strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's for people.</v>

1000
00:46:28.681 --> 00:46:30.600
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My friends were like,</v>

1001
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:31.650
<v Speaker 5>can I come see your show?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

1002
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.120
<v Speaker 5>that's not what it's for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's for complete strangers.</v>

1003
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 5>It's not for people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1004
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.810
<v Speaker 5>you just nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1005
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.900
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're doing standup and someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>who you know really good is in the front</v>

1006
00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:43.734
<v Speaker 5>row,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what are the front row is all your </v>

1007
00:46:44.431 --> 00:46:46.770
<v Speaker 5>family?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't say that.</v>

1008
00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:47.940
<v Speaker 5>I can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't say that.</v>

1009
00:46:47.941 --> 00:46:49.500
<v Speaker 5>It's like I'm doing these shows in La </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>

1010
00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:51.750
<v Speaker 5>why am I doing la shows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's gonna be all people.</v>

1011
00:46:51.751 --> 00:46:52.650
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's like,</v>

1012
00:46:52.651 --> 00:46:53.251
<v Speaker 5>can I come on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1013
00:46:53.251 --> 00:46:54.240
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>

1014
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.493
<v Speaker 5>I'm like doing a complete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you got to tune into everybody </v>

1015
00:46:58.141 --> 00:46:59.430
<v Speaker 5>else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just like,</v>

1016
00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:01.890
<v Speaker 5>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not even thinking about.</v>

1017
00:47:01.891 --> 00:47:05.200
<v Speaker 5>Those are the people they may or may not</v>
<v Speaker 5>be an impediment in,</v>

1018
00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.173
<v Speaker 5>but they're not going to enhance it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to be a part of the </v>

1019
00:47:07.951 --> 00:47:08.784
<v Speaker 5>normal crowd.</v>

1020
00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:09.663
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always thinking in the back of my </v>

1021
00:47:10.571 --> 00:47:11.141
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1022
00:47:11.141 --> 00:47:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that I'm going to hurt their</v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings.</v>

1023
00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:16.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't say anything because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just be like,</v>

1024
00:47:16.181 --> 00:47:17.800
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my fucking crazy family.</v>

1025
00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:18.790
<v Speaker 2>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are we creating?</v>

1026
00:47:18.791 --> 00:47:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm set in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's.</v>

1027
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:20.933
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's such a fucking narcissist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like the worst when you're </v>

1028
00:47:23.201 --> 00:47:24.034
<v Speaker 2>dating someone or whatever it is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like going on and on about like </v>

1029
00:47:25.761 --> 00:47:26.950
<v Speaker 2>in this stupid guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

1030
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:27.940
<v Speaker 2>what's that about me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1031
00:47:27.941 --> 00:47:28.990
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made that up.</v>

1032
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not about anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my friend told me this,</v>

1033
00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:32.143
<v Speaker 2>like everyone just has to like turn your</v>
<v Speaker 2>act into a war shock tests and </v>

1034
00:47:34.841 --> 00:47:37.150
<v Speaker 2>everything's about them and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

1035
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's this unspoken shit that's</v>

1036
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:41.530
<v Speaker 3>going on in your act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's me,</v>

1037
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.530
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking,</v>

1038
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:46.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so ridiculous.</v>

1039
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a problem with you doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>calm.</v>

1040
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You work out or shit on stage.</v>

1041
00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1042
00:47:53.851 --> 00:47:54.684
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because bill bird </v>
<v Speaker 2>number talks about his wife on stage or </v>

1043
00:47:56.071 --> 00:47:56.904
<v Speaker 2>he never talks about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says that she doesn't like when he </v>

1044
00:48:00.751 --> 00:48:02.850
<v Speaker 2>talks about him or when he talks about </v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

1045
00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.800
<v Speaker 2>like she drew a boundary about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think yeah,</v>

1046
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:06.723
<v Speaker 3>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what you're saying makes </v>

1047
00:48:07.581 --> 00:48:10.100
<v Speaker 3>sense to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the actual act of doing it.</v>

1048
00:48:10.101 --> 00:48:12.020
<v Speaker 3>You're doing it for people who don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know you.</v>

1049
00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:13.910
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to do a thing.</v>

1050
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was a stripper,</v>

1051
00:48:15.361 --> 00:48:16.194
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want you to come to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so emotionally revealing and it's </v>

1052
00:48:18.901 --> 00:48:21.270
<v Speaker 2>about vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about like I'm going to talk to you</v>

1053
00:48:21.271 --> 00:48:23.130
<v Speaker 2>for an hour and then never see you </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1054
00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.680
<v Speaker 2>They're completely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a one night stand.</v>

1055
00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.480
<v Speaker 3>But what about songs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like songs the same way too.</v>

1056
00:48:28.481 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Like if you know someone really well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like God damn like,</v>

1057
00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:34.570
<v Speaker 3>do you really want someone to sing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>song for you?</v>

1058
00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:35.853
<v Speaker 2>I went to a wedding where it was two </v>
<v Speaker 2>brides who was lesbian wedding and one </v>

1059
00:48:39.851 --> 00:48:43.510
<v Speaker 2>of them sung to the other person and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to get up and walk away.</v>

1060
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:46.990
<v Speaker 2>So uncomfortable looking in her eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>singing to her.</v>

1061
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I was crouched over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally was.</v>

1062
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I was sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1063
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean I look like fucking the joker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Mega was.</v>

1064
00:48:57.461 --> 00:49:00.100
<v Speaker 2>I was so uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think singing to me.</v>

1065
00:49:00.101 --> 00:49:03.910
<v Speaker 2>I would rather blow you making eye </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact the entire time.</v>

1066
00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:05.413
<v Speaker 2>Then have you seen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will put a gun in my mouth before I </v>

1067
00:49:08.891 --> 00:49:11.200
<v Speaker 2>let someone sing a song to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awful.</v>

1068
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why it.</v>

1069
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.530
<v Speaker 2>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the human condition?</v>

1070
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.630
<v Speaker 2>How can we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a primordial perspective,</v>

1071
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I just am trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

1072
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so embarrassing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if you're a good singer,</v>

1073
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.980
<v Speaker 2>this was a good singer too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That actually made it worse.</v>

1074
00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even if you're a good sandwiches,</v>

1075
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.833
<v Speaker 3>you and this one person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're alone in your kitchen and they </v>

1076
00:49:34.721 --> 00:49:36.310
<v Speaker 3>start looking you in the icing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1077
00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:36.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1078
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.891
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1079
00:49:36.891 --> 00:49:38.990
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut the shit.</v>

1080
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.410
<v Speaker 2>And active aggression really is a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>awkward thing to do.</v>

1081
00:49:42.411 --> 00:49:43.244
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to listen now because making </v>

1082
00:49:44.211 --> 00:49:45.044
<v Speaker 2>eye contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just makes me a guitar and you're </v>

1083
00:49:47.161 --> 00:49:47.994
<v Speaker 2>so comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could look someone in the eye and </v>

1084
00:49:49.021 --> 00:49:49.580
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1085
00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.690
<v Speaker 2>you've got to go around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wrap.</v>

1086
00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Can't do it.</v>

1087
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Like something really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1088
00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:54.844
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would it be 10 songs would sing </v>

1089
00:49:55.751 --> 00:49:56.250
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1090
00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:59.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a Sam Smith Banger or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1091
00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:01.493
<v Speaker 3>maybe some Elliot Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you thinking about sticking the </v>

1092
00:50:03.421 --> 00:50:04.100
<v Speaker 3>knife in your heart?</v>

1093
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1094
00:50:06.291 --> 00:50:07.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

1095
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Because we are designed music releases </v>
<v Speaker 2>endorphins,</v>

1096
00:50:11.151 --> 00:50:11.984
<v Speaker 2>right when we listened to music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's great in a small gathering </v>

1097
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.333
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we don't love on top of each </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

1100
00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I could do it in sunglass sunglasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is</v>

<v Speaker 5>Super Yogi.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1258
01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a heroin addiction,</v>

1259
01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:18.200
<v Speaker 5>a lack of a frontal lobe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no college education,</v>

1260
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.020
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>love of r Kelly holder of the towel,</v>

1261
01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:24.570

1262
01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.553
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But once you hold a towel and a woman </v>

1263
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:32.060
<v Speaker 5>said she was under the spell of a master</v>
<v Speaker 5>manipulator are killer.</v>

1264
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:33.103
<v Speaker 5>After watching that video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I would actually like to </v>

1265
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:37.363
<v Speaker 5>join this call to question if you say </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you were under the spell of a </v>

1266
01:00:40.611 --> 01:00:42.470
<v Speaker 5>master manipulator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But can I ask you a question?</v>

1267
01:00:42.471 --> 01:00:44.600
<v Speaker 5>Why do you need to start a sex cult?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you just get a girlfriend?</v>

1268
01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:45.803
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to sleep with a lot of </v>

1269
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:49.310
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can't you just,</v>

1270
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.710
<v Speaker 5>you're already a musician.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you get to do that anyway?</v>

1271
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.843
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to talk to our.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do not want to speak for the man </v>

1272
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.200
<v Speaker 5>because.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1273
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:58.520
<v Speaker 5>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1274
01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:02.670
<v Speaker 5>you know anyone who I don't really fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1275
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.170
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1276
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:09.220
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's infinity infinity.</v>

1277
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.063
<v Speaker 5>You can't argue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll talk is banging your head against </v>

1278
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:12.704
<v Speaker 5>a brick wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You cannot win a fight with that guy </v>

1279
01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.890
<v Speaker 5>because he just repeats your insults </v>
<v Speaker 5>back to you.</v>

1280
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.823
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he's really running a </v>

1281
01:01:17.361 --> 01:01:19.040
<v Speaker 5>sex cult so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if he is,</v>

1282
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:22.820
<v Speaker 5>why does anybody ever run into any </v>
<v Speaker 5>popstar running a sex cult?</v>

1283
01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:24.950
<v Speaker 5>It's not what being a pop star is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it say here?</v>

1284
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:27.470
<v Speaker 5>This is kitty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gave me your number.</v>

1285
01:01:27.471 --> 01:01:29.390
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>always refer to me as daddy.</v>

1286
01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.900
<v Speaker 5>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not good.</v>

1287
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:38.420
<v Speaker 5>Whatever we say baby during sex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is me,</v>

1288
01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:44.180
<v Speaker 5>but it does make sense that if that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>your kid though,</v>

1289
01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:46.330
<v Speaker 5>you'd be freaking the fuck out your kids</v>
<v Speaker 5>in art.</v>

1290
01:01:46.331 --> 01:01:47.164
<v Speaker 5>Kelly's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They strike me as someone who fights </v>

1291
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:52.160
<v Speaker 5>with a women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not into it.</v>

1292
01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't like fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's fun.</v>

1293
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:57.680
<v Speaker 5>It's not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of the time that's the point.</v>

1294
01:01:57.681 --> 01:01:58.514
<v Speaker 5>It's not necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I no longer have the need to have those </v>

1295
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.100
<v Speaker 5>chaotic arguments and people disagree </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

1296
01:02:04.101 --> 01:02:04.934
<v Speaker 5>I've had a pretty heated arguments with </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of my best friends and sometimes </v>

1297
01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.550
<v Speaker 5>over ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1298
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:10.573
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the same with </v>

1299
01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:11.894
<v Speaker 5>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she'd never say something in a </v>

1300
01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:14.780
<v Speaker 5>relationship.</v>

1301
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.660
<v Speaker 5>Like people say things in relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel that they would never say to your</v>

1302
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:21.210
<v Speaker 5>best friend like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very rare.</v>

1303
01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:25.140
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting that you would like </v>
<v Speaker 5>say something to your best friend.</v>

1304
01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.620
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a hurtful thing without her.</v>

1305
01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean at least me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it.</v>

1306
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.493
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hurt my best friends </v>

1307
01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:33.423
<v Speaker 5>from when I had good friends there </v>
<v Speaker 5>acting a fool and it's like I have to </v>

1308
01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:36.804
<v Speaker 5>say this uncomfortable thing and protect</v>
<v Speaker 5>you from yourself because what you're </v>

1309
01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:42.270
<v Speaker 5>doing is stupid or dangerous and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>like most men agree with that.</v>

1310
01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:46.710
<v Speaker 5>But most men that I've talked to about </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights with their wives,</v>

1311
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:50.730
<v Speaker 5>a lot of guys have told me that shit can</v>
<v Speaker 5>get really ugly and you start like going</v>

1312
01:02:50.731 --> 01:02:51.564
<v Speaker 5>after the things that you know we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to hurt the other person's </v>

1313
01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:54.720
<v Speaker 5>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like woo.</v>

1314
01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.670
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you do that with your friends?</v>

1315
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:57.504
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1316
01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.860
<v Speaker 5>don't do that with my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the whole point.</v>

1317
01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.250
<v Speaker 5>But a friend is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to have weird,</v>

1318
01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 5>acrimonious things with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1319
01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:05.090
<v Speaker 5>this doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1320
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:07.100
<v Speaker 5>if I'm not fucking you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not fighting with you.</v>

1321
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.230
<v Speaker 5>Friends should be safe place should it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you know,</v>

1322
01:03:10.231 --> 01:03:12.030
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I see a lot of friends of mine.</v>

1323
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:16.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm going down in a blaze of glory on </v>
<v Speaker 5>instagram with their crazy.</v>

1324
01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.533
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever lived?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've lost some friends to insert like </v>

1325
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:23.610
<v Speaker 5>oak trees are falling every day with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1326
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.060
<v Speaker 5>just losing their minds with their </v>
<v Speaker 5>documenting every last thing.</v>

1327
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.280
<v Speaker 5>And I've done a couple of interventions </v>
<v Speaker 5>where I'm like,</v>

1328
01:03:29.281 --> 01:03:31.380
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're starting to look crazy.</v>

1329
01:03:31.381 --> 01:03:34.140
<v Speaker 5>And it never goes well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trying to help.</v>

1330
01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:37.200
<v Speaker 5>Trying to just hold a mirror up.</v>

1331
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:40.020
<v Speaker 5>You're starting to look bad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta take your kids off.</v>

1332
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.960
<v Speaker 5>You can't be filming them and saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>their name and saying where they live.</v>

1333
01:03:42.961 --> 01:03:44.310
<v Speaker 5>It's just dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1334
01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:47.670
<v Speaker 5>I run someone to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would tell me if I was going crazy.</v>

1335
01:03:47.671 --> 01:03:48.420
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1336
01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.253
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>get addicted to the idea of posting </v>

1337
01:03:51.451 --> 01:03:54.690
<v Speaker 5>things that are getting the feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 5>feedback.</v>

1338
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.110
<v Speaker 5>There's some sort of a weird serotonin </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that comes from.</v>

1339
01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:57.963
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

1340
01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:58.951
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>

1341
01:03:58.951 --> 01:04:02.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like rats with the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the skinner box and that.</v>

1342
01:04:02.251 --> 01:04:05.370
<v Speaker 5>Just like Pavlovian response.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was at instagram the other day.</v>

1343
01:04:05.371 --> 01:04:08.520
<v Speaker 5>They said the average instagram user </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes to instagram 35 times a day.</v>

1344
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:10.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>30 five times a day.</v>

1345
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:13.530
<v Speaker 5>That's more than once an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's nice to know that my average.</v>

1346
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.720
<v Speaker 5>Do you think you go that often?</v>

1347
01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.793
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm probably close to five times in a </v>

1348
01:04:20.521 --> 01:04:23.930
<v Speaker 5>row and then not for like a couple hours</v>
<v Speaker 5>I follow a bunch of,</v>

1349
01:04:23.931 --> 01:04:25.000
<v Speaker 5>like really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1350
01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.380
<v Speaker 5>nature ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1351

<v Speaker 5>popping and that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>push down and it comes out.</v>

1359
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:41.243
<v Speaker 5>Why is that so satisfying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because as humans we're designed to </v>

1360
01:04:44.101 --> 01:04:44.934
<v Speaker 5>groom each other because before </v>
<v Speaker 5>antibacterial soap and fucking purell </v>

<v Speaker 5>but he lets me do it because he knows </v>

1371
01:05:07.351 --> 01:05:09.120
<v Speaker 5>how and I tweeze eyebrows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what is it?</v>

1372
01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:12.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like a monkey thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think like grooming and everything?</v>

1373
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when we're watching Dr Pimple popper,</v>

1374
01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 5>lance the zits and pus endorphins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like little</v>

1375
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 4>mini orgasms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's unapologetic with it to doctor.</v>

1376
01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.880
<v Speaker 4>She actually loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love.</v>

1377
01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:25.714
<v Speaker 4>I go on planes and go in and I squeeze </v>
<v Speaker 4>my and then stuff comes out of every </v>

1378
01:05:30.911 --> 01:05:32.710
<v Speaker 4>pore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it so much.</v>

1379
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:33.873
<v Speaker 4>It's the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go on planes and squeeze one off and it </v>

1380
01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:36.730
<v Speaker 4>hits the Mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1381
01:05:36.731 --> 01:05:38.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't have the ones that like are </v>
<v Speaker 4>projectile.</v>

1382
01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.520
<v Speaker 4>I wish I did glad I had those in high </v>
<v Speaker 4>school or something in every one of your</v>

1383
01:05:42.521 --> 01:05:45.040
<v Speaker 4>fucking little pores and if you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like squeeze your skin,</v>

1384
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:47.450
<v Speaker 4>it'll come out all at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Lauren.</v>

1385
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.610
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And look for it.</v>

1386
01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:49.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the high school used to get those </v>

1387
01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:53.120
<v Speaker 1>volcanoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that like you'd be walking around.</v>

1388
01:05:53.121 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>It was like this white bubble.</v>

1389
01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.470
<v Speaker 4>I used to have to get cortisone shots </v>
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>

1390
01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.810
<v Speaker 4>I used to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1391
01:05:58.811 --> 01:06:00.320
<v Speaker 4>like when I got my period they would </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

1392
01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.273
<v Speaker 4>You'd feel them and they'd like Hertz </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you like can't even sleep on that </v>

1393
01:06:04.131 --> 01:06:06.440
<v Speaker 4>and then you'd have to wait four weeks </v>
<v Speaker 4>for them to surface.</v>

1394
01:06:06.441 --> 01:06:07.140
<v Speaker 4>So I would get a quarter</v>

1395
01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>in Brighton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The time when you're most vulnerable and</v>

1396
01:06:09.561 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 1>confused as a teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1397
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:12.343
<v Speaker 1>Your body starts to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little basis for having acne as a </v>

1398
01:06:14.811 --> 01:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hormonal thing,</v>

1399
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:17.823
<v Speaker 1>sort of a reaction and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different ways to </v>

1400
01:06:19.761 --> 01:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>mitigate it and a lot of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These medications are really heavy.</v>

1401
01:06:22.731 --> 01:06:23.140
<v Speaker 1>They drive it.</v>

1402
01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:23.980
<v Speaker 4>I took,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1403
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:25.810
<v Speaker 4>I took acutane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1404
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:29.380
<v Speaker 4>I took acutane twice because I mean or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1405
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.693
<v Speaker 4>I mean you met me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think the layman on the </v>

1406
01:06:33.491 --> 01:06:34.210
<v Speaker 4>accutane?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1407
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:36.190
<v Speaker 4>but there was this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you take it,</v>

1408
01:06:36.191 --> 01:06:37.024
<v Speaker 4>you have to take birth control </v>
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously because you have to </v>

1409
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:41.560
<v Speaker 4>because it causes birth defects and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fetuses.</v>

1410
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:43.270
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this causes birth defects,</v>

1411
01:06:43.271 --> 01:06:44.104
<v Speaker 4>maybe I shouldn't be putting it in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>bloodstream and the side effects are so </v>

1412
01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:49.960
<v Speaker 4>gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm suicidal.</v>

1413
01:06:49.961 --> 01:06:51.520
<v Speaker 4>You have to sign this form saying this </v>
<v Speaker 4>could.</v>

1414
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.160
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

1415
01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.500
<v Speaker 4>Drove you to suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like anal bleeding is one of them.</v>

1416
01:06:57.350 --> 01:07:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Hey waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're giving that to a 14 year old.</v>

1417
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:04.780
<v Speaker 4>My skin started flaking off in like </v>
<v Speaker 4>croissant,</v>

1418
01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 4>like pastry sheets and my lips were like</v>
<v Speaker 4>bleeding.</v>

1419
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:09.634
<v Speaker 4>It was a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your eyes start itching and drawing out </v>

1420
01:07:11.171 --> 01:07:12.730
<v Speaker 4>like this isn't ready for the market.</v>

1421
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:15.270
<v Speaker 4>Don't release this product yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a thing now.</v>

1422
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.410
<v Speaker 4>Was it possibly like you took too much </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

1423
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.610
<v Speaker 4>You're on it for six months and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>

1424
01:07:19.611 --> 01:07:20.201
<v Speaker 4>It varies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:07:20.201 --> 01:07:23.470
<v Speaker 4>Dries your skin out or like a hair </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts falling out,</v>

1426
01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:25.310
<v Speaker 4>but my skin cleared up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1427
01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.850
<v Speaker 4>that's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Behavioral effects as well.</v>

1428
01:07:27.851 --> 01:07:28.550
<v Speaker 4>Or Am I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1429
01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:29.291
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they said it's a,</v>

1430
01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:30.400
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's my thing,</v>

1431
01:07:30.401 --> 01:07:34.390
<v Speaker 4>it says increases your risk of suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Christ.</v>

1432
01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:36.910
<v Speaker 4>But when you're a teenager having bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>skin,</v>

1433
01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.770
<v Speaker 4>it's like a chicken or an egg thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1434
01:07:38.771 --> 01:07:40.660
<v Speaker 4>because all you want to do is fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm always like,</v>

1435
01:07:40.661 --> 01:07:42.400
<v Speaker 4>was it the accutane or was it the bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>scan?</v>

1436
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:44.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're arguing.</v>

1437
01:07:44.471 --> 01:07:45.304
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you ever let your kids go on </v>

1438
01:07:46.211 --> 01:07:46.720
<v Speaker 4>accutane?</v>

1439
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.360
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1440
01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what,</v>

1441
01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:54.750
<v Speaker 1>what natural alternatives there are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wonder if anything has to do with</v>

1442
01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:58.290
<v Speaker 1>the amount of probiotics you'd take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if anything it has to do.</v>

1443
01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Any of it can be mitigated with oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>glands.</v>

1444
01:08:00.691 --> 01:08:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's genetic.</v>

1445
01:08:01.921 --> 01:08:04.170
<v Speaker 1>There's not a ton you can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is that the case?</v>

1446
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Does the genes express themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same way?</v>

1447
01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Dependent upon environmental stress?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1448
01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.920
<v Speaker 1>the amount of nutrition and you take in.</v>

1449
01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're a coil plants.</v>

1450
01:08:14.851 --> 01:08:15.260
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1451
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 4>Can you shrink</v>

1452
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:17.930
<v Speaker 5>or grow oil glands based on Diet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1453
01:08:17.931 --> 01:08:19.130
<v Speaker 5>but it's not uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1454
01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:21.240
<v Speaker 5>So there's only a few in certain places </v>
<v Speaker 5>like why,</v>

1455
01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 5>why do they want it's variable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have oil glands and large pores.</v>

1456
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:26.803
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not all your pores get </v>

1457
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:28.221
<v Speaker 5>infected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1458
01:08:28.221 --> 01:08:30.380
<v Speaker 5>So some of them do like why are they </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting infected?</v>

1459
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:33.260
<v Speaker 5>How much of that could be dietary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much of that can be changed?</v>

1460
01:08:33.261 --> 01:08:35.360
<v Speaker 5>Like what if you cut out dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows?</v>

1461
01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.003
<v Speaker 5>There's probably a lot of things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are causing issues from what I gathered </v>

1462
01:08:41.601 --> 01:08:42.434
<v Speaker 5>and this could just be all of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dermatologists trying to prescribe me </v>

1463
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:46.510
<v Speaker 5>more stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of it is genetic diet.</v>

1464
01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:47.373
<v Speaker 5>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if it can be mitigated with </v>

1465
01:08:48.981 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 5>diet or wonder if maybe poor diet </v>
<v Speaker 5>exacerbates it.</v>

1466
01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:52.970
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1467
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 5>probably it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just guessing,</v>

1468
01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:58.480
<v Speaker 5>but I just wonder if medication can do </v>
<v Speaker 5>something for you to.</v>

1469
01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.353
<v Speaker 5>Maybe there's another way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to handle it in some sort of a more all </v>

1470
01:09:02.091 --> 01:09:02.924
<v Speaker 5>encompassing way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Deep systemic ones like that is just </v>

1471
01:09:05.661 --> 01:09:06.351
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that is.</v>

1472
01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:07.184
<v Speaker 5>So those are the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think it's probably a hormonal </v>

1473
01:09:08.961 --> 01:09:09.794
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like can you control your hormones with </v>

1474
01:09:11.091 --> 01:09:12.080
<v Speaker 5>diet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I doubt it,</v>

1475
01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it enhances,</v>

1476
01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:14.963
<v Speaker 5>it enhances your body's ability to </v>
<v Speaker 5>produce hormones if you eat the right </v>

1477
01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:19.240
<v Speaker 5>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

1478
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:20.990
<v Speaker 5>I wonder like as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1479
01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.380
<v Speaker 5>you're in such a state of flux and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>might actually be,</v>

1480
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:25.214
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if there's some biological </v>
<v Speaker 5>basis for like the Darwinism of having </v>

1481
01:09:28.221 --> 01:09:31.040
<v Speaker 5>really bad skin and overcoming it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1482
01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:31.874
<v Speaker 5>like what is the point of that in terms </v>
<v Speaker 5>of your pecking order in the tribe of </v>

1483
01:09:35.241 --> 01:09:36.074
<v Speaker 5>like having some kind of stigma and </v>
<v Speaker 5>overcoming it and if you're a bit more </v>

1484
01:09:38.271 --> 01:09:39.104
<v Speaker 5>of a bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1485
01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:42.190
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting article.</v>

1486
01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't Miss Scientific American or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that,</v>

1487
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:48.140
<v Speaker 5>that people who had acne,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our over performers in life because they</v>

1488
01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:50.330
<v Speaker 5>had to overcompensate and overcome </v>
<v Speaker 5>adversity.</v>

1489
01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:51.670
<v Speaker 5>The adversity overcome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1490
01:09:51.671 --> 01:09:54.680
<v Speaker 5>Like the more resilient you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1491
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:55.603
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just like something about you </v>

1492
01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.570
<v Speaker 5>completely partners.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that funny how something will come</v>

1493
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:02.000
<v Speaker 5>up and it seems completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>contradictory.</v>

1494
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:03.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you stop and look at it and you go,</v>

1495
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.850
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1496
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.770
<v Speaker 5>They had to try harder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they got stronger.</v>

1497
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:09.200
<v Speaker 5>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's tracing the people who had acne,</v>

1498
01:10:09.201 --> 01:10:10.034
<v Speaker 5>who weren't successful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one's following them and they don't </v>

1499
01:10:11.751 --> 01:10:12.890
<v Speaker 5>know about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1500
01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:15.320
<v Speaker 5>But is there a disproportion amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people with acne that's succeed?</v>

1501
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:20.090
<v Speaker 5>Apparently it was some study about like </v>
<v Speaker 5>a ton of people who say,</v>

1502
01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:21.680
<v Speaker 5>I was a Dork in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had acne,</v>

1503
01:10:21.681 --> 01:10:22.514
<v Speaker 5>I was a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they're like ceos of companies </v>

1504
01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:25.910
<v Speaker 5>or performance or entertaining like Bill</v>
<v Speaker 5>Murray,</v>

1505
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:27.380
<v Speaker 5>you become funny.</v>

1506
01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.213
<v Speaker 5>You sort of have to develop some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>personality to fit in because you're so </v>

1507
01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:34.890
<v Speaker 5>stigmatized.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That line of thinking is a real similar.</v>

1508
01:10:34.891 --> 01:10:39.830
<v Speaker 5>It's similarly criticized to the line of</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking that they use in like the movie</v>

1509
01:10:39.831 --> 01:10:41.240
<v Speaker 5>the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>

1510
01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:43.360
<v Speaker 5>I was just talking about the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1511
01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.273
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem with that thing is not that </v>

1512
01:10:46.071 --> 01:10:47.960
<v Speaker 5>the law of attraction isn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not if that.</v>

1513
01:10:47.961 --> 01:10:50.420
<v Speaker 5>If you don't focus on something and put </v>
<v Speaker 5>your energy towards something,</v>

1514
01:10:50.421 --> 01:10:52.970
<v Speaker 5>you're more likely to achieve it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then if you don't focus on those things.</v>

1515
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.863
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is you're only looking </v>

1516
01:10:54.981 --> 01:10:56.330
<v Speaker 5>at winters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1517
01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:00.200
<v Speaker 5>You're only looking at people who </v>
<v Speaker 5>focused on following the losers.</v>

1518
01:11:00.201 --> 01:11:03.110
<v Speaker 5>There's so many of those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you just go over 300 million people,</v>

1519
01:11:03.111 --> 01:11:05.660
<v Speaker 5>it's easy to find a few thousand super </v>
<v Speaker 5>winters like those people.</v>

1520
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.943
<v Speaker 5>You find them and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what made you so successful and they </v>

1521
01:11:08.751 --> 01:11:09.870
<v Speaker 5>will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1522
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:14.280
<v Speaker 5>I use the power of the law of attraction</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I wrote things and I had a vision</v>

1523
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 3>board and I went towards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you also like took all the necessary</v>

1524
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:19.164
<v Speaker 3>steps to make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also were very disciplined and work </v>

1525
01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:22.404
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some people don't and you also </v>

1526
01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:25.970
<v Speaker 3>thought it through correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1527
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.960
<v Speaker 3>There's a puzzle in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You solved it.</v>

1528
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden I'm the CEO of Exxon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I started apple.</v>

1529
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:34.290
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to figure that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing out.</v>

1530
01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:35.124
<v Speaker 3>Just because you made it there doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean you have like a valid roadmap that </v>

1531
01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:42.720
<v Speaker 3>anyone can use and just think positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and think about the future and make a,</v>

1532
01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of vision map.</v>

1533
01:11:44.161 --> 01:11:45.540
<v Speaker 3>But it's definitely going to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1534
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.330
<v Speaker 3>you have to do all the right things to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not going to be easy.</v>

1535
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:49.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people are going</v>

1536
01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.373
<v Speaker 4>quit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they kind of person who goes to buy </v>

1537
01:11:51.671 --> 01:11:52.504
<v Speaker 4>the secret,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes a vision board is probably the </v>

1538
01:11:53.561 --> 01:11:56.050
<v Speaker 4>same person who's going to do all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right things hopefully.</v>

1539
01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:56.430
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1540
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:57.263
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of people that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>try a new thing like that and they sort </v>

1541
01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:01.650
<v Speaker 3>of start them out and then they bail on </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1542
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 3>And I used to do that for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

1543
01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:05.994
<v Speaker 3>I did that for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get like those anthony robins </v>

1544
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:08.783
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>

1545
01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.570
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember Zig Ziglar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he ever listen to that guy?</v>

1546
01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:14.220
<v Speaker 4>He was like one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a rich one though,</v>

1547
01:12:14.221 --> 01:12:15.054
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like dreaming and become rich or </v>

1548
01:12:16.261 --> 01:12:19.500
<v Speaker 4>some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know how to influence people.</v>

1549
01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:22.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zig Ziglar.</v>

1550
01:12:22.111 --> 01:12:24.630
<v Speaker 4>He was like something positive thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

1551
01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:27.510
<v Speaker 4>I know it sounds like a English pop </v>
<v Speaker 4>star,</v>

1552
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.030
<v Speaker 4>but you mean you would start?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait.</v>

1553
01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:32.120
<v Speaker 4>So you would start these inspirational </v>
<v Speaker 4>start these programs.</v>

1554
01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Stop fucking bail on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1555
01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.113
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never completely discipline myself </v>

1556
01:12:37.281 --> 01:12:39.800
<v Speaker 3>with any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sort of self help program.</v>

1557
01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.570
<v Speaker 3>I would start them out and then I'd bail</v>
<v Speaker 3>on him.</v>

1558
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like everybody has a different.</v>

1559
01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:44.061
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1560
01:12:44.061 --> 01:12:46.790
<v Speaker 4>do you feel like your training is kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that now?</v>

1561
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think even then like it was just a</v>

1562
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:54.830
<v Speaker 3>matter of me just developing as a person</v>
<v Speaker 3>and being able to understand the process</v>

1563
01:12:56.401 --> 01:12:58.680
<v Speaker 3>of disciplining myself better because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1564
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I was never very disciplined when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger.</v>

1565
01:13:00.841 --> 01:13:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I would just get obsessed with things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would do them because that's all I</v>

1566
01:13:03.661 --> 01:13:04.494
<v Speaker 3>wanted to do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it never felt like discipline </v>

1567
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 3>because it felt like this was something </v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to do.</v>

1568
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:09.143
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>productivity incorporation makes </v>

1569
01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:10.770
<v Speaker 3>dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1570
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.060
<v Speaker 3>So I had to learn after the fact how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be disciplined.</v>

1571
01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Discipline is doing a bunch of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it.</v>

1572
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:20.020
<v Speaker 4>You strike me as.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean one of the most disciplined.</v>

1573
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're certainly one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>people I know.</v>

1574
01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.790
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More disciplined people than me.</v>

1575
01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:25.571
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1576
01:13:25.571 --> 01:13:26.650
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1577
01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.633
<v Speaker 3>My friend Cameron Hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talk about them too much on the </v>

1578
01:13:29.111 --> 01:13:30.340
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People thinking we're gay for you.</v>

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy who taught me at a bow hunt</v>

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.533
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking savage and I think </v>

1587
01:13:53.641 --> 01:13:57.210
<v Speaker 4>there's something to be said though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm pretty disciplined,</v>

1588
01:13:57.211 --> 01:13:59.460
<v Speaker 4>but I think my next step is to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

1589
01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.473
<v Speaker 4>Let things be sloppy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wake up and don't know where you're </v>

1590
01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:05.340
<v Speaker 4>going to fucking do because I am just so</v>
<v Speaker 4>attached to a rigid control.</v>

1591

<v Speaker 4>Well here's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a comic that fuck off instinct is a </v>

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:13.053
<v Speaker 1>fuck off is where the ideas come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I only feel like I can do that </v>

1594
01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:16.840
<v Speaker 1>onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He doesn't care.</v>

1598
01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:26.650
<v Speaker 1>He's training for something called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moab to 40,</v>

1599
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.830
<v Speaker 1>where it's 238 miles of running and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>run them through the.</v>

1600
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that takes more than three days?</v>

1601
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes more than three days.</v>

1602
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:37.571
<v Speaker 1>He did two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1603
01:14:37.571 --> 01:14:39.340
<v Speaker 1>five already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he run in sneakers?</v>

1604
01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Under armour runs in these things called</v>

1605
01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:42.844
<v Speaker 1>fat tires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got like a good amount of </v>

1606
01:14:43.691 --> 01:14:45.700
<v Speaker 1>cushioning to them because the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding,</v>

1607
01:14:45.701 --> 01:14:47.890
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of constantly do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likes it that way.</v>

1608
01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.053
<v Speaker 1>It's just like he's talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to extreme volume of </v>

1609
01:14:52.151 --> 01:14:55.120
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just insane or just.</v>

1610
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.013
<v Speaker 1>That can't be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fine running on pavement and he's </v>

1611
01:14:57.730 --> 01:14:59.280
<v Speaker 1>running on sometimes runs on pavements.</v>

1612
01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.113
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he runs on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he'll run early in the morning </v>

1613
01:15:01.481 --> 01:15:02.850
<v Speaker 1>near his house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1614
01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.720
<v Speaker 1>but like this is the lab two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1615
01:15:04.721 --> 01:15:07.720
<v Speaker 1>five to 2:30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two 40.</v>

1616
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:12.750
<v Speaker 1>We'll have 240.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it called the 2:40.</v>

1617
01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I think they changed it to the to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were calling it the $200.</v>

1618
01:15:15.671 --> 01:15:19.810
<v Speaker 1>You get paid what is the question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look at the fucking scenery and look</v>

1619
01:15:19.811 --> 01:15:21.960
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you slip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking down,</v>

1620
01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:25.630
<v Speaker 1>you're not enjoying this.</v>

1623
01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:31.390
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1624
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:34.480
<v Speaker 1>there will be no trump care that gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>you out of that crevice in between those</v>

1625
01:15:34.481 --> 01:15:35.860
<v Speaker 1>rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

1626
01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:40.120
<v Speaker 1>and this is for four days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than three days.</v>

1627
01:15:40.121 --> 01:15:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stop and eat.</v>

1628
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stopped.</v>

1629
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:46.370
<v Speaker 1>They get like a snack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a but the strongest after ours,</v>

1630
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 1>they keep running.</v>

1631
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:49.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many runners?</v>

1632
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

1633
01:15:51.311 --> 01:15:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I think he said a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Entered the 200.</v>

1634
01:15:55.031 --> 01:15:58.000
<v Speaker 1>The big $200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said 45 completed it.</v>

1635
01:15:58.001 --> 01:15:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I think those are the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

1636
01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:00.430
<v Speaker 1>40th five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Complete.</v>

1637
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And what is the main element of someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that completes this?</v>

1638
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Is it mental or physical?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mental.</v>

1639
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:09.520
<v Speaker 1>It's mental tenacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because first of all,</v>

1640
01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:12.970
<v Speaker 1>the physical is involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you certainly have to be physically</v>

1641
01:16:12.971 --> 01:16:13.804
<v Speaker 1>tough to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the physical toughness is most of </v>

1642
01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:19.080
<v Speaker 1>the time dictated by your mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>toughness.</v>

1643
01:16:19.081 --> 01:16:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Like the navy seals that make it are </v>
<v Speaker 1>never the biggest or the strongest.</v>

1644
01:16:21.461 --> 01:16:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always like,</v>

1645
01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:25.850
<v Speaker 1>you know David Goggins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ultra marathon runner,</v>

1646
01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:29.470
<v Speaker 1>navy seal character who's like a famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ultra marathon athlete.</v>

1647
01:16:29.471 --> 01:16:34.170
<v Speaker 1>He always says that people quit at 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent and that yeah,</v>

1648
01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.070
<v Speaker 1>most people quit at 40 percent.</v>

1649
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Forty percent of the kids probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place where you get to go.</v>

1650
01:16:38.441 --> 01:16:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fail.</v>

1651
01:16:39.491 --> 01:16:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I stopped when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1652
01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>you get to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this anymore.</v>

1653
01:16:42.161 --> 01:16:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I gotta stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta stop.</v>

1654
01:16:43.121 --> 01:16:43.954
<v Speaker 1>I gotta stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's 40 percent of what you're </v>

1655
01:16:45.041 --> 01:16:47.430
<v Speaker 1>actually capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where does mental toughness?</v>

1656
01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean it comes from adversity at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>young age,</v>

1657
01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And overcome Ken,</v>

1658
01:16:50.771 --> 01:16:52.510
<v Speaker 1>but there's no recipe for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1659
01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:56.290
<v Speaker 1>You could decide that you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a pussy at 18.</v>

1660
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:57.403
<v Speaker 1>I just started doing Jujitsu and become </v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the hardest trainers in the </v>

1661
01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:00.844
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You escalate who you are and who you </v>

1662
01:17:01.811 --> 01:17:03.910
<v Speaker 1>become and become some world champions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu burst.</v>

1663
01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.610
<v Speaker 1>It's been done a bunch of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a bunch of different guys.</v>

1664
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>A lot of like worlds Jujitsu Champs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of Nerdy,</v>

1665
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Geeky book type characters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really amazing.</v>

1666
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

1667
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:15.400
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they become these like</v>

1668
01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.600
<v Speaker 2>when you are studying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is like you.</v>

1669
01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:22.130
<v Speaker 2>It's so precise and it's like the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's geometry and math kind.</v>

1670
01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 2>The nerd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1671
01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.560
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely an equation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1672
01:17:25.561 --> 01:17:27.900
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interactive equation going on,</v>

1673
01:17:27.930 --> 01:17:28.763
<v Speaker 3>but it's also incredibly physical so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get away with all the physical anxiety </v>

1674
01:17:32.311 --> 01:17:34.140
<v Speaker 3>and all the bullshit that most people </v>
<v Speaker 3>carry around with them.</v>

1675
01:17:34.141 --> 01:17:36.270
<v Speaker 3>You talk to people like after training </v>
<v Speaker 3>or after class,</v>

1676
01:17:36.271 --> 01:17:40.080
<v Speaker 3>everybody like so chilled out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so relaxed because they just went to war</v>

1677
01:17:40.081 --> 01:17:43.190
<v Speaker 3>for an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's like so chill and afterwards</v>

1678
01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:44.820
<v Speaker 3>I like the funnest guys to hang out </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1679
01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:45.683
<v Speaker 3>Go to dinner and laugh and joke around </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what happens if those people don't </v>

1680
01:17:48.571 --> 01:17:49.404
<v Speaker 3>do it for a month?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get itchy every time you get </v>

1681
01:17:51.451 --> 01:17:52.284
<v Speaker 3>injured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys get injured again because </v>

1682
01:17:54.361 --> 01:17:56.730
<v Speaker 3>they'll get a surgery and then go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>quick.</v>

1683
01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Super common</v>

1684
01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.310
<v Speaker 2>because they need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want to do it.</v>

1685
01:18:00.311 --> 01:18:01.144
<v Speaker 2>You miss it so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you go without doing standup before </v>

1686
01:18:02.801 --> 01:18:05.440
<v Speaker 2>you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like doing bits for your wife?</v>

1687
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:08.650
<v Speaker 3>I never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd never tolerated.</v>

1688
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:11.830
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could probably go.</v>

1689
01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gone a month.</v>

1690
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:14.303
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't do that for as long as </v>

1691
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:17.880
<v Speaker 3>you've gone since you started?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1692
01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1693
01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:21.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a long time ago.</v>

1694
01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:24.400
<v Speaker 3>I just did it because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I moved in,</v>

1695
01:18:24.401 --> 01:18:25.234
<v Speaker 3>I settled into new place and I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a lot of stuff for the UFC when I </v>

1696
01:18:30.591 --> 01:18:32.980
<v Speaker 3>was traveling a lot and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1697
01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:34.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to just do nothing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them</v>

1698
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.380
<v Speaker 2>doing ufc stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get so fascinated by the,</v>

1699
01:18:37.381 --> 01:18:41.390
<v Speaker 2>like our need for visibility and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much do I need and whereas this shit</v>

1700
01:18:41.391 --> 01:18:45.770
<v Speaker 2>coming from and do I exist if I'm not on</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I need to work on that thing.</v>

1701
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Do we exist when we're not fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>documented?</v>

1702
01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:49.693
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I sort of took some time off of </v>

1703
01:18:51.021 --> 01:18:52.880
<v Speaker 2>being on TV and stuff and then I started</v>
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>

1704
01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:54.050
<v Speaker 2>do I still exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anyone,</v>

1705
01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:54.913
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because I wasn't seeing a lot as a </v>

1706
01:18:56.211 --> 01:18:59.100
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like doing ufc where you're,</v>

1707
01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.710
<v Speaker 2>you're being heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being seen,</v>

1708
01:19:00.711 --> 01:19:02.800
<v Speaker 2>you're valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love you,</v>

1709
01:19:02.801 --> 01:19:03.634
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the same reward centers in your </v>

1710
01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:07.360
<v Speaker 2>brain is performing stands?</v>

1711
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:08.151
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1712
01:19:08.151 --> 01:19:09.590
<v Speaker 3>it's totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1713
01:19:09.591 --> 01:19:10.424
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a representative when I'm doing the </v>

1714
01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:16.670
<v Speaker 3>UFC has almost nothing to do with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that has to do with me,</v>

1715
01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.280
<v Speaker 3>it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was true.</v>

1716
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:21.080
<v Speaker 3>The officiant auto stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>

1717
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:25.790
<v Speaker 3>All I'm the one without their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight without that,</v>

1718
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:27.770
<v Speaker 3>what I do is useless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1719
01:19:27.771 --> 01:19:28.604
<v Speaker 3>So all I'm doing is trying to use my </v>
<v Speaker 3>vocabulary and my creativity in my </v>

1720
01:19:31.791 --> 01:19:33.890
<v Speaker 3>understanding what they're doing to best</v>
<v Speaker 3>represent it.</v>

1721
01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:36.200
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To honor their hard work.</v>

1722
01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:40.580
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what I feel like that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's so not like I've,</v>

1723
01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:42.050
<v Speaker 3>I tried to keep myself</v>

1724
01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:44.510
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1725
01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.353
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean opinions on tactics and stuff </v>

1726
01:19:47.551 --> 01:19:49.950
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're a creative point of</v>

1727
01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:50.280
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

1728
01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:50.940
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1729
01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:51.311
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1730
01:19:51.311 --> 01:19:52.144
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just my perspective on </v>
<v Speaker 3>performances and the character and the </v>

1731
01:19:55.951 --> 01:19:57.710
<v Speaker 3>different interactions between these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different</v>

1732
01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:01.050
<v Speaker 2>people's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your human for understanding the science</v>

1733
01:20:01.051 --> 01:20:03.950
<v Speaker 2>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not infusing your incendiary.</v>

1734
01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:06.520
<v Speaker 3>It's just a very different feeling than </v>
<v Speaker 3>being stand up.</v>

1735
01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:07.373
<v Speaker 3>Like when I go do standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I'm going to go and I'm going </v>

1736
01:20:09.141 --> 01:20:09.931
<v Speaker 3>to do my act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1737
01:20:09.931 --> 01:20:10.711
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go,</v>

1738
01:20:10.711 --> 01:20:11.550
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's it?</v>

1739
01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:13.500
<v Speaker 3>And it's about me interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1740
01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like doing the USC is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>just about being a representative.</v>

1741
01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.193
<v Speaker 3>I'm a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're kind of a more of like an </v>

1742
01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:21.603
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an analysts,</v>

1743
01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:22.351
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

1744
01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen so many of these things.</v>

1745
01:20:25.351 --> 01:20:25.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1746
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.100
<v Speaker 3>What does this represent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1747
01:20:27.101 --> 01:20:29.790
<v Speaker 3>I know this code.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This code means left high kicks coming,</v>

1748
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.890
<v Speaker 3>you know he's moving this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's lifting his leg.</v>

1749
01:20:31.891 --> 01:20:33.770
<v Speaker 3>I see where it's coming and because </v>
<v Speaker 3>scaleio is dropping his hands out.</v>

1750
01:20:33.771 --> 01:20:37.770
<v Speaker 3>There it is and you call it and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's representation.</v>

1751
01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's very different than doing</v>

1752
01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:40.133
<v Speaker 4>athletes will start or have they already</v>
<v Speaker 4>started getting elective surgeries when </v>

1753
01:20:43.351 --> 01:20:44.400
<v Speaker 4>they don't have injuries.</v>

1754
01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:45.963
<v Speaker 3>There's only a few that I've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that think that that's willing to do </v>

1755
01:20:49.271 --> 01:20:50.104
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Brody Stevens actually told me that </v>

1756
01:20:51.401 --> 01:20:52.234
<v Speaker 3>was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them was a Tommy John Surgery </v>

1757
01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:56.040
<v Speaker 3>where it apparently makes you able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitch.</v>

1758
01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:58.340
<v Speaker 4>A lot of those guys I think are getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1759
01:20:58.341 --> 01:20:59.174
<v Speaker 4>but I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get it when you need it when your </v>

1760
01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:01.570
<v Speaker 4>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck</v>

1761
01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:02.403
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had read the people were getting an </v>

1762
01:21:03.341 --> 01:21:05.360
<v Speaker 3>elective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brody said that was bullshit.</v>

1763
01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:06.253
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1764
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:07.243
<v Speaker 4>person three get one knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did one knee and then he did the </v>

1765
01:21:10.321 --> 01:21:12.660
<v Speaker 4>other one just as rg three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy from.</v>

1766
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.250
<v Speaker 4>Am I saying that right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quarterback,</v>

1767
01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:16.100
<v Speaker 4>quarterback of the Redskins game?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1768
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Didn't he get an elective knee surgery?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just because they can improve your knee?</v>

1769
01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it's not sure.</v>

1770
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:23.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have not heard this at all.</v>

1771
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.140
<v Speaker 4>That he got one knee done because he had</v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1772
01:21:25.141 --> 01:21:25.974
<v Speaker 4>The running quarterback guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know nothing about sports running </v>

1773
01:21:30.121 --> 01:21:35.121
<v Speaker 4>quarterback guy that runs with the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was on the redskins.</v>

1774
01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:40.260
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard of someone doing that.</v>

1775
01:21:40.261 --> 01:21:41.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1776
01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:44.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm just curious if you think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to start to be a.</v>

1777
01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.500
<v Speaker 4>it's an off season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to get a new risk because</v>

1778
01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:48.240
<v Speaker 4>they can make better ones than genetics </v>
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>

1779
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:51.610
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about that with legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what if they get to the point where</v>

1780
01:21:51.611 --> 01:21:54.850
<v Speaker 3>someone breaks a leg and it gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>gangrene and have to move the leg,</v>

1781
01:21:54.851 --> 01:21:57.340
<v Speaker 3>but they were replaced with the bionic </v>
<v Speaker 3>leg and it's like the $6,000,000</v>

1782
01:21:57.341 --> 01:21:58.174
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if they get you a leg that you can </v>

1783
01:21:59.561 --> 01:22:01.590
<v Speaker 3>feel and it works way better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular legs?</v>

1784
01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.670
<v Speaker 3>What would you rather do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you rather be in a wheelchair?</v>

1785
01:22:03.671 --> 01:22:04.504
<v Speaker 3>Would you rather be on crutches or would</v>
<v Speaker 3>you rather have a leg that works way </v>

1786
01:22:06.911 --> 01:22:07.744
<v Speaker 3>better than a regular leg?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you definitely take the </v>

1787
01:22:09.401 --> 01:22:10.840
<v Speaker 3>fucking leg?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bucks way better,</v>

1788
01:22:10.841 --> 01:22:14.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then if you feel it and it feels like</v>

1789
01:22:14.141 --> 01:22:17.260
<v Speaker 3>a regular leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's to stop you from just deciding to</v>

1790
01:22:17.261 --> 01:22:20.380
<v Speaker 3>just do the other leg to get your arms </v>
<v Speaker 3>done?</v>

1791
01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.780
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me get my neck done on it.</v>

1792
01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:26.270
<v Speaker 4>Why not ahead with fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carry around like that.</v>

1793
01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.530
<v Speaker 4>For Real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just carry somebody around with you.</v>

1794
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:32.510
<v Speaker 4>Send a text message or phone explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1795
01:22:32.511 --> 01:22:34.700
<v Speaker 4>I feel like we might be moving towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1796
01:22:34.701 --> 01:22:35.534
<v Speaker 4>We now have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like where everyone's trying to be a </v>

1797
01:22:36.361 --> 01:22:37.194
<v Speaker 4>super human super.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone thinks they're a fucking </v>

1798
01:22:38.691 --> 01:22:39.380
<v Speaker 4>athlete.</v>

1799
01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met a guy who didn't have an arm.</v>

1800
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.650
<v Speaker 3>He lost his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the accident was,</v>

1801
01:22:43.651 --> 01:22:48.110
<v Speaker 3>but he had a carbon fiber arm with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulating hand and it could move from</v>

1802
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:49.470
<v Speaker 3>his thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1803
01:22:49.471 --> 01:22:50.304
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's moving it somehow or </v>

1804
01:22:51.841 --> 01:22:52.674
<v Speaker 3>another with his nerves in his forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think somehow or another that's how </v>

1805
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.380
<v Speaker 3>he's moving it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not,</v>

1806
01:22:58.730 --> 01:23:01.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm not entirely sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that they've had,</v>

1807
01:23:01.771 --> 01:23:03.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were there,</v>

1808
01:23:03.711 --> 01:23:07.240
<v Speaker 3>they put a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these sort of electrodes or something to</v>

1809
01:23:07.241 --> 01:23:08.074
<v Speaker 3>their head and they can have them </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulate fingers like people that are </v>

1810
01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:14.830
<v Speaker 3>paralyzed these mechanical fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've,</v>

1811
01:23:14.831 --> 01:23:15.664
<v Speaker 3>I've done this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to this lab where they do these </v>

1812
01:23:18.431 --> 01:23:19.264
<v Speaker 3>tests and we put this helmet on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by thinking about things you can </v>

1813
01:23:22.241 --> 01:23:26.530
<v Speaker 3>make a drone fly around by thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about like when you're,</v>

1814
01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:28.540
<v Speaker 3>when you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>achieve a certain frequency,</v>

1815
01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:31.630
<v Speaker 3>it communicates wirelessly with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>drone,</v>

1816
01:23:31.631 --> 01:23:34.120
<v Speaker 3>through this thing that they put on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>head with all these electrodes.</v>

1817
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:35.083
<v Speaker 4>We can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you were just talking about it </v>

1818
01:23:36.441 --> 01:23:38.840
<v Speaker 4>with a Kennison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can kind of do that.</v>

1819
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.943
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was doing that with words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean this is the shit that I do </v>

1820
01:23:41.931 --> 01:23:45.230
<v Speaker 4>with horses is that you can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate with them,</v>

1821
01:23:45.231 --> 01:23:46.064
<v Speaker 4>with your lines if you're really having </v>
<v Speaker 4>a 50 slash 50 consensual relationship </v>

1822
01:23:48.501 --> 01:23:51.440
<v Speaker 4>with them because they're prey animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can literally just think if your</v>

1823
01:23:51.441 --> 01:23:53.870
<v Speaker 4>intention is pure enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this sounds like bullshit,</v>

1824
01:23:53.871 --> 01:23:54.920
<v Speaker 4>the secret,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1825
01:23:55.190 --> 01:23:56.023
<v Speaker 4>But if you think about what you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>from them and you're really present and </v>

1826
01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:00.350
<v Speaker 4>connected to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will do it.</v>

1827
01:24:00.650 --> 01:24:02.460
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievable.</v>

1828
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:07.400
<v Speaker 4>And it's like really into horse riding </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're prey animals,</v>

1829
01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:09.830
<v Speaker 4>their prey animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the way that they've evolved,</v>

1830
01:24:09.831 --> 01:24:10.664
<v Speaker 4>if anyone cares that there's this book </v>
<v Speaker 4>called Zen Mind Zen horse and talks </v>

1831
01:24:12.501 --> 01:24:13.970
<v Speaker 4>about the evolution of the prey animal.</v>

1832
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:17.390
<v Speaker 4>And basically how they can feel fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can feel intention,</v>

1833
01:24:17.391 --> 01:24:18.224
<v Speaker 4>they can feel where you want to go and </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're training to be the lead mayor </v>

1834
01:24:21.111 --> 01:24:21.944
<v Speaker 4>of the herd that they look to you and if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you basically anticipate something from </v>

1835
01:24:25.971 --> 01:24:28.220
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will fulfill that anticipation.</v>

1836
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:29.990
<v Speaker 4>It's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like we don't use bits,</v>

1837
01:24:29.991 --> 01:24:30.824
<v Speaker 4>we don't use saddles and I don't use any</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of leads and I'll be on him and </v>

1838
01:24:34.041 --> 01:24:34.874
<v Speaker 4>I'll lead a little bit with my knees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I just visualize where I want to </v>

1839
01:24:36.711 --> 01:24:37.640
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll just go there.</v>

1840
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:39.283
<v Speaker 4>But if I'm disconnected and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just came in from traffic and I'm </v>

1841
01:24:41.721 --> 01:24:43.640
<v Speaker 4>just like bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like thinking about my shit.</v>

1842
01:24:43.641 --> 01:24:45.710
<v Speaker 4>He's just like not connected to me and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll do anything.</v>

1843
01:24:45.711 --> 01:24:48.200
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to get to that flow.</v>

1844
01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:49.093
<v Speaker 4>Meditative state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't smoked weed and hung out with </v>

1845
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:54.200
<v Speaker 4>my horse before.</v>

1846
01:24:54.230 --> 01:24:57.350
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've played music and stuff like that,</v>

1847
01:24:57.890 --> 01:25:01.280
<v Speaker 4>but maybe I should try that to trough my</v>
<v Speaker 4>amygdala.</v>

1848
01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:02.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just try a little.</v>

1849
01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:04.210
<v Speaker 4>Don't get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just try a little bit.</v>

1850
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:05.103
<v Speaker 4>That's actually a really good idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>because when you bring anxiety around a </v>

1851
01:25:07.701 --> 01:25:10.460
<v Speaker 4>prey animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel it and they just feel fear and</v>

1852
01:25:10.461 --> 01:25:11.690
<v Speaker 4>fear is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1853
01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:12.533
<v Speaker 4>there have just been designed to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 4>any sort of companion animal feels the </v>

1854
01:25:17.031 --> 01:25:18.950
<v Speaker 4>same thing like dogs love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1855
01:25:18.951 --> 01:25:21.950
<v Speaker 4>I think dogs knowing your high totally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally,</v>

1856
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:24.163
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they get high with you and her </v>

1857
01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.750
<v Speaker 4>small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They not.</v>

1858
01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:29.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had that happen before dog,</v>

1859
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:31.900
<v Speaker 4>that she got a panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

1860
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:33.103
<v Speaker 4>She fucking hit underneath the table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish he was high as fuck as we hop </v>

1861
01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.360
<v Speaker 4>boxed or me and joey ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Geez.</v>

1862
01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.570
<v Speaker 4>My office we were doing in my office </v>
<v Speaker 4>with my dog,</v>

1863
01:25:44.571 --> 01:25:45.340
<v Speaker 4>Lucy.</v>

1864
01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.173
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this guy that the dog that bit </v>

1865
01:25:47.361 --> 01:25:49.260
<v Speaker 4>my year off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't find him a home know.</v>

1866
01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.640
<v Speaker 4>Basically if a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a self soothes that way and it was taken</v>

1867
01:25:52.641 --> 01:25:53.474
<v Speaker 4>from his mother too young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always going to sort of be a </v>

1868
01:25:54.471 --> 01:25:56.360
<v Speaker 4>liability and I wasn't going to put them</v>
<v Speaker 4>down obviously.</v>

1869
01:25:56.361 --> 01:25:57.194
<v Speaker 4>So I sent him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this guy named Stephen Baldwin </v>

<v Speaker 4>knowledge.</v>

1871
01:26:01.491 --> 01:26:03.420
<v Speaker 4>Alec Baldwin's brother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not like Alec Baldwin.</v>

1872
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:05.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Here's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>newest hawks.</v>

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:42.110
<v Speaker 4>The best hopes and amazing actor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's pretty amazing because he uses hemp</v>

1889
01:26:42.111 --> 01:26:43.910
<v Speaker 4>treats for his dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good move.</v>

1890
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:46.700
<v Speaker 4>Can you chill them out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chilling a little bit.</v>

1891
01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:49.400
<v Speaker 4>I think that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Need to pop one?</v>

1892
01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.530
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put A.</v>

1893
01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.480
<v Speaker 4>I've been trimming elk steaks and I have</v>
<v Speaker 4>these little scraps,</v>

1894
01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:54.523
<v Speaker 4>little scraps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and give them to the doj the greatest </v>

1895
01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.250
<v Speaker 4>training aid in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

1896
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:01.340
<v Speaker 4>Just give it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Cooked,</v>

1897
01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:02.061
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:27:02.061 --> 01:27:04.400
<v Speaker 4>Raw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can give them one piece of less than</v>

1899
01:27:04.401 --> 01:27:06.140
<v Speaker 4>three days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to feed him for three days.</v>

1900
01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.050
<v Speaker 4>Three days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1901
01:27:08.050 --> 01:27:12.200
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who just gives the dog </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a slab of raw meat every three days</v>

1902
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:15.680
<v Speaker 4>and they don't feed them the second </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing or animals way too much.</v>

1903
01:27:15.681 --> 01:27:17.720
<v Speaker 4>Dogs do not need to eat twice a day.</v>

1904
01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.553
<v Speaker 4>We give him this fucking giant bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of our dogs are overweight and </v>

1905
01:27:20.781 --> 01:27:22.780
<v Speaker 4>overfed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're giving them.</v>

1906
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:23.833
<v Speaker 4>We're giving them way more food that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they need and it's terrible on their </v>

1907
01:27:25.701 --> 01:27:26.534
<v Speaker 4>joints and just terrible for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I only feed my dogs as training </v>

1908
01:27:28.971 --> 01:27:30.220
<v Speaker 4>rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1909
01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:31.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't use training.</v>

1910
01:27:31.401 --> 01:27:34.220
<v Speaker 4>They don't get just a big bowl of food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get marrow bones,</v>

1911
01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.860
<v Speaker 4>they get meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get eggs sometimes,</v>

1912
01:27:36.861 --> 01:27:40.670
<v Speaker 4>but they only get feeding throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 4>just running shit.</v>

1913
01:27:40.671 --> 01:27:44.270
<v Speaker 4>And your house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You totally out for the fuck of how many</v>

1914
01:27:44.271 --> 01:27:45.770
<v Speaker 4>dogs do you have at your house?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have three.</v>

1915
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:46.833
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you gotta kind of be running shit </v>

1916
01:27:47.661 --> 01:27:49.640
<v Speaker 4>because they're alone right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just plot.</v>

1917
01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 4>They're in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crates are almost always.</v>

1918
01:27:52.521 --> 01:27:54.330
<v Speaker 4>Dogs are den animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to be in credits.</v>

1919
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:56.060
<v Speaker 4>People are always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's mean to put them in crates.</v>

1920
01:27:56.061 --> 01:27:56.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

1921
01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.553
<v Speaker 4>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's mean to just let them roam around </v>

1922
01:27:58.791 --> 01:27:59.624
<v Speaker 4>all the time because then they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>territorial and they think that they </v>

1923
01:28:00.831 --> 01:28:04.400
<v Speaker 4>have to control things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My dogs are guests in my home.</v>

1924
01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.670
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1925
01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:08.690
<v Speaker 4>They don't get on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't get to do anything.</v>

1926
01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.430
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like you're a slave master </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of sound like a species is to me,</v>

1927
01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:14.503
<v Speaker 4>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have had my ear ripped off so </v>

1928
01:28:15.981 --> 01:28:18.410
<v Speaker 4>I've made some mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with my dogs,</v>

1929
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 4>dogs really do well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you dominate them,</v>

1930
01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:24.800
<v Speaker 4>what kind of food do you feed them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feed them this place called the way in</v>

1931
01:28:24.801 --> 01:28:27.500
<v Speaker 4>this kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just keenwah and Turkey.</v>

1932
01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Keenwah and beef and chicken and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>come in these frozen things.</v>

1933
01:28:30.250 --> 01:28:33.110
<v Speaker 4>Is it a good thing to give them grain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it help them in some way?</v>

1934
01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:33.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1935
01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:37.490
<v Speaker 4>They seem to do really well on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I give them store bought food,</v>

1936
01:28:37.491 --> 01:28:38.930
<v Speaker 4>I sometimes do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buffalo,</v>

1937
01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:41.450
<v Speaker 4>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buffalo wild buffalo or something,</v>

1938
01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.313
<v Speaker 4>but they start eating grass and I see in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there they puke and I see in there </v>

1939
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:47.870
<v Speaker 4>because they eat grass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just sort of restore equilibrium because</v>

1940
01:28:47.871 --> 01:28:48.704
<v Speaker 4>they're too acidic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they'll start eating grass with that </v>

1941
01:28:50.281 --> 01:28:51.330
<v Speaker 4>if that's where they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1942
01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:54.830
<v Speaker 4>So some sort of an instinct to restore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1943
01:28:54.831 --> 01:28:57.620
<v Speaker 4>They're not getting enough of certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>minerals and vitamins.</v>

1944
01:28:57.621 --> 01:28:58.454
<v Speaker 4>They're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means they're malnourished and </v>

1945
01:28:59.421 --> 01:29:01.710
<v Speaker 4>they're getting it elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when they start eating dirt.</v>

1946
01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 4>When they start</v>

1947
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.480
<v Speaker 2>eating shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're malnourished.</v>

1948
01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:04.620
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1949
01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I give them this stuff and they don't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1950
01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:07.893
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got this from watching them just </v>

1951
01:29:11.241 --> 01:29:14.090
<v Speaker 3>eat grass around the backyard like after</v>
<v Speaker 3>you played them?</v>

1952
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dogs puke up grass.</v>

1953
01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Are you seeing their poop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they have grass in it.</v>

1954
01:29:19.361 --> 01:29:22.960
<v Speaker 2>That means that they're having to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>other places for nourishment.</v>

1955
01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.333
<v Speaker 3>So have you ever tried to feed them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a lot of companies that </v>

1956
01:29:26.411 --> 01:29:28.630
<v Speaker 3>sell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sort of a raw diet for dogs.</v>

1957
01:29:28.631 --> 01:29:31.660
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm asking you this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have like these tubes of raw food</v>

1958
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:33.690
<v Speaker 2>that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1959
01:29:33.710 --> 01:29:36.290
<v Speaker 2>I usually only do it for like training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1960
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:37.980
<v Speaker 2>but that's what they're designed to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1961
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.150
<v Speaker 2>they're designed to rob their walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1962
01:29:40.151 --> 01:29:41.140
<v Speaker 2>they're just designed to eat raw meat.</v>

1963
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:42.330
<v Speaker 3>This dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1964
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:44.700
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the sweetest dog of all time,</v>

1965
01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 3>but he can barely keep it together when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I have barely.</v>

1966
01:29:48.601 --> 01:29:50.930
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy like credit you get jumped up</v>

1967
01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:52.143
<v Speaker 2>because also the meat that we eat is </v>
<v Speaker 2>full of antibiotics and chemicals has </v>

1968
01:29:54.731 --> 01:29:56.110
<v Speaker 2>been frozen 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

1969
01:29:56.111 --> 01:29:56.944
<v Speaker 2>There's no fucking blood in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're bringing home this fresh real </v>

1970
01:29:59.051 --> 01:30:01.510
<v Speaker 2>meat with no garbage in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's like,</v>

1971
01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:03.030
<v Speaker 2>you're awakening his prime.</v>

1972
01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:05.940
<v Speaker 3>His reactions are incredible and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>reactions are way.</v>

1973
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:07.660
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way more extreme.</v>

1974
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Be Super Interested in juxtaposing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like store bought meat and then your elk</v>

1975
01:30:13.271 --> 01:30:15.080
<v Speaker 2>meat and seeing what he goes.</v>

1976
01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:17.720
<v Speaker 3>I think dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either one of them for sure,</v>

1977
01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:21.060
<v Speaker 3>but I mean meat is meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think to the dog.</v>

1978
01:30:21.061 --> 01:30:21.894
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet if you gave him time and allowed </v>

1979
01:30:25.261 --> 01:30:28.170
<v Speaker 3>him to discern and hunger was not an </v>
<v Speaker 3>option.</v>

1980
01:30:28.171 --> 01:30:29.004
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If had already lean towards the elk </v>

1981
01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:33.930
<v Speaker 3>towards the bloody stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly more than that.</v>

1982
01:30:33.931 --> 01:30:34.764
<v Speaker 3>Toward then dog food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you put the elk down next to a bowl </v>

1983
01:30:37.261 --> 01:30:38.630
<v Speaker 3>of dog food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would totally ignore the dog.</v>

1984
01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:43.500
<v Speaker 3>If you let the dog loose in to ride one </v>
<v Speaker 3>bowl of elk in one bowl of dog food,</v>

1985
01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.330
<v Speaker 3>they would go to the elk 100 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1986
01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:46.633
<v Speaker 2>The ingredients in dog food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like sugar or sucrose or high </v>

1987
01:30:50.841 --> 01:30:53.420
<v Speaker 2>fructose corn syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just like trash.</v>

1988
01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:56.320
<v Speaker 3>I buy this stuff that has no grain in it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's all.</v>

1989
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:57.163
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of his like lamb and beef and </v>

1990
01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.470
<v Speaker 3>people talk about their dogs sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer at five.</v>

1991
01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:05.840
<v Speaker 3>Feeding your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1992
01:31:05.841 --> 01:31:07.640
<v Speaker 3>it's also could be like a genetic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1993
01:31:07.730 --> 01:31:08.563
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't it be fucked up breed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I feel like if I think dogs are </v>

1994
01:31:12.261 --> 01:31:14.100
<v Speaker 3>supposed to eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

1995
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:16.910
<v Speaker 3>I would think that like if you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way like I've been thinking</v>

1996
01:31:16.911 --> 01:31:19.160
<v Speaker 3>about that lately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like actually hunting for my dog,</v>

1997
01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:20.533
<v Speaker 3>like getting a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some food and putting aside just </v>

1998
01:31:23.571 --> 01:31:25.460
<v Speaker 3>for the dogs do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always do,</v>

1999
01:31:25.461 --> 01:31:27.320
<v Speaker 3>whenever I make eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll make some for the dogs.</v>

2000
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just grind it up,</v>

2001
01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:32.290
<v Speaker 3>like make a and just see if they behave </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

2002
01:31:32.291 --> 01:31:33.100
<v Speaker 3>If they feel there.</v>

2003
01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:33.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'll just feed them meat and </v>

2004
01:31:35.921 --> 01:31:38.570
<v Speaker 2>then eggs and then a couple days later </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just give a.</v>

2005
01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:40.510
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'll just give the marrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>bones for the day.</v>

2006
01:31:40.890 --> 01:31:41.723
<v Speaker 3>What's the thinking of is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like some of the only mass </v>

2007
01:31:44.191 --> 01:31:46.500
<v Speaker 3>produced factory farm food that I still </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy.</v>

2008
01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2009
01:31:48.381 --> 01:31:49.214
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be factory farmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're getting it the cheapest </v>

2010
01:31:51.541 --> 01:31:52.590
<v Speaker 3>way they get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2011
01:31:52.650 --> 01:31:54.290
<v Speaker 3>If you're buying some sort of dried </v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken</v>

2012
01:31:54.490 --> 01:31:56.980
<v Speaker 2>feeding your kids lucky charms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2013
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because the dog's meet.</v>

2014
01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:01.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they sleep more,</v>

2015
01:32:01.330 --> 01:32:04.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just probably fart more.</v>

2016
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he fired a lot?</v>

2017
01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he.</v>

2018
01:32:09.101 --> 01:32:09.934
<v Speaker 2>Does that seem like actually having them</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat meat and see if he farts less </v>

2019
01:32:13.090 --> 01:32:13.923
<v Speaker 2>because their bodies are working so hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>to break it down and they have to </v>

2020
01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:16.893
<v Speaker 2>methane gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There could really be what it is that </v>

2021
01:32:18.731 --> 01:32:20.350
<v Speaker 2>when your dogs are fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means something's up.</v>

2022
01:32:20.351 --> 01:32:22.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you're fighting a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like one of my wanting to eat.</v>

2023
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:23.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

2024
01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Why is my body working so hard to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>this down?</v>

2025
01:32:26.381 --> 01:32:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't this digestible?</v>

2026
01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you follow any kind of crazy diet?</v>

2027
01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:32.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had eating disorders,</v>

2028
01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:36.070
<v Speaker 2>shocker plot twist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously.</v>

2029
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have to be careful with that shit.</v>

2030
01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:40.960
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get over him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2031
01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:42.640
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2032
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:47.290
<v Speaker 2>I like want to do a 12 step program for </v>
<v Speaker 2>codependence,</v>

2033
01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:48.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2034
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:49.263
<v Speaker 2>and I did this like inner child work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all sounds like very hippie and like </v>

2035
01:32:52.091 --> 01:32:52.924
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I had to start re parenting myself </v>

2036
01:32:56.051 --> 01:32:58.210
<v Speaker 2>because I grew up around eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorders.</v>

2037
01:32:58.211 --> 01:32:59.044
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't a lot of eating in my </v>

2038
01:33:00.251 --> 01:33:01.570
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of eating on the go,</v>

2039
01:33:01.571 --> 01:33:02.404
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing in my fridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it just never occurred to me to </v>

2040
01:33:03.971 --> 01:33:04.804
<v Speaker 2>take care of myself nutritionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But eating disorders are a lot about </v>

2041
01:33:07.361 --> 01:33:09.640
<v Speaker 2>control for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you know that.</v>

2042
01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:10.803
<v Speaker 2>So it was like my life felt out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>control when I was a teenager and that </v>

2043
01:33:13.961 --> 01:33:14.794
<v Speaker 2>was the one thing I could control is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I aid getting thin also got me </v>

2044
01:33:16.871 --> 01:33:18.730
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got people to like worry about me and</v>

2045
01:33:18.731 --> 01:33:19.564
<v Speaker 2>font over me and that I wanted attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that coupled with like </v>

2046
01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:28.720
<v Speaker 2>intense therapy with it and then doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>job where I get</v>

2047
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:30.180
<v Speaker 3>my sort of</v>

2048
01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:34.940
<v Speaker 2>quota of attention in healthy ways that </v>
<v Speaker 2>box is checked.</v>

2049
01:33:34.941 --> 01:33:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I no longer need to get attention and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy ways.</v>

2050
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:38.143
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

2051
01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:39.063
<v Speaker 3>So it was basically an attention thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and also just a bad programming saying </v>

2052
01:33:42.190 --> 01:33:45.220
<v Speaker 3>bad conditioning had both of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things sort of.</v>

2053
01:33:45.730 --> 01:33:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2054
01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:51.420
<v Speaker 2>And I had an adversarial relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my body and with food and um,</v>

2055
01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.530
<v Speaker 2>it was a very antisocial behavior as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2056
01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Liked I was able to isolate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I in school was not very social.</v>

2057
01:33:58.481 --> 01:34:01.450
<v Speaker 2>I have a socially awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really scared of people and having</v>

2058
01:34:01.451 --> 01:34:03.420
<v Speaker 2>like fucked up eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're eating in your car,</v>

2059
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:04.031
<v Speaker 2>you're high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2060
01:34:04.031 --> 01:34:05.440
<v Speaker 2>you can't really go to dinner with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2061
01:34:05.441 --> 01:34:08.710
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a way that I put a wall up </v>
<v Speaker 2>between myself and other people as well.</v>

2062
01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Why does a more common a female thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>like from your perspective,</v>

2063
01:34:14.431 --> 01:34:17.030
<v Speaker 3>like when you think about like people </v>
<v Speaker 3>having like that,</v>

2064
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:17.933
<v Speaker 3>that phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having an adversarial relationship with </v>

2065
01:34:19.921 --> 01:34:21.930
<v Speaker 3>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't really hear guys say that</v>

2066
01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.790
<v Speaker 2>because we have an expiration date and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys kind of don't maybe.</v>

2067
01:34:25.791 --> 01:34:28.540
<v Speaker 2>And then we also have this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2068
01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:30.090
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Golden rule,</v>

2069
01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:33.950
<v Speaker 2>symmetrical need to look fertile to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys where it's like tiny ways,</v>

2070
01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.330
<v Speaker 2>tiny legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big hips,</v>

2071
01:34:35.331 --> 01:34:36.141
<v Speaker 2>big boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2072
01:34:36.141 --> 01:34:36.974
<v Speaker 2>like I think there's just a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure on our bodies because our </v>

2073
01:34:39.051 --> 01:34:43.280
<v Speaker 2>bodies are why you guys decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect us and procreate with us or not,</v>

2074
01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:44.750
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there were of course the social</v>

2075
01:34:44.751 --> 01:34:46.160
<v Speaker 2>construction of what's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2076
01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating disorders.</v>

2077
01:34:47.451 --> 01:34:49.430
<v Speaker 2>I read this amazing book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the name of it,</v>

2078
01:34:49.431 --> 01:34:50.264
<v Speaker 2>but how they're eating disorders in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Italy only started when American </v>

2079
01:34:54.561 --> 01:34:55.394
<v Speaker 2>television went over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like tearing the fabric of </v>

2080
01:34:57.771 --> 01:34:58.604
<v Speaker 2>their families because food is how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>show love and connect with each other </v>

2081
01:35:00.921 --> 01:35:02.030
<v Speaker 2>and mothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2082
01:35:02.031 --> 01:35:02.480
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2083
01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:04.820
<v Speaker 2>it starts with breastfeeding and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's feeding you pasta.</v>

2084
01:35:04.821 --> 01:35:05.654
<v Speaker 2>And this and girls stopped eating pasta </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dairy because they started getting </v>

2085
01:35:08.451 --> 01:35:11.410
<v Speaker 2>eating disorders and it was like tearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart the fabric of Italian families.</v>

2086
01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing</v>

2087
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.920
<v Speaker 2>to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I definitely grew up around a lot of</v>

2088
01:35:15.921 --> 01:35:17.480
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw women,</v>

2089
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:18.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we all have such a fucked </v>

2090
01:35:20.031 --> 01:35:21.590
<v Speaker 2>up relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2091
01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.710
<v Speaker 2>our children because we tell our kids to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do certain things,</v>

2092
01:35:24.711 --> 01:35:25.544
<v Speaker 2>but we don't do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I heard adults say it like I need to </v>

2093
01:35:28.011 --> 01:35:29.690
<v Speaker 2>lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to lose five pounds.</v>

2094
01:35:29.691 --> 01:35:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Adults who were not fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I internalized sort of,</v>

2095
01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:34.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the body that I need minus,</v>

2096
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:36.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just saw a lot of fucked up shit.</v>

2097
01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:37.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and women that had adverse ational </v>

2098
01:35:38.881 --> 01:35:40.460
<v Speaker 2>really adversarial relation with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

2099
01:35:40.461 --> 01:35:42.080
<v Speaker 2>So I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know any better,</v>

2100
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:43.940
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like a lot of women have </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2101
01:35:43.941 --> 01:35:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Like from the jump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2102
01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.153
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not something that I don't even </v>

2103
01:35:47.361 --> 01:35:50.900
<v Speaker 3>know if you're really aware of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>expiration date when you're 16 and 17,</v>

2104
01:35:50.901 --> 01:35:52.910
<v Speaker 3>are you think you're not thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>your longevity,</v>

2105
01:35:52.911 --> 01:35:54.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think about your current state.</v>

2106
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are objectified.</v>

2107
01:35:56.231 --> 01:35:57.460
<v Speaker 2>It's such a young age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2108
01:35:57.461 --> 01:35:58.294
<v Speaker 2>my brother is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got these daughters and they're </v>

2109
01:36:00.461 --> 01:36:02.230
<v Speaker 2>gorgeous and he always tells people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't tell them.</v>

2110
01:36:02.231 --> 01:36:03.064
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell them they're smart at such a young </v>

2111
01:36:04.511 --> 01:36:05.231
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're told like,</v>

2112
01:36:05.231 --> 01:36:06.640
<v Speaker 2>you're so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're so pretty.</v>

2113
01:36:06.641 --> 01:36:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah.</v>

2114
01:36:07.330 --> 01:36:08.890
<v Speaker 2>And whereas boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2115
01:36:08.891 --> 01:36:10.330
<v Speaker 2>you're so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're so awesome.</v>

2116
01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:13.300
<v Speaker 2>You're so good at football or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think from such an early age,</v>

2117
01:36:13.301 --> 01:36:14.134
<v Speaker 2>I thought my appearance was the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that I had to offer the world and </v>

2118
01:36:16.031 --> 01:36:16.864
<v Speaker 2>I just got really obsessed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fastidious about like what it looked </v>

2119
01:36:19.241 --> 01:36:22.540
<v Speaker 2>like and I just thought I had to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>really skinny at a young age.</v>

2120
01:36:23.370 --> 01:36:25.260
<v Speaker 3>How do you talk to kids like that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that regards?</v>

2121
01:36:25.261 --> 01:36:27.180
<v Speaker 3>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like instead of saying,</v>

2122
01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:29.460
<v Speaker 3>you're so good at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to say,</v>

2123
01:36:29.461 --> 01:36:33.000
<v Speaker 3>see how working hard has paid off this </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2124
01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:34.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose to say,</v>

2125
01:36:34.861 --> 01:36:35.694
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the times you've gone to class now </v>

2126
01:36:36.991 --> 01:36:38.550
<v Speaker 3>you can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is amazing.</v>

2127
01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:39.900
<v Speaker 3>You've progressed.</v>

2128
01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Also heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good because I had struggled</v>

2129
01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:46.990
<v Speaker 2>with intense perfectionism in eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorders are a big part of that because</v>

2130
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.863
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know I was allowed to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>flaws as a kid because my parents I </v>

2131
01:36:50.151 --> 01:36:53.900
<v Speaker 2>think always tried to put on a front </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything was fine when it wasn't.</v>

2132
01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:54.973
<v Speaker 2>Whereas what they say you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with kids as fuck up and then course </v>

2133
01:36:57.591 --> 01:36:59.360
<v Speaker 2>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they get to see resilience.</v>

2134
01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:00.830
<v Speaker 2>So you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2135
01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I was late to pick you up from school </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2136
01:37:03.141 --> 01:37:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I totally miscalculated the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really sorry.</v>

2137
01:37:05.511 --> 01:37:06.231
<v Speaker 2>Instead of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2138
01:37:06.231 --> 01:37:08.240
<v Speaker 2>there was a line at the bank and things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or just,</v>

2139
01:37:08.241 --> 01:37:09.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't lie to kids.</v>

2140
01:37:09.801 --> 01:37:10.634
<v Speaker 2>You weren't supposed to pretend things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are fine or you're not supposed to </v>

2141
01:37:11.691 --> 01:37:14.510
<v Speaker 2>pretend you're perfect to be this hero </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

2142
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Or if like you're fighting with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>spouse,</v>

2143
01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:17.811
<v Speaker 2>you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2144
01:37:17.811 --> 01:37:20.240
<v Speaker 2>we kind of got in an argument and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and now we're fine.</v>

2145
01:37:20.241 --> 01:37:20.871
<v Speaker 2>You don't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2146
01:37:20.871 --> 01:37:23.090
<v Speaker 2>everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just watching a movie.</v>

2147
01:37:23.091 --> 01:37:24.410
<v Speaker 2>It was the sound from the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2148
01:37:24.411 --> 01:37:25.580
<v Speaker 2>you don't lie to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2149
01:37:25.581 --> 01:37:25.971
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2150
01:37:25.971 --> 01:37:26.804
<v Speaker 2>And I never had any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got the message very young and </v>

2151
01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.700
<v Speaker 2>like I had to be perfect and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the way of traffic.</v>

2152
01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:34.490
<v Speaker 3>See that's very rare that boys get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thin message.</v>

2153
01:37:34.491 --> 01:37:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Just what I'm trying to get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's odd that it hits</v>

2154
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:40.280
<v Speaker 2>just the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be muscular and strong.</v>

2155
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:41.143
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recently just learned that men like </v>

2156
01:37:42.421 --> 01:37:44.690
<v Speaker 2>have body image stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had no idea,</v>

2157
01:37:44.691 --> 01:37:46.490
<v Speaker 2>but it just manifests in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2158
01:37:46.491 --> 01:37:48.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like you guys have to be like cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be big.</v>

2159
01:37:48.681 --> 01:37:50.060
<v Speaker 2>You have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2160
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:52.560
<v Speaker 2>have a big Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you guys have all that Shit Shit.</v>

2161
01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some men do have the,</v>

2162
01:37:54.250 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 3>the fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where</v>

2163
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:58.110
<v Speaker 5>it really bothers him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really books their heads,</v>

2164
01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:59.460
<v Speaker 5>they're eating salads all over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

2165
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.400
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot anorexic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no question about it.</v>

2166
01:38:02.401 --> 01:38:03.234
<v Speaker 5>I mean it just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially when you're trying to course </v>

2167
01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:05.960
<v Speaker 5>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2168
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:07.170
<v Speaker 5>like you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you decide,</v>

2169
01:38:07.171 --> 01:38:08.280
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going the other way.</v>

2170
01:38:08.281 --> 01:38:10.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at yourself in the mirror,</v>

2171
01:38:10.231 --> 01:38:11.070
<v Speaker 5>you get disgusted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2172
01:38:11.071 --> 01:38:15.300
<v Speaker 5>like I'm not eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see a lot of guys and I'm curious your</v>

2173
01:38:15.301 --> 01:38:16.134
<v Speaker 5>take on this because you're such a big </v>
<v Speaker 5>part of this world of like these guys </v>

2174
01:38:18.541 --> 01:38:20.060
<v Speaker 5>who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm Paleo,</v>

2175
01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:21.540
<v Speaker 5>don't eat anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>

2176
01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:22.923
<v Speaker 5>this is still fucking rigid and fucked </v>
<v Speaker 5>up and I see guys with their cricket </v>

2177
01:38:25.741 --> 01:38:30.300
<v Speaker 5>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dated a guy who just ate dry protein.</v>

2178
01:38:30.301 --> 01:38:32.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a fucking eating disorder.</v>

2179
01:38:32.110 --> 01:38:34.800
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when is it healthy?</v>

2180
01:38:34.801 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 5>When does it go into disorder than </v>
<v Speaker 5>dysfunctional.</v>

2181
01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:41.280
<v Speaker 5>It's unnecessary based on the results </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you get from it,</v>

2182
01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.173
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2183
01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.193
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you just eat healthy foods and you </v>

2184
01:38:44.971 --> 01:38:45.804
<v Speaker 5>take like say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean depending upon how much training </v>

2185
01:38:47.911 --> 01:38:48.744
<v Speaker 5>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might want to take a protein </v>

2186
01:38:50.401 --> 01:38:51.234
<v Speaker 5>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Occasionally you get to take something </v>

2187
01:38:52.411 --> 01:38:56.040
<v Speaker 5>that's easily digestible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>concentrate on macronutrients,</v>

2188
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:57.900
<v Speaker 5>concentrating on getting most of it from</v>
<v Speaker 5>your food,</v>

2189
01:38:57.901 --> 01:39:00.390
<v Speaker 5>but making sure you balance things out </v>
<v Speaker 5>with supplements.</v>

2190
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:01.583
<v Speaker 5>Once you do all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like why are you eating dry protein </v>

2191
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:06.120
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just eat some food,</v>

2192
01:39:06.121 --> 01:39:06.954
<v Speaker 5>get a nice piece of salmon and the salad</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's going to be way better for you </v>

2193
01:39:10.021 --> 01:39:11.850
<v Speaker 5>than what you're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's irrational.</v>

2194
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.790
<v Speaker 5>I used to have such an irrational fear </v>
<v Speaker 5>of fat,</v>

2195
01:39:15.210 --> 01:39:18.000
<v Speaker 5>like I would go to a restaurant order </v>
<v Speaker 5>steamed vegetables.</v>

2196
01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:20.460
<v Speaker 5>If there was oil on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would like pat it down.</v>

2197
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:21.870
<v Speaker 5>Like it was like insanity.</v>

2198
01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:22.920
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2199
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.650
<v Speaker 5>but eating disorders are not logical </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely.</v>

2200
01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:26.753
<v Speaker 5>They become more like a mirage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I used to only eat like dried </v>

2201
01:39:29.431 --> 01:39:30.264
<v Speaker 5>fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is so fucking bad for you and </v>

2202
01:39:32.101 --> 01:39:34.560
<v Speaker 5>fattening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pure sugar,</v>

2203
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:36.300
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not logical.</v>

2204
01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:37.693
<v Speaker 5>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2205
01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:39.440
<v Speaker 5>but then it would like go to the gym for</v>
<v Speaker 5>four hours.</v>

2206
01:39:39.450 --> 01:39:41.640
<v Speaker 5>It's like I wasn't even good at having </v>
<v Speaker 5>an eating disorder.</v>

2207
01:39:41.641 --> 01:39:42.620
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not even eat.</v>

2208
01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.620
<v Speaker 5>I was eating 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>calories a day.</v>

2209
01:39:44.621 --> 01:39:45.870
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2210
01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:48.750
<v Speaker 5>You're not even good at being anorexic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's like I just,</v>

2211
01:39:48.751 --> 01:39:49.584
<v Speaker 5>it becomes so irrational and you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>get so a logical and you just have so </v>

2212
01:39:53.551 --> 01:39:54.384
<v Speaker 5>many blind spots about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't you think you just know a </v>

2213
01:39:55.861 --> 01:39:59.970
<v Speaker 5>whole lot more about nutrition now too </v>
<v Speaker 5>because like when this is going on,</v>

2214
01:39:59.971 --> 01:40:02.880
<v Speaker 5>like say say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say back to like 20 years ago,</v>

2215
01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:05.730
<v Speaker 5>how many people really knew how to eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>correctly.</v>

2216
01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:10.310
<v Speaker 5>Everybody was eating whole grain bread </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they thought that was the way to go.</v>

2217
01:40:10.311 --> 01:40:11.144
<v Speaker 5>Everything there wasn't this like high </v>
<v Speaker 5>fructose corn syrup and fucking </v>

2218
01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.790
<v Speaker 5>everything and like antibiotics and </v>
<v Speaker 5>garbage and everything.</v>

2219
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:18.653
<v Speaker 5>We didn't notice there was that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we didn't understand like what your </v>

2220
01:40:23.431 --> 01:40:24.264
<v Speaker 5>body actually needed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were trying to go low fat with </v>

2221
01:40:25.831 --> 01:40:28.950
<v Speaker 5>everything like everybody was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>go with low fat yogurt.</v>

2222
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Low fat milk has sugar in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's disgusting.</v>

2223
01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:35.240
<v Speaker 5>Low fat milk has sugar in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Put sugar in it because otherwise,</v>

2224
01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:41.670
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's also this rat king's rat kings.</v>

2225
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:44.783
<v Speaker 5>Kings are now saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw a photo of a bunch of dead ones </v>

2226
01:40:48.151 --> 01:40:51.180
<v Speaker 5>all tangled together by the tail and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they just starve to death.</v>

2227
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:52.950
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that what a rat king is?</v>

2228
01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.030
<v Speaker 5>A rat king is when</v>

2229
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:55.290
<v Speaker 4>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all get tangled together.</v>

2230
01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.193
<v Speaker 4>Retails get tangled and then they shared</v>
<v Speaker 4>in an all congeals and they just turned </v>

2231
01:40:59.111 --> 01:41:01.780
<v Speaker 4>into a mass of rats and then they starve</v>
<v Speaker 4>to death and die.</v>

2232
01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:02.673
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

2233
01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:04.810
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do they get all tangled up?</v>

2234
01:41:04.811 --> 01:41:06.040
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2235
01:41:06.041 --> 01:41:07.410
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All.</v>

2236
01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:08.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean they are</v>

2237
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.640
<v Speaker 2>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Sinewy.</v>

2238
01:41:10.670 --> 01:41:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen this before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie King?</v>

2239
01:41:13.770 --> 01:41:14.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is right there.</v>

2240
01:41:14.691 --> 01:41:15.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's one way.</v>

2241
01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:19.610
<v Speaker 4>Tails on your it out or they get stuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

2242
01:41:19.611 --> 01:41:20.930
<v Speaker 4>aren't they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like kind of slimy.</v>

2243
01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Guess if I had a gas that they spend too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much time in a very small area,</v>

2244
01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.273
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>

2245
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:29.833
<v Speaker 3>Scroll King.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those squirrels got accidentally </v>

2246
01:41:31.991 --> 01:41:32.824
<v Speaker 3>intertwined.</v>

2247
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:33.990
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2248
01:41:33.991 --> 01:41:35.690
<v Speaker 4>That's heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are they going to do?</v>

2249
01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:38.740
<v Speaker 4>Don't get eaten by coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fox Goes,</v>

2250
01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.860
<v Speaker 4>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that bother you.</v>

2251
01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.430
<v Speaker 3>This predation bother you.</v>

2252
01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Like you love animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do love animals.</v>

2253
01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I'll say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your deal,</v>

2254
01:41:47.521 --> 01:41:52.521
<v Speaker 2>because you do it from an angle of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation is I think is amazing.</v>

2255
01:41:53.010 --> 01:41:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sort of do it for,</v>

2256
01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:56.990
<v Speaker 3>from an angle of conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2257
01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:00.240
<v Speaker 3>but you have more food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly foods number one,</v>

2258
01:42:00.241 --> 01:42:04.440
<v Speaker 3>but conservation is a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to seek out food that way because</v>

2259
01:42:04.441 --> 01:42:05.274
<v Speaker 3>the money that's spent goes directly to </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to preserve the habitat where these </v>

2260
01:42:08.581 --> 01:42:09.414
<v Speaker 3>animals live and to keep things public </v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep all this land like we have </v>

2261
01:42:12.691 --> 01:42:14.040
<v Speaker 3>millions of acres of land</v>

2262
01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:14.973
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2263
01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:16.173
<v Speaker 2>I know that we need predators in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>to look for things to make sense like </v>

2264
01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:19.960
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

2265
01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:20.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves being reintroduced into </v>

2266
01:42:21.611 --> 01:42:23.410
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone basically everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2267
01:42:23.411 --> 01:42:26.860
<v Speaker 2>like you call out a couple and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people more get to live,</v>

2268
01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:27.850
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not People.</v>

2269
01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sort of obsessed with that.</v>

2270
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:31.660
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just understanding that like kind</v>

2271
01:42:31.661 --> 01:42:34.720
<v Speaker 2>of such a big key to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2272
01:42:34.930 --> 01:42:35.763
<v Speaker 2>whatever as this sounds ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know why I have shame about </v>

2273
01:42:37.791 --> 01:42:39.160
<v Speaker 2>like giving a shit about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

2274
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:40.263
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when being into the </v>

2275
01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:44.740
<v Speaker 2>environment became like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's quite lame,</v>

2276
01:42:44.741 --> 01:42:49.741
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I think it's 240,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>gallons of water for one cow and we only</v>

2277
01:42:50.591 --> 01:42:52.990
<v Speaker 2>eat 40 percent of cows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally,</v>

2278
01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:54.123
<v Speaker 2>50 percent of its body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of his body if we are so </v>

2279
01:42:55.991 --> 01:42:56.824
<v Speaker 2>wasteful and the way that you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like you're eating every part </v>

2280
01:42:59.411 --> 01:43:01.720
<v Speaker 2>of the body and don't you eat it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like months at a time and stuff.</v>

2281
01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.000
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're doing for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment is amazing.</v>

2282
01:43:04.370 --> 01:43:05.203
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a consequence of just </v>

2283
01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:10.040
<v Speaker 3>being selfish and selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not in a bad way,</v>

2284
01:43:10.041 --> 01:43:10.874
<v Speaker 3>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the honest word is selfish </v>

2285
01:43:11.931 --> 01:43:16.430
<v Speaker 3>because my feelings about meat where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>really enjoyed eating meat and I,</v>

2286
01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:17.413
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well let me look at it from a health </v>

2287
01:43:19.131 --> 01:43:20.510
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And boy,</v>

2288
01:43:20.511 --> 01:43:23.630
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of shit that vegans try to</v>

2289
01:43:23.631 --> 01:43:25.310
<v Speaker 3>point out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at it objectively,</v>

2290
01:43:25.311 --> 01:43:26.144
<v Speaker 3>there's almost nothing that shows that </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating meat with vegetables is bad for </v>

2291
01:43:29.331 --> 01:43:29.880
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2292
01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do these different speeds.</v>

2293
01:43:31.441 --> 01:43:32.274
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

2294
01:43:33.330 --> 01:43:35.260
<v Speaker 4>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what actually matters to me?</v>

2295
01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:36.030
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This mic.</v>

2296
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:37.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why am I doing this?</v>

2297
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:42.090
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm rusty on my podcast.</v>

2298
01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:44.370
<v Speaker 4>I know because I'm actually trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to you.</v>

2299
01:43:44.371 --> 01:43:46.620
<v Speaker 4>I keep forgetting we're on a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just gets weird,</v>

2300
01:43:46.650 --> 01:43:48.900
<v Speaker 4>but is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean because our teeth are sharp.</v>

2301
01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:50.820
<v Speaker 4>This is proof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're designed to be predators.</v>

2302
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 4>I were more</v>

2303
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.873
<v Speaker 3>omnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not predators because if we're a </v>

2304
01:43:54.511 --> 01:43:55.344
<v Speaker 3>predator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we were capable of did this like the </v>

2305
01:43:56.001 --> 01:43:56.834
<v Speaker 3>argument against us being predators by </v>
<v Speaker 3>like really like argumentative vegans </v>

2306
01:44:00.411 --> 01:44:03.280
<v Speaker 3>who they give these speeches about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we were really predators,</v>

2307
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:05.630
<v Speaker 3>we would have fangs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd be able to eat things raw.</v>

2308
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are just opportunists.</v>

2309
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:09.183
<v Speaker 3>We are heatedness and we don't need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live like this and they argued that </v>

2310
01:44:11.271 --> 01:44:14.270
<v Speaker 3>because our intestines are longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here the arguments not good.</v>

2311
01:44:14.271 --> 01:44:15.104
<v Speaker 3>Here's why it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We evolve to kill animals and cook them </v>

2312
01:44:17.691 --> 01:44:18.524
<v Speaker 3>and then chew them up and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been doing that for thousands of </v>

2313
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:22.123
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we looked this way and we </v>

2314
01:44:22.701 --> 01:44:25.790
<v Speaker 3>don't look like chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chimps,</v>

2315
01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:26.840
<v Speaker 3>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2316
01:44:27.230 --> 01:44:29.180
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cannibalize chimps.</v>

2317
01:44:29.181 --> 01:44:32.390
<v Speaker 3>Eat monkeys or chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eat a lot of monkeys.</v>

2318
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of monkeys,</v>

2319
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:35.900
<v Speaker 3>one of their favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They eat them alive.</v>

2320
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:39.230
<v Speaker 3>They tear them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is must much video of chimps,</v>

2321
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:42.620
<v Speaker 3>particularly in the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbing monkeys out of trees and eating</v>

2322
01:44:42.621 --> 01:44:45.230
<v Speaker 3>them along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just tearing them apart with their hands</v>

2323
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:46.280
<v Speaker 3>champs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2324
01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Rip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's face off.</v>

2325
01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chimps are the closest to us.</v>

2326
01:44:49.911 --> 01:44:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're super humid.</v>

2327
01:44:51.021 --> 01:44:51.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so.</v>

2328
01:44:51.771 --> 01:44:52.604
<v Speaker 3>They're so close to what we are there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one step left or right of the </v>

2329
01:44:55.851 --> 01:44:56.684
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary chain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like 90 to 99 percent of our </v>

2330
01:45:01.251 --> 01:45:02.960
<v Speaker 3>DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Insanely strong,</v>

2331
01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:05.810
<v Speaker 3>insanely strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we can't even rationalize.</v>

2332
01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Smaller than gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way smaller,</v>

2333
01:45:07.791 --> 01:45:08.624
<v Speaker 3>but as strong as a 500 pound man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a 150 pound chimpanzees like </v>

2334
01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.393
<v Speaker 3>literally like bigger than a game of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrones guy just rip you apart like you </v>

2335
01:45:18.501 --> 01:45:19.334
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll never be able to understand the </v>

2336
01:45:20.091 --> 01:45:22.040
<v Speaker 3>amount of power they can generate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their limbs.</v>

2337
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:25.300
<v Speaker 3>My concern is more where does it meet </v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg?</v>

2338
01:45:25.301 --> 01:45:27.140
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the way that we eat meat is actually</v>

2339
01:45:27.141 --> 01:45:29.630
<v Speaker 3>killing us in the longterm and </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroying our planet.</v>

2340
01:45:29.630 --> 01:45:34.630
<v Speaker 3>So much that we're just going to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>go extinct if we don't just do it in the</v>

2341
01:45:34.721 --> 01:45:35.800
<v Speaker 3>kind of way that you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:36.980
<v Speaker 3>There's some chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2343
01:45:36.981 --> 01:45:40.280
<v Speaker 3>They're tearing apart a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the little hands.</v>

2344
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:42.630
<v Speaker 3>Holy Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does that look like a gorilla to me?</v>

2345
01:45:42.690 --> 01:45:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Now that's a chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a straight up chimp.</v>

2346
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:48.620
<v Speaker 3>That's a big ass fucking tearing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>monkey apart.</v>

2347
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:50.383
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea that they meet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their favorite thing was the thing they </v>

2348
01:45:54.651 --> 01:45:58.610
<v Speaker 3>love more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just hard to get a monkey when they</v>

2349
01:45:58.611 --> 01:46:00.680
<v Speaker 3>get a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck about a banana.</v>

2350
01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.590
<v Speaker 3>So what's it resumed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chimps and gorillas?</v>

2351
01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Gorillas are vegetarians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're 100 percent vegetarian.</v>

2352
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:07.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2353
01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest primates we know of,</v>

2354
01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:13.340
<v Speaker 3>they have these giant fangs and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just for war,</v>

2355
01:46:13.450 --> 01:46:14.283
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just one gorilla takes care of </v>

2356
01:46:15.411 --> 01:46:16.280
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2357
01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:17.173
<v Speaker 3>a gang of bitches and grill has tiny </v>
<v Speaker 3>little Dick Taylor because penis sizes </v>

2358
01:46:23.241 --> 01:46:24.074
<v Speaker 3>and testicle size is directly </v>
<v Speaker 3>proportionate to the amount of </v>

2359
01:46:25.851 --> 01:46:28.190
<v Speaker 3>promiscuous females in the area.</v>

2360
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:29.383
<v Speaker 3>So with chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chimps have giant balls because all </v>

2361
01:46:30.741 --> 01:46:31.574
<v Speaker 3>chimp women are hoes and these bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just slinging that pussy from branch to </v>

2362
01:46:35.211 --> 01:46:37.080
<v Speaker 3>branch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not white.</v>

2363
01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:37.953
<v Speaker 3>Dick's human decks evolve to have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>little hook at the end of scoop out the </v>

2364
01:46:40.730 --> 01:46:41.563
<v Speaker 3>competitors seem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why the bigger head is more </v>

2365
01:46:43.341 --> 01:46:47.600
<v Speaker 3>successful because it's like a plunger </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there pulls it out to circumcision.</v>

2366
01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder.</v>

2367
01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:51.750
<v Speaker 3>I bet it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

2368
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:53.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:46:53.230 --> 01:46:56.090
<v Speaker 3>You're going to hear all about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight at the icehouse circumcision.</v>

2370
01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:57.960
<v Speaker 3>I used to have a whole series of bits </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2371
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2372
01:46:58.860 --> 01:46:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2373
01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:02.700
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the last insane rituals that</v>

2374
01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:06.600
<v Speaker 3>we almost universally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right people lose penises every year.</v>

2375
01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:07.793
<v Speaker 3>There are many kids every year that lose</v>
<v Speaker 3>their penis due to infection where they </v>

2376
01:47:10.471 --> 01:47:11.304
<v Speaker 3>never get a dick their entire life </v>
<v Speaker 3>because somebody wanted to go through a </v>

2377
01:47:13.081 --> 01:47:14.730
<v Speaker 3>ritualistic Dick.</v>

2378
01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:15.563
<v Speaker 3>Skin cutting and a bait beside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious argument for it and also the </v>

2379
01:47:18.991 --> 01:47:20.850
<v Speaker 3>sanitation argument no longer makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

2380
01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:23.040
<v Speaker 3>We had purell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we can disinfect.</v>

2381
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:25.103
<v Speaker 3>It's such a stupid argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like in the argument is that </v>

2382
01:47:27.810 --> 01:47:28.643
<v Speaker 3>there's a direct connection to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of people who are uncircumcised </v>

2383
01:47:32.791 --> 01:47:36.870
<v Speaker 3>who also have HIV in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way it was explained to me like,</v>

2384
01:47:36.871 --> 01:47:37.704
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the people that are uncircumcised </v>

2385
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.170
<v Speaker 3>also probably weren't taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

2386
01:47:43.171 --> 01:47:44.004
<v Speaker 3>weren't in a good family environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they went through ritualistic </v>

2387
01:47:46.291 --> 01:47:48.300
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what they were exposed to,</v>

2388
01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:49.433
<v Speaker 3>what can I intervene intravenous drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of lack of food and </v>

2389
01:47:51.841 --> 01:47:54.450
<v Speaker 3>nourishment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of diseases do they encounter?</v>

2390
01:47:54.451 --> 01:47:56.350
<v Speaker 3>The crush their immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2391
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.720
<v Speaker 3>what part of Africa they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2392
01:47:57.721 --> 01:47:58.860
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the prevalence?</v>

2393
01:47:59.040 --> 01:47:59.873
<v Speaker 3>Have they actually been tested positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>for HIV or as we were dealing with a t </v>

2394
01:48:02.281 --> 01:48:03.114
<v Speaker 3>cell count issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what has this been establish that </v>

2395
01:48:04.831 --> 01:48:06.520
<v Speaker 3>these people have aids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

2396
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:07.530
<v Speaker 3>What's causing it?</v>

2397
01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also all this,</v>

2398
01:48:08.530 --> 01:48:09.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these metrics coming out now that it's </v>

2399
01:48:10.441 --> 01:48:12.120
<v Speaker 2>emotionally traumatizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes it,</v>

2400
01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:15.330
<v Speaker 2>which makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that men can't express their feelings.</v>

2401
01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.193
<v Speaker 2>Eighty percent of the men that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumcised have a harder time </v>

2402
01:48:17.551 --> 01:48:19.050
<v Speaker 2>expressing their feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like something I read.</v>

2403
01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:20.400
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2404
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:21.263
<v Speaker 2>because the only woman that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever met gives you a stranger when </v>

2405
01:48:24.211 --> 01:48:28.110
<v Speaker 2>you're five days old and cuts your Dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>off in front of people.</v>

2406
01:48:28.111 --> 01:48:28.944
<v Speaker 2>And when you start crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just start clapping and taking </v>

2407
01:48:31.381 --> 01:48:32.214
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you're going to not distrust </v>

2408
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.740
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2409
01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.620
<v Speaker 3>Literally heard this come out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lady's mouth.</v>

2410
01:48:35.621 --> 01:48:38.220
<v Speaker 3>I did it to my son because I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>it to look gross for him.</v>

2411
01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2412
01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:45.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to a little gross called </v>
<v Speaker 3>child services.</v>

2413
01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:48.180
<v Speaker 3>So you're allowed to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's crazy of circumcision.</v>

2414
01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:49.713
<v Speaker 3>It is insane that it has even legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if it didn't exist and then </v>

2415
01:48:52.330 --> 01:48:56.520
<v Speaker 3>someone came along off women's vaginas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There would be riots in the story.</v>

2416
01:48:56.650 --> 01:48:57.483
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard some really crazy fucking </v>

2417
01:48:58.811 --> 01:48:59.644
<v Speaker 3>arguments from people that are super </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultra progressive that start going down </v>

2418
01:49:02.471 --> 01:49:05.230
<v Speaker 3>the rabbit hole with Islam where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to criticize anything.</v>

2419
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Someone called it egalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gender Surgery.</v>

2420
01:49:10.090 --> 01:49:10.923
<v Speaker 3>That the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genital mutilation was some sort of </v>

2421
01:49:13.330 --> 01:49:16.390
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian gender surgery as like men </v>
<v Speaker 3>and women.</v>

2422
01:49:16.610 --> 01:49:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

2423
01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:18.880
<v Speaker 3>But women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

2424
01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:21.760
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to cut off your clit.</v>

2425
01:49:21.761 --> 01:49:22.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same thing.</v>

2426
01:49:23.170 --> 01:49:25.140
<v Speaker 2>A lot of porn stars do that first set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grayson,</v>

2427
01:49:25.141 --> 01:49:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Slavia Prostate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2428
01:49:26.531 --> 01:49:28.870
<v Speaker 2>like in porn will cut their clinicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The enemy.</v>

2429
01:49:28.871 --> 01:49:29.704
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see a vagina cut their </v>

2430
01:49:30.671 --> 01:49:31.491
<v Speaker 2>currency?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vagina?</v>

2431
01:49:31.491 --> 01:49:32.770
<v Speaker 2>You want me to draw it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a few.</v>

2432
01:49:32.771 --> 01:49:34.660
<v Speaker 2>See vaginas that don't have the chicken </v>
<v Speaker 2>gizzard?</v>

2433
01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:36.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the Labia plasty.</v>

2434
01:49:36.311 --> 01:49:39.220
<v Speaker 2>And they do it for aesthetic reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have the,</v>

2435
01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.290
<v Speaker 2>they've got that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2436
01:49:41.890 --> 01:49:43.520
<v Speaker 2>the mud flaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2437
01:49:43.570 --> 01:49:46.960
<v Speaker 2>they've got the kind of of Oyster vibe </v>
<v Speaker 2>going but this,</v>

2438
01:49:47.050 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 2>the tourists get cut</v>

2439
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:51.760
<v Speaker 5>there as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like you guys are watching porn</v>

2440
01:49:51.761 --> 01:49:52.594
<v Speaker 5>with these girls that don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are generally mutilated and aren't </v>

2441
01:49:54.311 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 5>even having orgasms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're being lied to.</v>

2442
01:49:57.250 --> 01:49:58.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2443
01:49:58.241 --> 01:50:00.430
<v Speaker 5>So if the vagina doesn't have this on </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2444
01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:05.740
<v Speaker 5>you know them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They went to one of those,</v>

2445
01:50:05.741 --> 01:50:10.220
<v Speaker 5>a strip mall plastic surgeons and got </v>
<v Speaker 5>that thing shaved off nights.</v>

2446
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:12.160
<v Speaker 5>It's like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen porn where I'm like,</v>

2447
01:50:12.190 --> 01:50:14.710
<v Speaker 5>where's her Lavia?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is going on?</v>

2448
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:15.783
<v Speaker 5>They're just cutting them right off to </v>
<v Speaker 5>numb the outside edge of your pussy and </v>

2449
01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:24.460
<v Speaker 5>resetting the attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:25.750
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2451
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:29.020
<v Speaker 5>and that is what's causing so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>problems because you're seeing that fake</v>

2452
01:50:29.021 --> 01:50:30.490
<v Speaker 5>vagina and then you see a real one and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

2453
01:50:30.491 --> 01:50:31.211
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is ugly.</v>

2454
01:50:31.211 --> 01:50:31.600
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2455
01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:32.433
<v Speaker 5>this is just what a vagina looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the new voluntary female </v>

2456
01:50:35.531 --> 01:50:37.200
<v Speaker 5>circumcision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

2457
01:50:37.530 --> 01:50:42.530
<v Speaker 5>Toro Hood reduction is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We do need to change the name of that.</v>

2458
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:47.570
<v Speaker 5>Look under the hood and everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd really rather not a Hoodie,</v>

2459
01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:48.413
<v Speaker 5>a Hoodie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's at least a little more daring </v>

2460
01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:52.120
<v Speaker 5>relatively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2461
01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:53.530
<v Speaker 5>Was it worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

2462
01:50:53.531 --> 01:50:54.364
<v Speaker 5>Reviews costs pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have friends who have gotten the </v>

2463
01:50:59.321 --> 01:51:02.470
<v Speaker 5>vaginal rejuvenation surgery and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>said it was more painful than childbirth</v>

2464
01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:07.990
<v Speaker 5>and what they do is they ask you do you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to go back to 16,</v>

2465
01:51:07.991 --> 01:51:08.824
<v Speaker 5>18 or 21.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They ask you what age you want to go </v>

2466
01:51:10.271 --> 01:51:15.271
<v Speaker 5>back to 12 girls at different amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 5>sex at those ages.</v>

2467
01:51:17.231 --> 01:51:20.530
<v Speaker 5>So it's like I want her 21,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not my 21.</v>

2468
01:51:21.850 --> 01:51:22.683
<v Speaker 5>Fuck kind of question is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it's disproportionate to the </v>

2469
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:26.103
<v Speaker 5>amount of people that get circumcisions </v>
<v Speaker 5>versus the amount of people to get </v>

2470
01:51:28.091 --> 01:51:29.240
<v Speaker 5>Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Libya.</v>

2471
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:33.490
<v Speaker 5>That rejection is somewhat consent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're choosing to do it.</v>

2472
01:51:33.491 --> 01:51:34.324
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you probably aren't all there if you're </v>

2473
01:51:36.371 --> 01:51:37.204
<v Speaker 5>a porn star anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like I just think doing it when </v>

2474
01:51:39.131 --> 01:51:41.080
<v Speaker 5>you're five days old isn't particularly </v>
<v Speaker 5>fair.</v>

2475
01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:43.870
<v Speaker 5>It's so unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so crazy that it's the norm.</v>

2476
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:44.973
<v Speaker 5>It's more common than norm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think something like 75 percent of </v>

2477
01:51:48.011 --> 01:51:48.844
<v Speaker 5>American men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so unnecessary and it doesn't do </v>

2478
01:51:50.651 --> 01:51:52.180
<v Speaker 5>any good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

2479
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:56.890
<v Speaker 5>and it gives some numbness to do you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know guys who are uncircumcised that say</v>

2480
01:51:56.891 --> 01:51:59.320
<v Speaker 5>it feels way better when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>uncircumcised?</v>

2481
01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:00.131
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

2482
01:52:00.131 --> 01:52:00.964
<v Speaker 5>How do you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just talking shit but might be </v>

2483
01:52:03.791 --> 01:52:06.580
<v Speaker 5>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a thin layer of mucous develops</v>

2484
01:52:06.581 --> 01:52:09.670
<v Speaker 5>over the head of the Deq where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>protected by the skin.</v>

2485
01:52:09.671 --> 01:52:12.160
<v Speaker 5>It stays moist in there and supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 5>more sensitive.</v>

2486
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:14.650
<v Speaker 5>Whereas after you've had your four skin </v>
<v Speaker 5>remove this,</v>

2487
01:52:14.651 --> 01:52:18.610
<v Speaker 5>dried out so numb,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also cut some nerve endings,</v>

2488
01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:19.990
<v Speaker 5>which is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

2489
01:52:19.991 --> 01:52:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you guys do need less nerve </v>
<v Speaker 5>endings.</v>

2490
01:52:22.150 --> 01:52:24.700
<v Speaker 5>I actually think if all men weren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumcised,</v>

2491
01:52:24.701 --> 01:52:25.534
<v Speaker 5>nothing would ever get done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably jerking off all day if </v>

2492
01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:29.753
<v Speaker 5>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If everybody gets sucked around Dick </v>

2493
01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:32.573
<v Speaker 5>circumcised.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the reason why everybody comes </v>

2494
01:52:34.211 --> 01:52:35.044
<v Speaker 5>like just short.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's why our country has such a </v>

2495
01:52:37.271 --> 01:52:41.050
<v Speaker 5>prolific GDP because the men are </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumcised and it does suck.</v>

2496
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:44.210
<v Speaker 5>If sex felt any better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd have a real problem on our end.</v>

2497
01:52:44.211 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if you go to a and it's like super</v>

2498
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:47.150
<v Speaker 3>advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2499
01:52:47.151 --> 01:52:47.984
<v Speaker 3>that the dick size is directly </v>
<v Speaker 3>proportional to the face to how far the </v>

2500
01:52:51.621 --> 01:52:53.480
<v Speaker 3>face can get down on most men.</v>

2501
01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:55.980
<v Speaker 5>They're on deck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just curious.</v>

2502
01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a dude.</v>

2503
01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:57.873
<v Speaker 3>There's a dude online that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone sent me a video of this guy </v>

2504
01:53:00.721 --> 01:53:03.090
<v Speaker 3>literally fucking his own face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so disturbing.</v>

2505
01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:06.740
<v Speaker 3>He was doing a shoulder press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2506
01:53:06.741 --> 01:53:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was doing a shoulder press,</v>

2507
01:53:08.770 --> 01:53:11.310
<v Speaker 3>whereas like his neck was flat on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

2508
01:53:11.311 --> 01:53:12.144
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then his body was like super </v>

2509
01:53:13.591 --> 01:53:17.370
<v Speaker 3>flexible and it was up like his back was</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and he was bent over,</v>

2510
01:53:17.371 --> 01:53:20.490
<v Speaker 3>so down that he was literally deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>throating his own deck.</v>

2511
01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:22.650
<v Speaker 3>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>

2512
01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:24.133
<v Speaker 5>his own mouth pulled out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like kept jizzing on its own phase and </v>

2513
01:53:27.231 --> 01:53:30.060
<v Speaker 5>then stuck it back in his mouth again.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why are you running 200,</v>

01:55:50.490 --> 01:55:55.200
<v Speaker 1>pause and the whole design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pathological.</v>

2561
01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying why do people get their face </v>

<v Speaker 1>be a part of a tribe,</v>

2564
01:56:06.671 --> 01:56:10.620
<v Speaker 1>but like getting fisted in private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about acceptance or maladaptive</v>

2565
01:56:10.621 --> 01:56:11.730
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

2566
01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:13.940
<v Speaker 1>it's about taking things to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

2567
01:56:14.970 --> 01:56:15.803
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of things people do sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to try to freak out the other </v>

2568
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:21.360
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to let them know that they're on another</v>

2569
01:56:21.361 --> 01:56:22.194
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm on some super freak level it </v>

2570
01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:26.340
<v Speaker 1>put in my ass baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm at the point where I'm like,</v>

2571
01:56:26.341 --> 01:56:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be really kinky missionary.</v>

2572
01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Like the craziest thing you can do these</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

2573
01:56:32.881 --> 01:56:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get crazy.</v>

2574
01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's kiss during sex and I'll be on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>

2575
01:56:37.050 --> 01:56:38.190
<v Speaker 1>but some people know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2576
01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:39.023
<v Speaker 1>Some people want to do freak shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then if someone's going to want to do </v>

2577
01:56:41.491 --> 01:56:42.324
<v Speaker 1>freaky shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always gonna be someone who </v>

2578
01:56:43.251 --> 01:56:44.880
<v Speaker 1>wants to take it to the next level and </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

2579
01:56:44.881 --> 01:56:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a super freak.</v>

2580
01:56:46.810 --> 01:56:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a regular fee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could fill me motherfucker.</v>

2581
01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:52.200
<v Speaker 1>But then the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that this is all the people</v>

2582
01:56:52.201 --> 01:56:56.040
<v Speaker 1>who don't get to do what you get to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fight people and do comedy.</v>

2583
01:56:56.041 --> 01:56:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Like people that don't get to get those </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme needs met,</v>

2584
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:01.553
<v Speaker 1>they might not have ever found a path </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to sort of express themselves </v>

2585
01:57:04.771 --> 01:57:05.604
<v Speaker 1>through and then they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're spiraling out of control with </v>

2586
01:57:07.381 --> 01:57:08.214
<v Speaker 1>like poor programming and shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with their family and </v>

2587
01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:16.930
<v Speaker 1>friends that are fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all that leads to someone fist up to</v>

2588
01:57:17.050 --> 01:57:20.460
<v Speaker 1>your sign up for an open mic at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store or something else.</v>

2589
01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:21.000
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2590
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:21.833
<v Speaker 1>the thing is like everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality would lend itself to a </v>

2591
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:27.060
<v Speaker 1>different kind of pursuit and it's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the real problems.</v>

2592
01:57:27.061 --> 01:57:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Like some sort of a cookie cutter </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

2593
01:57:29.290 --> 01:57:30.123
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that you in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form would be most happy in a </v>

2594
01:57:32.971 --> 01:57:35.820
<v Speaker 1>cubicle is patently insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

2595
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>

01:57:37.111 --> 01:57:37.944
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good to put your star wars toys </v>

<v Speaker 1>Is fisting new because we're all in </v>

2598
01:57:47.251 --> 01:57:49.980
<v Speaker 1>cubicles or has it always been around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when we were fighting each other in</v>

2599
01:57:49.981 --> 01:57:50.731
<v Speaker 1>the streets?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2600
01:57:50.731 --> 01:57:52.410
<v Speaker 1>you got to think during the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>Empire,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Constantly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They were going so deep.</v>

2603
01:57:56.911 --> 01:57:58.050
<v Speaker 1>They were crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were.</v>

2604
01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:01.380
<v Speaker 1>They were literally trying to be as </v>
<v Speaker 1>hedonistic as possible.</v>

2605
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:02.303
<v Speaker 1>I was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just at the Coliseum and amazing </v>

2606
01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:08.130

<v Speaker 1>but it was funny.</v>

2607
01:58:08.130 --> 01:58:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking barbaric,</v>

2608
01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:13.740

<v Speaker 1>These are people who were going to die </v>

2611
01:58:18.571 --> 01:58:19.404
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only did these spites once every </v>

2612
01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:23.010
<v Speaker 1>couple months if the emperor wasn't into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2613
01:58:23.011 --> 01:58:24.300
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

2614
01:58:24.301 --> 01:58:25.134
<v Speaker 1>you guys routinely have people killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other on television and you guys </v>

<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were but allied animals extinct.</v>

<v Speaker 3>absolutely devastated the wildlife of </v>

2643
01:59:32.451 --> 01:59:35.540
<v Speaker 3>North Africa and the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mediterranean region,</v>

2644
01:59:35.541 --> 01:59:38.240
<v Speaker 3>wiping some species of animals off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>map.</v>

2645
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Entirely thousand</v>

2646
01:59:41.540 --> 01:59:43.960
<v Speaker 5>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly irritable</v>

2647
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:47.900
<v Speaker 3>set of games in which 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals are slaughtered.</v>

2648
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:51.320
<v Speaker 3>The hippo disappeared from the River </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nile at North Africa.</v>

2649
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:52.183
<v Speaker 3>They were fighting elephants that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>use an elephants and lions and and some </v>

2650
01:59:56.091 --> 01:59:59.480
<v Speaker 3>of the lines escaped and Tigers had </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaped to the front.</v>

2651
01:59:59.481 --> 02:00:00.314
<v Speaker 3>Rows were the richest people lived or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the richest people have their seats and </v>

2652
02:00:03.081 --> 02:00:03.914
<v Speaker 3>killed the richest people and so they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to develop these fence systems all </v>

2653
02:00:06.861 --> 02:00:08.690
<v Speaker 3>around and they had to raise the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2654
02:00:08.691 --> 02:00:09.524
<v Speaker 3>This guy was like explaining how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to protect the rich people sat in </v>

2655
02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:12.610
<v Speaker 3>the front row.</v>

2656
02:00:12.610 --> 02:00:16.450
<v Speaker 5>I think that's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those lions are awesome.</v>

2657
02:00:16.730 --> 02:00:17.563
<v Speaker 5>Could you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hear they're going to start putting </v>

2658
02:00:19.151 --> 02:00:22.120
<v Speaker 5>nets up at baseball games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Going to be from baseball.</v>

2659
02:00:22.130 --> 02:00:24.710
<v Speaker 5>Baby got hit by a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got a baby,</v>

2660
02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:29.920
<v Speaker 5>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>baby nets and all the baby to a baseball</v>

2661
02:00:30.371 --> 02:00:31.630
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is the baby dead?</v>

2662
02:00:31.890 --> 02:00:32.830
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't ask,</v>

2663
02:00:33.190 --> 02:00:34.640
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want it now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's going to be no,</v>

2664
02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:38.050
<v Speaker 5>it happened in hockey after a girl got </v>
<v Speaker 5>hit by a puck and where I'm from,</v>

2665
02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:39.413
<v Speaker 5>but hockey pucks slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but baseball's like don't as quickly or </v>

2666
02:00:44.201 --> 02:00:46.030
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It killed her.</v>

2667
02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:47.560
<v Speaker 5>She died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The girl in Columbus died.</v>

2668
02:00:47.561 --> 02:00:50.200
<v Speaker 5>That's why they have nets up all over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like every entrepreneur.</v>

2669
02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:54.940
<v Speaker 5>The pucks aren't flying into the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It used to get hit by a puck.</v>

2670
02:00:54.970 --> 02:00:55.803
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>used to be a thing to catch a puck when </v>

2671
02:00:56.771 --> 02:00:57.604
<v Speaker 5>it came into the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a foul ball and baseball because </v>

2672
02:00:59.441 --> 02:01:00.760
<v Speaker 5>they would flip over and whatnot.</v>

2673
02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:03.930
<v Speaker 5>But they started flying because people </v>
<v Speaker 5>got better and hidden faster.</v>

2674
02:01:03.931 --> 02:01:05.970
<v Speaker 5>Slap shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they had.</v>

2675
02:01:05.971 --> 02:01:08.200
<v Speaker 5>Now there's like a net up almost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You almost can't.</v>

2676
02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:09.283
<v Speaker 5>A hockey arena at least nhl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where did it hit her in like a like I </v>

2677
02:01:14.410 --> 02:01:15.430
<v Speaker 5>think it here in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2678
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:18.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure she wasn't sitting very super </v>
<v Speaker 5>close,</v>

2679
02:01:18.491 --> 02:01:20.830
<v Speaker 5>but I mean most good seats now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're all good seats,</v>

2680
02:01:20.831 --> 02:01:21.810
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hit it.</v>

2681
02:01:22.590 --> 02:01:25.850
<v Speaker 5>I'll get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I guess get a pat on this.</v>

2682
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:28.170
<v Speaker 5>Is your mom yelling you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that one guy got mom,</v>

2683
02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:29.013
<v Speaker 5>I killed that lady in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you do you get paid more money </v>

2684
02:01:31.361 --> 02:01:32.194
<v Speaker 5>because you're so good at hitting and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>got an assault charge that for hitting </v>

2685
02:01:35.801 --> 02:01:37.720
<v Speaker 5>the guy with the stick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was like player on player.</v>

2686
02:01:38.050 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 5>That's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Illegal or within</v>

2687
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:40.993
<v Speaker 3>sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Under ticket it says like you're </v>

2688
02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:43.873
<v Speaker 3>assuming all the risk of potential debt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever can happen to you at the event </v>

2689
02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:48.300
<v Speaker 3>eating puck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

2690
02:01:48.301 --> 02:01:50.090
<v Speaker 3>so now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now I'm.</v>

2691
02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:52.280
<v Speaker 3>All baseball fields are going to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuts.</v>

2692
02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Some of the worst idea in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People died from it,</v>

2693
02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:56.293
<v Speaker 3>but the nerfing of the world continues </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say you can't bring children and </v>

2694
02:02:00.411 --> 02:02:01.244
<v Speaker 3>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baseball just different because it's </v>

2695
02:02:02.241 --> 02:02:03.510
<v Speaker 3>like American mass time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2696
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I think you should wear gloves and don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring a baby.</v>

2697
02:02:06.110 --> 02:02:08.990
<v Speaker 3>That's my take on it and if the ball's </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming,</v>

2698
02:02:09.170 --> 02:02:10.610
<v Speaker 3>you got to be paying attention all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2699
02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:11.473
<v Speaker 3>Don't leave your kid alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be there with the fucking </v>

2700
02:02:13.731 --> 02:02:14.564
<v Speaker 3>glove tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mayor should be able to show that you </v>

2701
02:02:16.581 --> 02:02:20.000
<v Speaker 3>can catch a 90 mile an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2702
02:02:20.010 --> 02:02:20.843
<v Speaker 3>do you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that going to like kill baseball to </v>

2703
02:02:22.191 --> 02:02:23.480
<v Speaker 3>have to look through nets?</v>

2704
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.823
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happened to all sports is their </v>

2705
02:02:26.181 --> 02:02:27.440
<v Speaker 3>nerf and things up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2706
02:02:27.441 --> 02:02:28.274
<v Speaker 3>And that's the big thing that Donald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump got criticized for the most was </v>

2707
02:02:31.881 --> 02:02:33.670
<v Speaker 3>when he said that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2708
02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:35.570
<v Speaker 3>not just the thing about the players </v>
<v Speaker 3>kneeling,</v>

2709
02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:36.613
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they're killing the game with all </v>

2710
02:02:37.851 --> 02:02:39.080
<v Speaker 3>these safety regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2711
02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:40.000
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2712
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:41.260
<v Speaker 3>regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people are,</v>

2713
02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:42.893
<v Speaker 3>they're changing the rules at 35,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden they are getting fucked </v>

2714
02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:47.293
<v Speaker 3>up and do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the things that are supposedly </v>

2715
02:02:50.211 --> 02:02:51.044
<v Speaker 3>making them safer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the helmets are actually becoming </v>

2716
02:02:52.191 --> 02:02:53.810
<v Speaker 3>weapons and the things that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>entering each other.</v>

2717
02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:56.140
<v Speaker 3>But the people that believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2718
02:02:56.141 --> 02:02:59.930
<v Speaker 3>I tend to believe that a rugby is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>superior sport.</v>

2719
02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:02.900
<v Speaker 3>I was no helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no helmets,</v>

2720
02:03:02.901 --> 02:03:03.471
<v Speaker 3>no helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2721
02:03:03.471 --> 02:03:05.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fan of either one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I don't.</v>

2722
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:08.080
<v Speaker 3>If I wanted to walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had to choose to watch one,</v>

2723
02:03:08.081 --> 02:03:09.820
<v Speaker 3>since I don't give a fuck who wins the </v>
<v Speaker 3>superbowl?</v>

2724
02:03:09.970 --> 02:03:10.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch it.</v>

2725
02:03:10.931 --> 02:03:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But about choose to watch somebody said,</v>

2726
02:03:12.981 --> 02:03:14.540
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wanna go to a rugby game or football</v>

2727
02:03:14.541 --> 02:03:15.970
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I want to go see a rugby game.</v>

2728
02:03:15.971 --> 02:03:16.804
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any helmets or pads on </v>

2729
02:03:17.811 --> 02:03:18.644
<v Speaker 3>like that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not hitting each other the </v>

2730
02:03:20.031 --> 02:03:22.190
<v Speaker 3>way that they do and can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would die.</v>

2731
02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:23.570
<v Speaker 3>You would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd break your body,</v>

2732
02:03:23.571 --> 02:03:25.580
<v Speaker 3>you'd break your teammates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody would get fucked up.</v>

2733
02:03:25.581 --> 02:03:27.170
<v Speaker 3>They hit each other a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong.</v>

2734
02:03:27.171 --> 02:03:28.004
<v Speaker 3>It's a rough game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a smarter and it's more </v>

2735
02:03:29.901 --> 02:03:32.690
<v Speaker 3>realistic game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like putting on this stupid outfit.</v>

2736
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:35.180
<v Speaker 3>No offense guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all that shit.</v>

2737
02:03:35.181 --> 02:03:36.890
<v Speaker 3>You're doing all those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're such a bad ass,</v>

2738
02:03:36.891 --> 02:03:39.140
<v Speaker 3>why do y'all pads on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is this?</v>

2739
02:03:39.410 --> 02:03:40.243
<v Speaker 3>The only reason why you're able to run </v>
<v Speaker 3>at each other full clip is because of </v>

2740
02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:43.580
<v Speaker 3>past crazy.</v>

2741
02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:44.893
<v Speaker 3>Take that stupid shit off and you'll get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a more honest representation of what's </v>

2742
02:03:48.201 --> 02:03:49.034
<v Speaker 3>possible when people collide with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and you'll have way less scaled </v>

2743
02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:54.410
<v Speaker 3>ahead of just brute force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2744
02:03:54.411 --> 02:03:56.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there will ever be a day </v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's no nfl?</v>

2745
02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:57.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no nfl.</v>

2746
02:03:57.711 --> 02:03:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2747
02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:04.060
<v Speaker 3>I would hope that the NFL would just go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a more rugby based system.</v>

2748
02:04:04.521 --> 02:04:05.121
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2749
02:04:05.121 --> 02:04:06.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't listen to me.</v>

2750
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:10.280
<v Speaker 3>If you're an nfl fan you love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand the game relatively</v>

2751
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:13.220
<v Speaker 3>trivial days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit about nfl,</v>

2752
02:04:13.221 --> 02:04:14.054
<v Speaker 3>but I know that wearing helmets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if it's the same thing to me about </v>

2753
02:04:17.511 --> 02:04:18.344
<v Speaker 3>like striking with boxing gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think to be bare knuckle I think we'd </v>

2754
02:04:22.371 --> 02:04:23.600
<v Speaker 3>be safer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd have.</v>

2755
02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Fighters would have less brain trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't even strike less,</v>

2756
02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:30.500
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be able to just openly start </v>
<v Speaker 3>wailing on someone.</v>

2757
02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:32.840
<v Speaker 3>You just shatter your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that easy.</v>

2758
02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:36.190
<v Speaker 3>So you're more um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2759
02:04:36.230 --> 02:04:41.230
<v Speaker 3>calculated and much more calculated you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's much more emphasis on accuracy.</v>

2760
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:44.010
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't just hit somebody as hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you want to.</v>

2761
02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 3>Like the thing about having pants </v>
<v Speaker 3>gloves,</v>

2762
02:04:46.630 --> 02:04:48.060
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you're going to punch a </v>
<v Speaker 3>door,</v>

2763
02:04:48.090 --> 02:04:51.570
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a real wood solid wood door and you</v>

2764
02:04:51.571 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 3>just knock on that door full blast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2765
02:04:53.821 --> 02:04:54.654
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get fucking hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can kind of punch a door like </v>

2766
02:04:57.301 --> 02:04:58.980
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could do that.</v>

2767
02:04:58.981 --> 02:05:02.250
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't really hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can hit some on a bunch of times</v>

2768
02:05:02.251 --> 02:05:05.670
<v Speaker 3>like that and it doesn't hurt you if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have bare knuckle.</v>

2769
02:05:05.730 --> 02:05:06.563
<v Speaker 3>But if you have pads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have pads on your knuckles </v>

2770
02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:11.940
<v Speaker 3>pitching and hitting and hitting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting lamb that table,</v>

2771
02:05:11.941 --> 02:05:15.420
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't hurt at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're literally not capable of punching</v>

2772
02:05:15.421 --> 02:05:17.670
<v Speaker 3>full blast with knuckles all the time.</v>

2773
02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you hit like an elbow or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit a forehead.</v>

2774
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Guys shatter their hands on people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreheads.</v>

2775
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Your Ford is a dome that's good for </v>
<v Speaker 3>headbutting like this area.</v>

2776
02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:31.230
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to break that and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to break it with a hand.</v>

2777
02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:33.660
<v Speaker 3>But if you hit someone right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty devastating.</v>

2778
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:37.020
<v Speaker 3>This is a more softer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more flat.</v>

2779
02:05:37.170 --> 02:05:38.003
<v Speaker 3>You can get a good impact on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you catch this bridge like a lot </v>

2780
02:05:41.011 --> 02:05:43.920
<v Speaker 3>of times people break their hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>catching this bridge.</v>

2781
02:05:44.010 --> 02:05:44.843
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is the curve of the head</v>
<v Speaker 3>runs into the middle of your hand </v>

2782
02:05:49.450 --> 02:05:51.270
<v Speaker 3>because you're just trying to tee off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2783
02:05:51.271 --> 02:05:54.390
<v Speaker 3>And if you're in a fight and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to swing as hard as you can,</v>

2784
02:05:54.630 --> 02:05:55.463
<v Speaker 3>if you hit forehead and the curve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that forehead hits the middle of those </v>

2785
02:05:58.621 --> 02:06:00.100
<v Speaker 3>fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're the.</v>

2786
02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:01.620
<v Speaker 3>It's the weakest area.</v>

2787
02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:03.420
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like bends in between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>joints.</v>

2788
02:06:03.421 --> 02:06:05.700
<v Speaker 3>They snap and they also snapped back </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2789
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:09.570
<v Speaker 3>The snap on the top of the hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly the last two knuckles.</v>

2790
02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:12.500
<v Speaker 3>These aren't really connected to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of your,</v>

2791
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:13.363
<v Speaker 3>your arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these two knuckles or what you're </v>

2792
02:06:14.641 --> 02:06:17.400
<v Speaker 3>supposed to concentrate on because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's sort of reinforced by the risk.</v>

2793
02:06:17.490 --> 02:06:19.620
<v Speaker 3>But they break too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your whole hand brakes.</v>

2794
02:06:20.050 --> 02:06:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Fans are super fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Making me wonder,</v>

2795
02:06:22.051 --> 02:06:22.884
<v Speaker 3>like the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Michael Phelps was just born to </v>

2796
02:06:24.211 --> 02:06:25.044
<v Speaker 3>swam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2797
02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:28.220
<v Speaker 3>His Wingspan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his heart,</v>

2798
02:06:28.230 --> 02:06:29.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that shit.</v>

2799
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Are there people whose faces are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>born to fight?</v>

2800
02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2801
02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Faces were born for sure.</v>

2802
02:06:34.890 --> 02:06:37.350
<v Speaker 3>They can take more impact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wider faces,</v>

2803
02:06:37.351 --> 02:06:39.440
<v Speaker 3>bigger heads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thicker next for sure.</v>

2804
02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:42.530
<v Speaker 3>They can absorb better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can get knocked out because of</v>

2805
02:06:42.531 --> 02:06:43.364
<v Speaker 3>the human body is just so flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you have like some crazy </v>

2806
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Alistair overeem type character kick you</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the head,</v>

2807
02:06:48.301 --> 02:06:49.134
<v Speaker 3>anyone can get knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's less likely to get knocked out </v>

2808
02:06:51.661 --> 02:06:54.240
<v Speaker 3>if you're shaped a certain way and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands,</v>

2809
02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:57.040
<v Speaker 3>the shape of your hands makes a giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference as well.</v>

2810
02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:58.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like how much impact you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>deliver.</v>

2811
02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have someone like us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like George Foreman had enormous hands,</v>

2812
02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:04.723
<v Speaker 3>like there's a guy named Francis and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ghana was like one of the top UFC </v>

2813
02:07:06.650 --> 02:07:07.483
<v Speaker 3>heavyweights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time I shake his hands I just go </v>

2814
02:07:08.431 --> 02:07:13.431
<v Speaker 3>with Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got these fucking hammers,</v>

2815
02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:17.250
<v Speaker 3>like these giant hammers and he just </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocks people just dead.</v>

2816
02:07:17.670 --> 02:07:19.320
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge advantage.</v>

2817
02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:20.223
<v Speaker 3>Structural advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the difference between having </v>

2818
02:07:21.751 --> 02:07:22.584
<v Speaker 3>a ball peen hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little tiny hammer nails and having a </v>

2819
02:07:24.691 --> 02:07:27.180
<v Speaker 3>sledge hammer is literally as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

2820
02:07:27.590 --> 02:07:28.423
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the having that extra weight </v>

2821
02:07:29.911 --> 02:07:31.830
<v Speaker 3>on the end as a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if there's a lot of,</v>

2822
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:34.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of body mass behind it as well.</v>

2823
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Just a massive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want there to be no gloves,</v>

2824
02:07:37.571 --> 02:07:40.330
<v Speaker 3>so look at his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sizes motherfucker saying yeah,</v>

2825
02:07:40.350 --> 02:07:42.520
<v Speaker 3>they're enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seemed Fair.</v>

2826
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:43.810
<v Speaker 3>There were enormous.</v>

2827
02:07:44.230 --> 02:07:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Brian stand by the way.</v>

2828
02:07:46.811 --> 02:07:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Who was the UFC or the WC 205 pound </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>

2829
02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2830
02:07:51.611 --> 02:07:52.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a UFC fighter,</v>

2831
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:55.690
<v Speaker 3>a top UFC fighter at 185 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a big boy.</v>

2832
02:07:55.720 --> 02:07:56.553
<v Speaker 3>He lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His arms get dwarfed by in Ghana whose </v>

2833
02:07:58.601 --> 02:08:01.940
<v Speaker 3>hands it looks like a stump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

2834
02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:02.783
<v Speaker 3>that is an undeniable physical advantage</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can land that punch more dumbed </v>

2835
02:08:08.251 --> 02:08:09.100
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2836
02:08:09.101 --> 02:08:09.934
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point is that if fights had no </v>

2837
02:08:12.311 --> 02:08:13.144
<v Speaker 3>pads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would get a more accurate </v>

2838
02:08:14.291 --> 02:08:17.140
<v Speaker 3>representation of what the body can </v>
<v Speaker 3>really do.</v>

2839
02:08:17.141 --> 02:08:17.974
<v Speaker 3>Instead we're making fighters get more </v>
<v Speaker 3>damaged because you're letting people </v>

2840
02:08:21.341 --> 02:08:22.630
<v Speaker 3>tee off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should be able to tape</v>

2841
02:08:22.631 --> 02:08:23.464
<v Speaker 3>your risks either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's unfair to because you </v>

2842
02:08:25.650 --> 02:08:27.110
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gives it,</v>

2843
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:28.183
<v Speaker 3>make it stiffer so it doesn't buckle as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much when you impact something because </v>

2844
02:08:30.941 --> 02:08:32.620
<v Speaker 3>when you hit something of your handles </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

2845
02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:34.270
<v Speaker 3>you can really fuck your wrist up.</v>

2846
02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:36.870
<v Speaker 3>And when you really get torn tendons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all competition,</v>

2847
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.700
<v Speaker 3>they'll put like cement and their gloves</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have.</v>

2848
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:40.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2849
02:08:41.110 --> 02:08:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Margarito did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2850
02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:43.660
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2851
02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:45.270
<v Speaker 3>he was fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2852
02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:49.510
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different guys and busting </v>
<v Speaker 3>them up really bad.</v>

2853
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:52.270
<v Speaker 3>And then before his fight with sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shane Mosley,</v>

2854
02:08:52.271 --> 02:08:57.271
<v Speaker 3>they caught him in the locker room with </v>
<v Speaker 3>plaster in the wraps of the gloves.</v>

2855
02:08:57.850 --> 02:09:00.760
<v Speaker 3>Somebody caught them and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>started putting two and two together and</v>

2856
02:09:00.761 --> 02:09:02.650
<v Speaker 3>realizing like when he beat up Miguel </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cotto,</v>

2857
02:09:02.651 --> 02:09:04.120
<v Speaker 3>when he beat up all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters,</v>

2858
02:09:04.630 --> 02:09:07.390
<v Speaker 3>it was an unusual beating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was hitting them and it was just</v>

2859
02:09:07.391 --> 02:09:08.130
<v Speaker 3>having an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an,</v>

2860
02:09:08.130 --> 02:09:10.540
<v Speaker 3>an inordinate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inordinate effect on them.</v>

2861
02:09:10.541 --> 02:09:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Like hitting people way harder than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody else was.</v>

2862
02:09:13.150 --> 02:09:13.983
<v Speaker 3>No one could figure out why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once they took that way worse because </v>

2863
02:09:19.181 --> 02:09:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Lance Armstrong was doing that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else was also doing that.</v>

2864
02:09:23.230 --> 02:09:24.063
<v Speaker 3>No one else was putting too much and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are gonna start getting </v>

2865
02:09:27.401 --> 02:09:27.880
<v Speaker 3>suspicious.</v>

2866
02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:28.421
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't,</v>

2867
02:09:28.421 --> 02:09:31.280
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't necessarily beating everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was beating a lot of guys.</v>

2868
02:09:31.281 --> 02:09:33.190
<v Speaker 3>And the way he was beating him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was fucking them up.</v>

2869
02:09:33.191 --> 02:09:36.310
<v Speaker 3>And then when he got the sugar Shane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they caught him with the plaster.</v>

2870
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:37.263
<v Speaker 3>They took it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rewrap his hands and Sugar Shane beat </v>

2871
02:09:38.891 --> 02:09:40.570
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sugar.</v>

2872
02:09:40.571 --> 02:09:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Shane knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knew about it.</v>

2873
02:09:42.461 --> 02:09:43.620
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about it on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2874
02:09:43.630 --> 02:09:44.463
<v Speaker 3>on the broadcast and that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost not letting him fight and they </v>

2875
02:09:46.691 --> 02:09:49.470
<v Speaker 3>let him fight with new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>newly wrapped hands and sugar.</v>

2876
02:09:49.471 --> 02:09:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Shane just lit him up like a Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree.</v>

2877
02:09:51.491 --> 02:09:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Fucked him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then manny Pacquiao fucked him up to</v>

2878
02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:57.530
<v Speaker 3>everybody fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you get to.</v>

2879
02:09:57.630 --> 02:09:59.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he should've been.</v>

2880
02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:02.170
<v Speaker 3>He should've been probably retired from </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing.</v>

2881
02:10:02.171 --> 02:10:04.420
<v Speaker 3>They should've said there's no way you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could ever fight again were just like,</v>

2882
02:10:04.450 --> 02:10:05.950
<v Speaker 3>we want to see you get killed a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of times.</v>

2883
02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:07.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was never the same guy and he </v>

2884
02:10:08.351 --> 02:10:13.000
<v Speaker 3>actually wound up fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a really badly torn retina to the</v>

2885
02:10:13.001 --> 02:10:13.834
<v Speaker 3>point where I think they put an </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial retina from one of the </v>

2886
02:10:15.611 --> 02:10:17.320
<v Speaker 3>beatings that he took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think two sugar.</v>

2887
02:10:17.321 --> 02:10:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Shane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might've been the pack.</v>

2888
02:10:18.691 --> 02:10:20.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might've been the packout beat him.</v>

2889
02:10:20.750 --> 02:10:21.583
<v Speaker 3>Beat him bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of guys beat the fuck </v>

2890
02:10:23.711 --> 02:10:24.544
<v Speaker 3>out of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just that guy was putting </v>

2891
02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:29.350
<v Speaker 3>plaster and his gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gloves are the way to go.</v>

2892
02:10:29.351 --> 02:10:31.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you want to do it for boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2893
02:10:31.391 --> 02:10:32.224
<v Speaker 3>Boxing is a completely different sport </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's an art to catching punches </v>

2894
02:10:34.761 --> 02:10:35.594
<v Speaker 3>on the gloves and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my thing about mma in particular is </v>

2895
02:10:38.241 --> 02:10:41.150
<v Speaker 3>why is it okay to elbow someone in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>

2896
02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:45.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's not okay to have gloves that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are like bare knuckle.</v>

2897
02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:46.453
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could literally smash someone's </v>

2898
02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:49.910
<v Speaker 3>reading this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2899
02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:54.290
<v Speaker 3>you could smash someone's head with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>elbow like right in their eye socket and</v>

2900
02:10:54.291 --> 02:10:55.124
<v Speaker 3>that's totally legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could smash their nose to a pulp </v>

2901
02:10:56.690 --> 02:11:00.230
<v Speaker 3>that's totally legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some are like a shin.</v>

2902
02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:03.260
<v Speaker 3>You can hit someone so hard with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shin.</v>

2903
02:11:03.530 --> 02:11:06.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a razor blade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately it's a baseball bat.</v>

2904
02:11:06.930 --> 02:11:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Kick someone in the head with a shin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2905
02:11:08.901 --> 02:11:11.780
<v Speaker 3>There's no padding out of the all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to have in your fists.</v>

2906
02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:14.150
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that it's old.</v>

2907
02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:18.020
<v Speaker 3>We left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's when the UFC first came about,</v>

2908
02:11:18.021 --> 02:11:22.460
<v Speaker 3>it was beer and alcohol and then in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some sort of a,</v>

2909
02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:23.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of concerted effort to turn into a </v>

2910
02:11:25.041 --> 02:11:28.160
<v Speaker 3>legitimate sport and be accepted by </v>
<v Speaker 3>athletic commissions.</v>

2911
02:11:28.161 --> 02:11:31.760
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very new in terms of big time sports.</v>

2912
02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:35.810
<v Speaker 3>It was started in 1993,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's just 20 something years old,</v>

2913
02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:36.673
<v Speaker 3>24 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they wanted to make it look like in </v>

2914
02:11:39.171 --> 02:11:40.004
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of the first fights that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw in [inaudible] 97 when I first </v>

2915
02:11:41.961 --> 02:11:42.794
<v Speaker 3>started working for the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of bare knuckle </v>

2916
02:11:44.391 --> 02:11:46.640
<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys fought with shoes on.</v>

2917
02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:48.163
<v Speaker 3>They were bare knuckle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were allowed to grab people's </v>

2918
02:11:49.131 --> 02:11:49.964
<v Speaker 3>crotches still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You rather grab their clothes are </v>

2919
02:11:51.831 --> 02:11:52.664
<v Speaker 3>Kelly's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2920
02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:55.180
<v Speaker 3>Not that a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were,</v>

2921
02:11:55.210 --> 02:11:57.740
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to do a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could pull hair for a long time.</v>

2922
02:11:59.030 --> 02:12:01.820
<v Speaker 3>They finally got rid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got rid of grabbing clothes,</v>

2923
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:07.010
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't have to have knuckle </v>
<v Speaker 1>padding on your knuckles back then.</v>

2924
02:12:07.011 --> 02:12:07.844
<v Speaker 1>And the people that were super </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful realize you could hit people </v>

2925
02:12:10.401 --> 02:12:12.080
<v Speaker 1>way harder if you have patty on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>knuckles.</v>

2926
02:12:12.330 --> 02:12:13.163
<v Speaker 1>So Vito Belfort was one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>night he was 19 years old and you enter </v>

2927
02:12:16.181 --> 02:12:17.960
<v Speaker 1>into the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC 12,</v>

2928
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.823
<v Speaker 1>Dothan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alabama in 1997 and just beat the fuck </v>

2929
02:12:21.111 --> 02:12:25.790
<v Speaker 1>out of everybody with gloves on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would it take for them to do a rule</v>

2930
02:12:25.791 --> 02:12:26.624
<v Speaker 1>that said no gloves anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have to listen to me and </v>

2931
02:12:29.121 --> 02:12:30.890
<v Speaker 1>listened to a lot of other martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans.</v>

2932
02:12:31.130 --> 02:12:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Some people wouldn't want because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you would get cut more,</v>

2933
02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:34.453
<v Speaker 1>which I think you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would get more superficial tissue </v>

2934
02:12:36.471 --> 02:12:37.304
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think ultimately you'd get less </v>

2935
02:12:39.081 --> 02:12:41.750
<v Speaker 1>brain damage I think because you can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>him less.</v>

2936
02:12:41.751 --> 02:12:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd get hit less.</v>

2937
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:45.110
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>

2938
02:12:45.530 --> 02:12:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I think you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2939
02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:47.533
<v Speaker 1>I mean you would still run the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting elbowed indeed and kicked and </v>

2940
02:12:50.421 --> 02:12:52.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not safe by any stretch of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

2941
02:12:52.670 --> 02:12:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it has to get to a point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where because I'm so young,</v>

2942
02:12:57.140 --> 02:12:57.973
<v Speaker 1>we're fighters or 60 and they're blowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>their brains out and doing what nfl </v>

2943
02:13:00.801 --> 02:13:01.970
<v Speaker 1>players are doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody would.</v>

2944
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.863
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people would have to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>or hear about a concussion crisis and </v>

2945
02:13:05.710 --> 02:13:06.980
<v Speaker 1>mma that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's real.</v>

2946
02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean any sort of combat sport you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have it.</v>

2947
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:10.183
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know it's there but it's not </v>

2948
02:13:10.941 --> 02:13:13.490
<v Speaker 1>like in the zeitgeists really at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment it isn't yet,</v>

2949
02:13:13.491 --> 02:13:14.324
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly could be and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably certainly will be when some of </v>

2950
02:13:16.701 --> 02:13:19.670
<v Speaker 1>the veterans get into their sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies and we start to see them.</v>

2951
02:13:19.670 --> 02:13:20.503
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever see Joe Frazier before he </v>

2952
02:13:21.321 --> 02:13:24.920
<v Speaker 1>died?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on my throat.</v>

2953
02:13:25.150 --> 02:13:28.940
<v Speaker 1>He was on Opie and Anthony Show and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so bad.</v>

2954
02:13:28.941 --> 02:13:29.774
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his snoring and his inability was on </v>

2955
02:13:31.801 --> 02:13:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Howard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like floyd mayweather.</v>

2956
02:13:33.930 --> 02:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's showing any signs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuttering.</v>

2957
02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2958
02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:39.090
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's just 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>

2959
02:13:39.450 --> 02:13:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Five am nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe try and get it together or talking</v>

2960
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:50.490
<v Speaker 1>to Howard and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably has zero come left and his body</v>

2961
02:13:51.210 --> 02:13:52.950
<v Speaker 1>was it all night long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2962
02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:54.630
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For too much comment.</v>

2963
02:13:54.631 --> 02:13:55.800
<v Speaker 1>His mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this.</v>

2964
02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:58.020
<v Speaker 1>They have a Ct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tests,</v>

2965
02:13:58.021 --> 02:14:00.980
<v Speaker 1>they think of boston university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>THey found a biomarker.</v>

2966
02:14:00.990 --> 02:14:04.810
<v Speaker 1>they think that can let people know now </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of time before it doesn't interest</v>

2967
02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:05.813
<v Speaker 1>you get your bell rung three times and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of know that already because </v>

2968
02:14:08.461 --> 02:14:10.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It varies upon the person.</v>

2969
02:14:10.231 --> 02:14:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Some people are way more durable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason.</v>

2970
02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:13.733
<v Speaker 1>They don't know why and it could be also</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected what we were talking about </v>

2971
02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:18.030
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual shape of the head,</v>

2972
02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:19.920
<v Speaker 1>the thickness of the muscles of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>

2973
02:14:19.921 --> 02:14:23.490
<v Speaker 1>the ability to keep the head from </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapping back too much.</v>

2974
02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:26.290
<v Speaker 1>How many times it actually happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how good you are.</v>

2975
02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:27.173
<v Speaker 1>Avoiding things and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some people get hit and then they </v>

2976
02:14:29.431 --> 02:14:32.820
<v Speaker 1>learn how to roll with stuff and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a tremendous amount of impact off.</v>

2977
02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So you think what mma fighters are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their sixties and seventies and it's not</v>

2978
02:14:37.021 --> 02:14:38.400
<v Speaker 1>looking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might consider.</v>

2979
02:14:39.370 --> 02:14:41.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're going to consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>it Because I think to the general public</v>

2980
02:14:41.731 --> 02:14:46.731
<v Speaker 1>gloves mean safer gloves mean sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fans of mgma want faith.</v>

2981
02:14:47.340 --> 02:14:50.390
<v Speaker 1>They Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you got.</v>

2982
02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:53.370
<v Speaker 1>If I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking about public opinion,</v>

2983
02:14:53.550 --> 02:14:54.383
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a lot of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't really fans that are also </v>

2984
02:14:57.421 --> 02:14:58.200
<v Speaker 1>going to weigh in.</v>

2985
02:14:58.200 --> 02:14:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have public opinion,</v>

2986
02:14:59.970 --> 02:15:00.803
<v Speaker 1>should they take the gloves off mma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be a lot of people out </v>

2987
02:15:02.791 --> 02:15:05.950
<v Speaker 1>there arguing passionately that I had no</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea what they're talking about.</v>

2988
02:15:05.970 --> 02:15:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Gloves me and more dangerous and They </v>
<v Speaker 1>will say no way.</v>

2989
02:15:08.821 --> 02:15:09.654
<v Speaker 1>It's already barbaric enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really what we should concentrate </v>

2990
02:15:12.001 --> 02:15:12.834
<v Speaker 1>on and putting more pads and more safety</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures and stopping fights quicker </v>

2991
02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:17.430
<v Speaker 1>and looking out for the safety of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>

2992
02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:18.713
<v Speaker 1>but I think much like how pads and </v>
<v Speaker 1>football probably caused more injuries </v>

2993
02:15:23.590 --> 02:15:24.423
<v Speaker 1>to players rugby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the same thing should be said </v>

2994
02:15:27.571 --> 02:15:28.404
<v Speaker 1>about mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think mathematics or logic of like </v>

2995
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:30.743
<v Speaker 1>helmets and pads cause injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IT really does because think they </v>

2996
02:15:33.771 --> 02:15:34.604
<v Speaker 1>present them the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing that it does any </v>

2997
02:15:36.301 --> 02:15:37.134
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't like if I had to choose </v>

2998
02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:39.413
<v Speaker 1>between fighting someone with them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make gloves and fighting some bare </v>

2999
02:15:41.101 --> 02:15:43.740
<v Speaker 1>knuckle with a good hand wraps and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

3000
02:15:43.741 --> 02:15:44.574
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write me up.</v>

3001
02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Write me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just tee off on somebody.</v>

3002
02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:50.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your hands are fragile,</v>

3003
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:51.263
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times guys will hit each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the palms of the hands instead </v>

3004
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:55.200
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want to break your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

3005
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:56.263
<v Speaker 1>Get on top of someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could smash their face with a palm </v>

3006
02:15:57.591 --> 02:15:58.424
<v Speaker 1>of the hardest part of your hand when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit things hard with a poem and it </v>

3007
02:16:00.601 --> 02:16:01.980
<v Speaker 1>doesn't hurt at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3008
02:16:01.981 --> 02:16:02.814
<v Speaker 1>it's a different kind of a bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a thick bone and it's used to </v>

3009
02:16:05.521 --> 02:16:08.070
<v Speaker 1>touching and pushing against the hardest</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of your body,</v>

3010
02:16:08.071 --> 02:16:10.650
<v Speaker 1>your elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your knee and your elbow,</v>

3011
02:16:10.670 --> 02:16:13.320
<v Speaker 1>but the real hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you break your elbow.</v>

3012
02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:14.823
<v Speaker 1>People break shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They break chunks off the bottoms of </v>

3013
02:16:16.951 --> 02:16:19.830
<v Speaker 1>their elbows from fighting to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3014
02:16:19.831 --> 02:16:20.664
<v Speaker 1>I've had friends that have to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery where they have like floating </v>

3015
02:16:22.621 --> 02:16:24.570
<v Speaker 1>bone chunks from elbow and people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

3016
02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:26.640
<v Speaker 1>You can chip off little pieces of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>elbow.</v>

3017
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:29.440
<v Speaker 1>That's not great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get kicked their pain.</v>

3018
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>When you get</v>

3019
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.150
<v Speaker 5>hit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're fighting,</v>

3020
02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:32.493
<v Speaker 3>you feel less pain than you probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>would in regular life because your </v>

3021
02:16:34.751 --> 02:16:37.420
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline's through the roof and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this heightened situation,</v>

3022
02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:39.880
<v Speaker 3>But you could definitely tell some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some shots,</v>

3023
02:16:39.881 --> 02:16:41.800
<v Speaker 3>huRt guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shots the legs.</v>

3024
02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:42.933
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times when you get that second </v>
<v Speaker 3>or third leg kick in the same spot on </v>

3025
02:16:46.061 --> 02:16:46.894
<v Speaker 3>the legs from a really good lead kicker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a jolt that goes through </v>

3026
02:16:49.711 --> 02:16:51.460
<v Speaker 3>your whole body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3027
02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:52.893
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between like a leg kick </v>

3028
02:16:54.371 --> 02:16:55.470
<v Speaker 3>and anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you're different,</v>

3029
02:16:55.500 --> 02:16:56.333
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with a giant piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle and there's a lot of nerve </v>

3030
02:16:59.261 --> 02:17:00.094
<v Speaker 3>endings in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The outside edge of it is kind of </v>

3031
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:03.063
<v Speaker 3>tender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're not a person who's </v>

3032
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:06.630
<v Speaker 3>used to getting kicked there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if someone like a,</v>

3033
02:17:06.780 --> 02:17:07.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a maurice smith or an anesto nesto </v>

3034
02:17:09.401 --> 02:17:13.360
<v Speaker 3>who's like a world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxer slams a shin into there.</v>

3035
02:17:13.361 --> 02:17:15.580
<v Speaker 3>It is extraordinarily painful</v>

3036
02:17:15.610 --> 02:17:19.230
<v Speaker 5>because I remember that girl that got </v>
<v Speaker 5>her arm bitten off by a shark.</v>

3037
02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:23.370
<v Speaker 5>Bethany a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone she said that when she heard the</v>

3038
02:17:23.371 --> 02:17:25.980
<v Speaker 5>sound of she heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the crunch,</v>

3039
02:17:26.010 --> 02:17:27.480
<v Speaker 5>but she felt no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

3040
02:17:27.481 --> 02:17:28.314
<v Speaker 5>she said it felt like blissful orgasmic </v>
<v Speaker 5>because so much dope men goes to the </v>

3041
02:17:31.111 --> 02:17:34.090
<v Speaker 5>area so that you don't give up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my god.</v>

3042
02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:34.933
<v Speaker 5>So I just curious if in like fight or </v>
<v Speaker 5>flight mode fighting if you're even </v>

3043
02:17:37.861 --> 02:17:39.660
<v Speaker 5>feeling this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3044
02:17:39.661 --> 02:17:41.670
<v Speaker 5>you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You feel some stuff more than others.</v>

3045
02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:43.440
<v Speaker 5>Just like kicking in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as the fight's over you're like,</v>

3046
02:17:43.441 --> 02:17:46.110
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so much pain after a fight.</v>

3047
02:17:46.111 --> 02:17:48.450
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in severe pain for sure.</v>

3048
02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:49.333
<v Speaker 5>Just after your whole body's bruised up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been a long time since I've felt </v>

3049
02:17:53.521 --> 02:17:55.800
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I definitely remember after fights.</v>

3050
02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:59.100
<v Speaker 5>What's the most painful place to be hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>the head for sure.</v>

3051
02:17:59.430 --> 02:18:00.263
<v Speaker 5>The body too though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know your body can hurt for days </v>

3052
02:18:02.281 --> 02:18:04.650
<v Speaker 5>afterwards if you get hit with like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>left hook to the liver,</v>

3053
02:18:04.651 --> 02:18:07.740
<v Speaker 5>like a really hard left hook to the body</v>
<v Speaker 5>is tearing the achilles heel.</v>

3054
02:18:07.741 --> 02:18:11.070
<v Speaker 5>Really the most painful injury there has</v>
<v Speaker 5>done a really bad one though,</v>

3055
02:18:11.071 --> 02:18:13.770
<v Speaker 5>but I think injured discs are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>goddamn bad.</v>

3056
02:18:14.730 --> 02:18:15.563
<v Speaker 5>Injured disc sleeve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people with a atrophied arms </v>

3057
02:18:18.451 --> 02:18:21.230
<v Speaker 5>and pushes on nerves and jen</v>

3058
02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:25.370
<v Speaker 3>nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impingements impinges on the signal.</v>

3059
02:18:25.450 --> 02:18:26.283
<v Speaker 3>So working your muscles literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>atrophy and shrink up and if you don't </v>

3060
02:18:29.211 --> 02:18:33.470
<v Speaker 3>act on it really quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really common thing with men,</v>

3061
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:34.641
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3062
02:18:34.641 --> 02:18:35.474
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either lift a lot of weights or do it </v>

3063
02:18:37.041 --> 02:18:39.100
<v Speaker 3>incorrectly and fuck their back.</v>

3064
02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:40.213
<v Speaker 5>But are we all sleepIng wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting wrong and just doing everything </v>

3065
02:18:42.091 --> 02:18:44.280
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely sitting wrong.</v>

3066
02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:46.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm in the sybian right now.</v>

3067
02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:47.990
<v Speaker 5>This thing's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3068
02:18:47.991 --> 02:18:49.000
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is this.</v>

3082
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:20.220
<v Speaker 5>Squatty potties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Primarily women.</v>

3083
02:19:20.221 --> 02:19:21.054
<v Speaker 5>We don't empty our bladders completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>when we use regular toilets and that's </v>

3084
02:19:23.791 --> 02:19:27.440
<v Speaker 5>why we have to pee all the time because </v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to use squatty potties when we p</v>

3085
02:19:27.441 --> 02:19:28.270

02:19:28.270 --> 02:19:29.103
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't empty our entire bladders </v>

3087
02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:33.050
<v Speaker 5>toilets are not designed for our </v>
<v Speaker 5>uteruses.</v>

3088
02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:35.410
<v Speaker 5>Basically uti as a plural,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as uti.</v>

3089
02:19:35.430 --> 02:19:36.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

3090
02:19:36.650 --> 02:19:39.200
<v Speaker 5>that's why women always have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you can piece it in.</v>

3091
02:19:39.210 --> 02:19:39.921
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No problem.</v>

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3096
02:19:45.790 --> 02:19:48.050

<v Speaker 5>It's just being in the shower only.</v>

3097
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:50.200
<v Speaker 5>What seems like it'd be a real clean way</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do it.</v>

3098
02:19:50.201 --> 02:19:55.201

<v Speaker 5>Is it just like I have to pee and I'm in</v>

3103
02:20:08.571 --> 02:20:08.970
<v Speaker 5>the shower.</v>

<v Speaker 5>shower with that.</v>

3106
02:20:12.231 --> 02:20:14.300
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're peeing on my foot </v>
<v Speaker 5>bottom.</v>

3107
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:16.820

02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:23.670
<v Speaker 5>Like why is this so disgusting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gross.</v>

3111
02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:29.380

<v Speaker 5>I know I've seen you out,</v>

3113
02:20:33.530 --> 02:20:36.050
<v Speaker 5>Conditioning?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably conditioning.</v>

3114
02:20:36.051 --> 02:20:36.884
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem like there's a </v>

3115
02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:39.170
<v Speaker 5>renovation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scratching your ear if you're scratching</v>

3116
02:20:39.171 --> 02:20:40.230
<v Speaker 5>your eye.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you reach it,</v>

3117
02:20:40.290 --> 02:20:41.440
<v Speaker 5>what do you pick up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Food.</v>

3118
02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:43.053
<v Speaker 5>But this is gross,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't even have any boogers in </v>

3119
02:20:45.261 --> 02:20:46.220
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a good question.</v>

3120
02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:47.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell me.</v>

3121
02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:50.870
<v Speaker 5>I really wish I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's like a shame thing from the</v>

3122
02:20:50.871 --> 02:20:52.850
<v Speaker 5>time you were little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got a booger in your nose.</v>

3123
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:54.330
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true,</v>

3124
02:20:54.750 --> 02:20:56.210
<v Speaker 5>mike.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He eats his bugger.</v>

3125
02:20:56.880 --> 02:20:57.713
<v Speaker 5>This is my face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All my fits like I have a blood hold on </v>

3126
02:20:59.181 --> 02:21:04.181
<v Speaker 5>my face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why is this is gross crumps,</v>

3127
02:21:04.970 --> 02:21:07.670
<v Speaker 5>but why is it so satisfying when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>pick out a giant,</v>

3128
02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:11.420
<v Speaker 5>a giant winter burger and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

3129
02:21:11.421 --> 02:21:12.254
<v Speaker 5>look at this goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started getting my nose waxed hall </v>

3130
02:21:15.771 --> 02:21:16.604
<v Speaker 5>inside of my.</v>

3131
02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:22.070
<v Speaker 5>This is what happened in the second of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the pocket and they just started meeting</v>

3132
02:21:22.071 --> 02:21:22.904
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should never tell anyone that it's </v>

3133
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:26.920
<v Speaker 5>always have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's on the job.</v>

3134
02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:27.973
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you have little hairs and </v>

3135
02:21:28.671 --> 02:21:30.830
<v Speaker 5>they're just like unattractive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I started waxing them.</v>

3136
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:32.510
<v Speaker 5>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It hurts.</v>

3137
02:21:33.370 --> 02:21:36.740
<v Speaker 5>I stick a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why you guys having those hairs?</v>

3138
02:21:36.741 --> 02:21:38.870
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Girls having good success gets itchy.</v>

3139
02:21:39.570 --> 02:21:40.403
<v Speaker 5>Boogers get stuck in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I cleaned it out just like a blow my </v>

3140
02:21:42.351 --> 02:21:43.760
<v Speaker 5>nose because then you get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3141
02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:47.080
<v Speaker 5>the boogers get all but we're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 5>to have knows harris needs more.</v>

3142
02:21:47.090 --> 02:21:48.590
<v Speaker 5>I just sneezed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're running,</v>

3143
02:21:48.591 --> 02:21:50.090
<v Speaker 5>do you ever run?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

3144
02:21:50.091 --> 02:21:52.670
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you run to emotional rocket,</v>

3145
02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:55.670
<v Speaker 5>do you put a finger on one nostril like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

3146
02:21:55.680 --> 02:22:00.680
<v Speaker 5>Golf club?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only when I'm running,</v>

3147
02:22:00.891 --> 02:22:01.724
<v Speaker 5>why would numb running because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>good thing to do in the middle of </v>

3148
02:22:03.981 --> 02:22:08.580
<v Speaker 5>running outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3149
02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:09.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3150
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:12.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to start running inside </v>
<v Speaker 5>barefoot.</v>

3151
02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:13.333
<v Speaker 5>Like those socks you sent me a </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous because here's the thing </v>

3152
02:22:16.761 --> 02:22:19.880
<v Speaker 5>about those socks and I feel it with </v>
<v Speaker 5>those five fingers known.</v>

3153
02:22:19.881 --> 02:22:20.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3154
02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:22.250
<v Speaker 5>I've heard of him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>the steel socks.</v>

3155
02:22:23.090 --> 02:22:26.090
<v Speaker 5>Dyneema.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dyneema is the same stuff they used</v>

3156
02:22:26.090 --> 02:22:27.980
<v Speaker 3>to make bows drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

3157
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.501
<v Speaker 3>Use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3158
02:22:28.501 --> 02:22:29.334
<v Speaker 3>because it's incredibly strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you think about it a bow you're </v>

3159
02:22:31.501 --> 02:22:32.334
<v Speaker 3>pulling back like at a really heavy book</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go like 80 pounds of pressure to </v>

3160
02:22:35.491 --> 02:22:36.324
<v Speaker 3>pull it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you have all this force on those </v>

3161
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:39.623
<v Speaker 3>very thin wire that's like a shoestring </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinner even in fact that's how strong </v>

3162
02:22:44.341 --> 02:22:45.174
<v Speaker 3>dyneema is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they make these shoes out of dyneema </v>

3163
02:22:47.761 --> 02:22:49.660
<v Speaker 3>and you can run on things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3164
02:22:49.730 --> 02:22:51.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting a date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3165
02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:55.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to be barefoot outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty minutes a day.</v>

3166
02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:57.480
<v Speaker 3>It's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this a dyneema?</v>

3167
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:58.021
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3168
02:22:58.021 --> 02:22:59.910
<v Speaker 3>today I kept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did kick boxing,</v>

3169
02:22:59.911 --> 02:23:00.744
<v Speaker 3>which I always do barefoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got my a lot of barefoot moving in </v>

3170
02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:06.750
<v Speaker 3>and I also do it on a fairly soft </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface,</v>

3171
02:23:06.751 --> 02:23:10.500
<v Speaker 3>which is great because your feet really </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to dig in your toes.</v>

3172
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:14.570
<v Speaker 5>Electrons from the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

3173
02:23:14.571 --> 02:23:15.940
<v Speaker 5>It's deep dyneema.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

3174
02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:17.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got these myself too.</v>

3175
02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:21.320
<v Speaker 5>It felt like just putting on a garden </v>
<v Speaker 5>gloves on your feet,</v>

3176
02:23:21.470 --> 02:23:22.303
<v Speaker 5>but can you walk on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I walked outside of my little parking </v>

3177
02:23:25.371 --> 02:23:26.380
<v Speaker 5>lot and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nah,</v>

3178
02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:27.493
<v Speaker 5>it's phillip felt better barefoot like </v>
<v Speaker 5>glass was going to go right through my </v>

3179
02:23:29.811 --> 02:23:31.020
<v Speaker 5>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't.</v>

3180
02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:32.900
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have run anywhere,</v>

3181
02:23:32.950 --> 02:23:37.200
<v Speaker 5>but I won't go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't going to test it.</v>

3182
02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:39.250
<v Speaker 5>They felt they didn't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on bro.</v>

3183
02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:42.000
<v Speaker 5>This is supposed to be like sneakers </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3184
02:23:42.130 --> 02:23:44.120
<v Speaker 5>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't buy the advertising,</v>

3185
02:23:45.230 --> 02:23:49.850
<v Speaker 5>but well here's 80 bucks.</v>

3186
02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Boasts strings cut all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Accidentally this bow strings or they're</v>

3187
02:23:54.731 --> 02:23:56.500
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an invulnerable.</v>

3188
02:23:56.501 --> 02:23:57.790
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in Hawaii,</v>

3189
02:23:57.820 --> 02:24:01.210
<v Speaker 3>I accidentally cut one of my bow strings</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the broadhead from the arrow.</v>

3190
02:24:01.211 --> 02:24:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Just touched it and I didn't even know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened.</v>

3191
02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:08.740
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that stuff for fishing line,</v>

3192
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:12.730
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a synthetic line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how exactly they make it.</v>

3193
02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.863
<v Speaker 3>I think it's got to be different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of different kinds </v>

3194
02:24:15.191 --> 02:24:17.950
<v Speaker 3>of fishing line too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have braided fishing line.</v>

3195
02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:21.520
<v Speaker 3>that's like the most common stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they use today.</v>

3196
02:24:21.521 --> 02:24:22.091
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3197
02:24:22.091 --> 02:24:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Fish were mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3198
02:24:25.631 --> 02:24:26.464
<v Speaker 3>mostly salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>water fly fishing boat fishing in the </v>

3199
02:24:30.431 --> 02:24:31.264
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great to catch fish and then you </v>

3200
02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:36.400
<v Speaker 3>bring it like if you stay in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant or a hotel on mercury,</v>

3201
02:24:36.770 --> 02:24:37.603
<v Speaker 3>mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can definitely get some mercury in </v>

3202
02:24:39.911 --> 02:24:42.810
<v Speaker 3>your body if you eat a lot of salmon or </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you love tuna rather.</v>

3203
02:24:42.930 --> 02:24:43.763
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just say don't eat it all the </v>

3204
02:24:46.991 --> 02:24:48.470
<v Speaker 3>time every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3205
02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:51.100
<v Speaker 3>but with the amount of heavy metals that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are in the ocean,</v>

3206
02:24:51.101 --> 02:24:51.934
<v Speaker 3>you're definitely going to get some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much of it they're </v>

3207
02:24:53.261 --> 02:24:55.340
<v Speaker 3>actually testing though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like have you ever been?</v>

3208
02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:58.100
<v Speaker 3>I'd get my blood tested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never shown it.</v>

3209
02:24:58.101 --> 02:25:02.830
<v Speaker 3>I did at one point in time I was eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of sardines and it tested positive</v>

3210
02:25:02.831 --> 02:25:06.660
<v Speaker 3>for arsenic and the doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3211
02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:09.130
<v Speaker 3>it was a very tiny amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The doctor was like,</v>

3212
02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:11.320
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do like go through your diet?</v>

3213
02:25:11.350 --> 02:25:12.850
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as I hit sardines,</v>

3214
02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:13.661
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how often you eat?</v>

3215
02:25:13.661 --> 02:25:15.460
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat like two cans a day.</v>

3216
02:25:15.690 --> 02:25:17.260
<v Speaker 3>Just like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

3217
02:25:17.261 --> 02:25:18.050
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

3218
02:25:18.050 --> 02:25:19.060
<v Speaker 3>I think he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3219
02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:22.000
<v Speaker 3>they live in very polluted areas often </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're at the bottom.</v>

3220
02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 3>They collect some of</v>

3221
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:25.630
<v Speaker 5>the heavy metals that comes from our </v>
<v Speaker 5>polluted.</v>

3222
02:25:26.770 --> 02:25:28.990
<v Speaker 5>How often?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not every day,</v>

3223
02:25:28.991 --> 02:25:31.030
<v Speaker 5>not two cans a day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I eat it can last night.</v>

3224
02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:33.430

<v Speaker 5>Why do you have to do in canned?</v>

3225
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:36.220
<v Speaker 5>Because you don't.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like I can only make noises.</v>

3261
02:26:58.750 --> 02:27:00.790
<v Speaker 5>It's a muscle ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

3262
02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:03.310
<v Speaker 5>I think is a sound that you're capable </v>
<v Speaker 5>of making,</v>

3263
02:27:03.311 --> 02:27:05.140
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like impressions.</v>

3264
02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:09.220
<v Speaker 5>I can do impressions of some people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I know when I could do them.</v>

3265
02:27:09.610 --> 02:27:11.540
<v Speaker 5>Are they in your same register?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Sam kinison oppression.</v>

3267
02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:14.200
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I can do that.</v>

3268
02:27:14.201 --> 02:27:17.050
<v Speaker 5>If I could listen to them in particular </v>
<v Speaker 5>can do it.</v>

3269
02:27:17.051 --> 02:27:19.570
<v Speaker 5>Then you could just got to get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I cAn do a Mike Tyson.</v>

3270
02:27:19.571 --> 02:27:20.404
<v Speaker 5>I can do a few of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there's other ones that I hear </v>

3271
02:27:21.911 --> 02:27:23.050
<v Speaker 5>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do that one.</v>

3272
02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:25.530
<v Speaker 5>Apparently people are good at </v>
<v Speaker 5>impressions are good at singing.</v>

3273
02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:27.070
<v Speaker 5>It's the same part of your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3274
02:27:27.350 --> 02:27:29.590
<v Speaker 5>Like you hear something and can </v>
<v Speaker 5>replicate it.</v>

3275
02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:32.740
<v Speaker 5>It's about hearing not about replicating</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something.</v>

3276
02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:34.870
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's singing is a weird thing,</v>

3277
02:27:34.871 --> 02:27:35.704
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's mariah carey style singing </v>

3278
02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:40.230
<v Speaker 5>and then there's amy winehouse saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>this coming.</v>

3281
02:27:47.090 --> 02:27:47.923
<v Speaker 5>I say the difference like mariah carey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say she's known for </v>

3282
02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:55.940
<v Speaker 5>songwriting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whereas amy wants different artists,</v>

3283
02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:57.640
<v Speaker 5>but like that fantasy song.</v>

<v Speaker 5>believe you just said that.</v>

3287
02:28:04.571 --> 02:28:07.060
<v Speaker 5>Me and mariah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>back leg babies.</v>

3288

<v Speaker 5>I listened to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like my go to song.</v>

3289
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:11.630

<v Speaker 3>someone told me that they were told by a</v>

<v Speaker 3>called them and told them to take then </v>
<v Speaker 3>affleck's basketball court that he has </v>

3325
02:30:03.601 --> 02:30:07.740
<v Speaker 3>and move it to her house and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3328
02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:15.550
<v Speaker 3>I want to move his basketball court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did.</v>

3329
02:30:15.570 --> 02:30:19.230
<v Speaker 3>She wanted them to literally build a </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball court in her.</v>

3330
02:30:19.260 --> 02:30:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm sure palatial estate that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>his.</v>

3331
02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:23.573
<v Speaker 3>He has an indoor basketball court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wanted them to recreate it at her </v>

3332
02:30:26.221 --> 02:30:27.054
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it board by board and move it to </v>

3333
02:30:29.191 --> 02:30:30.750
<v Speaker 3>her place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if that is true,</v>

3334
02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:31.673
<v Speaker 3>and it may not be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might just be bullshit that somebody </v>

02:30:32.821 --> 02:30:34.680
<v Speaker 3>told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I loved it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that she thought it would be a good move</v>

3343
02:30:56.731 --> 02:30:59.750

<v Speaker 3>I</v>

3344
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:02.580
<v Speaker 5>like it when women throw money around </v>
<v Speaker 5>and give gifts,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't do it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm very beta in my relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but something I do wonder is apparently </v>

3411
02:33:50.390 --> 02:33:51.223
<v Speaker 4>giving his masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm always curious if guys like </v>

3412
02:33:54.291 --> 02:33:58.070
<v Speaker 4>expensive gifts or if they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have an opinion.</v>

3413
02:33:58.160 --> 02:33:58.993
<v Speaker 4>We're dating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting you a watch or you were </v>

3414
02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.410
<v Speaker 4>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I wouldn't know.</v>

3415
02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:08.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm not because I buy guys watches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's very sweet.</v>

3416
02:34:08.301 --> 02:34:10.250
<v Speaker 4>That's the nice thing about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

3417
02:34:10.251 --> 02:34:12.300
<v Speaker 4>I gotta buy this pitch something now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3418
02:34:12.890 --> 02:34:13.840
<v Speaker 4>I would think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3419
02:34:14.610 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to feel like I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to feel like keeping</v>

3420
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:19.990
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I get you a,</v>

3421
02:34:20.170 --> 02:34:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking another salt lamp or whatever.</v>

3422
02:34:24.311 --> 02:34:26.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not a strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So salt lamp.</v>

3423
02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:30.370
<v Speaker 1>if I get you something fancy or pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a trip or something,</v>

3424
02:34:30.371 --> 02:34:33.010
<v Speaker 1>do you like it or do you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>gross?</v>

3425
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I think ideally this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like shit,</v>

3426
02:34:37.601 --> 02:34:39.340
<v Speaker 1>but I'm being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think ideally,</v>

3427
02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:43.330
<v Speaker 1>especially in the situation where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like you has a lot of money.</v>

3428
02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any guy looks really give </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all to dogs and sick relatives,</v>

3429
02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:52.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting.</v>

3430
02:34:52.690 --> 02:34:53.523
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3431
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:55.390
<v Speaker 1>you don't have an issue with money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3432
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:58.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like the person that you're dating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're successful,</v>

3433
02:34:58.270 --> 02:35:00.250
<v Speaker 1>likely they don't have an issue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>money either.</v>

3434
02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:02.140
<v Speaker 1>So if people don'T have an issue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

3435
02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:05.410
<v Speaker 1>money should just be like fun coupons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll be like,</v>

3436
02:35:05.411 --> 02:35:10.411
<v Speaker 1>what can we do something that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any money?</v>

3437
02:35:11.710 --> 02:35:12.543
<v Speaker 1>Then it becomes weird and it could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what kind of relationship </v>

3438
02:35:16.331 --> 02:35:17.830
<v Speaker 1>you have with the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But It also,</v>

3439
02:35:17.831 --> 02:35:19.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3440
02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:21.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the purpose of this?</v>

3441
02:35:21.071 --> 02:35:23.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like a control thing or is it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3442
02:35:23.350 --> 02:35:24.790
<v Speaker 1>let's go have fun thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3443
02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:26.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if ben affleck was dating </v>

3444
02:35:29.561 --> 02:35:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lopez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both fucking kajillion.</v>

3445
02:35:31.630 --> 02:35:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

3446
02:35:34.060 --> 02:35:35.320
<v Speaker 1>here's a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the whatever.</v>

3447
02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if ben orders the private jet,</v>

3448
02:35:38.500 --> 02:35:39.880
<v Speaker 1>jennifer doesn't go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you bitch.</v>

3449
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't even know.</v>

3450
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:45.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

3451
02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:46.451
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3452
02:35:46.451 --> 02:35:47.440
<v Speaker 1>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coupons.</v>

3453
02:35:47.530 --> 02:35:50.920
<v Speaker 1>They feel like money is the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>frontier of weird.</v>

3454
02:35:51.710 --> 02:35:53.230
<v Speaker 1>It can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's anonymous.</v>

3455
02:35:53.570 --> 02:35:54.403
<v Speaker 1>It's just so symbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like now I've had financial </v>

3456
02:35:57.371 --> 02:36:00.400
<v Speaker 1>arrangements with friends before they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>south and it just gets real weird.</v>

3457
02:36:00.610 --> 02:36:01.443
<v Speaker 1>If you were dating now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say we're some alternative string </v>

3458
02:36:04.091 --> 02:36:04.924
<v Speaker 1>theory universe where you were dating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you pay for everything if you're </v>

3459
02:36:07.421 --> 02:36:08.380
<v Speaker 1>starting from scratch?</v>

3460
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:11.620
<v Speaker 1>If I was starting from scratch with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new person,</v>

3461
02:36:12.130 --> 02:36:12.963
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the person didn't have money and one </v>

3462
02:36:15.401 --> 02:36:18.730
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons why I like paying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because I like to tip a lot,</v>

3463
02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:21.160
<v Speaker 1>but what if you date someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

3464
02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:23.860
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you split it.</v>

3465
02:36:23.861 --> 02:36:24.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my friends,</v>

3466
02:36:24.611 --> 02:36:25.444
<v Speaker 1>like if I go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend stayed with a woman is </v>

3467
02:36:26.531 --> 02:36:28.720
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it depends.</v>

3468
02:36:28.730 --> 02:36:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I would be more than happy to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't give a fuck,</v>

3469
02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:34.360
<v Speaker 1>but if they for some reason wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay,</v>

3470
02:36:34.361 --> 02:36:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't give a fuck about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

3471
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:39.850
<v Speaker 1>But like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it didn't feel weird.</v>

3472
02:36:39.970 --> 02:36:40.803
<v Speaker 1>But like I've met guys where the guide </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make any money and the woman </v>

3473
02:36:43.841 --> 02:36:44.674
<v Speaker 1>makes a ton of money and the woman pays </v>
<v Speaker 1>for everything and that relationship </v>

3474
02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:50.230
<v Speaker 1>always gets squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

3475
02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:51.990
<v Speaker 1>World.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm your mother,</v>

3476
02:36:52.270 --> 02:36:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't correlate the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can work.</v>

3477
02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:56.073
<v Speaker 1>Like if the guy has a ton of money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman does it definitely can work </v>

3478
02:36:59.580 --> 02:37:01.110
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>

3479
02:37:01.570 --> 02:37:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's alpha though.</v>

3480
02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:05.793
<v Speaker 1>It's just not likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not likely that that's going to </v>

3481
02:37:07.181 --> 02:37:08.014
<v Speaker 1>work for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never know if paying makes things </v>

3482
02:37:10.751 --> 02:37:12.370
<v Speaker 1>weird or if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3483
02:37:12.490 --> 02:37:13.323
<v Speaker 1>like beyonce and jay z.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they give a fuck about who </v>

3484
02:37:15.381 --> 02:37:16.280
<v Speaker 1>pays for something</v>

3485
02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:20.000
<v Speaker 5>that sells bell?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am the happiest person on the planet.</v>

3486
02:37:20.001 --> 02:37:21.350
<v Speaker 5>That would be hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sammut.</v>

3487
02:37:21.410 --> 02:37:24.560
<v Speaker 5>Now I got the shampoo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you could just put this into carts,</v>

3488
02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:29.710
<v Speaker 5>but I think you're obligated at that </v>
<v Speaker 5>level of fame to tip ridiculously.</v>

3489
02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:30.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3490
02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:33.410
<v Speaker 5>I just heard somewhere that 20 percent </v>
<v Speaker 5>is actually not a good tip.</v>

3491
02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:34.573
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3492
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:36.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a good tip.</v>

3493
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:37.063
<v Speaker 5>Someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a friend of mine who has a daughter </v>

3494
02:37:38.121 --> 02:37:39.980
<v Speaker 5>who's a waitress,</v>
<v Speaker 5>said the waitress is like,</v>

3495
02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:43.420
<v Speaker 5>that's now not so what is it now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty five.</v>

3496
02:37:43.930 --> 02:37:46.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess so give me all your money.</v>

3497
02:37:46.131 --> 02:37:47.280
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is that?</v>

3498
02:37:47.950 --> 02:37:51.370
<v Speaker 5>It's just like such a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm always standard standard</v>

3499
02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:54.590
<v Speaker 5>20th expecting used to be 15.</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3500
02:37:54.690 --> 02:37:55.523
<v Speaker 5>You start working at a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One oF the last jobs I had was like a </v>

3501
02:38:01.490 --> 02:38:02.323
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a brand new restaurant and the </v>

3502
02:38:03.411 --> 02:38:04.244
<v Speaker 5>rule they were coming up with to decide </v>
<v Speaker 5>how much we had to tip out to our </v>

3503
02:38:06.771 --> 02:38:11.771
<v Speaker 5>coworkers was basing it off of us </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting 20 percent off of every table.</v>

3504
02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:13.700
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty percent is expected.</v>

3505
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:14.743
<v Speaker 5>Fucked up Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because then they're screwing you </v>

3506
02:38:16.311 --> 02:38:18.140
<v Speaker 5>because you know there's gonna be a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of cheap people.</v>

3507
02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:20.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen some people leave some fucking</v>

3508
02:38:20.241 --> 02:38:22.440
<v Speaker 5>horrendous tips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really bothers.</v>

3509
02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:24.260
<v Speaker 5>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is my number one pet peeve.</v>

3510
02:38:24.261 --> 02:38:25.970
<v Speaker 5>It makes me sick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just so selfish.</v>

3511
02:38:26.010 --> 02:38:26.843
<v Speaker 5>Unless you're super broke and like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're barely pay and then honestly you </v>

3512
02:38:29.841 --> 02:38:32.510
<v Speaker 5>probably shouldn't be just don't be </v>
<v Speaker 5>going out to restaurants,</v>

3513
02:38:32.750 --> 02:38:33.880
<v Speaker 5>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But how do you,</v>

3514
02:38:33.890 --> 02:38:35.150
<v Speaker 5>how are people supposed to know this </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff?</v>

3515
02:38:35.151 --> 02:38:38.870
<v Speaker 5>Because I thought it was 15 percent go </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

3516
02:38:38.871 --> 02:38:39.704
<v Speaker 5>That's another service started getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>mad and like we shouldn't be going out </v>

3517
02:38:41.541 --> 02:38:45.170
<v Speaker 5>to eat if you can't afford a 20 percent </v>
<v Speaker 5>tip and then add 20 percent to the whole</v>

3518
02:38:45.171 --> 02:38:46.004
<v Speaker 5>bill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a place that I go to a sushi </v>

3519
02:38:47.361 --> 02:38:52.361
<v Speaker 5>place to put the tip on the bill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Always kinda liked that hotels.</v>

3520
02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:53.473
<v Speaker 5>It's always a gratuity included,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like how shitty is your </v>

3521
02:38:55.461 --> 02:38:59.480
<v Speaker 5>clientele that you have to include </v>
<v Speaker 5>gratuity because you don't trust them?</v>

3522
02:38:59.780 --> 02:39:01.850
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not necessarily that.</v>

3523
02:39:01.851 --> 02:39:03.800
<v Speaker 5>It's just like you take it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>equation.</v>

3524
02:39:04.250 --> 02:39:05.850
<v Speaker 5>It's nice to not have to think about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and be like,</v>

3525
02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:08.630
<v Speaker 5>just like that's the worst part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the day when you're like,</v>

3526
02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:10.520
<v Speaker 5>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the percentage?</v>

3527
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:13.700
<v Speaker 5>It's weird that those people who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>working don't get paid.</v>

3528
02:39:13.701 --> 02:39:15.590
<v Speaker 5>RIght?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They only get paid through tips.</v>

3529
02:39:15.591 --> 02:39:18.580
<v Speaker 5>Like people say they rely on your tips </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a way to do.</v>

3530
02:39:18.590 --> 02:39:21.240
<v Speaker 5>Only make tips that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea.</v>

3531
02:39:21.470 --> 02:39:23.090
<v Speaker 5>why don't you pay them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>like why are they.</v>

3532
02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:25.820
<v Speaker 5>Why don't they get some kind of lump sum</v>
<v Speaker 5>can fire them,</v>

3533
02:39:25.821 --> 02:39:27.440
<v Speaker 5>but you don't have to pay them or you </v>
<v Speaker 5>pay them.</v>

3534
02:39:27.441 --> 02:39:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Very little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good insurance?</v>

3535
02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:30.650
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where did you work in Ohio,</v>

3536
02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:31.910
<v Speaker 5>which is a right to work state.</v>

3537
02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:33.530
<v Speaker 5>What kind of restaurant?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3538
02:39:33.531 --> 02:39:37.220
<v Speaker 5>all kinds I worked at a chain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Opens up health insurance.</v>

3539
02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:37.590
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3540
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.771
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3541
02:39:37.771 --> 02:39:38.350
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3542
02:39:38.350 --> 02:39:41.720
<v Speaker 5>Just tips is also pre obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know how actually works now,</v>

3543
02:39:41.721 --> 02:39:44.420
<v Speaker 5>but like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have been able to afford it.</v>

3544
02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:45.673
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much money a night in tips for a </v>

3545
02:39:47.361 --> 02:39:48.194
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also different between guys and </v>

3546
02:39:49.191 --> 02:39:50.024
<v Speaker 5>girls there too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that like the one profession where </v>

3547
02:39:52.551 --> 02:39:53.384
<v Speaker 5>guys get fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a woman's game was discussing the </v>

3548
02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:00.560
<v Speaker 5>other night and we kind of came to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conclusion that might be not for sure,</v>

3549
02:40:00.561 --> 02:40:01.394
<v Speaker 5>but it might be that um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say a guy's taking care of the </v>

3550
02:40:03.591 --> 02:40:04.424
<v Speaker 5>bill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he might feel shittier or it might be </v>

3551
02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:07.733
<v Speaker 5>more okay being shittier to a guy than a</v>
<v Speaker 5>girl that's taken care of them for </v>

3552
02:40:11.781 --> 02:40:12.614
<v Speaker 5>whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Might be lots of things could play into </v>

3553
02:40:13.921 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3554
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:14.933
<v Speaker 9>But that's kind of where we arrived to </v>
<v Speaker 9>where we're all sitting and really </v>

3555
02:40:17.610 --> 02:40:19.070
<v Speaker 9>servers to two of the girls talking.</v>

3556
02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:20.033
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of men have weird competition </v>

3557
02:40:20.811 --> 02:40:21.644
<v Speaker 5>issues with other men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's got him some guys bringing your </v>

3558
02:40:22.851 --> 02:40:23.271
<v Speaker 5>food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

3559
02:40:23.271 --> 02:40:24.670
<v Speaker 5>fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can shitty.</v>

3560
02:40:24.700 --> 02:40:24.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3561
02:40:24.990 --> 02:40:27.420
<v Speaker 9>just shitty of that way and like you </v>
<v Speaker 9>don't want to be mean to a girl.</v>

3562
02:40:27.421 --> 02:40:29.400
<v Speaker 9>You don't want to make her cry if that </v>
<v Speaker 9>might not happen,</v>

3563
02:40:29.401 --> 02:40:32.040
<v Speaker 9>but you just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You think it could and you just make all</v>

3564
02:40:32.041 --> 02:40:33.240
<v Speaker 9>your decisions based off of that.</v>

3565
02:40:33.330 --> 02:40:35.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is so nuts.</v>

3566
02:40:35.011 --> 02:40:36.900
<v Speaker 5>I never thought about like being a male </v>
<v Speaker 5>waiter,</v>

3567
02:40:36.901 --> 02:40:39.480
<v Speaker 5>you're going to make less money than a </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman probably.</v>

3568
02:40:39.630 --> 02:40:41.490
<v Speaker 5>Unless you're really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a sexist professional,</v>

3569
02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:42.353
<v Speaker 5>but you're a really good restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You like a really good male waiter who </v>

3570
02:40:45.151 --> 02:40:48.040
<v Speaker 5>knows exactly what kind of fucking dijon</v>
<v Speaker 5>salt,</v>

3571
02:40:48.410 --> 02:40:49.460
<v Speaker 5>the preparation</v>

3572
02:40:49.730 --> 02:40:50.563
<v Speaker 9>then it's.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You have to be almost way above and </v>

3573
02:40:52.231 --> 02:40:56.050
<v Speaker 9>beyond the job knowing way deep being </v>
<v Speaker 9>anticipating everything.</v>

3574
02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:59.250
<v Speaker 9>100 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Maybe it was a good decent night,</v>

3575
02:40:59.251 --> 02:41:01.710
<v Speaker 9>but like out here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you'd be expecting to make three or $400</v>

3576
02:41:01.711 --> 02:41:03.330
<v Speaker 9>a night or you wouldn't probably </v>
<v Speaker 9>survive.</v>

3577
02:41:03.430 --> 02:41:05.080
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of us out here,</v>

3578
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:06.730
<v Speaker 5>you want to work at a place that serves </v>
<v Speaker 5>alcohol though,</v>

3579
02:41:06.731 --> 02:41:09.420
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For for cash.</v>

3580
02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:11.980
<v Speaker 5>That's the only way to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I would think that if you were,</v>

3581
02:41:12.010 --> 02:41:13.880
<v Speaker 5>if you were like a waiter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3582
02:41:14.010 --> 02:41:14.843
<v Speaker 5>like it's always fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most fasting when you go to a nice </v>

3583
02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:19.450
<v Speaker 5>restaurant and the waiters obviously </v>
<v Speaker 5>from Italy.</v>

3584
02:41:20.530 --> 02:41:21.450
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

3585
02:41:21.451 --> 02:41:22.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm coughing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus christ.</v>

3586
02:41:23.250 --> 02:41:24.083
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just have phlegm.</v>

3587
02:41:24.730 --> 02:41:27.370
<v Speaker 5>But if the weight is from Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's more impressive.</v>

3588
02:41:27.430 --> 02:41:28.790
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got a nice title restaurant.</v>

3589
02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:33.130
<v Speaker 5>What do they bring those guys over?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How's that work?</v>

3590
02:41:33.131 --> 02:41:35.080
<v Speaker 5>Do they have like some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>service?</v>

3591
02:41:35.890 --> 02:41:36.723
<v Speaker 5>Restaurants like request the services </v>
<v Speaker 5>because italians take service way more </v>

3592
02:41:41.921 --> 02:41:44.230
<v Speaker 5>seriously than we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody who is working as a waiter,</v>

3593
02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:45.213
<v Speaker 5>I feel like at least certainly out here </v>
<v Speaker 5>is trying to do something else for a </v>

3594
02:41:47.141 --> 02:41:47.560
<v Speaker 5>living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3595
02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:48.393
<v Speaker 5>But it makes your restaurant more legit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't even know who the fuck </v>

3596
02:41:50.801 --> 02:41:51.634
<v Speaker 5>cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could be a straight up white guy in </v>

3597
02:41:52.351 --> 02:41:53.620
<v Speaker 5>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't bother you.</v>

3598
02:41:53.621 --> 02:41:57.160
<v Speaker 5>But as long as it's an italian person </v>
<v Speaker 5>explaining what the right,</v>

3599
02:41:57.610 --> 02:41:59.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an ncaa can of the words,</v>

3600
02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:00.453
<v Speaker 5>you're just enchanted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the most fucked up thing you've </v>

3601
02:42:01.811 --> 02:42:03.940
<v Speaker 5>ever seen a restaurant like restaurants </v>
<v Speaker 5>or just nightmares,</v>

3602
02:42:03.941 --> 02:42:04.770
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3603
02:42:04.770 --> 02:42:05.603
<v Speaker 9>not fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I just remember because I explained </v>

3604
02:42:06.981 --> 02:42:07.814
<v Speaker 9>this to the newer restaurant I worked at</v>
<v Speaker 9>that was expect expecting that 20 </v>

3605
02:42:10.641 --> 02:42:11.474
<v Speaker 9>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The clientele they weRe trying to </v>

3606
02:42:12.111 --> 02:42:14.420
<v Speaker 9>attract with like a white tablecloth </v>
<v Speaker 9>kind of thing.</v>

3607
02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:15.583
<v Speaker 9>Although it was not in that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 9>place and was not that kind of </v>

3608
02:42:17.571 --> 02:42:18.404
<v Speaker 9>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And one of my first tables I got that </v>

3609
02:42:20.331 --> 02:42:22.280
<v Speaker 9>was expecting that service I like </v>
<v Speaker 9>cleared.</v>

3610
02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:25.420
<v Speaker 9>The gentleman's played before his wife </v>
<v Speaker 9>for.</v>

3611
02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:30.080
<v Speaker 9>She was mostly being done eating.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I literally got yelled at about that and</v>

3612
02:42:30.081 --> 02:42:34.940
<v Speaker 9>explain to why you shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And my boss,</v>

3613
02:42:34.941 --> 02:42:37.540
<v Speaker 9>he got yelled at by the client and then </v>
<v Speaker 9>he left the next day.</v>

3614
02:42:37.541 --> 02:42:38.001
<v Speaker 9>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>

3615
02:42:38.001 --> 02:42:38.834
<v Speaker 9>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>don't take people's plates until </v>

3616
02:42:40.701 --> 02:42:41.660
<v Speaker 9>everybody's done.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>

3617
02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:45.740
<v Speaker 9>it's what?</v>
<v Speaker 9>That iS just a weird thing.</v>

3618
02:42:45.741 --> 02:42:46.574
<v Speaker 9>And then</v>

3619
02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:50.000
<v Speaker 5>I hear there's no such thing as chilean </v>
<v Speaker 5>sea bass.</v>

3620
02:42:50.001 --> 02:42:50.834
<v Speaker 5>That's not a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just take white fish and they call </v>

3621
02:42:52.311 --> 02:42:54.490
<v Speaker 5>it a bunch of other shit so they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>charge different things.</v>

3622
02:42:55.310 --> 02:42:59.030
<v Speaker 5>Definitely chilean sea bass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like an invention,</v>

3623
02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:02.330
<v Speaker 5>like a restaurant invention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The look up New York times.</v>

3624
02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:03.193
<v Speaker 5>They also say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't eat sushi in Oklahoma city and </v>

3625
02:43:04.401 --> 02:43:06.080
<v Speaker 5>shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's not what she's saying.</v>

3626
02:43:06.130 --> 02:43:08.720
<v Speaker 5>She's saying chilean sea bass is not a </v>
<v Speaker 5>real fish.</v>

3627
02:43:09.060 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 5>Apparently restaurants just take random </v>
<v Speaker 5>fish and call it a bunch</v>

3628
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:14.150
<v Speaker 1>of fancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3629
02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Chilean sea bass has a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and unique buttery taste to it.</v>

3630
02:43:17.861 --> 02:43:18.694
<v Speaker 1>Like don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of restaurants just take garbage </v>

3631
02:43:20.321 --> 02:43:21.154
<v Speaker 1>fish and put a bunch of salt on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely dancing that they found </v>

3632
02:43:23.531 --> 02:43:25.810
<v Speaker 1>that people lie about the type of sushi </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating.</v>

3633
02:43:25.811 --> 02:43:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes fake fish on your plate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3634
02:43:28.211 --> 02:43:30.250
<v Speaker 1>But that's chilean sea bass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just ordered.</v>

3635
02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:32.950
<v Speaker 1>It isn't a bass and it probably didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from Chile.</v>

3636
02:43:34.490 --> 02:43:37.870
<v Speaker 1>What does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

3637
02:43:38.530 --> 02:43:39.610
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

3638
02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Chilean sea bass is a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>

3639
02:43:42.820 --> 02:43:44.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a bass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cod.</v>

3640
02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:45.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

3641
02:43:45.161 --> 02:43:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Because you know what it tastes like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miso,</v>

3642
02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:48.370
<v Speaker 1>cod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cotton,</v>

3643
02:43:48.380 --> 02:43:49.840
<v Speaker 1>chilean sea bass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buttery.</v>

3644
02:43:50.750 --> 02:43:51.583
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until the late 19 seventies named </v>

3645
02:43:52.661 --> 02:43:53.494
<v Speaker 1>chilean sea bass didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fish went by the unappetizing name </v>

3646
02:43:56.770 --> 02:44:00.340
<v Speaker 1>of the patagonian toothfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3647
02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:02.170
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is an actual animal.</v>

3648
02:44:02.170 --> 02:44:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just not a bass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that makes sense.</v>

3649
02:44:04.091 --> 02:44:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Why it's uniform and its flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's on a bass.</v>

3650
02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:08.980
<v Speaker 1>The cock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's better.</v>

3651
02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Tastes better than bass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's interesting because bass</v>

3652
02:44:11.630 --> 02:44:12.463
<v Speaker 1>doesn't taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most bass is a bass or not like the </v>

3653
02:44:15.071 --> 02:44:18.010
<v Speaker 1>tastiest fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really fishy.</v>

3654
02:44:18.100 --> 02:44:21.820
<v Speaker 1>The large money fast are kind of boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuna used to be cat food.</v>

3655
02:44:22.170 --> 02:44:25.510
<v Speaker 1>It used to be trash fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

3656
02:44:25.810 --> 02:44:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Until the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bluefin tuna was considered a trash fish</v>

3657
02:44:28.301 --> 02:44:29.590
<v Speaker 1>suitable for cat food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

3658
02:44:29.591 --> 02:44:31.600
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most prized fish in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3659
02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:35.800
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the bluefin sushi craze spread across</v>

3660
02:44:35.801 --> 02:44:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Japan from Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States over fishing triggered</v>

3661
02:44:39.041 --> 02:44:42.340
<v Speaker 1>a 95 percent decline in the fish </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

3662
02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

3663
02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Ninety five percent since 19 seventies </v>
<v Speaker 1>going extinct,</v>

3664
02:44:47.861 --> 02:44:48.694
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3665
02:44:48.870 --> 02:44:50.440
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety five percent.</v>

3666
02:44:50.441 --> 02:44:51.274
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like go outside or sick up attend </v>

3667
02:44:53.790 --> 02:44:54.623
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

3668
02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:55.533
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when seafood buyers found the fish </v>

3669
02:44:56.561 --> 02:44:57.394
<v Speaker 1>adaptable in terms of taste and texture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rebranded as chilean sea bass and </v>

3670
02:44:59.951 --> 02:45:02.750
<v Speaker 1>peddled it as a gourmet fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that legal to just lie about.</v>

3671
02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:04.433
<v Speaker 1>Look at what they're saying today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of the fish sold as chilean sea </v>

3672
02:45:06.611 --> 02:45:10.720
<v Speaker 1>bass comes from the an arctic waters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the chilean coast.</v>

3673
02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

3674
02:45:12.340 --> 02:45:13.173
<v Speaker 1>isn't that like false advertising or </v>
<v Speaker 1>like blasphemy or isn't there some law </v>

3675
02:45:15.791 --> 02:45:18.040
<v Speaker 1>against just lying about food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3676
02:45:18.041 --> 02:45:19.360
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look long,</v>

3677
02:45:19.361 --> 02:45:20.194
<v Speaker 1>considered worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The patagonian toothfish can live up to </v>

3678
02:45:22.421 --> 02:45:23.254
<v Speaker 1>50 years and grow to seven feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when seafood buyers found the fish </v>

3679
02:45:26.921 --> 02:45:27.754
<v Speaker 1>adaptable in terms of taste and texture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rebranded it as chilean sea bass </v>

3680
02:45:31.151 --> 02:45:34.330
<v Speaker 1>and peddled it as gore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mayfair scam.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean I joke about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what I was trying to explain to my </v>

3788
02:51:20.451 --> 02:51:22.040
<v Speaker 3>kids something and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>have literally years old,</v>

3790
02:51:24.981 --> 02:51:29.480
<v Speaker 3>some people have brains that are made </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of dog shit and then you find people</v>

3791
02:51:29.481 --> 02:51:31.520
<v Speaker 3>that are dumber than them that let them </v>
<v Speaker 3>have sex with them.</v>

3792
02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:32.393
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they make kids and those kids </v>

3793
02:51:33.141 --> 02:51:34.910

<v Speaker 3>you any different.</v>

3794
02:51:35.630 --> 02:51:40.630
<v Speaker 3>And if you have a really low watt brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you run into some charismatic figure</v>

3795

<v Speaker 3>didn't we just see this happen in </v>

02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 8>I just want to be told what to do by </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone who's confident and alpha.</v>

3806
02:52:06.090 --> 02:52:06.923
<v Speaker 3>It's 100 percent absolutely evident to </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost anybody that I know that's </v>

3807
02:52:10.301 --> 02:52:11.770
<v Speaker 3>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are people out there that are</v>

3808
02:52:11.771 --> 02:52:12.604
<v Speaker 3>far smarter than them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when I have him on my podcast all </v>

3809
02:52:15.011 --> 02:52:18.910
<v Speaker 3>the time I talked to astrophysicists and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and people breaking down the,</v>

3810
02:52:18.911 --> 02:52:19.370
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3811
02:52:19.370 --> 02:52:20.203
<v Speaker 3>the actual fiber of reality and he tried</v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk to them and have them explain </v>

3812
02:52:24.221 --> 02:52:26.160
<v Speaker 3>things to you and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3813
02:52:26.170 --> 02:52:28.930
<v Speaker 3>bundonally clear that I'm not nearly as </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart as them,</v>

3814
02:52:28.990 --> 02:52:29.823
<v Speaker 3>but I talked to a lot of people and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell like somewhere in the </v>

3815
02:52:32.801 --> 02:52:37.160
<v Speaker 3>conversation like this is all you got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work with you.</v>

3816
02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:39.790
<v Speaker 3>We've all met people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's not even their fault.</v>

3817
02:52:39.970 --> 02:52:41.540
<v Speaker 3>It's just like this is what they have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work with it,</v>

3818
02:52:41.550 --> 02:52:42.383
<v Speaker 3>but nobody wants to entertain that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we all want to pretend that we're on </v>

3819
02:52:44.981 --> 02:52:45.814
<v Speaker 3>the same starting line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what if we're not at the same </v>

3820
02:52:47.201 --> 02:52:48.034
<v Speaker 3>starting line with dick size and width </v>
<v Speaker 3>height and with a physical strength and </v>

3821
02:52:52.181 --> 02:52:53.980
<v Speaker 3>with all the other attributes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people possess,</v>

3822
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:56.320
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck would we be on the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>with mine?</v>

3823
02:52:57.220 --> 02:52:58.510
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not real.</v>

3824
02:52:58.540 --> 02:53:02.530
<v Speaker 3>If all of us had the same mind power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd be extinct by now.</v>

3825
02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:04.870
<v Speaker 3>You've all just destroyed each other for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3826
02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:05.913
<v Speaker 3>There's a general sort of range that </v>
<v Speaker 3>most of us fall into and you can for </v>

3827
02:53:09.131 --> 02:53:09.964
<v Speaker 3>sure improve upon that with really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>schooling and and study and discipline </v>

3828
02:53:12.881 --> 02:53:13.714
<v Speaker 3>and supportive family and all the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the good things that we all aware </v>

3829
02:53:16.151 --> 02:53:16.984

02:54:40.290 --> 02:54:41.123
<v Speaker 3>if I hope all their parents are dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>already and luck someone gets killed </v>

3863
02:54:46.691 --> 02:54:48.550
<v Speaker 3>himself during the eclipse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to go somehow.</v>

3864
02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like walking into a wall or falling</v>

3865
02:54:50.861 --> 02:54:53.320
<v Speaker 3>off a building or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good choice.</v>

3866
02:54:54.250 --> 02:54:55.083
<v Speaker 3>It's not the way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think for sure like those people </v>

3867
02:54:58.991 --> 02:55:00.130
<v Speaker 3>are always going to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3868
02:55:00.131 --> 02:55:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Those people like the heaven's gate cult</v>
<v Speaker 3>or who have so little to lose a need to</v>

3869
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:04.813
<v Speaker 1>believe something that exists bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than themselves or their brain doesn't </v>

3870
02:55:08.121 --> 02:55:09.380
<v Speaker 1>work good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3871
02:55:09.381 --> 02:55:14.381
<v Speaker 1>there's certain people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3872
02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:20.030
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3873
02:55:20.470 --> 02:55:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Just doesn't work that good no matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

3874
02:55:24.110 --> 02:55:25.460
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3875
02:55:25.550 --> 02:55:27.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3876
02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:32.440
<v Speaker 1>this is spelt wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it even knows that.</v>

3877
02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:35.770
<v Speaker 1>So you're just operating on another </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

3878
02:55:35.771 --> 02:55:36.790
<v Speaker 1>But there's some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3879
02:55:36.830 --> 02:55:37.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3880
02:55:37.511 --> 02:55:39.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a fact like they can be.</v>

3881
02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:42.860
<v Speaker 1>There's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like open ended pursuits,</v>

3882
02:55:42.861 --> 02:55:44.870
<v Speaker 1>like standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It attracts those people,</v>

3883
02:55:44.871 --> 02:55:45.704
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need those perpetual open miker who </v>

3884
02:55:47.870 --> 02:55:49.390
<v Speaker 1>are convinced that some labs.</v>

3885
02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:50.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we're not going to be heat.</v>

3887
02:55:52.450 --> 02:55:53.283
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is one of my favorite </v>

3888
02:55:55.540 --> 02:55:57.520
<v Speaker 2>documentaries on the plate or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

3889
02:55:57.550 --> 02:56:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Movies on the planet a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's heartbreaking but amazing.</v>

3890
02:56:01.050 --> 02:56:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3891
02:56:01.550 --> 02:56:02.383
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unreal,</v>

3892
02:56:02.390 --> 02:56:03.223
<v Speaker 2>it's almost as good as that r kelly </v>
<v Speaker 2>video you showed me in terms of the </v>

3893
02:56:05.441 --> 02:56:06.274
<v Speaker 2>emotions that evokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But dId you ever see the guy at the </v>

3896
02:56:10.810 --> 02:56:14.050
<v Speaker 2>I think you missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on the porch of the comedy store,</v>

3897
02:56:14.051 --> 02:56:16.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the front patio for like a good year.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dollhouse giant doll house.</v>

3899
02:56:19.610 --> 02:56:20.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a way to get people look at you </v>

3900
02:56:21.051 --> 02:56:25.610
<v Speaker 1>and jesus guy and jesus guys got gotta </v>
<v Speaker 1>look weird in because he's dressed up as</v>

3901
02:56:25.611 --> 02:56:26.444
<v Speaker 1>jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if the same guy dressed up as </v>

3902
02:56:27.711 --> 02:56:29.930
<v Speaker 1>mohammed people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>

3903
02:56:30.350 --> 02:56:31.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when,</v>

3904
02:56:31.750 --> 02:56:35.240
<v Speaker 1>when you're that guy who dresses up as </v>
<v Speaker 1>jesus on sunset,</v>

3905
02:56:35.540 --> 02:56:36.950
<v Speaker 1>he's probably listening right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying.</v>

3906
02:56:36.980 --> 02:56:39.020
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that life look like?</v>

3907
02:56:39.230 --> 02:56:40.880
<v Speaker 1>What's your life look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tweet me.</v>

3908
02:56:43.550 --> 02:56:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Google his network.</v>

3909
02:56:45.540 --> 02:56:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Either a trust fund kid and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaire.</v>

3910
02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:48.953
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

3911
02:56:50.230 --> 02:56:53.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just probably not the smartest way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live.</v>

3912
02:56:53.811 --> 02:56:58.811
<v Speaker 1>But the message that he's given when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>walks around like that is of one who was</v>

3913
02:56:59.691 --> 02:57:02.090
<v Speaker 1>a disciple of jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see him,</v>

3914
02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:05.740
<v Speaker 1>he looks like jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's dressed like jesus and you think,</v>

3915
02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:06.350
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

3916
02:57:06.350 --> 02:57:08.840
<v Speaker 1>probably find out if he's jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

3917
02:57:10.630 --> 02:57:12.370
<v Speaker 2>right is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if I,</v>

3918
02:57:12.490 --> 02:57:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't really my beliefs is done.</v>

3919
02:57:14.291 --> 02:57:16.330
<v Speaker 2>But if jesus were to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are we going to go?</v>

3920
02:57:16.331 --> 02:57:17.164
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3921
02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:19.160
<v Speaker 1>He would have to show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3922
02:57:19.161 --> 02:57:21.000
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be in Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take pictures and things.</v>

3923
02:57:21.010 --> 02:57:21.843
<v Speaker 1>She was the crazy homeless guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people that are convinced that </v>

3924
02:57:23.391 --> 02:57:24.224
<v Speaker 1>jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he returns is going to return to </v>

3925
02:57:25.341 --> 02:57:26.174
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to secure the safety of </v>

3926
02:57:27.111 --> 02:57:27.944
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those really super evangelical </v>

3927
02:57:29.751 --> 02:57:30.584
<v Speaker 1>christians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3928
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Piece that advice piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While these people go over to Israel,</v>

3929
02:57:34.250 --> 02:57:37.040
<v Speaker 1>all these southerners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these southerners that a real,</v>

3930
02:57:37.070 --> 02:57:37.903
<v Speaker 1>real familiar with the lord's word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go over there and they're </v>

3931
02:57:40.281 --> 02:57:41.114
<v Speaker 1>literally talking about like where jesus</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to return and it's going to be </v>

3932
02:57:43.761 --> 02:57:44.594
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3933
02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I was going to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speak up on high.</v>

3934
02:57:47.300 --> 02:57:50.120
<v Speaker 1>They voted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about.</v>

3935
02:57:50.740 --> 02:57:51.573
<v Speaker 1>This is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the area that's dictated in the </v>

3936
02:57:53.331 --> 02:57:56.210
<v Speaker 1>bible more where he will return,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where your talk was,</v>

3937
02:57:56.211 --> 02:57:57.044
<v Speaker 1>that crazy thing called where they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to Israel and they end up taking </v>

3938
02:57:59.031 --> 02:58:00.740
<v Speaker 1>off all their clothes and jerusalem </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndrome.</v>

3939
02:58:02.250 --> 02:58:03.083
<v Speaker 3>Jerusalem syndrome is like a mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marin actually wrote a book called </v>

3940
02:58:06.301 --> 02:58:08.340
<v Speaker 3>jerusalem syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3941
02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:10.231
<v Speaker 3>But it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3942
02:58:10.231 --> 02:58:11.064
<v Speaker 3>it's people that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a relatively common thing that </v>

3943
02:58:14.281 --> 02:58:17.730
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go to Israel and they,</v>

3944
02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:20.580
<v Speaker 3>they think that they're like a messiah </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they freak out.</v>

3945
02:58:20.610 --> 02:58:22.500
<v Speaker 3>They think that they're hearing the word</v>
<v Speaker 3>of god.</v>

3946
02:58:22.501 --> 02:58:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that,</v>

3947
02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:25.870
<v Speaker 3>am I reading this wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of people do this.</v>

3948
02:58:26.430 --> 02:58:27.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a couple of year.</v>

3949
02:58:28.650 --> 02:58:29.483
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they literally have a name for </v>

3950
02:58:30.451 --> 02:58:33.030
<v Speaker 3>it called the jerusalem syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

3951
02:58:33.510 --> 02:58:36.510
<v Speaker 3>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or jeremiah says,</v>

3952
02:58:36.511 --> 02:58:37.700
<v Speaker 3>a group of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3953
02:58:37.970 --> 02:58:38.803
<v Speaker 3>a group of mental phenomena involving </v>
<v Speaker 3>the presence of either religiosity </v>

3954
02:58:42.811 --> 02:58:44.820
<v Speaker 3>themed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessive ideas,</v>

3955
02:58:45.060 --> 02:58:45.893
<v Speaker 3>delusions or other psychosis like </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences that are triggered by a </v>

3956
02:58:50.821 --> 02:58:53.670
<v Speaker 3>visit to the city of jerusalem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3957
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:56.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3958
02:58:56.250 --> 02:59:00.390
<v Speaker 3>It's not a demo to a single religion or </v>
<v Speaker 3>denomination is affected jews.</v>

3959
02:59:00.391 --> 02:59:03.090
<v Speaker 3>ChrIstians and muslims have many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different backgrounds,</v>

3960
02:59:04.410 --> 02:59:06.660
<v Speaker 3>but when they go to jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's really crazy.</v>

3961
02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Tourism wobble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poison,</v>

3962
02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:12.450
<v Speaker 3>imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerusalem really is a holy place.</v>

3963
02:59:13.060 --> 02:59:16.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll go there and only some people can </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear the calling.</v>

3964
02:59:16.771 --> 02:59:18.390
<v Speaker 3>What if we're wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could be wrong.</v>

3965
02:59:18.420 --> 02:59:20.370
<v Speaker 3>We're arrogant left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're telling us about this,</v>

3966
02:59:20.371 --> 02:59:21.204
<v Speaker 3>said that I feel like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said that most of them were </v>

3967
02:59:22.261 --> 02:59:24.780
<v Speaker 3>southerners from the us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they're the dumbest people,</v>

3968
02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:29.500
<v Speaker 2>but do you know about art?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Used to listen to you.</v>

3969
02:59:29.910 --> 02:59:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about the hookworm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can epidemic in the south,</v>

3970
02:59:32.670 --> 02:59:33.503
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of the reason that they </v>

3971
02:59:34.591 --> 02:59:38.070
<v Speaker 2>were slow is because people in the south</v>
<v Speaker 2>all head hookworm will explain that.</v>

3972
02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:39.870
<v Speaker 2>This is recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you look this up please?</v>

3973
02:59:39.871 --> 02:59:40.704
<v Speaker 2>I listened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on how stuff works or </v>

3974
02:59:42.721 --> 02:59:43.800
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

3975
02:59:44.110 --> 02:59:44.943
<v Speaker 2>Because of the heat and the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>south is so humid that hookworm was so </v>

3976
02:59:47.491 --> 02:59:48.324
<v Speaker 2>prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were founding hookworm and all of </v>

3977
02:59:49.231 --> 02:59:50.064
<v Speaker 2>their feces and it eats away your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and something like 70 percent of all </v>

3978
02:59:53.821 --> 02:59:56.910
<v Speaker 2>southerners had hookworm until like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forties.</v>

3979
02:59:57.440 --> 02:59:58.273
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you look that up and corroborate </v>

3980
02:59:59.791 --> 03:00:00.624
<v Speaker 2>that so that I'm not just lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is scientific explanation for </v>

3981
03:00:04.141 --> 03:00:05.310
<v Speaker 2>southerners being slower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

3982
03:00:05.311 --> 03:00:06.180
<v Speaker 2>southerners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>

3983
03:00:06.420 --> 03:00:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3984
03:00:06.930 --> 03:00:08.850
<v Speaker 3>But some of them are super smartly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy carter.</v>

3985
03:00:09.020 --> 03:00:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

3986
03:00:10.020 --> 03:00:12.120
<v Speaker 2>but like this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3987
03:00:12.530 --> 03:00:14.790
<v Speaker 2>and who was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it roosevelt who tried to.</v>

3988
03:00:14.850 --> 03:00:15.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was</v>

3989
03:00:16.080 --> 03:00:17.480
<v Speaker 3>rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weren't lazy,</v>

3990
03:00:17.481 --> 03:00:18.314
<v Speaker 3>just infected with hookworms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A story of the postbellum south as told </v>

3991
03:00:22.341 --> 03:00:24.650
<v Speaker 3>by parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy shit.</v>

3992
03:00:24.651 --> 03:00:26.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes your teeth fall out and it eats</v>

3993
03:00:26.291 --> 03:00:27.124
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain got stereotypes are almost </v>

3994
03:00:28.430 --> 03:00:29.263
<v Speaker 3>always the conclusion of lazy science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just empirical generalizations </v>

3995
03:00:34.010 --> 03:00:34.843
<v Speaker 3>that are stripped are the variances and </v>
<v Speaker 3>encoded as fact into the collective </v>

3996
03:00:38.451 --> 03:00:40.670
<v Speaker 3>consciousness of the general population </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

3997
03:00:40.671 --> 03:00:41.510
<v Speaker 3>to bubba bubba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

3998
03:00:41.511 --> 03:00:41.840
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

3999
03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:42.673
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the stereotype reveals a </v>

4000
03:00:43.821 --> 03:00:46.700
<v Speaker 3>hidden truth that provides an origin to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the myth.</v>

4001
03:00:46.850 --> 03:00:47.683
<v Speaker 3>The trope of the lazy southerner dates </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to america's postbellum period </v>

4002
03:00:50.721 --> 03:00:54.080
<v Speaker 3>following the end of the civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one really knows where it came from,</v>

4003
03:00:54.081 --> 03:00:58.520
<v Speaker 3>but the image of lethargic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>filthy drawing farmer has pervaded art,</v>

4004
03:00:58.550 --> 03:01:02.440
<v Speaker 3>literature and popular culture until up </v>
<v Speaker 3>until this very moment.</v>

4005
03:01:03.340 --> 03:01:05.770
<v Speaker 3>So one argument recently published by </v>
<v Speaker 3>rachel,</v>

4006
03:01:05.771 --> 03:01:06.604
<v Speaker 3>newer for pbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nova techs present some compelling </v>

4007
03:01:08.501 --> 03:01:09.334
<v Speaker 3>evidence for the theory that a hookworm </v>
<v Speaker 3>epidemic was responsible for the rural </v>

4008
03:01:13.421 --> 03:01:14.254
<v Speaker 3>stereotype</v>

4009
03:01:14.810 --> 03:01:19.180
<v Speaker 2>shed laziness through the exhaustion </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental fogginess attends to inflict upon</v>

4010
03:01:19.181 --> 03:01:20.014
<v Speaker 2>its victims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Historical evidence shows that the </v>

4011
03:01:20.861 --> 03:01:23.260
<v Speaker 2>parasite ravaged the american south </v>
<v Speaker 2>route,</v>

4012
03:01:23.261 --> 03:01:24.094
<v Speaker 2>the early 20th century as a result of </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor sanitation and lack of public </v>

4013
03:01:26.201 --> 03:01:29.380
<v Speaker 2>health programs among the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy by 19 oh,</v>

4014
03:01:29.381 --> 03:01:31.240
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parasitologists,</v>

4015
03:01:31.241 --> 03:01:34.990
<v Speaker 2>that's a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a joke.</v>

4016
03:01:35.020 --> 03:01:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Topologist charles says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we 40 percent or more,</v>

4017
03:01:38.590 --> 03:01:39.820
<v Speaker 2>not 60 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wrong,</v>

4018
03:01:39.821 --> 03:01:42.190
<v Speaker 2>of the southern population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was infected with hookworms.</v>

4019
03:01:42.191 --> 03:01:43.024
<v Speaker 2>The parasIte thrives and fecal matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the combination of shoddy waste </v>

4020
03:01:45.061 --> 03:01:46.450
<v Speaker 2>disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the rarity of shoes,</v>

4021
03:01:46.720 --> 03:01:47.553
<v Speaker 2>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no shoes allowed hookworm larvae to </v>

4022
03:01:49.361 --> 03:01:52.000
<v Speaker 2>enter people's bodies through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>webbing between their toes.</v>

4023
03:01:52.001 --> 03:01:54.460
<v Speaker 2>How fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once they penetrate the skin,</v>

4024
03:01:54.461 --> 03:01:55.294
<v Speaker 2>they travel through their hosts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lungs into their intestines where they </v>

4025
03:01:57.551 --> 03:02:00.280
<v Speaker 2>survive on a diet of blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they suck out from the intestinal wall.</v>

4026
03:02:00.281 --> 03:02:03.760
<v Speaker 2>A female hookworm can lay up to 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>eggs in a single day,</v>

4027
03:02:03.761 --> 03:02:04.594
<v Speaker 2>which gives you an idea of how rampant a</v>
<v Speaker 2>localized infestation can become in a </v>

4028
03:02:07.421 --> 03:02:08.254
<v Speaker 2>very short time.</v>

4029
03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:09.153
<v Speaker 2>The laziness that is synonymous with </v>
<v Speaker 2>hookworm a hookworm infections is </v>

4030
03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:15.190
<v Speaker 2>synonym of iron deficiency anemia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Due To blood loss,</v>

4031
03:02:15.191 --> 03:02:17.680
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting bled out.</v>

4032
03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Forty percent of people were anemic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>had blood loss.</v>

4033
03:02:21.311 --> 03:02:22.640
<v Speaker 2>the poor malnourished victims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the paris,</v>

4034
03:02:22.641 --> 03:02:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I can cause stunted growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

4035
03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:26.073
<v Speaker 2>Children with hookworms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're plagued with attention deficit </v>

4036
03:02:27.731 --> 03:02:28.564
<v Speaker 2>disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower iq and the infected often had </v>

4037
03:02:30.131 --> 03:02:33.760
<v Speaker 2>strange food cravings for dirt clay </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper and chalk.</v>

4038
03:02:34.570 --> 03:02:35.403
<v Speaker 2>How nuts is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Southern states where the nexus of </v>

4039
03:02:36.701 --> 03:02:39.850
<v Speaker 2>hookworm friendly climate is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parasite loved the sandy soil that makes</v>

4040
03:02:39.851 --> 03:02:41.290
<v Speaker 2>the real with the region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for at all,</v>

4041
03:02:41.530 --> 03:02:42.363
<v Speaker 2>in 1910,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven point $5 million southerners had </v>

4042
03:02:43.631 --> 03:02:45.430
<v Speaker 2>hookworms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

4043
03:02:46.150 --> 03:02:47.490
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>

4044
03:02:47.980 --> 03:02:48.813
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rockefeller is who donated money to </v>

4045
03:02:50.801 --> 03:02:51.634
<v Speaker 2>try to combat it,</v>

4046
03:02:52.250 --> 03:02:54.140
<v Speaker 3>but that's the illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't he like a.</v>

4047
03:02:55.220 --> 03:02:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this is all a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Started</v>

4048
03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:00.630
<v Speaker 2>50 years for the worm to be eradicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the south.</v>

4049
03:03:00.650 --> 03:03:02.760
<v Speaker 2>In 1960,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was eradicated.</v>

4050
03:03:03.150 --> 03:03:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the sanItation issues,</v>

4051
03:03:06.130 --> 03:03:06.963
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost entirely freed from hookworms by </v>

4052
03:03:08.801 --> 03:03:10.090
<v Speaker 3>1985.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4053
03:03:10.470 --> 03:03:12.540
<v Speaker 2>that was 1:20</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

4054
03:03:13.740 --> 03:03:15.900
<v Speaker 2>So recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely insane.</v>

4055
03:03:16.140 --> 03:03:16.973
<v Speaker 2>Is that nuts?</v>

4056
03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:17.833
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then add that to the fact that half the </v>

4057
03:03:18.891 --> 03:03:21.050
<v Speaker 3>people in the country have </v>
<v Speaker 3>toxoplasmosis.</v>

4058
03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:21.913
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's from cat parasites will know </v>

4059
03:03:23.610 --> 03:03:24.860
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4060
03:03:24.890 --> 03:03:27.200
<v Speaker 3>this is a crazy one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people,</v>

4061
03:03:27.710 --> 03:03:30.980
<v Speaker 3>if you're around for real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're around like farm animals,</v>

4062
03:03:30.981 --> 03:03:33.110
<v Speaker 3>if you're around cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians,</v>

4063
03:03:33.140 --> 03:03:34.770
<v Speaker 3>comedians were all fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

4064
03:03:34.780 --> 03:03:35.670
<v Speaker 3>you're around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4065
03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:36.583
<v Speaker 3>any sort of feral cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a parasite that it only can </v>

4066
03:03:40.431 --> 03:03:44.030
<v Speaker 3>sexually reproduce inside of cats gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So check this out.</v>

4067
03:03:44.540 --> 03:03:45.373
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4068
03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:46.333
<v Speaker 3>these rats get it and it rewires the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rats to make them sexually attracted to </v>

4069
03:03:50.841 --> 03:03:54.320
<v Speaker 3>the smell of cat urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the roads there.</v>

4070
03:03:54.321 --> 03:03:55.154
<v Speaker 3>Fear of cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these rats literally get enlarge and </v>

4071
03:03:59.211 --> 03:04:00.044
<v Speaker 3>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their ball swell up and their dicks get </v>

4072
03:04:01.461 --> 03:04:04.970
<v Speaker 3>hard and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to find the rats and so,</v>

4073
03:04:04.971 --> 03:04:07.070
<v Speaker 3>or they go to find the cat's rather when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to find the cats,</v>

4074
03:04:07.080 --> 03:04:07.913
<v Speaker 3>they get killed.</v>

4075
03:04:08.060 --> 03:04:12.380
<v Speaker 3>The bacteria gets inside the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that doesn't seem to have any effect</v>

4076
03:04:12.381 --> 03:04:13.214
<v Speaker 3>on the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the cat shit has an effect on women </v>

4077
03:04:16.461 --> 03:04:20.150
<v Speaker 3>in particular were they tell women like </v>
<v Speaker 3>see how that rat is not scared,</v>

4078
03:04:20.180 --> 03:04:21.013
<v Speaker 3>not scared at all the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes they chase cats and like </v>

4079
03:04:23.181 --> 03:04:24.890
<v Speaker 3>jump adam and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nuts.</v>

4080
03:04:25.010 --> 03:04:27.340
<v Speaker 3>See look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is going to kill the rat though.</v>

4081
03:04:29.080 --> 03:04:29.913
<v Speaker 3>But the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rats not afraid it's running and </v>

4082
03:04:32.270 --> 03:04:33.103
<v Speaker 3>then stopping like it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it knows it's being chased but it's not </v>

4083
03:04:35.541 --> 03:04:40.100
<v Speaker 3>like I have to get the fuck out of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just,</v>

4084
03:04:40.101 --> 03:04:40.934
<v Speaker 3>it's fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It literally makes them sometimes </v>

4085
03:04:42.021 --> 03:04:44.300
<v Speaker 3>sexually attracted to the smell of cat </v>
<v Speaker 3>urine.</v>

4086
03:04:44.690 --> 03:04:49.640
<v Speaker 3>So then this parasite is toxoplasmosis </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets inside the cat's gut,</v>

4087
03:04:49.820 --> 03:04:50.653
<v Speaker 3>the cat's shit it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why they tell pregnant women </v>

4088
03:04:52.821 --> 03:04:54.620
<v Speaker 3>to never touch litter boxes.</v>

4089
03:04:54.950 --> 03:04:55.783
<v Speaker 3>It's extremely important because it can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be deadly to children and cause all </v>

4090
03:04:59.121 --> 03:04:59.954
<v Speaker 3>sorts of birth defects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a crazy amount of people have it </v>

4091
03:05:02.690 --> 03:05:03.523
<v Speaker 3>like maybe as many as 50 percent of some</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries that people have 50 million </v>

4092
03:05:08.421 --> 03:05:09.560
<v Speaker 3>people in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abbott.</v>

4093
03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:11.203
<v Speaker 3>I think that was the latest number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if that's the case number of people </v>

4094
03:05:14.061 --> 03:05:16.100
<v Speaker 3>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it manifests itself.</v>

4095
03:05:16.101 --> 03:05:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes men reckless.</v>

4096
03:05:17.721 --> 03:05:20.840
<v Speaker 3>We had this guy dr robert sapolsky on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the podcast.</v>

4097
03:05:20.841 --> 03:05:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And robertson polsky's is fascinating.</v>

4098
03:05:23.350 --> 03:05:24.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>

4099
03:05:24.650 --> 03:05:27.410
<v Speaker 3>scientist and researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he spent a tremendous amount of time</v>

4100
03:05:27.411 --> 03:05:28.244
<v Speaker 3>studying toxoplasmosis and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that he talked about how they </v>

4101
03:05:32.421 --> 03:05:36.650
<v Speaker 3>found a disproportionate number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>motorcycle accidents.</v>

4102
03:05:36.920 --> 03:05:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where the person who died had toxo.</v>

4103
03:05:40.730 --> 03:05:41.563
<v Speaker 3>So they would do these tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of these doctors told him when we </v>

4104
03:05:43.551 --> 03:05:45.620
<v Speaker 3>would get a guy who died from motorcycle</v>
<v Speaker 3>crash,</v>

4105
03:05:45.770 --> 03:05:46.603
<v Speaker 3>we test them for toxo and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>disproportionate number and they think </v>

4106
03:05:48.910 --> 03:05:50.690
<v Speaker 3>toxo was making people reckless.</v>

4107
03:05:51.170 --> 03:05:52.003
<v Speaker 3>And there's also a connection in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange way to soccer teams that are </v>

4108
03:05:55.641 --> 03:05:56.474
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They find a disproportionate number of </v>

4109
03:05:58.641 --> 03:06:02.400
<v Speaker 3>soccer teams that are successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The players test positive for toxins.</v>

4110
03:06:02.430 --> 03:06:03.263
<v Speaker 3>They're reckless in some way or they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fearless and it may in fact even raise </v>

4111
03:06:06.501 --> 03:06:09.190
<v Speaker 3>testosterone and some males and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made.</v>

4112
03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:11.060
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4113
03:06:11.090 --> 03:06:11.990
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't be cured.</v>

4114
03:06:12.090 --> 03:06:13.760
<v Speaker 3>So you can test yourself for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4115
03:06:13.850 --> 03:06:16.000
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4116
03:06:16.010 --> 03:06:19.730
<v Speaker 3>literally on the front of every </v>
<v Speaker 3>magazine.</v>

4117
03:06:20.120 --> 03:06:20.953
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4118
03:06:21.080 --> 03:06:23.780
<v Speaker 3>people like paul ski have only been </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying it,</v>

4119
03:06:23.781 --> 03:06:25.910
<v Speaker 3>only been aware of it for the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of decades.</v>

4120
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.961
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

4121
03:06:26.961 --> 03:06:27.794
<v Speaker 3>as people who've grown up and talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about all the various factors for why </v>

4122
03:06:29.841 --> 03:06:30.674
<v Speaker 3>people behave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they behave is just recently </v>

4123
03:06:32.181 --> 03:06:33.830
<v Speaker 3>coming into the realm of understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>

4124
03:06:33.831 --> 03:06:37.430
<v Speaker 3>it's not a real like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well established fact for many,</v>

4125
03:06:37.431 --> 03:06:38.300
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years.</v>

4126
03:06:38.480 --> 03:06:39.313
<v Speaker 3>But so paul skis done a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible work on it and you can read </v>

4127
03:06:42.531 --> 03:06:44.570
<v Speaker 3>his lecture or listened to his lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather read them.</v>

4128
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:48.980
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the shit that he probably,</v>

4129
03:06:49.130 --> 03:06:50.420
<v Speaker 3>I probably have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4130
03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:53.210
<v Speaker 3>I've got a lot of feral cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a lot of wildcats.</v>

4131
03:06:54.130 --> 03:06:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived with a wildcat flick seven years</v>

4132
03:06:56.850 --> 03:06:59.580
<v Speaker 3>and I had a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was growing up that were wild.</v>

4133
03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:01.590
<v Speaker 3>There was always living outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4134
03:07:01.591 --> 03:07:03.750
<v Speaker 3>and who knows what the fuck they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting outside when I was a kid.</v>

4135
03:07:03.751 --> 03:07:05.340
<v Speaker 3>My counts were always outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4136
03:07:05.490 --> 03:07:06.323
<v Speaker 3>my cat needs to bring home squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just seen him walk across the street </v>

4137
03:07:08.671 --> 03:07:11.010
<v Speaker 3>with a squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He be killed a squirrel.</v>

4138
03:07:11.011 --> 03:07:11.844
<v Speaker 3>He had it in his mouth and squirrels </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost his size and he's literally </v>

4139
03:07:14.071 --> 03:07:15.470
<v Speaker 3>walking across the street with </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirrels,</v>

4140
03:07:15.480 --> 03:07:16.313
<v Speaker 3>body in between his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dragging the squirrel across the </v>

4141
03:07:18.721 --> 03:07:20.580
<v Speaker 3>street to show me that he killed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirrel.</v>

4142
03:07:21.330 --> 03:07:23.770
<v Speaker 3>So he was probably out there killing </v>
<v Speaker 3>rats kinds of things.</v>

4143
03:07:24.250 --> 03:07:26.400
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4144
03:07:26.440 --> 03:07:30.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a great documentary on netflix </v>
<v Speaker 3>about rats called rats.</v>

4145
03:07:30.600 --> 03:07:31.433
<v Speaker 3>What does It say here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Morbid attraction to leopard urine in </v>

4146
03:07:33.631 --> 03:07:36.600
<v Speaker 3>toxo plasma infested chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4147
03:07:36.780 --> 03:07:37.613
<v Speaker 3>Seeing that the chimpanzees that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>infected by toxo fuck with fuck with </v>

4148
03:07:42.960 --> 03:07:43.793
<v Speaker 3>leopard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they can get killed because the toxo </v>

4149
03:07:45.061 --> 03:07:47.260
<v Speaker 3>wants to grow inside the cat's gut.</v>

4150
03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:51.120
<v Speaker 4>Sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexually reproducing the crypt.</v>

4151
03:07:51.210 --> 03:07:52.043
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it's actually reproduces </v>

4152
03:07:54.120 --> 03:07:56.570
<v Speaker 4>inside the gut of cats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the only way it's viable.</v>

4153
03:07:56.880 --> 03:07:59.130
<v Speaker 4>They stopped being afraid so they can </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically,</v>

4154
03:07:59.131 --> 03:08:01.350
<v Speaker 4>they commit suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just be something afraid.</v>

4155
03:08:01.351 --> 03:08:02.184
<v Speaker 4>They're attracted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's drawn with them like they're like </v>

4156
03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:07.650
<v Speaker 4>reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are attracted to danger.</v>

4157
03:08:08.080 --> 03:08:11.890
<v Speaker 4>A light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my fucking mind blowing.</v>

4158
03:08:12.380 --> 03:08:13.213
<v Speaker 4>The parasites have some sort of innate </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence that explained people who </v>

4159
03:08:16.891 --> 03:08:20.370
<v Speaker 4>are just have a higher tolerance for </v>
<v Speaker 4>danger and attraction to danger.</v>

4160
03:08:20.770 --> 03:08:23.580
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably probably addiction for sure.</v>

4161
03:08:23.610 --> 03:08:25.110
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>

4162
03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:27.900
<v Speaker 4>We know so little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when we learn,</v>

4163
03:08:28.330 --> 03:08:29.163
<v Speaker 4>we learn shit now it's like I remember I</v>
<v Speaker 4>get really bad migraines and I was in </v>

4164
03:08:32.610 --> 03:08:34.770
<v Speaker 4>cedars getting morphine and I was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4165
03:08:35.010 --> 03:08:35.761
<v Speaker 4>when was this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh you go to cedars and they shoot you </v>

4167
03:08:38.431 --> 03:08:39.264

4169
03:08:41.041 --> 03:08:42.610
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which by the way I was on the,</v>

4170
03:08:42.820 --> 03:08:45.860
<v Speaker 4>the watchlist because drug addicts go in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and they say like,</v>

4171
03:08:45.870 --> 03:08:47.550
<v Speaker 4>I have a migraine helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was on a list.</v>

4172
03:08:47.551 --> 03:08:48.630
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't give it to her.</v>

4173
03:08:48.631 --> 03:08:49.464
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this whole thing if you go into </v>

4174
03:08:51.240 --> 03:08:53.000
<v Speaker 4>frequently.</v>

<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I remember asking him.</v>

4190
03:09:30.721 --> 03:09:35.721
<v Speaker 4>I was high at least Michael Jackson died</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing what he loved sleeping.</v>

4191
03:09:38.590 --> 03:09:39.510
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4192
03:09:39.570 --> 03:09:40.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one time was just like,</v>

4193
03:09:40.591 --> 03:09:42.060
<v Speaker 4>what causes migraines?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4194
03:09:42.120 --> 03:09:43.230
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

4195
03:09:43.231 --> 03:09:44.850
<v Speaker 4>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

4196
03:09:44.851 --> 03:09:46.680
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean you don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

4197
03:09:46.681 --> 03:09:48.090
<v Speaker 4>there's just a lot we don't know about </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurology.</v>

4198
03:09:48.091 --> 03:09:49.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking like?</v>

4199
03:09:49.530 --> 03:09:50.970
<v Speaker 4>And then I remember another doctor was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4200
03:09:50.971 --> 03:09:52.320
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why we call it a practice.</v>

4201
03:09:52.940 --> 03:09:56.410
<v Speaker 4>We're doing the best we can with what we</v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

4202
03:09:56.710 --> 03:09:57.543
<v Speaker 4>So we don't call it space it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how often can you go in there and </v>

4203
03:10:00.101 --> 03:10:01.150
<v Speaker 4>walk yourself to the moon?</v>

4204
03:10:01.180 --> 03:10:03.220
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had to do that for like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of years,</v>

4205
03:10:03.420 --> 03:10:07.750
<v Speaker 4>but when you go in they're like eee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think now it's a little bit better.</v>

4206
03:10:07.751 --> 03:10:10.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't go back to cedars because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were shitty about my ear surgery.</v>

4207
03:10:10.720 --> 03:10:11.321
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

4208
03:10:11.321 --> 03:10:14.050
<v Speaker 4>I have a tattoo here when we're attached</v>
<v Speaker 4>to my ear,</v>

4209
03:10:14.080 --> 03:10:16.540
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just did not go particularly well.</v>

4210
03:10:16.541 --> 03:10:20.110
<v Speaker 4>The doctor was very dismissive to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So funny.</v>

4211
03:10:20.111 --> 03:10:22.210
<v Speaker 4>Is this an only an la thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

4212
03:10:22.211 --> 03:10:24.490
<v Speaker 4>you're need a plastic surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have one that you prefer?</v>

4213
03:10:24.730 --> 03:10:25.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4214
03:10:25.660 --> 03:10:27.040
<v Speaker 4>excuse first of all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

4215
03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:29.260
<v Speaker 4>Second of all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

4216
03:10:29.261 --> 03:10:32.680
<v Speaker 4>Like I just have a plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that only in la question?</v>

4217
03:10:32.950 --> 03:10:33.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine.</v>

4218
03:10:33.791 --> 03:10:35.620
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever gotten plan to get plastic</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgery on a,</v>

4219
03:10:35.790 --> 03:10:37.200
<v Speaker 4>a injury?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4220
03:10:37.330 --> 03:10:37.931
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have,</v>

4221
03:10:37.931 --> 03:10:38.764
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to get a plastic surgeon if </v>

4222
03:10:40.391 --> 03:10:41.224
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're comes off.</v>

4223
03:10:41.890 --> 03:10:42.723
<v Speaker 3>I know dudes who have had their ears </v>
<v Speaker 3>fixed where they had the cauliflower </v>

4224
03:10:44.381 --> 03:10:45.900
<v Speaker 3>moved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4225
03:10:45.980 --> 03:10:47.140
<v Speaker 3>that's hard to do though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

4226
03:10:47.141 --> 03:10:48.940
<v Speaker 3>because it's got nerve endings in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4227
03:10:48.941 --> 03:10:51.520
<v Speaker 3>it's real tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to delay your ear.</v>

4228
03:10:51.940 --> 03:10:52.773
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware of peel it back and they have </v>

4229
03:10:54.041 --> 03:10:54.874
<v Speaker 3>to pull the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the calcium deposits out of the hard </v>

4230
03:10:57.341 --> 03:11:00.520
<v Speaker 3>parts of your ear and had that on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>nose.</v>

4231
03:11:00.850 --> 03:11:01.760
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4232
03:11:01.761 --> 03:11:03.500
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of calcium deposits in </v>
<v Speaker 3>segment.</v>

4233
03:11:03.540 --> 03:11:04.373
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for what you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would assume it'd be a little </v>

4234
03:11:05.441 --> 03:11:08.410
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The inside was pretty fucked up until 10</v>

4235
03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:09.650
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a thing in there?</v>

4236
03:11:09.690 --> 03:11:10.451
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4237
03:11:10.451 --> 03:11:12.760
<v Speaker 3>but when I had a deviated septum </v>
<v Speaker 3>operation,</v>

4238
03:11:12.761 --> 03:11:16.180
<v Speaker 3>they put these plastic stents in there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and opened everything nice.</v>

4239
03:11:16.360 --> 03:11:19.600
<v Speaker 3>And they cut away the turbinates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They cut away all this tissue.</v>

4240
03:11:19.780 --> 03:11:23.350
<v Speaker 3>They showed me all the tissue that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>removed from my nose.</v>

4241
03:11:23.350 --> 03:11:26.620
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking crazy tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a.</v>

4242
03:11:26.621 --> 03:11:27.454
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of scar tissue and a lot of when </v>

4243
03:11:29.111 --> 03:11:30.510
<v Speaker 3>you get blood clots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4244
03:11:31.060 --> 03:11:34.480
<v Speaker 3>like the same stuff that happens with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cauliflower ear,</v>

4245
03:11:34.560 --> 03:11:35.393
<v Speaker 3>but that is his blood leaking inbetween </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tissue cells and then it stays in </v>

4246
03:11:39.821 --> 03:11:40.654
<v Speaker 3>their pools up and then it calcifies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it calcifies it literally becomes </v>

4247
03:11:44.021 --> 03:11:47.470
<v Speaker 3>like a rock and you can get that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your nose too.</v>

4248
03:11:47.590 --> 03:11:51.130
<v Speaker 3>And some guys like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get calcification in there and it,</v>

4249
03:11:51.160 --> 03:11:51.993
<v Speaker 3>it hardens up and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you also get a lot of scar tissue </v>

4250
03:11:54.820 --> 03:11:56.970
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it closes up the um,</v>

4251
03:11:57.090 --> 03:11:58.150
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nose,</v>

4252
03:11:58.210 --> 03:12:01.350
<v Speaker 3>a window you can't breathe out of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>nose happens.</v>

4253
03:12:01.360 --> 03:12:04.480
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that do fighting,</v>

4254
03:12:04.481 --> 03:12:06.060
<v Speaker 3>they talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you'll hear them,</v>

4255
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.903
<v Speaker 3>they have like a way of talking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's because they can't </v>

4256
03:12:09.581 --> 03:12:10.990
<v Speaker 3>breathe through their nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super,</v>

4257
03:12:10.991 --> 03:12:12.940
<v Speaker 3>super common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they can't.</v>

4258
03:12:12.941 --> 03:12:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you haven't done your areola?</v>

4259
03:12:15.060 --> 03:12:16.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had it in my ears.</v>

4260
03:12:16.511 --> 03:12:18.490
<v Speaker 3>So I got a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got little pieces in my ears,</v>

4261
03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:22.060
<v Speaker 3>but I always worked your guards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is important.</v>

4262
03:12:22.061 --> 03:12:24.880
<v Speaker 3>This helps you hear shit like all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

4263
03:12:25.050 --> 03:12:29.410
<v Speaker 3>The design of the interface is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>design of the ear though.</v>

4264
03:12:29.411 --> 03:12:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like just take your ears.</v>

4265
03:12:31.391 --> 03:12:32.270
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4266
03:12:32.320 --> 03:12:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Take your ear and then talk like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then fold your year's over like that</v>

4267
03:12:36.341 --> 03:12:37.060
<v Speaker 3>and keep talking.</v>

4268
03:12:37.060 --> 03:12:37.491
<v Speaker 11>La,</v>
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>

4269
03:12:37.491 --> 03:12:38.241
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>

4270
03:12:38.241 --> 03:12:38.780
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>

4271
03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:39.930
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>

4272
03:12:40.020 --> 03:12:40.450
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>

4273
03:12:40.450 --> 03:12:40.910
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>
<v Speaker 11>la,</v>

4274
03:12:40.910 --> 03:12:41.500
<v Speaker 11>la.</v>

4275
03:12:41.500 --> 03:12:42.333
<v Speaker 4>It dulls the sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine if you have one rocks like </v>

4276
03:12:45.910 --> 03:12:49.660
<v Speaker 4>literally randy coture way that the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's formed.</v>

4277
03:12:49.990 --> 03:12:51.620
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mine is all fucked up now,</v>

4278
03:12:51.621 --> 03:12:52.130
<v Speaker 4>but you</v>

4279
03:12:52.130 --> 03:12:53.740
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I don't know the case.</v>

4280
03:12:53.780 --> 03:12:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you get cauliflower ear </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery,</v>

4281
03:12:56.091 --> 03:12:58.820
<v Speaker 2>but they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An anesthetizing your ear actually hurts</v>

4282
03:12:58.821 --> 03:12:59.654
<v Speaker 2>more than just getting the surgery </v>
<v Speaker 2>without anesthesia because they had to </v>

4283
03:13:02.061 --> 03:13:06.020
<v Speaker 2>put anesthesia in the laceration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess because the cartilage,</v>

4284
03:13:06.021 --> 03:13:06.854
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't spread as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they did the reattachment surgery </v>

4285
03:13:09.441 --> 03:13:11.870
<v Speaker 2>without anesthesia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a fucking nightmare.</v>

4286
03:13:12.410 --> 03:13:13.243
<v Speaker 2>It was real as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was doing it and he wasn't </v>

4287
03:13:18.471 --> 03:13:19.400
<v Speaker 2>listening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4288
03:13:19.401 --> 03:13:21.580
<v Speaker 2>surgeons can be kind of dismissive </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway because they're like,</v>

4289
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:22.850
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think they're god.</v>

4290
03:13:23.120 --> 03:13:23.811
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir,</v>

4291
03:13:23.811 --> 03:13:26.240
<v Speaker 2>can you please just give me a heads up </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like when you're going to do that,</v>

4292
03:13:26.360 --> 03:13:28.580
<v Speaker 2>just would do it without telling me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like freaking out.</v>

4293
03:13:29.450 --> 03:13:30.283
<v Speaker 2>And I was like not being heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was actually like triggering me </v>

4294
03:13:33.501 --> 03:13:35.360
<v Speaker 2>emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can deal with physical pain.</v>

4295
03:13:35.450 --> 03:13:37.400
<v Speaker 2>I was getting triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4296
03:13:37.401 --> 03:13:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean heard.</v>

4297
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:40.940
<v Speaker 2>He's like totally ignoring me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like doing it.</v>

4298
03:13:40.941 --> 03:13:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean punching holes into my body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like without,</v>

4299
03:13:43.280 --> 03:13:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I get like an honorary rafter three?</v>

4300
03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:46.850
<v Speaker 2>And then the next day my friend called </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>

4301
03:13:46.851 --> 03:13:48.290
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when can you come get her stitches out?</v>

4302
03:13:48.291 --> 03:13:49.850
<v Speaker 2>And the nurse was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh the uh,</v>

4303
03:13:50.090 --> 03:13:52.100
<v Speaker 2>the surgeon can't talk on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's deaf.</v>

4304
03:13:52.970 --> 03:13:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I got a depth surgeon and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even tell me.</v>

4305
03:13:55.040 --> 03:13:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you need to give someone a </v>
<v Speaker 2>heads up on that.</v>

4306
03:13:56.780 --> 03:13:57.613
<v Speaker 2>You should definitely give her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck is he going to know if he </v>

4307
03:13:59.870 --> 03:14:01.640
<v Speaker 2>was screaming at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>LIke,</v>

4308
03:14:01.641 --> 03:14:03.050
<v Speaker 2>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you please like give me a heads up?</v>

4309
03:14:03.051 --> 03:14:03.500
<v Speaker 2>And he just was</v>

4310
03:14:03.500 --> 03:14:04.333
<v Speaker 3>deaf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a dude who got cauliflower ear </v>

4311
03:14:05.781 --> 03:14:06.614
<v Speaker 3>and then somehow or another got a staph </v>
<v Speaker 3>infection inside of his ear and it was </v>

4312
03:14:09.621 --> 03:14:10.454
<v Speaker 3>so bad they had to remove his ear and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a solder it because the </v>

4313
03:14:13.221 --> 03:14:14.054
<v Speaker 3>infection was so prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was constantly leaking fluid out of </v>

4314
03:14:17.061 --> 03:14:18.320
<v Speaker 3>his ear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What solder mean?</v>

4315
03:14:18.470 --> 03:14:22.490
<v Speaker 3>They had a fucking like do in the wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>west movies where a guy gets shot,</v>

4316
03:14:22.491 --> 03:14:23.600
<v Speaker 3>they slap iron to it.</v>

4317
03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cauterize.</v>

4318
03:14:26.241 --> 03:14:27.860
<v Speaker 2>It caught our eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the cauterize.</v>

4319
03:14:27.861 --> 03:14:29.930
<v Speaker 2>The inside of cold solder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being dramatic.</v>

4320
03:14:29.931 --> 03:14:32.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they do that with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleft palate.</v>

4321
03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Highrise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The inside cauterize,</v>

4322
03:14:34.410 --> 03:14:36.160
<v Speaker 2>the smell cauterizing</v>

4323
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:41.230
<v Speaker 3>and it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to do it again.</v>

4324
03:14:41.290 --> 03:14:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Carla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just tricky.</v>

4325
03:14:42.480 --> 03:14:44.440
<v Speaker 3>You had to go in there more than once </v>
<v Speaker 3>and cleaned it out.</v>

4326
03:14:44.940 --> 03:14:45.773
<v Speaker 3>Put shoot antibiotics in there because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't fight with it or wrestle with </v>

4327
03:14:48.551 --> 03:14:52.990
<v Speaker 3>it because it'll keep popping and had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>staph infection inside of his ear.</v>

4328
03:14:53.050 --> 03:14:55.390
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is super bad.</v>

4329
03:14:55.420 --> 03:14:56.440
<v Speaker 3>What does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These headphones.</v>

4330
03:14:56.830 --> 03:15:00.550
<v Speaker 3>Bone conduction headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good enough yet.</v>

4331
03:15:00.620 --> 03:15:01.331
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4332
03:15:01.331 --> 03:15:02.080
<v Speaker 3>I haven't.</v>

4333
03:15:02.080 --> 03:15:03.650
<v Speaker 9>That's what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The sound name.</v>

4334
03:15:03.651 --> 03:15:04.840
<v Speaker 9>You think of that their,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4335
03:15:04.870 --> 03:15:07.390
<v Speaker 9>their headphones you put,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you put them on like headphones,</v>

4336
03:15:07.391 --> 03:15:08.224
<v Speaker 9>but they don't go in your ear.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They go on your ear and they vibrate in </v>

4337
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:16.180
<v Speaker 9>your jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The sound literally as vibrant.</v>

4338
03:15:16.181 --> 03:15:18.370
<v Speaker 9>There's no sound coming out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's vibrations,</v>

4339
03:15:18.371 --> 03:15:21.520
<v Speaker 9>which is what sound is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And it vibrates into your head,</v>

4340
03:15:21.521 --> 03:15:23.880
<v Speaker 9>not through your ear.</v>
<v Speaker 9>All this shit.</v>

4341
03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:25.660
<v Speaker 9>I went to sound audio engineering </v>
<v Speaker 9>school.</v>

4342
03:15:25.720 --> 03:15:27.190
<v Speaker 9>He's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That,</v>

4343
03:15:27.191 --> 03:15:28.570
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>have you heard them?</v>

4344
03:15:28.600 --> 03:15:28.900
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>

4345
03:15:28.900 --> 03:15:31.240
<v Speaker 9>I was at the cs I went to a couple </v>
<v Speaker 9>months ago.</v>

4346
03:15:31.241 --> 03:15:33.280
<v Speaker 9>I tested them out there,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but like they're coming out again.</v>

4347
03:15:33.281 --> 03:15:34.870
<v Speaker 9>There's a video going around where </v>
<v Speaker 9>people are getting,</v>

4348
03:15:34.871 --> 03:15:36.100
<v Speaker 9>like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>amazed by how,</v>

4349
03:15:36.520 --> 03:15:38.620
<v Speaker 9>what it sounds like when you're putting </v>
<v Speaker 9>something weird.</v>

4350
03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:39.543
<v Speaker 9>It's a very weird feeling because it's </v>
<v Speaker 9>literally vibrating really small pulses </v>

4351
03:15:43.390 --> 03:15:44.320
<v Speaker 9>on your skin.</v>

4352
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:49.980
<v Speaker 2>It didn't sound bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would fucking</v>

4353
03:15:49.980 --> 03:15:52.320
<v Speaker 4>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you smoke some weed.</v>

4354
03:15:52.350 --> 03:15:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Go to a sound bath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one in pasadena.</v>

4355
03:15:54.510 --> 03:15:57.210
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't want to in joshua tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

4356
03:15:57.360 --> 03:15:58.430
<v Speaker 4>will you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>

4357
03:15:58.450 --> 03:16:00.930
<v Speaker 4>you'll probably be better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this guy that does bowls,</v>

4358
03:16:00.931 --> 03:16:03.390
<v Speaker 4>but it vibrates your entire body with </v>
<v Speaker 4>sound.</v>

4359
03:16:03.960 --> 03:16:06.000
<v Speaker 4>And it's like this hypnotic you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4360
03:16:06.001 --> 03:16:07.080
<v Speaker 4>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got paralyzed,</v>

4361
03:16:07.081 --> 03:16:10.800
<v Speaker 4>like I couldn't move my body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so clean this place.</v>

4362
03:16:10.801 --> 03:16:11.634
<v Speaker 4>The way that they dome it and the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the sound travels like renders you </v>

4363
03:16:15.091 --> 03:16:15.924
<v Speaker 4>paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this insane out of body </v>

4364
03:16:17.641 --> 03:16:18.474
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one of these places that's </v>

4365
03:16:19.351 --> 03:16:21.330
<v Speaker 4>really famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's in palm springs,</v>

4366
03:16:21.331 --> 03:16:22.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

03:16:24.661 --> 03:16:28.020
<v Speaker 4>That's in joshua tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about joshua tree.</v>

4369
03:16:28.021 --> 03:16:28.854
<v Speaker 4>They say it has the most conductive </v>
<v Speaker 4>sound or there's something about the </v>

4370
03:16:31.981 --> 03:16:34.620
<v Speaker 4>electricity in the earth that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly powerful.</v>

4371
03:16:34.620 --> 03:16:37.920
<v Speaker 4>That's the one that I went to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I did some other good before.</v>

4372
03:16:37.930 --> 03:16:42.270
<v Speaker 4>how it was on a scale of one to snoop </v>
<v Speaker 4>dogg was r kelly.</v>

4373
03:16:43.220 --> 03:16:44.053
<v Speaker 4>I was like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like a six out of 10 in </v>

4374
03:16:45.931 --> 03:16:49.230
<v Speaker 4>hiGhness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you saw a concert inside?</v>

4375

<v Speaker 4>There's one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually I'm wearing a shirt of.</v>

4376
03:16:50.950 --> 03:16:53.790
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really special.</v>

4378
03:16:56.810 --> 03:16:57.643
<v Speaker 4>They had a screen up and they projected </v>
<v Speaker 4>three d images on the screen and you </v>

4379
03:17:00.301 --> 03:17:02.730
<v Speaker 4>couldn't take your cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's really hard to find anything</v>

4380
03:17:02.731 --> 03:17:03.780
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

4381
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:06.780
<v Speaker 4>it was a really cool experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the sound insane.</v>

4382
03:17:07.080 --> 03:17:09.450
<v Speaker 4>It was weird because it was all in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was different.</v>

4383
03:17:09.451 --> 03:17:12.420
<v Speaker 4>They had to spend some time figuring it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out so it sounded good in there to enjoy</v>

4384
03:17:12.421 --> 03:17:13.254
<v Speaker 4>it as a concert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if You stand in the middle of the </v>

4385
03:17:14.971 --> 03:17:15.804
<v Speaker 4>room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hear like waves just because of the </v>

4386
03:17:19.561 --> 03:17:21.980
<v Speaker 4>way that there's like a hole in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ceiling and you just like hear this,</v>

4387
03:17:21.981 --> 03:17:26.560
<v Speaker 4>like it's oddly numbing and your skin </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts tingling and you just go into the</v>

4388
03:17:26.790 --> 03:17:27.750
<v Speaker 4>hypnotic state.</v>

4389
03:17:28.530 --> 03:17:29.363
<v Speaker 4>I came out of it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea if I was here for six </v>

4390
03:17:30.781 --> 03:17:32.220
<v Speaker 4>hours or 10 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>no concept of time.</v>

4392

<v Speaker 4>It was pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's doing something to you.</v>

03:17:54.811 --> 03:17:55.644
<v Speaker 4>there's one in eagle rock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same science that makes crystals really </v>

4400
03:17:59.910 --> 03:18:00.900
<v Speaker 4>dirty feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

<v Speaker 4>into crystals.</v>

4403
03:18:04.980 --> 03:18:07.080
<v Speaker 4>Crystals happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's salt lamps,</v>

4404
03:18:07.081 --> 03:18:08.790
<v Speaker 4>but they just look cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
