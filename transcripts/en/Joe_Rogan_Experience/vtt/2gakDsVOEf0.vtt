22
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>So we just talk.</v>

<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] remember any fights?</v>

29
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Crazy blind magnitude.</v>

30
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Really close fight.</v>

31
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.753
<v Speaker 1>It was a war.</v>

32
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

33
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I believe Miller wanted decision.</v>

34
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.601
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

35
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>see if,</v>

36
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.063
<v Speaker 1>see if I'm correct.</v>

37
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't even remember if you know,</v>

38
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>how am I supposed to remember?</v>

39
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:04.981
<v Speaker 1>Super,</v>

40
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>super close fight.</v>

41
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that Miller wanted decision.</v>

42
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>but I remember it being really tightly matched.</v>

44
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at these guys like skill wise,</v>

45
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you think about them like both guys are like at this point in their career,</v>

46
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>like super consummate pros.</v>

47
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>You know both.</v>

48
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>There's real similar in that regard.</v>

49
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Almost mirror images and the fact that these bolts guys are so competent and</v>

50
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>they have some amazing victories like Miller,</v>

51
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>when he tapped out all the vera Lozan just knocked out Diego Sanchez.</v>

52
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:34.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean come on.</v>

53
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I was like probably one of his best victories ever.</v>

54
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>How about when he was 19 I think it was when he knocked out Jens Pulver.</v>

55
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Remember that Shit Dude?</v>

56
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Lozano is a beast.</v>

57
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.883
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

58
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.060

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Good defense.</v>

61
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.541
<v Speaker 1>Hold guys.</v>

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.951
<v Speaker 1>Miller one.</v>

65
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:57.440
<v Speaker 1>The first one in the a decision.</v>

66
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>See my members had that bad but I remember it being a fucking war.</v>

68
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.011
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

69
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Was this split decision?</v>

70
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:03.684
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

71
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Unanimous,</v>

72
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>unanimous decision.</v>

73
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>These are the kind of fighters that fight to their full potential.</v>

74
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>They have so much confidence.</v>

75
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>They've done it so much,</v>

76
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>so much experience that you could trust them no matter what crowd you put them</v>

77
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:14.611
<v Speaker 1>in front of,</v>

78
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>no matter who you put in front of them,</v>

79
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This whole card is fucking bang up man.</v>

90
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I was real excited about this card.</v>

91
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>They're both really good strikers that both really good wrestlers.</v>

92
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>They're both really good at Jujitsu.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tap for ratio.</v>

97
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Kimonti's captain in an arm bar from the guard.</v>

98
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

<v Speaker 2>as top shell.</v>

104
00:03:09.261 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Fasting transitions.</v>

105

<v Speaker 2>He finished.</v>

106
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:13.504
<v Speaker 2>He's a finisher.</v>

107
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 2>He puts you in a triangle.</v>

108
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a probably 98% rap city,</v>

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like he goes from zero to a hundred miles an hour.</v>

112
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Like instantly he hits hard as fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's game.</v>

114
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 2>He's a true savage.</v>

126
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Pepino Cuevas versus a um,</v>

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Hearns or some shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They could go right there with Conor McGregor.</v>

144
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.090
<v Speaker 2>He can throw down key.</v>

145
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Imagine Joe Lowe's on Conor Mcgregor.</v>

146
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>That would be amazing.</v>

00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

149
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not just hard man.</v>

150
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 2>It's the accuracy is a big part of it.</v>

151
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's definitely hard.</v>

152
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 2>He hits hard as fuck,</v>

153
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's the speed and the accuracy combined like his f eating.</v>

154
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 2>You know what people give him a hard time about doing that.</v>

155
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

156
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Edo Port Dow Movement Shit.</v>

157
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

158
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

159
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 2>Because his movement is outstanding.</v>

160
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Like his ability to move his body.</v>

161
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I think people joke about that.</v>

162
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 2>They know it's the chin,</v>

163
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's just the way he has called the touch.</v>

164
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.001
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

165
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I think people know what's the jet and his movement is great.</v>

166
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.531
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

167
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Like to know how much of an effect it really has had.</v>

168
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.600
<v Speaker 2>It's basically like a Kata.</v>

169
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Your mood,</v>

170
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>you're even more crazy.</v>

172
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.221
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.673
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

176
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.790
<v Speaker 2>these guys are going after it.</v>

177
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Good body shots.</v>

178
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.081
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

180
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I was so impressed with the way,</v>

181
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 2>first of all is timing on that left leg kick there.</v>

182
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.451
<v Speaker 2>Nice touch,</v>

183
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 2>but touch,</v>

184
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.851
<v Speaker 2>touch.</v>

185
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:34.684
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

186
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.603
<v Speaker 2>have you seen that?</v>

187
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the parody of Nate Diaz and Conor McGregor?</v>

188
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

189
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.491
<v Speaker 2>there's dudes that,</v>

190
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 2>he's like a,</v>

191
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 2>he uses a Nate Diaz type a snapchat filter on my Instagram.</v>

192
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of it.</v>

193
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

194
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.570

<v Speaker 2>it's fucking hysterical.</v>

196
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a parody climate.</v>

197
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Gregor and Diaz.</v>

198
00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I getting a intimate,</v>

199
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>getting like slightly gay.</v>

200
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:02.901
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen this?</v>

201
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:03.201
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

202
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I have not.</v>

203
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh dude,</v>

204
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 2>it's so fucking,</v>

205
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

206
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 2>The guy who does Nate Diaz is,</v>

207
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 2>is perfect.</v>

208
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 2>That could be a cartoon.</v>

209
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Do just Nate Diaz and Conor Mcgregor,</v>

210
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.770
<v Speaker 2>like the odd couple just hanging out that,</v>

211
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

212
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 2>that'll be an easy hit.</v>

213
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Easy sensation</v>

214
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 2>to the pace in which those guys fought that five round fight.</v>

215
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever screened as much during that fight.</v>

216
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 2>I was actually screaming going,</v>

217
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

218
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 2>like Alton was a fight.</v>

219
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 2>It was so intense.</v>

220
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 2>That was a fight where I felt like,</v>

221
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:42.531
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

222
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I would've rather done a fight companion for this then call it.</v>

223
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Cause I wanted to swear a bunch of times.</v>

224
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Think I've ever got as excited for any fight ever.</v>

225
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

226
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the only other one was Nogueira Bob Sapp.</v>

227
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.580
<v Speaker 2>That's the only other one.</v>

228
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.000
<v Speaker 2>God damn crazy.</v>

229
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 2>That was such an amazing fight.</v>

230
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:00.914
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

231
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.821
<v Speaker 2>Connor muck.</v>

232
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Gregor man.</v>

233
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Holy.</v>

234
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 2>And they're both awesome.</v>

235
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 2>They're both awesome.</v>

236
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 2>That was a great fight.</v>

237
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.730
<v Speaker 2>You mean?</v>

238
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

239
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I honestly,</v>

240
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:15.520
<v Speaker 2>I haven't gone back and watched it again and tried to score it and uh,</v>

241
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I stopped a long time ago trying to score fights while I'm watching them,</v>

242
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:19.830
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what the fuck is.</v>

243
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

244
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he went five rounds and Nate Diaz,</v>

245
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 2>he kept up with them.</v>

246
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.750
<v Speaker 2>I thought for sure if it went past three,</v>

247
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Nate was just going to completely dominate and he fucking hung in there.</v>

248
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Man survived that fourth round,</v>

249
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.150
<v Speaker 2>kind of seemed like he kind of caught a second wind somewhere around the fourth</v>

250
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 2>round and he started a punching like looser and more relaxed,</v>

251
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.080
<v Speaker 2>like sort of fell into a different pace.</v>

252
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

253
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 2>You know that fight prove that Connor has,</v>

254
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

255
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 2>he proved that he has legit heart,</v>

256
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 2>she was in trouble.</v>

257
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 2>There are a couple of rounds and Nate was messing them up and I had him against</v>

258
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:54.051
<v Speaker 2>the fucking cage.</v>

259
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 2>It looked like he was slowing down and he fucking regrouped.</v>

260
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:00.100
<v Speaker 2>He got an second wind or whatever you want to call it.</v>

261
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.943
<v Speaker 2>He came back and,</v>

262
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 2>and fuck.</v>

263
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 2>It was an important fight to watch,</v>

264
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:05.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

265
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.690
<v Speaker 2>cause that was a guy that had just decided that he was not going to be defined</v>

266
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.890
<v Speaker 2>by this one fight and then what?</v>

267
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.750
<v Speaker 2>It was not going to be defined by his past result and that he's better than</v>

268
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

269
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.751
<v Speaker 2>And he's going to come in,</v>

270
00:08:18.751 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 2>he's going to show everybody.</v>

271
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.550
<v Speaker 2>And Dude,</v>

272
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 2>if he could keep that pace up that he fought in that first round,</v>

273
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

274
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:28.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's so explosive and dominant cruisers talking about it.</v>

275
00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 2>And I was a really got me thinking,</v>

276
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

277
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.741
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

278
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you could fight in a style like Connor does for five rounds.</v>

279
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.771
<v Speaker 2>And I thought about it,</v>

280
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:37.071
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

281
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:37.491
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

282
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:38.324
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

283
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.171
<v Speaker 2>Dominick Cruz,</v>

284
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 2>first of all would know,</v>

285
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

286
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 2>If anybody's gonna know Dominic is kind of super high fight Iq.</v>

287
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:47.330
<v Speaker 2>So I considered it at a respect and then I thought about it,</v>

288
00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:47.601
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

289
00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:47.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

290
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:50.900
<v Speaker 2>there's only one way to move that fast when we,</v>

291
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.200
<v Speaker 2>when Connor closes the gap and blasts Nate with those left hands,</v>

292
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>the fucking,</v>

293
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 3>the speed and explosiveness of it,</v>

294
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 3>that's a very tense movement.</v>

295
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Like that takes a lot of energy to do.</v>

296
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 3>I think it takes way more energy than what Nate does because what Nate and nick</v>

297
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:07.584
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

298
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 3>the overwhelming you with volume and they're overwhelming ability to maintain a</v>

299
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:13.530
<v Speaker 3>certain level,</v>

300
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 3>like a certain level of activity.</v>

301
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 3>Like especially nick,</v>

302
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 3>he's the master at it.</v>

303
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 3>Like maintaining a level of activity that you can keep up for it and then turn</v>

304
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:22.670
<v Speaker 3>it on once they smell blood.</v>

305
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

306
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 3>like the frank shamrock fight.</v>

307
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 3>Great example of that.</v>

308
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

309
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 3>the Paul daily fight is a great example of that.</v>

310
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 3>There was a war.</v>

311
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.590
<v Speaker 4>Imagine fighting a guy that that's your,</v>

312
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.940
<v Speaker 4>that's their style.</v>

313
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.601
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>

314
00:09:34.601 --> 00:09:35.434
<v Speaker 4>where are you now?</v>

315
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.390
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as they smell blood,</v>

316
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 4>that's when they turn it on.</v>

317
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.330
<v Speaker 4>You don't want a guy like that.</v>

318
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.590
<v Speaker 4>You want a guy that uh,</v>

319
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:42.710
<v Speaker 4>know</v>

320
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.360
<v Speaker 3>talking shit the whole time he's punching you.</v>

321
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

322
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.860
<v Speaker 3>The whole time he's punching you,</v>

323
00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:46.610
<v Speaker 3>he was talking shit.</v>

324
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.720
<v Speaker 3>You never get to relax.</v>

325
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

326
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.471
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

327
00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:48.981
<v Speaker 3>what bitch?</v>

328
00:09:48.981 --> 00:09:49.710
<v Speaker 3>What bitch?</v>

329
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.543
<v Speaker 3>He's hitting you.</v>

330
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.220
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a referee,</v>

331
00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:56.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to remember who was fighting,</v>

332
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.980
<v Speaker 3>but there was a referee once.</v>

333
00:09:57.981 --> 00:09:59.090
<v Speaker 3>We're two guys were fighting.</v>

334
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.710
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it's Nick Diaz,</v>

335
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.560
<v Speaker 3>but it might not have been with the referee was telling them to stop talking.</v>

336
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:04.911
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

337
00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:06.710
<v Speaker 3>don't tell him to stop talking.</v>

338
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Why would you tell them to stop talking as if it's somehow or another?</v>

339
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:13.130
<v Speaker 3>It's worse to beat someone's ass and talk shit,</v>

340
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.170
<v Speaker 3>then it is to just beat their ass.</v>

341
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.540
<v Speaker 3>That's so bizarre.</v>

342
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.633
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

343
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.000
<v Speaker 3>why can't you talk shit</v>

344
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.830
<v Speaker 4>and Nate Diaz is,</v>

345
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.783
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

346
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 4>he's beyond a rockstar.</v>

347
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.041
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's,</v>

348
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 4>he's as famous as a rock star.</v>

349
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.321
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

350
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:29.154
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

351
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.330
<v Speaker 4>dude on Instagram,</v>

352
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 4>he's already over a million followers.</v>

353
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

354
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 4>he is,</v>

355
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.771
<v Speaker 4>he's got it.</v>

356
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:38.010
<v Speaker 4>That attitude that they'll never be another Nate Diaz.</v>

357
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.260
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

358
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:38.930
<v Speaker 4>He know what I mean.</v>

359
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

360
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.051
<v Speaker 4>there'll be,</v>

361
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:40.261
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

362
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 4>can you imagine a guy trying to emulate his personality?</v>

363
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:42.961
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

364
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 4>they'll never be anybody like Nate.</v>

365
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.960
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

366
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 4>the one thing that impressed me,</v>

367
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:52.620
<v Speaker 4>one thing that impressed me a lot about Nate Diaz is his ability to track,</v>

368
00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 4>talk,</v>

369
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.240
<v Speaker 4>trash talk in the media pack.</v>

370
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:54.901
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

371
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 4>that touched that stuff.</v>

372
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.693
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

373
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.320
<v Speaker 4>some people thought he was going to get trout and he got real real quick.</v>

374
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

375
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:02.671
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

376
00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:03.820
<v Speaker 3>he's good at that.</v>

377
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:04.021
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

378
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:04.381
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

379
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't get rattled and that was a big problem in the first fight,</v>

380
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 3>I think too with Connor did,</v>

381
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 3>he had to overcome,</v>

382
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 3>this is the first guy that not only did he not get rattled,</v>

383
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 3>he got back at him and he made them flinch at the weigh ins.</v>

384
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:17.580
<v Speaker 3>I think that was big.</v>

385
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

386
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Bunch of people talked about that.</v>

387
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Red Band was one of the first people that pointed out to me.</v>

388
00:11:22.361 --> 00:11:23.270
<v Speaker 3>He sent me a thing.</v>

389
00:11:23.271 --> 00:11:23.421
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

390
00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:23.641
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

391
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:23.821
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

392
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:24.654
<v Speaker 3>he flinched.</v>

393
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

394
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:25.681
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

395
00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:26.514
<v Speaker 3>He flinched.</v>

396
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.230
<v Speaker 3>That seems so stupid.</v>

397
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

398
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.030
<v Speaker 3>it seems so fourth grade,</v>

399
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 3>but there might be something to do.</v>

400
00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:34.650
<v Speaker 3>It was that the greatest UFC fight ever.</v>

401
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.211
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it,</v>

402
00:11:36.211 --> 00:11:36.391
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

403
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to tell.</v>

404
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 3>There's so many good ones these days,</v>

405
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 3>but it was a swap meet</v>

406
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.383
<v Speaker 4>flashlights.</v>

407
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.880
<v Speaker 4>The fact that the Connor's considered,</v>

408
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:44.451
<v Speaker 4>oh Ratti,</v>

409
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:45.950
<v Speaker 4>he's considered one of the greatest.</v>

410
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Some people might say he's the greatest of all time.</v>

411
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 4>Some people might say that just based on what they've seen.</v>

412
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.833
<v Speaker 4>It is a,</v>

413
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:51.940
<v Speaker 3>it is amazing,</v>

414
00:11:51.941 --> 00:11:54.700
<v Speaker 3>but then there's condit Robbie Lawler</v>

415
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 2>and the Nate Diaz as well.</v>

416
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.823
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz,</v>

417
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.680
<v Speaker 2>the guy that people consider this,</v>

418
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 2>the new unstoppable force made dia stopped him.</v>

419
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 2>He choked him out.</v>

420
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

421
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.723
<v Speaker 2>second fight.</v>

422
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 2>It could've went either way and I had an ideas winning,</v>

423
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.610
<v Speaker 2>but when looking back at it again,</v>

424
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:09.791
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

425
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:10.061
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

426
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:10.811
<v Speaker 2>that second round,</v>

427
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 2>that's a hard one to score.</v>

428
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 2>I see how it could've gone either way.</v>

429
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

430
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 2>It's almost a shame in a fight that's that close.</v>

431
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Like I would like to see what the results are.</v>

432
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I think the majority of people thought that Conor one,</v>

433
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I think you have to consider those knockdowns and that,</v>

434
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 2>that Connor was staggering him with those straight laughs and,</v>

435
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 2>and cracking them with those leg kicks.</v>

436
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.201
<v Speaker 2>You look,</v>

437
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 2>you're like decisive moments in the fight.</v>

438
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I feel like those decisive moments of super crisp punching,</v>

439
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.850
<v Speaker 2>where knocks him down.</v>

440
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.960
<v Speaker 2>We used repeatedly landing that leg kick that's kind of worth a lot.</v>

441
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Like he was lighting him up barley at first round.</v>

442
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.930
<v Speaker 2>But if it meant that much,</v>

443
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.370
<v Speaker 2>you could look at it in another way.</v>

444
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.263
<v Speaker 2>If it made that much.</v>

445
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it didn't mean that much because if it did,</v>

446
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:54.963
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

447
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.660
<v Speaker 2>how was he on his back when the fight ended and Nate Diaz is on top grounded and</v>

448
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.020
<v Speaker 2>pounded,</v>

449
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.790
<v Speaker 2>like if all that meant so much maybe didn't mean that much after all.</v>

450
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

451
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

452
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

453
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.240
<v Speaker 2>that's just another way of looking at it.</v>

454
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Cause it pride didn't,</v>

455
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:09.280
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

456
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:09.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

457
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:11.830
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows that they uh,</v>

458
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.350
<v Speaker 2>judge fights based on how the fight looks at the end.</v>

459
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:15.243
<v Speaker 2>So how would it,</v>

460
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.890
<v Speaker 2>how would the Japanese look at that?</v>

461
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Well that moment where Nate's on top is huge.</v>

462
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.960
<v Speaker 2>When it finally takes him down.</v>

463
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.800
<v Speaker 2>That's huge.</v>

464
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.633
<v Speaker 2>I thought that's it.</v>

465
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:25.631
<v Speaker 2>That's what I thought at that.</v>

466
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

467
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.011
<v Speaker 2>He got this round.</v>

468
00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

469
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.930
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

470
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty huge because also it's at the end of the fight,</v>

471
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 2>which I agree with you.</v>

472
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it should matter more like,</v>

473
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:39.460
<v Speaker 2>or like the Japanese had it for where the last round was like the most</v>

474
00:13:39.461 --> 00:13:39.971
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>

475
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

476
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.110
<v Speaker 2>The judge the fight as a whole.</v>

477
00:13:42.111 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 2>But how does it look at the end?</v>

478
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Who's getting their ass beat at the end?</v>

479
00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Which is a real a point,</v>

480
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:47.561
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

481
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Because the whole idea about what a fight supposed to be,</v>

482
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:53.050
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be like high level problem solving,</v>

483
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:53.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

484
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

485
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 2>And there's some guys that present like real scary problems and you've got to</v>

486
00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 2>figure those problems out.</v>

487
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 2>And whoever's winning towards the end is the guy that really figured that</v>

488
00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 2>problem out the best.</v>

489
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Cause the guy who was on the ground,</v>

490
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.500
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

491
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.180
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't really be thinking in a fight.</v>

492
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

493
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 2>just I've already ahead.</v>

494
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna let this guy get on top of me.</v>

495
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't,</v>

496
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.790
<v Speaker 2>nobody's thinking that.</v>

497
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

498
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 2>So if the guy does take you down late in the fight is because he's starting to</v>

499
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 2>overwhelm you.</v>

500
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 2>That should be worth a lot.</v>

502
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.360
<v Speaker 2>It should be worth a lot.</v>

503
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:23.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much though.</v>

504
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

505
00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:27.460
<v Speaker 2>how much should a a knock down like the ones that kind of event.</v>

506
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.190
<v Speaker 2>This is a slobber knocker Oh my God.</v>

507
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:31.420
<v Speaker 2>These guys are going after it.</v>

508
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

509
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Throwing some bombs.</v>

510
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

511
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 2>This is outstanding.</v>

512
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh street,</v>

513
00:14:40.061 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 2>right by Lozano.</v>

514
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.133
<v Speaker 2>Lozano.</v>

515
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

516
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:45.581
<v Speaker 2>That was on.</v>

517
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Got That Good Jab.</v>

518
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 2>He's got real good boxing man.</v>

519
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.151
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

520
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:49.984
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentals</v>

521
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.940
<v Speaker 2>and heart.</v>

522
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 5>Both of these guys got some hard.</v>

523
00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

524
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting man.</v>

525
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Deciding how fight should be scored cause I don't,</v>

526
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they've got it down yet.</v>

527
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 3>I think it still needs work as a system because I think we had a bad head start</v>

528
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 3>in MMA.</v>

529
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm starting off with the 10 point must system.</v>

530
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.580
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it's adequate for all the aspects of MMA.</v>

531
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Boxing is only judging one dimension.</v>

532
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.670
<v Speaker 3>They're only judging one style of striking.</v>

533
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:23.750
<v Speaker 3>It's just with the hands.</v>

534
00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:24.200
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

535
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 3>There's a clear rule set.</v>

536
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 3>You could teach somebody yet.</v>

537
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think a lot of people totally understand who's even winning fights</v>

538
00:15:32.381 --> 00:15:33.214
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

539
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.101
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

540
00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:38.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people understand who's who's in a bad position and who's totally</v>

541
00:15:38.991 --> 00:15:39.824
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>

542
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I just think there has to be a level of competency in martial arts themselves to</v>

543
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:47.990
<v Speaker 3>truly grasp it at the highest level.</v>

544
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think like former fighters would be like Ricardo Almeida I know is</v>

545
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.390
<v Speaker 3>doing it in new New Jersey,</v>

546
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.230
<v Speaker 3>which is awesome.</v>

547
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.270
<v Speaker 3>And he's a brilliant guy and it was a great fighter too.</v>

548
00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

549
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 3>and a black belt in Jujitsu completely understand the ground.</v>

550
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the kind of guy you want being a judge.</v>

551
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.660
<v Speaker 3>Like that's perfect.</v>

552
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.940
<v Speaker 3>You want a guy who really understands the sport and it's,</v>

553
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.300
<v Speaker 3>we have to make some sort of consensus as to what's most important.</v>

554
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:14.541
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

555
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:15.374
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna,</v>

556
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna judge the fight the way we're doing it right now,</v>

557
00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:18.681
<v Speaker 3>round by round,</v>

558
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 3>and a guy could just be overwhelming the guy towards the end of the fight and it</v>

559
00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 3>looks like he's winning and he loses a decision,</v>

560
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.960
<v Speaker 3>which I think we all agree,</v>

561
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:27.291
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

562
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:28.490
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't make any sense.</v>

563
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:28.981
<v Speaker 5>See right here,</v>

564
00:16:28.981 --> 00:16:29.280
<v Speaker 5>here's a,</v>

565
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.340
<v Speaker 5>here's a good example.</v>

566
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.160
<v Speaker 5>The first half of this round,</v>

567
00:16:32.161 --> 00:16:33.270
<v Speaker 5>Jim Miller is all over.</v>

568
00:16:33.271 --> 00:16:35.190
<v Speaker 5>Joe Lozan landing the bigger shots.</v>

569
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Speaker 5>But now the rounds ending with Joseph,</v>

570
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.570
<v Speaker 5>Joe Lowe's on getting the takedown and as an over his half guard right now maybe</v>

571
00:16:42.571 --> 00:16:46.020
<v Speaker 5>not doing it the same kind of damage that Jim Miller was doing on him on their</v>

572
00:16:46.021 --> 00:16:46.854
<v Speaker 5>feet.</v>

573
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.600
<v Speaker 5>So if the round ends here,</v>

574
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

575
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.980
<v Speaker 5>some people would give it to Jim,</v>

576
00:16:52.981 --> 00:16:54.060
<v Speaker 5>some people to give it to Joe.</v>

577
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

578
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.600
<v Speaker 5>well this is an awesome round because there's still,</v>

579
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.150
<v Speaker 5>unless it's like a rule,</v>

580
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.190
<v Speaker 5>if in that situation,</v>

581
00:17:02.191 --> 00:17:02.550
<v Speaker 5>Mike,</v>

582
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 5>they have those situations written out,</v>

583
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.040
<v Speaker 5>all the situations,</v>

584
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.630
<v Speaker 5>how do you score it in this situation,</v>

585
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.681
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

586
00:17:07.681 --> 00:17:08.514
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

587
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.330
<v Speaker 5>but then,</v>

588
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:09.551
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

589
00:17:09.551 --> 00:17:12.450
<v Speaker 5>you basically take the judges out of it and then it's more like a,</v>

590
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.553
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

591
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.720
<v Speaker 5>judging system is,</v>

592
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 5>is it,</v>

593
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.483
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

594
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.020
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

595
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 5>it's supposed to be an exact science or do you want,</v>

596
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

597
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:25.821
<v Speaker 3>It's weird man,</v>

598
00:17:25.821 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 3>because you and I might disagree.</v>

599
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.591
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

600
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:28.424
<v Speaker 3>look at that elbow.</v>

601
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean w we would,</v>

602
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:30.230
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

603
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.830
<v Speaker 3>it's very possible that we might disagree about certain aspects of scoring</v>

604
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.270
<v Speaker 5>or maybe it's good that you can trust the judges then that,</v>

605
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.850
<v Speaker 5>that forces the fighters to at not leaving in the hands of the judges.</v>

606
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:41.820
<v Speaker 5>Like everyone else says,</v>

607
00:17:41.821 --> 00:17:42.250
<v Speaker 5>look man,</v>

608
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:42.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

609
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:42.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

610
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.080
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't make any sense.</v>

611
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.160
<v Speaker 3>There's so many MMA fans out there that would make amazing judges.</v>

612
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 3>How people do you think to post</v>

613
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.410
<v Speaker 2>on the underground would be incredible judges.</v>

614
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 2>So many man,</v>

615
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 2>there's so many experts.</v>

616
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Like think of these guys that are doing these youtube clips now.</v>

617
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.280
<v Speaker 2>You know where there are breaking down fights and talking about technique.</v>

618
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen a lot of those?</v>

619
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Like Lawrence Kenshin?</v>

620
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever seen his stuff?</v>

638
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:44.040

639
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.023
<v Speaker 2>Does it bother you?</v>

640
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:46.833
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

644
00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

645
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Did he went right for that arm?</v>

646
00:18:58.930 --> 00:18:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

647
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:00.730
<v Speaker 2>He aunt.</v>

648
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:01.750
<v Speaker 2>So that was the end of the round.</v>

649
00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.853
<v Speaker 2>It's the end of the fight.</v>

650
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:03.641
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

651
00:19:03.641 --> 00:19:05.380
<v Speaker 2>but like that was a,</v>

652
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.150
<v Speaker 2>that was a nice Harmar shit.</v>

653
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.550
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were scanning,</v>

654
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.433
<v Speaker 2>tapped,</v>

655
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.273
<v Speaker 2>escape.</v>

656
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.223
<v Speaker 2>What a fight.</v>

657
00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Unless I didn't hear the bell.</v>

658
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:13.991
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

659
00:19:13.991 --> 00:19:14.824
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

660
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure because they're not showing the,</v>

661
00:19:17.831 --> 00:19:18.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

662
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 2>they would be showing the finish if that,</v>

663
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:21.663
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

664
00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.490
<v Speaker 2>That was in around God damn.</v>

665
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.653
<v Speaker 2>Oof.</v>

666
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Powerful Joe Lowe's on what?</v>

667
00:19:31.221 --> 00:19:32.054
<v Speaker 2>The takedown.</v>

668
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:32.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

669
00:19:32.381 --> 00:19:33.340
<v Speaker 2>take towns are huge,</v>

670
00:19:33.341 --> 00:19:33.940
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

671
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Guys don't want to be taken down.</v>

672
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like how much of a big deal is it?</v>

673
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.030
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be worth a lot,</v>

674
00:19:40.031 --> 00:19:40.630
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

675
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Cause someone's doing something to you that you don't want them to do and it's</v>

676
00:19:43.661 --> 00:19:44.494
<v Speaker 2>hard to do it.</v>

677
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.880
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be worth a lot.</v>

678
00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.500
<v Speaker 2>And I know a lot of people say yeah,</v>

679
00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.341
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

680
00:19:48.341 --> 00:19:50.590
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you've got to take you down and get right back up.</v>

681
00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:51.311
<v Speaker 2>It's no big deal,</v>

682
00:19:51.311 --> 00:19:53.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's still kind of a big deal.</v>

683
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.680
<v Speaker 2>It's still kind of a big deal.</v>

684
00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I took you down,</v>

685
00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.510
<v Speaker 2>you do monitor me,</v>

686
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:00.160
<v Speaker 2>take you down,</v>

687
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.000
<v Speaker 2>and he took you down.</v>

688
00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:01.230
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

689
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.770
<v Speaker 2>and how long did it holds you there?</v>

690
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.350
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be worth something.</v>

691
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:06.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just a question.</v>

692
00:20:06.551 --> 00:20:07.384
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

693
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.360
<v Speaker 2>But what's worth more control or damage?</v>

694
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.070
<v Speaker 2>That's the big question,</v>

695
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:12.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

696
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you define,</v>

697
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can.</v>

698
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

699
00:20:16.301 --> 00:20:17.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't think everybody's going to agree.</v>

700
00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Striker's going to thank [inaudible] important is a worse than being controlled.</v>

701
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.070
<v Speaker 2>You got,</v>

702
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.600
<v Speaker 2>if it comes down between,</v>

703
00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:29.020
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah dude took him down and held on but didn't do any damage.</v>

704
00:20:29.021 --> 00:20:32.800
<v Speaker 2>But earlier in the round he got hit with like three good shots.</v>

705
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Kind of snubbed them and rock them.</v>

706
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.400
<v Speaker 2>You go with the guy that landed the punches,</v>

707
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

708
00:20:36.701 --> 00:20:37.600
<v Speaker 2>You got to have damage,</v>

709
00:20:37.601 --> 00:20:37.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

710
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

711
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

712
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Damage is huge because if you get rocked that means you almost lost the fight</v>

713
00:20:43.151 --> 00:20:43.690
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

714
00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

715
00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>If you get taken down and end up in some dude's full guard or even</v>

716
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.620
<v Speaker 4>side control doesn't mean the fire is almost over.</v>

717
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you,</v>

718
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.700
<v Speaker 4>if you get all the fights that had side controlling them or full garden them and</v>

719
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.480
<v Speaker 4>factor in how many times the fight ended from that position,</v>

720
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

721
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.290
<v Speaker 4>it's super low 0.0,</v>

722
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:06.360
<v Speaker 4>zero 2%</v>

723
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.380
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

724
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:07.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

725
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.693
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

726
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.880
<v Speaker 3>I think there should be a possibility of having long arounds.</v>

727
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be interesting.</v>

728
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered like when you're watching a five minute round and the guy</v>

729
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:25.370
<v Speaker 3>takes a guy down at like three minutes and 50 seconds and then for the next,</v>

730
00:21:25.371 --> 00:21:25.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

731
00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.473
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

732
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:31.080
<v Speaker 3>minute is just completely dominating on the ground and uh,</v>

733
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.750
<v Speaker 3>and you want to see where this plays out.</v>

734
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:34.980
<v Speaker 3>And then the bell rings.</v>

735
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Like that was one of the interesting things about pride as he would see this,</v>

736
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.330
<v Speaker 3>this arc and those 10 minute rounds.</v>

737
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.790
<v Speaker 3>And I know as far as like athletes performance,</v>

738
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.360
<v Speaker 3>it's not the best thing cause it's too hard to do like chill son and thinks five</v>

739
00:21:48.361 --> 00:21:50.700
<v Speaker 3>minutes is too hard and he might be right.</v>

740
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.631
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

741
00:21:51.631 --> 00:21:54.390
<v Speaker 3>And now that everyone is all you cited,</v>

742
00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:55.171
<v Speaker 3>they're a,</v>

743
00:21:55.171 --> 00:21:59.280
<v Speaker 3>they're forced to do this all completely on the natural and it's,</v>

744
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.500
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be hard to fight for five minutes,</v>

745
00:22:01.501 --> 00:22:02.334
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

746
00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.280
<v Speaker 4>is five rounds.</v>

747
00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:05.600
<v Speaker 4>You got to have five minutes.</v>

748
00:22:05.601 --> 00:22:06.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

749
00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.043
<v Speaker 4>five minutes.</v>

750
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.440
<v Speaker 4>Anything shorter than five minutes is ridiculous.</v>

751
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.750
<v Speaker 4>It seems ridiculous for Grammar for sure.</v>

752
00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:12.141
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

753
00:22:12.141 --> 00:22:12.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

754
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.060
<v Speaker 4>organizations like the UFC or Bellator should have the option to do fights where</v>

755
00:22:17.061 --> 00:22:18.370
<v Speaker 4>we're going to this special finds him.</v>

756
00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:22.220
<v Speaker 4>He one 10 minute round or something like that or one five minute round and then</v>

757
00:22:22.221 --> 00:22:25.010
<v Speaker 4>a 10 minute round or 10 minute and then a five minute like pride used to do.</v>

758
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.480
<v Speaker 4>Why the fuck not,</v>

759
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:27.760
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason why,</v>

760
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.350
<v Speaker 4>why you shouldn't be allowed to do that.</v>

761
00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:30.501
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

762
00:22:30.501 --> 00:22:31.460
<v Speaker 4>Jim Miller wins.</v>

763
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:36.470
<v Speaker 4>Split Decision Slobber knocker um,</v>

764
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.640
<v Speaker 4>it was perfect example,</v>

765
00:22:37.641 --> 00:22:37.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

766
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:38.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

767
00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 4>He ended the fight ended with him on his back mounted,</v>

768
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

769
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.790
<v Speaker 4>escaped that arm bar right at the buzzer and he wins.</v>

770
00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.560
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

771
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:47.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

772
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.750
<v Speaker 4>but based on the point system,</v>

773
00:22:50.751 --> 00:22:52.400
<v Speaker 4>he must have won the first and second round.</v>

774
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.271
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

775
00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:53.511
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

776
00:22:53.511 --> 00:22:56.300
<v Speaker 3>I do not think the point system is diverse enough.</v>

777
00:22:56.301 --> 00:22:59.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can have a 10% like the,</v>

778
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.020
<v Speaker 3>the margin is always going to be in these 10% bumps.</v>

779
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.220
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

780
00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:04.731
<v Speaker 3>Like 10,</v>

781
00:23:04.731 --> 00:23:05.091
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

782
00:23:05.091 --> 00:23:05.421
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

783
00:23:05.421 --> 00:23:05.751
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

784
00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:05.991
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

785
00:23:05.991 --> 00:23:07.790
<v Speaker 3>seven that seems crazy to me.</v>

786
00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:08.931
<v Speaker 3>Like why,</v>

787
00:23:08.931 --> 00:23:10.460
<v Speaker 3>why these big jumps?</v>

788
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:11.780
<v Speaker 3>Why these big chunks?</v>

789
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.070
<v Speaker 3>Like 10 point why?</v>

790
00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:18.110
<v Speaker 3>Why is one ten nine round where guy totally kicks guy's ass and it's a ten nine</v>

791
00:23:18.111 --> 00:23:23.111
<v Speaker 3>round and another one a ten nine round where they're just barely squeaking by</v>

792
00:23:23.601 --> 00:23:23.841
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

793
00:23:23.841 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 3>You can't figure out who won.</v>

794
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.060
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea who won who.</v>

795
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.050
<v Speaker 3>How do you score that round?</v>

796
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.990
<v Speaker 3>And you look at the numbers like equal number of punches and kicks,</v>

797
00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:33.440
<v Speaker 3>landed equal number of take downs attempted and defended it.</v>

798
00:23:33.441 --> 00:23:34.610
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck do you do with that?</v>

799
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.140
<v Speaker 3>You do?</v>

800
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.110
<v Speaker 3>You just pick a guy,</v>

801
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.970
<v Speaker 3>you know that's what a lot of guys do,</v>

802
00:23:37.971 --> 00:23:38.241
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

803
00:23:38.241 --> 00:23:38.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

804
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.280
<v Speaker 3>That shouldn't be.</v>

805
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.780
<v Speaker 4>I said I didn't do that.</v>

806
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.780
<v Speaker 4>No you didn't know that.</v>

807
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.720
<v Speaker 4>If the first round was too close to call,</v>

808
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm like I'm not going to call that one.</v>

809
00:23:45.141 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 4>I now cause if the second</v>

810
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.970
<v Speaker 2>one is too close to call,</v>

811
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give them around each and then we're going to decide it and the</v>

812
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 2>third,</v>

813
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:50.361
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

814
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:53.540
<v Speaker 2>I'll just know that you used to do it for the UFC cause it was so long ago.</v>

815
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are not officially,</v>

816
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.660
<v Speaker 2>it was like just the way I scored it in my you,</v>

817
00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.630
<v Speaker 2>you weren't a judge for the UFC,</v>

818
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:02.900
<v Speaker 2>but what you would do was like Harold Letterman on Hbo,</v>

819
00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 2>which I always loved.</v>

820
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I loved that aspect when Harold Letterman would come on,</v>

821
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:08.211
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

822
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 2>tell you how I see it gym and he would go over the score.</v>

823
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.500
<v Speaker 2>You do you remember that guy?</v>

824
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:12.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

825
00:24:12.711 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

826
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

827
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's the best and the spot was based like rip that off.</v>

828
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

829
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.610
<v Speaker 2>I know but it was,</v>

830
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.200
<v Speaker 2>but I liked that.</v>

831
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 2>I think MMA could benefit from something like that.</v>

832
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

833
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Got To get a real fighter in that.</v>

834
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

835
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.030
<v Speaker 2>And I never found you have San never find them in Mesa.</v>

836
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I was the wrong guy.</v>

837
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.590
<v Speaker 2>You weren't the wrong guy.</v>

838
00:24:30.591 --> 00:24:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know a lot about fighting and you had a really good system.</v>

839
00:24:34.491 --> 00:24:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Like your system is probably like one of the best systems.</v>

840
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.073
<v Speaker 2>Plus,</v>

841
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:39.561
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

842
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:40.190
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

843
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.650
<v Speaker 2>if you also analyze the other aspects of the fight,</v>

844
00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:43.710
<v Speaker 2>like if you look at your system,</v>

845
00:24:43.711 --> 00:24:47.390
<v Speaker 2>like you would have like take down from one column and then you would have like</v>

846
00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:51.350
<v Speaker 2>submissions and kicks and punches and you just mark make marks for each guy</v>

847
00:24:51.351 --> 00:24:52.011
<v Speaker 2>whenever you did it.</v>

848
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:53.060
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd look at it at all,</v>

849
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.090
<v Speaker 2>think about it in your head and then decide like what was important.</v>

850
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.810
<v Speaker 2>But I think that is like the,</v>

851
00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.060
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

852
00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.360
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

853
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.550
<v Speaker 2>the big catalyst is like,</v>

854
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.440
<v Speaker 2>you know those subjective calls that you have.</v>

855
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Speaker 2>But towards the end of the round,</v>

856
00:25:05.121 --> 00:25:07.250
<v Speaker 2>even though he only landed four or five punches,</v>

857
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.140
<v Speaker 2>he had his opponent really badly hurt.</v>

858
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:10.280
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to give him the round,</v>

859
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.060
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

860
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:11.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

861
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:14.930
<v Speaker 2>The only reason I did that is because I had to go on air and I didn't know what</v>

862
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:15.711
<v Speaker 2>the fuck I'm talking about.</v>

863
00:25:15.711 --> 00:25:16.640
<v Speaker 2>And when you're watching a fight,</v>

864
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:17.474
<v Speaker 2>you forget.</v>

865
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.010
<v Speaker 2>So I would write any,</v>

866
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:22.640
<v Speaker 2>anything significant I would write down and I have the shorthand for it,</v>

867
00:25:22.641 --> 00:25:24.650
<v Speaker 2>like left hook himself.</v>

868
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.760
<v Speaker 2>I went on air,</v>

869
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I could look down at that and go,</v>

870
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.281
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

871
00:25:28.281 --> 00:25:29.990
<v Speaker 2>early in the round he had to take down,</v>

872
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:34.250
<v Speaker 2>but he did get knocked down and he'd landed a couple leg kicks and I'm going to</v>

873
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:35.140
<v Speaker 2>give the roundup boom,</v>

874
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

875
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.720
<v Speaker 2>that way I sounded like I actually remembered what I was watching,</v>

876
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.760
<v Speaker 2>but that's cheating.</v>

877
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.220
<v Speaker 2>But it would make um,</v>

878
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.730
<v Speaker 2>scoring easier when I could go back in the round and go,</v>

879
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

880
00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:47.901
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

881
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:49.040
<v Speaker 2>can we get it to this dude?</v>

882
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

883
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:53.990
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to go back and review it around instead of going on pure memory</v>

884
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes you forget it's a five minute round.</v>

885
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Something happens in the first 45 seconds and then a bunch of other shit happens</v>

886
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:00.120
<v Speaker 2>in the middle.</v>

887
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Now there's 15 seconds left,</v>

888
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.570
<v Speaker 2>some shit's going down.</v>

889
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>You might have forgotten that shit in the beginning.</v>

890
00:26:04.071 --> 00:26:04.904
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

891
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:05.601
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

892
00:26:05.601 --> 00:26:06.434
<v Speaker 2>I think too,</v>

893
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.360
<v Speaker 2>when you're really involved in a fight,</v>

894
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.600
<v Speaker 2>you're in the moment in a lot of ways.</v>

895
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:11.781
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

896
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:12.501
<v Speaker 2>you're watching it.</v>

897
00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:12.711
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

898
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:13.491
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen?</v>

899
00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:14.031
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen?</v>

900
00:26:14.031 --> 00:26:17.090
<v Speaker 2>You'll locked in the moment and I don't know about you,</v>

901
00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:20.120
<v Speaker 2>but when I'm in that spot I don't have like the best memory.</v>

902
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

903
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.800
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

904
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.570
<v Speaker 2>The more I'm enjoying a fight,</v>

905
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.270
<v Speaker 2>like I'll remember it after the fight,</v>

906
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.270
<v Speaker 2>but like while it's going on I'm,</v>

907
00:26:28.271 --> 00:26:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about what's happening only and I'm like,</v>

908
00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

909
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.670
<v Speaker 2>that did happen.</v>

910
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:32.121
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's right.</v>

911
00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:33.710
<v Speaker 2>He took him down off the choke.</v>

912
00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:34.100
<v Speaker 2>I forgot.</v>

913
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.090
<v Speaker 2>How did I forget the choke?</v>

914
00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.081
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>

915
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:36.321
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

916
00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember any of this shit.</v>

917
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Well you get so locked up in them over a course of five rounds.</v>

918
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I know that Robby versus Carlos</v>

919
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.630
<v Speaker 1>condit was one of my favorite fights ever.</v>

920
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.220
<v Speaker 1>But I couldn't tell you what happened.</v>

921
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.143
<v Speaker 1>God dammit</v>

922
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.960
<v Speaker 4>conduit Maya is right now.</v>

923
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 4>It's so exciting.</v>

924
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.540
<v Speaker 4>I love this fight.</v>

925
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.940
<v Speaker 4>You know there is hope that these,</v>

926
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 4>these conversations that we have in podcasts about the scoring system,</v>

927
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:05.010
<v Speaker 4>it should be this or it should be that.</v>

928
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 4>It is nice to know.</v>

929
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.793
<v Speaker 4>I thought they were,</v>

930
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:08.521
<v Speaker 4>to tell you the truth.</v>

931
00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 4>There was a couple times he got into it when I'm like,</v>

932
00:27:10.141 --> 00:27:11.580
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck are we talking about this shit?</v>

933
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:12.840
<v Speaker 4>This shit's never going to change this.</v>

934
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:13.674
<v Speaker 4>It's like forget it.</v>

935
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.281
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

936
00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:15.114
<v Speaker 4>Let's just drop it.</v>

937
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.433
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

938
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.870
<v Speaker 4>but there is hope because there have been changing.</v>

939
00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

940
00:27:19.271 --> 00:27:21.940
<v Speaker 1>They made the new changes to the touching and the ground,</v>

941
00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:22.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

942
00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:22.731
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

943
00:27:22.731 --> 00:27:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Explain.</v>

944
00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:23.973
<v Speaker 1>You probably know you,</v>

945
00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.230
<v Speaker 1>I think you told me so can you refresh my memory?</v>

946
00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

947
00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:26.981
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

948
00:27:26.981 --> 00:27:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to screw this up and I'm not exactly sure it goes when it goes into</v>

949
00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:31.511
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

950
00:27:31.511 --> 00:27:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I probably should know this year.</v>

951
00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:33.880
<v Speaker 1>First of the year.</v>

952
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

953
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what I look at Jamie.</v>

954
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.313
<v Speaker 1>Powerful</v>

955
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.890
<v Speaker 1>way into where you are in the UFC.</v>

956
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Big Time.</v>

957
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:41.880
<v Speaker 1>When you first started working with chuck,</v>

958
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.240
<v Speaker 1>that really someone looked at me,</v>

959
00:27:43.241 --> 00:27:44.750
<v Speaker 1>look this up during the fights last weekend.</v>

960
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.810
<v Speaker 1>So you were just a Joe Rogan Fan,</v>

961
00:27:46.811 --> 00:27:47.321
<v Speaker 1>but you're like,</v>

962
00:27:47.321 --> 00:27:48.310
<v Speaker 1>when he would talk about MMA,</v>

963
00:27:48.311 --> 00:27:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

967
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.890
<v Speaker 1>It still doesn't stick very much for some reason.</v>

968
00:27:53.891 --> 00:27:54.724
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

995
00:28:36.161 --> 00:28:36.640

1012
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:07.030
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it crazy that MMA is the sport where girls,</v>

1013
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.800
<v Speaker 4>women found a fucking hole out of now they can just blossom and explode through</v>

1014
00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:14.341
<v Speaker 4>the galaxy.</v>

1015
00:29:14.341 --> 00:29:17.730
<v Speaker 4>Now they can't do that with women's basketball.</v>

1016
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.870
<v Speaker 4>No one's watching that shit.</v>

1017
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.940
<v Speaker 4>Women's baseball.</v>

1018
00:29:20.941 --> 00:29:22.080
<v Speaker 4>There's no women's baseball.</v>

1019
00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:24.570
<v Speaker 4>They've got women's softball and they show the college,</v>

1020
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:25.410
<v Speaker 4>but there's no future.</v>

1021
00:29:25.411 --> 00:29:27.000
<v Speaker 4>There's no money in any of that shit.</v>

1022
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.130
<v Speaker 4>They'll show women's fucking volleyball,</v>

1023
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.230
<v Speaker 4>but there's no pro women's volleyball leagues.</v>

1024
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.310
<v Speaker 4>That's a good idea.</v>

1025
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.000
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1026
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.200
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1027
00:29:34.201 --> 00:29:35.280
<v Speaker 4>you're watching the Olympics,</v>

1028
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:35.761
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1029
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 4>You're watching the Olympics and I'm like,</v>

1030
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.730
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1031
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:39.950
<v Speaker 4>they barely show,</v>

1032
00:29:39.951 --> 00:29:41.320
<v Speaker 4>when they show men's volleyball,</v>

1033
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 4>it's like for three</v>

1034
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:42.491
<v Speaker 6>minutes,</v>

1035
00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:42.761
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

1036
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1037
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.820
<v Speaker 6>what's the least amount of time we can get away with showing the men's</v>

1038
00:29:45.821 --> 00:29:47.650
<v Speaker 6>volleyball so they could focus on the women?</v>

1039
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.140
<v Speaker 6>The women volleyball players are superstars,</v>

1040
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.011
<v Speaker 6>but like the men,</v>

1041
00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:51.311
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>

1042
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:51.581
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1043
00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:52.091
<v Speaker 6>two minutes.</v>

1044
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:52.924
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

1045
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 6>no one's paying attention to the men's volleyball.</v>

1046
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 6>Nobody watches has got the lowest ratings ever.</v>

1047
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.470
<v Speaker 6>But for some reason people are interested in women's volleyball or the beach.</v>

1048
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:05.740
<v Speaker 6>But how did beach volleyball become an Olympic sport?</v>

1049
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.360
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu dude.</v>

1050
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.970
<v Speaker 6>Seeing what they're wearing.</v>

1051
00:30:09.971 --> 00:30:10.661
<v Speaker 6>Fantastic.</v>

1052
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:11.411
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

1053
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:12.520
<v Speaker 6>Areas that we think,</v>

1054
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:12.881
<v Speaker 6>look no,</v>

1055
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:14.230
<v Speaker 6>they have to be almost naked.</v>

1056
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.501
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1057
00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:15.334
<v Speaker 6>it's falling.</v>

1058
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:16.840
<v Speaker 6>Oh it's volleyball.</v>

1059
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.080
<v Speaker 6>Volleyball is such a sophisticated sport.</v>

1060
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.741
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

1061
00:30:20.741 --> 00:30:21.130
<v Speaker 6>I love,</v>

1062
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.150
<v Speaker 6>it's a lot to it,</v>

1063
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:22.541
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1064
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:22.991
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

1065
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:24.580
<v Speaker 6>you can't play it in shorts.</v>

1066
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:27.963
<v Speaker 6>Can't be done.</v>

1067
00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:28.711
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

1068
00:30:28.711 --> 00:30:29.840
<v Speaker 6>you must wear,</v>

1069
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:32.801
<v Speaker 6>it's the best.</v>

1070
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:33.281
<v Speaker 6>Trust me.</v>

1071
00:30:33.281 --> 00:30:36.220
<v Speaker 6>You'll get better vertical loose shorts or anything.</v>

1072
00:30:36.221 --> 00:30:36.761
<v Speaker 6>Baggies.</v>

1073
00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:37.271
<v Speaker 6>Not Good.</v>

1074
00:30:37.271 --> 00:30:37.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:38.830
<v Speaker 6>They'll put sun lamps on you.</v>

1076
00:30:38.831 --> 00:30:39.131
<v Speaker 6>Bitch,</v>

1077
00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:40.010
<v Speaker 6>take your clothes off.</v>

1078
00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:43.720
<v Speaker 6>It's that hot enough.</v>

1079
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:45.160
<v Speaker 6>Could someone make a fire?</v>

1080
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.130
<v Speaker 6>I think volleyball and then the gymnastic</v>

1081
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.120
<v Speaker 6>trying to find men's gymnastics.</v>

1082
00:30:52.121 --> 00:30:53.680
<v Speaker 6>It's on for three minutes.</v>

1083
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:54.643
<v Speaker 6>They go,</v>

1084
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.830
<v Speaker 6>they go to Bob Costas.</v>

1085
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.830
<v Speaker 6>He gives you a quick review and then they go to the seven hours straight.</v>

1086
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.900
<v Speaker 6>They do the curls all day.</v>

1087
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:02.621
<v Speaker 6>The guys,</v>

1088
00:31:02.621 --> 00:31:05.090
<v Speaker 6>they want to see them do the rings or they want to see him break a leg.</v>

1089
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:05.801
<v Speaker 6>Real quick.</v>

1091
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:06.634
<v Speaker 6>Just in and out.</v>

1092
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.000
<v Speaker 6>We'll fit them in digital little dead time cause they got it.</v>

1093
00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:11.320
<v Speaker 6>They can't make it that obvious.</v>

1094
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.393
<v Speaker 6>Come on.</v>

1095
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:17.910
<v Speaker 6>They came us women's gymnastics and volleyball and soccer and all that shit you</v>

1096
00:31:17.951 --> 00:31:20.150
<v Speaker 6>can't do that is when they got a fucking bar.</v>

1097
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.220
<v Speaker 6>Is Women's volleyball like the most sexist sport ever?</v>

1098
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.113
<v Speaker 6>Like look,</v>

1099
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.830
<v Speaker 6>come on.</v>

1100
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.190
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it if they want to dress like that,</v>

1101
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:34.270
<v Speaker 6>but the fact that they make them all just like that is that real picture fucking</v>

1102
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:35.104
<v Speaker 6>crazy.</v>

1103
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 6>Like this isn't like,</v>

1104
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.810
<v Speaker 6>it's not like to stay alive or something.</v>

1105
00:31:38.811 --> 00:31:40.810
<v Speaker 6>Do you need to wear like as little clothing as possible?</v>

1106
00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:43.660
<v Speaker 6>Like that doesn't make any sense why they're in their underwear.</v>

1107
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:44.500
<v Speaker 6>Look at this.</v>

1108
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:44.980
<v Speaker 6>Look at that.</v>

1109
00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.813
<v Speaker 6>Why the fuck?</v>

1110
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.370
<v Speaker 6>What am I picks?</v>

1111
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.380
<v Speaker 6>Are they going to be allowed to wear thongs or is it written somewhere that they</v>

1112
00:31:50.381 --> 00:31:51.850
<v Speaker 6>can't actually wear a thong?</v>

1113
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.713
<v Speaker 6>Is that,</v>

1114
00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 6>why did they have to dress like with that?</v>

1115
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.990
<v Speaker 6>That's a ridiculous,</v>

1116
00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:56.883
<v Speaker 6>and they're in</v>

1117
00:31:58.570 --> 00:31:59.560
<v Speaker 6>very hot on the beach.</v>

1118
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.910
<v Speaker 6>It's so stupid.</v>

1119
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.320
<v Speaker 6>Beach Volleyball's in an Olympics poured</v>

1120
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.123
<v Speaker 6>out on the beach.</v>

1121
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.441
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1122
00:32:06.441 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

1123
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.960
<v Speaker 6>I go to the beach too.</v>

1124
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.380
<v Speaker 6>I don't wear underwear like that.</v>

1125
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:12.190
<v Speaker 6>Like that same fucking beach.</v>

1126
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:13.001
<v Speaker 6>I wear shorts.</v>

1127
00:32:13.001 --> 00:32:13.834
<v Speaker 6>It's incredible.</v>

1128
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:14.300
<v Speaker 6>Team,</v>

1129
00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Speaker 6>Egypt was,</v>

1130
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:15.760
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

1131
00:32:15.761 --> 00:32:17.200
<v Speaker 6>Egypt's than just like mummies.</v>

1132
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 6>Three people watch men's volleyball.</v>

1133
00:32:19.331 --> 00:32:19.601
<v Speaker 6>Come on,</v>

1134
00:32:19.601 --> 00:32:20.171
<v Speaker 6>think about that.</v>

1135
00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:21.640
<v Speaker 6>Who's watching men's volleyball?</v>

1136
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.770
<v Speaker 6>Why does Egypt have to wear so much clothes?</v>

1137
00:32:23.771 --> 00:32:24.700
<v Speaker 6>That a religious thing.</v>

1138
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:25.983
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1140
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.420
<v Speaker 6>I would like to see that game.</v>

1141
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.650
<v Speaker 6>Are there highlights of that one?</v>

1142
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:33.370
<v Speaker 6>I want to see the think that there would be a benefit in wearing that as far as</v>

1143
00:32:33.371 --> 00:32:36.330
<v Speaker 6>like not getting your skin scratched up by the sand look.</v>

1144
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.203
<v Speaker 6>Does that make sense?</v>

1145
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.033
<v Speaker 6>But that would make you,</v>

1146
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 2>that's brutal man.</v>

1147
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Religions that make you wear certain clothes.</v>

1148
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Like you're only allowed to wear certain clothes.</v>

1149
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.530
<v Speaker 2>How bout and everyone's like,</v>

1150
00:32:49.531 --> 00:32:50.271
<v Speaker 2>you will kill you,</v>

1151
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:53.420
<v Speaker 2>but if you cut your dick off you can cause a,</v>

1152
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.490
<v Speaker 2>apparently it's okay.</v>

1153
00:32:55.491 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say that you can't be a transvestite or a transgender,</v>

1154
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 2>but you can't be gay if you're gay.</v>

1155
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.310
<v Speaker 2>A lot of gay people in the Middle East,</v>

1156
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.680
<v Speaker 2>they got to become transgenders or they'll die.</v>

1157
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.990
<v Speaker 2>I read something about that's on vice news.</v>

1158
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit is vice real.</v>

1159
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I saw that on vice news.</v>

1160
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1161
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 2>you know it's a whole episode of vice covers.</v>

1162
00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 2>A lot of different subjects from what?</v>

1163
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:18.110
<v Speaker 2>A lot of different authors,</v>

1164
00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:18.944
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

1165
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.690
<v Speaker 2>if they're saying it so well,</v>

1166
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.420
<v Speaker 2>it's Shane Smith is a friend of mine,</v>

1167
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.523
<v Speaker 2>the guy who owns it.</v>

1168
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:30.230
<v Speaker 2>But Fox that show as a matter of how much it's happening in my bs and might be</v>

1169
00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:32.474
<v Speaker 2>insignificant.</v>

1170
00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Olympics,</v>

1171
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Mongolian wrestling coaches strip and protest of loss.</v>

1172
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.080
<v Speaker 2>What they started,</v>

1173
00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.190
<v Speaker 2>they started throwing their clothes at the judges.</v>

1174
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.093
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1175
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Was it a decision that bad?</v>

1176
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Pretty bad about the guys that got robbed and real right there.</v>

1177
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Did that happen a lot?</v>

1178
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:51.021
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1179
00:33:51.021 --> 00:33:51.830
<v Speaker 2>it didn't happen.</v>

1180
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Like I made that story.</v>

1181
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:53.744
<v Speaker 2>That was bullshit.</v>

1182
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:54.811
<v Speaker 2>Nobody got rob.</v>

1183
00:33:54.811 --> 00:33:55.071
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1184
00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:56.000
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get robbed.</v>

1185
00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:56.834
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1186
00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Don't even hear about this.</v>

1187
00:33:58.101 --> 00:33:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's a lie.</v>

1188
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1189
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.030
<v Speaker 2>they have video cameras.</v>

1190
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.070
<v Speaker 2>That's why he had to tell the real story.</v>

1191
00:34:04.071 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 2>They had security cameras from the place you might go to jail for it.</v>

1192
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:08.203
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1193
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.650
<v Speaker 2>so nobody got robbed?</v>

1194
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.221
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1195
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:10.840
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1196
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.170
<v Speaker 2>not only did you get robbed,</v>

1197
00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.090
<v Speaker 2>but he changed his story and a,</v>

1198
00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.520
<v Speaker 2>he sponsors dumped him.</v>

1199
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:17.661
<v Speaker 2>He had a like a,</v>

1200
00:34:17.661 --> 00:34:19.130
<v Speaker 2>a massive sponsored dump.</v>

1201
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:20.870
<v Speaker 2>He was drunk.</v>

1202
00:34:20.871 --> 00:34:21.980
<v Speaker 2>I guess he fucked up.</v>

1203
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean a guy did apparently pull a gun on them,</v>

1204
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:26.414
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1205
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.403
<v Speaker 2>Didn't the guy,</v>

1206
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.840
<v Speaker 2>apparently the vandalized a gas station.</v>

1207
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1208
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.280
<v Speaker 2>And the security guard was making them pay for it and you didn't.</v>

1209
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.640
<v Speaker 2>And whether or not they wanted to do or not,</v>

1210
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:37.310
<v Speaker 2>but did the security guard to make them pay?</v>

1211
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Did okay?</v>

1212
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:40.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:34:40.521 --> 00:34:41.600
<v Speaker 2>But see man,</v>

1214
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.370
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1215
00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Even that alone,</v>

1216
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 2>like that story alone,</v>

1217
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.570
<v Speaker 2>if they just told the truth,</v>

1218
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.590
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty sketchy.</v>

1219
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.500
<v Speaker 2>You know what was the truth?</v>

1220
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:53.210
<v Speaker 2>A gun pulled on you in Brazil.</v>

1221
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 2>So the gun did get pulled on them.</v>

1222
00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they vandalize a door.</v>

1223
00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Julie say Ryan Lochte,</v>

1224
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.090
<v Speaker 2>the Heisei.</v>

1225
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.600
<v Speaker 2>So the guide that's claiming they got robbed,</v>

1226
00:35:02.601 --> 00:35:04.640
<v Speaker 2>he was doing some bet vandalizing.</v>

1227
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Now he,</v>

1228
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I just think they were drunk apparently.</v>

1229
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.420
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1230
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.290
<v Speaker 2>I like to say apparently,</v>

1231
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:09.471
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1232
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:11.270

1233
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.033

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.610
<v Speaker 2>they broke a bathroom door or something.</v>

1237
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:17.421
<v Speaker 2>Is that the story?</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's not a good feeling.</v>

1301
00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.210
<v Speaker 1>That is not a good feeling.</v>

1302
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.560
<v Speaker 1>You can see like when one person is just,</v>

1303
00:37:26.561 --> 00:37:29.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to catch fire,</v>

1304
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.630
<v Speaker 1>starting to find it and feel it and then you see like uh,</v>

1305
00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.810
<v Speaker 1>their skill levels play out too.</v>

1306
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Like vanzant like super scrappy on the ground,</v>

1307
00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:38.920
<v Speaker 1>really tough.</v>

1308
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.760
<v Speaker 1>But Rawlings is just a seasoned striker man.</v>

1309
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Really Crisp.</v>

1310
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:46.211
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1311
00:37:46.211 --> 00:37:47.770
<v Speaker 1>look at those mu the movement right there.</v>

1312
00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Like though she sets up and then she doesn't like it.</v>

1313
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.970
<v Speaker 1>She's not there.</v>

1314
00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:52.923
<v Speaker 1>See Ya.</v>

1315
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Like if you hit her,</v>

1316
00:37:54.821 --> 00:37:56.350
<v Speaker 1>you're catching her on the end to shit.</v>

1317
00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.850
<v Speaker 1>She's sliding away from it.</v>

1318
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting cause you're seeing like the level of skill and women's MMA</v>

1319
00:38:05.141 --> 00:38:06.820
<v Speaker 1>like continue to go up and up.</v>

1320
00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.730
<v Speaker 1>These girls are having fucking dog fights man.</v>

1321
00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Some of the fights we've seen</v>

1322
00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.850
<v Speaker 6>and more and more of them are developing power.</v>

1323
00:38:13.851 --> 00:38:14.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1324

1330
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:23.730
<v Speaker 6>That and that other spinning kick that she missed by a mile but was awesome</v>

1331
00:38:23.731 --> 00:38:24.230
<v Speaker 6>looking.</v>

1332

<v Speaker 6>She's going to be on slowmo highlight reel.</v>

1333
00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:27.020
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

1334
00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.000
<v Speaker 6>Someone caught that someone got shot in the truck.</v>

1335
00:38:30.001 --> 00:38:31.020
<v Speaker 6>Did you save that?</v>

1336
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.180
<v Speaker 6>It's so true.</v>

1337
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:34.181
<v Speaker 6>It's so true.</v>

1338
00:38:34.181 --> 00:38:35.200
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that a good shot of that?</v>

1339
00:38:35.201 --> 00:38:36.340
<v Speaker 6>Which is just up there spinning</v>

1340
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:36.701
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1342
00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.110
<v Speaker 2>In the middle of a fight.</v>

1343
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.420
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if we landed,</v>

1344
00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:42.070
<v Speaker 2>we just need a couple of just one per round.</v>

1345
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Just give me something crazy.</v>

1346
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 2>But they told her to do it.</v>

1347
00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>

1348
00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Just do some crazy dancing with thinking about a Nike commercial or something.</v>

1349
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:48.821
<v Speaker 2>Well Reebok,</v>

<v Speaker 2>nice combination.</v>

1353
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Right leg kick and then a right hand by page.</v>

1354
00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.130
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1355
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Paige starting to find our rhythm man.</v>

1356
00:38:56.781 --> 00:38:57.411
<v Speaker 2>Maybe page,</v>

1357
00:38:57.411 --> 00:38:57.770
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1358
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:58.670
<v Speaker 2>this is a strategy.</v>

1359
00:38:58.671 --> 00:39:00.030
<v Speaker 2>Just go backwards for a while.</v>

1360
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.320
<v Speaker 2>Well she so scrappy man and she's so fit and she's constantly thrown down with</v>

1361
00:39:05.391 --> 00:39:06.650
<v Speaker 2>bad ass dudes.</v>

1362
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.071
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1363
00:39:07.071 --> 00:39:08.840
<v Speaker 2>so is Beck Rawlings,</v>

1364
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.590
<v Speaker 2>but like Paige is one of those Alpha male athletes.</v>

1365
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:17.770
<v Speaker 2>So she's at a team Alpha male with Uriah Faber and Chad Mendez and Cody</v>

1366
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Garbrandt and there's a ton of savages and Justin Buchholz who's the the trainer</v>

1367
00:39:24.411 --> 00:39:26.090
<v Speaker 2>there now who's one of the trainers there now.</v>

1368
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.640
<v Speaker 2>And I think Justin is still fighting to keep,</v>

1369
00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.110
<v Speaker 2>imagine how big pages a MMA and fitness academy would be.</v>

1370
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:34.123
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord.</v>

1371
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Alpha female.</v>

1372
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:36.763
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord.</v>

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:38.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1375
00:39:38.461 --> 00:39:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Just have a bunch of bad ass bitches smacking people and that then brings him</v>

1376
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.480
<v Speaker 2>the dude's and then that brings in the dude's and it's like a,</v>

1377
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.820
<v Speaker 2>it's like a nightclub after awhile.</v>

1378
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.173
<v Speaker 2>Soon as you walk in,</v>

1379
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.013
<v Speaker 2>there's no light,</v>

1380
00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:57.420
<v Speaker 2>just strobe light working out to a strobe light.</v>

1381
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.981
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine?</v>

1382
00:39:57.981 --> 00:39:58.540
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>

1383
00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:58.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1384
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.930
<v Speaker 2>and there's mirrors everywhere and strobes going off.</v>

1385
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Go go dancers.</v>

1386
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.240
<v Speaker 2>A shot girl.</v>

1387
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what she imagined.</v>

1388
00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:09.540
<v Speaker 2>That's what Bellah toward.</v>

1389
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Does they just go,</v>

1390
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.140
<v Speaker 2>did you go straight strip club?</v>

1391
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:14.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean Bela Tarr.</v>

1392
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.330
<v Speaker 2>If Bella door decided to,</v>

1393
00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:17.230
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

1394
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:18.000
<v Speaker 2>The shows.</v>

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1396
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.740
<v Speaker 2>in the dark.</v>

1397
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1398
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Without the fighter's got a fight with like flashing lights and competing with</v>

1399
00:40:24.691 --> 00:40:25.524
<v Speaker 2>them May.</v>

1400
00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:27.690
<v Speaker 2>It's just too hard to catch up to the UFC.</v>

1401
00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:30.090
<v Speaker 2>So what we're gonna do is obscure the lighting.</v>

1402
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.380
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make it a,</v>

1403
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:32.610
<v Speaker 2>everyone's going to wear neon.</v>

1404
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.430
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be hard.</v>

1405
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:38.430
<v Speaker 2>They do have to do like neon around the risks so that you know we're going to do</v>

1406
00:40:39.031 --> 00:40:39.864
<v Speaker 2>a special no.</v>

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.010
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:54.920
<v Speaker 6>Out of nowhere.</v>

1416
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:55.820
<v Speaker 6>Damn.</v>

1417
00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.140
<v Speaker 6>That was incredible.</v>

1418
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.180
<v Speaker 2>And then she just fucking swarmed on.</v>

1419
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.730
<v Speaker 2>She's a tough girl,</v>

1420
00:41:03.731 --> 00:41:04.300
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1421
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.530
<v Speaker 2>That was a tough girl.</v>

1422
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the one that's going to make the highlight.</v>

1423
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:09.431
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1424
00:41:09.431 --> 00:41:10.181

00:41:10.181 --> 00:41:10.451
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1426
00:41:10.451 --> 00:41:12.760
<v Speaker 2>She jumping in roundhouse kicked her in the face.</v>

1427
00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.210
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1429
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:17.570
<v Speaker 2>That was sensational.</v>

1430
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that was the plan to get her to come in,</v>

1431
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.640
<v Speaker 2>get her,</v>

1432
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.070
<v Speaker 2>just keep her coming in.</v>

1433
00:41:25.071 --> 00:41:25.611
<v Speaker 2>Coming in,</v>

1434
00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:26.444
<v Speaker 2>coming in.</v>

1435
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1436
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.520
<v Speaker 2>it looked like,</v>

1437
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:29.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1438
00:41:29.031 --> 00:41:30.260
<v Speaker 2>she was having her moments,</v>

1439
00:41:30.261 --> 00:41:34.610
<v Speaker 2>but it looked like back Rawlings was having an advantage over her and the</v>

1440
00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:35.241
<v Speaker 2>striking,</v>

1441
00:41:35.241 --> 00:41:36.074
<v Speaker 2>didn't you agree?</v>

1442
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.131
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1443
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:37.670

1504
00:43:00.391 --> 00:43:01.320

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.340
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1507
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.240
<v Speaker 2>that's the Jackie Chan realm.</v>

1508
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.010
<v Speaker 2>That's taekwondo.</v>

1509
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:09.751
<v Speaker 2>People get mad.</v>

1510
00:43:09.751 --> 00:43:10.584
<v Speaker 2>I say it wrong.</v>

1511
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.680
<v Speaker 2>That's almost like a one,</v>

1512
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.980
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1513
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1514
00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.400
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a wow.</v>

1515
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1516
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Well it's um,</v>

1517
00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.830
<v Speaker 2>except it's round instead of like that front snap kick.</v>

1518
00:43:19.831 --> 00:43:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1519
00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:21.210
<v Speaker 2>But some Kyokushin guys,</v>

1520
00:43:21.211 --> 00:43:21.841
<v Speaker 2>you still like that?</v>

1521
00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:25.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just basically a traditional sort of a karate style.</v>

1522
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:26.780
<v Speaker 2>One's ones around kick,</v>

1523
00:43:26.781 --> 00:43:26.881
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1524
00:43:26.881 --> 00:43:29.160
<v Speaker 2>It could be that or it could be double round kick.</v>

1525
00:43:29.161 --> 00:43:31.950
<v Speaker 2>You could like throw the first one just trying to touch.</v>

1526
00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.950
<v Speaker 2>You're not really trying to get all the power and it just trying to just touch</v>

1527
00:43:34.951 --> 00:43:38.400
<v Speaker 2>it so you could brace off of it and then switch the hips over and throw that</v>

1528
00:43:38.401 --> 00:43:39.060
<v Speaker 2>second one.</v>

1529
00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.520
<v Speaker 2>You see me doing a bag before you got to do a DVD of her.</v>

1530
00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.640
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking kicks to come home with a w</v>

1531
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:50.190
<v Speaker 2>and then just put it away for free and just give it away for a dollar.</v>

1532
00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:55.850
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that I think that shouldn't be an instructional online is uh,</v>

1533
00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:01.380
<v Speaker 2>how to correctly throw that turning sidekick to get power in it.</v>

1534
00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:05.160
<v Speaker 2>There's this almost should be like an instruction on that.</v>

1535
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:06.150
<v Speaker 2>You should make it.</v>

1536
00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:06.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1537
00:44:06.661 --> 00:44:07.111
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>

1538
00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:07.921
<v Speaker 2>I wish there was this guy,</v>

1539
00:44:07.921 --> 00:44:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

1540
00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.140
<v Speaker 2>well you kind of did that GSP kick.</v>

1541
00:44:10.141 --> 00:44:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean that helped a little was an instructional yeah.</v>

1542
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.370
<v Speaker 2>He basically got all your points out.</v>

1543
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.600
<v Speaker 2>It was five minutes or something,</v>

1544
00:44:15.601 --> 00:44:15.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1545
00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1546
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:17.460
<v Speaker 2>there could be,</v>

1547
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:22.260
<v Speaker 2>you could do it the way you would teach him and GSP you would do it the way you</v>

1548
00:44:22.261 --> 00:44:22.951
<v Speaker 2>would teach someone.</v>

1549
00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:24.090
<v Speaker 2>You would break it down.</v>

1550
00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:24.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1551
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.720
<v Speaker 2>cause I think like a lot of it is that people are missing,</v>

1552
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.390
<v Speaker 2>they're missing like one aspect of it did.</v>

1553
00:44:30.391 --> 00:44:31.140
<v Speaker 2>They just don't.</v>

1554
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1555
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 2>And they</v>

1556
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 3>put the other stuff together and it just doesn't work correctly because of it.</v>

1557
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:36.031
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

1558
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:39.580
<v Speaker 3>that aspect is that sidekick is like getting the knee out for the regular side</v>

1559
00:44:39.581 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 3>kick and then extending the body.</v>

1560
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.181
<v Speaker 3>That's where all the,</v>

1561
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:44.940
<v Speaker 3>like the efficiency and the torque and the power is.</v>

1562
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.810
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it crazy that something as simple as the turning side kick or just the</v>

1563
00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:49.860
<v Speaker 3>regular sidekick?</v>

1564
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.270
<v Speaker 3>It's so simple.</v>

1565
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows what it is.</v>

1566
00:44:52.631 --> 00:44:56.250
<v Speaker 3>It's sidekick is like probably one of the most popular kicking,</v>

1567
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.540
<v Speaker 3>kicking names,</v>

1568
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:57.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1569
00:44:57.901 --> 00:45:02.190
<v Speaker 3>and yet very few people on the planet and know how to throw it.</v>

1570
00:45:02.191 --> 00:45:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1571
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Especially like an MMA and the UFC.</v>

1572
00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.170
<v Speaker 3>How many guys throw it right?</v>

1573
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:07.741
<v Speaker 3>Would you say?</v>

1574
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:08.730
<v Speaker 3>Ten five.</v>

1575
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

1576
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.020
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to say because a lot of them don't do it when they're fighting.</v>

1577
00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:14.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not a common technique,</v>

1578
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.560
<v Speaker 3>but Wonderboy does it perfect.</v>

1579
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Really with power and everywhere.</v>

1580
00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:18.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1581
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.530
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what kind of power.</v>

1582
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:20.021
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1583
00:45:20.021 --> 00:45:20.221
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1584
00:45:20.221 --> 00:45:20.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1585
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:25.640
<v Speaker 3>Well wonder boy when he fights he keeps you at the very end cause he's real tall</v>

1586
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:26.890
<v Speaker 3>and long.</v>

1587
00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:30.660
<v Speaker 3>He's got a very specific sort of style and that style is like this.</v>

1588
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Like he's like he's got you and when you're moving in on him he's like angles</v>

1589
00:45:35.371 --> 00:45:36.330
<v Speaker 3>and shots.</v>

1590
00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:36.920
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1591
00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.580
<v Speaker 3>he's angles and counters.</v>

1592
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.900
<v Speaker 3>He'll catch you with that front,</v>

1593
00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:41.130
<v Speaker 3>right front leg side kick.</v>

1594
00:45:41.131 --> 00:45:44.640
<v Speaker 3>And then if you respond to it he'll go like he's going to do to it and then hit</v>

1595
00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 3>you in the face with a roundhouse kick instead.</v>

1596
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 3>He did that to Johnny Hendricks.</v>

1597
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.490
<v Speaker 3>He front leg side kicked him in the body and like hard indeed.</v>

1598
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.880
<v Speaker 3>You see Hendricks gets jarred just a little boom.</v>

1599
00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.500
<v Speaker 3>It was a jab,</v>

1600
00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:56.161
<v Speaker 3>it was a fucking,</v>

1601
00:45:56.161 --> 00:45:57.200
<v Speaker 3>he thrusted in there,</v>

1602
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:02.340
<v Speaker 3>a powerful front leg side kick and you see Hendrix try to move forward again,</v>

1603
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:03.900
<v Speaker 3>like to settle in again and boom,</v>

1604
00:46:03.901 --> 00:46:05.340
<v Speaker 3>he pops in with the same leg,</v>

1605
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:07.730
<v Speaker 3>hits him with the front leg round kick in the face.</v>

1606
00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:10.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1607
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.960
<v Speaker 3>it was like boosh and then there was like a little bit of a movement and then</v>

1608
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:13.381
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1609
00:46:13.381 --> 00:46:14.190
<v Speaker 3>the round kick him.</v>

1610
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.420
<v Speaker 3>See that you can find that.</v>

1611
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:16.800
<v Speaker 3>It was like a,</v>

1612
00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:18.120
<v Speaker 3>when Hendrix stopped,</v>

1613
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:18.991
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1614
00:46:18.991 --> 00:46:19.561
<v Speaker 3>or excuse me,</v>

1615
00:46:19.561 --> 00:46:20.850
<v Speaker 3>when I'm a,</v>

1616
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Wonderboy stopped Hendricks and he stomped him the first round,</v>

1617
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:25.470
<v Speaker 3>which was insane.</v>

1618
00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:26.101
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1619
00:46:26.101 --> 00:46:31.101
<v Speaker 3>you think that how fucking durable Hendricks is Hendrick's is an animal.</v>

1620
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.810
<v Speaker 3>You could stop that guy in the first round.</v>

1621
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:37.260
<v Speaker 3>That's something that's something incredibly impressive.</v>

1622
00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.331
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1623
00:46:39.331 --> 00:46:43.540
<v Speaker 3>You think of the Hendrix that went five fucking crazy rounds with Robbie Lawler,</v>

1624
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.690
<v Speaker 3>former Bachelorette.</v>

1625
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:48.520
<v Speaker 3>Fuck is that,</v>

1626
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:48.630
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1627
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:49.361
<v Speaker 3>it's a bachelorette.</v>

1628
00:46:49.361 --> 00:46:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to show what's going on here.</v>

1629
00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Former bachelor at Vancouver Canucks to take their hockey seriously up there.</v>

1630
00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:58.681
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

1631
00:46:58.681 --> 00:46:59.910
<v Speaker 3>They're allowed to punch each other.</v>

1632
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:00.990
<v Speaker 3>Their sport.</v>

1633
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:02.640
<v Speaker 3>They're allowed to beat the fuck out of each other.</v>

1634
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:04.613
<v Speaker 3>They just dropped it.</v>

1635
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.470
<v Speaker 3>They dropped their gloves and they go knuckle the knuckle.</v>

1636
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:11.670
<v Speaker 3>It's the only time you're allowed to go knuckle to knuckle with somebody on TV.</v>

1637
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.670
<v Speaker 3>You can't go knuckle to knuckle with anybody in the UFC fight.</v>

1638
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.110
<v Speaker 3>They make you take your gloves.</v>

1639
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.680
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1640
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.850
<v Speaker 3>you have your hand wraps,</v>

1641
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.810
<v Speaker 3>you put your gloves on,</v>

1642
00:47:18.811 --> 00:47:19.890
<v Speaker 3>you have to have gloves on.</v>

1643
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Did you know you don't have to have hand wraps.</v>

1644
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:25.020
<v Speaker 3>I want to see ultimate knockouts in hockey.</v>

1645
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.350
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be a highlight video here.</v>

1646
00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:31.240
<v Speaker 3>It is back up before this cause he does is before this.</v>

1647
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.823
<v Speaker 3>He catches him.</v>

1648
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:33.351
<v Speaker 3>I was this the,</v>

1649
00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:33.530
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1650
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:35.630
<v Speaker 3>the combination and ends the fight now.</v>

1651
00:47:35.631 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 3>It was it,</v>

1652
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry it was before earlier in the round.</v>

1653
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.090
<v Speaker 3>It was like when they were feeling each other out,</v>

1654
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.890
<v Speaker 3>like Thompson just starts putting it to him.</v>

1655
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Do that turn in psychic.</v>

1656
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.340
<v Speaker 3>He threw right there with five.</v>

1657
00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Jet Does is legit.</v>

1658
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:47.710
<v Speaker 3>He does everything perfect.</v>

1659
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.633
<v Speaker 3>Is He the best striker?</v>

1660
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.473
<v Speaker 3>Another may right now.</v>

1661
00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Michael Page is up there too.</v>

1662
00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:55.630
<v Speaker 3>I want to see Michael Page fight a higher caliber.</v>

1663
00:47:55.631 --> 00:47:56.081
<v Speaker 3>A fighter.</v>

1664
00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 3>But that guys,</v>

1665
00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:58.600
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>

1666
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.910
<v Speaker 3>he broke cyborgs head.</v>

1667
00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1668
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Cyborg evangelists.</v>

1669
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Sta who's a longtime veteran and a guy's been fighting forever.</v>

1670
00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.621
<v Speaker 3>Tough,</v>

1671
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:13.330
<v Speaker 3>tough guy and venom page broke his head with a flying knee.</v>

1672
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:14.830
<v Speaker 3>He's a high level striker.</v>

1673
00:48:14.831 --> 00:48:16.390
<v Speaker 3>We just don't know how high level,</v>

1674
00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:17.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1675
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:17.853
<v Speaker 3>I want to see him.</v>

1676
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:19.000
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1677
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.960
<v Speaker 3>as far as the UFC Wonderboy,</v>

1678
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:22.330
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the best for sure.</v>

1679
00:48:22.331 --> 00:48:23.220
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1680
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.220
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to say.</v>

1681
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Anybody is scarier right now than rumble.</v>

1682
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 3>Who's scary than Rumble Johnson?</v>

1683
00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>

1684
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:30.603
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>

1685
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:31.171
<v Speaker 3>Grumbled.</v>

1686
00:48:31.171 --> 00:48:32.080
<v Speaker 3>Johnson is like,</v>

1687
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:32.411
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1688
00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:33.160
<v Speaker 3>here it is.</v>

1689
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:33.700
<v Speaker 3>You got it.</v>

1690
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.533
<v Speaker 3>Jamie found it.</v>

1691
00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:36.281
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1692
00:48:36.281 --> 00:48:36.851
<v Speaker 3>back it up.</v>

1693
00:48:36.851 --> 00:48:38.530
<v Speaker 3>That's the same exact combination.</v>

1694
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:41.261
<v Speaker 3>But he did.</v>

1695
00:48:41.261 --> 00:48:42.970
<v Speaker 3>He land that turned inside kick right there.</v>

1696
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.601
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1697
00:48:43.601 --> 00:48:45.160
<v Speaker 3>he hit him like in the chest,</v>

1698
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.551
<v Speaker 3>but he was,</v>

1699
00:48:45.551 --> 00:48:46.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1700
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:46.750
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1701
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:47.471
<v Speaker 3>he's here.</v>

1702
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:47.711
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1703
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:50.920
<v Speaker 3>I think he catches him with some weird stuff coming in,</v>

1704
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:51.131
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1705
00:48:51.131 --> 00:48:52.120
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

1706
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Like they have this little combination.</v>

1707
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:58.000
<v Speaker 3>He throws that round cake out of nowhere too.</v>

1708
00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:59.830
<v Speaker 3>He's real good at the ending.</v>

1709
00:48:59.831 --> 00:49:02.830
<v Speaker 3>Those combinations with round cakes where people don't expect it.</v>

1710
00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 3>It comes in fast.</v>

1711
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:05.620
<v Speaker 3>See tags him there.</v>

1712
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.513
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

1713
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:07.960
<v Speaker 3>So I must've been before that.</v>

1714
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:10.503
<v Speaker 3>This is the follow up.</v>

1715
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:11.800
<v Speaker 3>This is the final combination.</v>

1716
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 3>What round did he stop him?</v>

1717
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Stop Him in the first.</v>

1718
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1719
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:15.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1720
00:49:15.311 --> 00:49:16.810
<v Speaker 3>We go watch the whole first round man.</v>

1721
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1722
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:17.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1723
00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Let's watch the whole first round.</v>

1724
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.780
<v Speaker 3>See if he could find it.</v>

1725
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:21.190
<v Speaker 3>He overwhelmed him.</v>

1726
00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:21.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1727
00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:22.750
<v Speaker 3>This is a how it sets up.</v>

1728
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:24.040
<v Speaker 3>Why is it all like weird?</v>

1729
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:25.180
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1730
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.710
<v Speaker 3>it's not supposed to be on youtube here to,</v>

1731
00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:31.750
<v Speaker 3>so like he also gets away with keeping his hands down like that.</v>

1732
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.171
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1733
00:49:32.171 --> 00:49:33.430
<v Speaker 3>He tried that shit right there,</v>

1734
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.140
<v Speaker 3>that jumping roundhouse kick.</v>

1735
00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:41.490
<v Speaker 3>He gets away with shit because of his distance and his understanding of like</v>

1736
00:49:41.921 --> 00:49:44.470
<v Speaker 3>space is so high level.</v>

1737
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:46.720
<v Speaker 3>He's understanding of like striking space.</v>

1738
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 3>So God damn good.</v>

1739
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.930
<v Speaker 3>And he was really smart.</v>

1740
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:53.800
<v Speaker 3>He went right to Chris Weidman would use like I got to learn how to wrestle.</v>

1741
00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to fucking become buddies with one of the toughest wrestlers and</v>

1742
00:49:57.131 --> 00:50:00.850
<v Speaker 3>MMA and I'm going to train like an animal with a guy who could beat my ass.</v>

1743
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.223
<v Speaker 3>That's the move.</v>

1744
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:02.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1745
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.753
<v Speaker 3>look what happened.</v>

1746
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:04.990
<v Speaker 3>He's the top contender.</v>

1747
00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:06.561
<v Speaker 3>We'll get a say what I,</v>

1748
00:50:06.561 --> 00:50:11.561
<v Speaker 3>what would you recommend till UFC fighter or like a new guy on the ultimate</v>

1749
00:50:11.681 --> 00:50:14.350
<v Speaker 3>fighter show when you got these young guys coming in,</v>

1750
00:50:14.351 --> 00:50:17.860
<v Speaker 3>would you ever recommend they take a taekwondo classes?</v>

1751
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad thing to do,</v>

1752
00:50:19.661 --> 00:50:24.520
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is if you're in the middle of learning how to fight,</v>

1753
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:27.160
<v Speaker 3>you might want to concentrate on,</v>

1754
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're going to compete,</v>

1755
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:32.930
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you might want to concentrate on those other aspects before you</v>

1756
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:33.860
<v Speaker 2>really attempt it.</v>

1757
00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.440
<v Speaker 2>You hope you might want to concentrate,</v>

1758
00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.970
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to talk to like a guy who was tragically training guys and is really</v>

1759
00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:45.110
<v Speaker 2>aware of how much resources you actually have as far as like how hard you can</v>

1760
00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:46.250
<v Speaker 2>train and stuff.</v>

1761
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:46.851
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1762
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:48.530
<v Speaker 2>because if you're training two or three times a day,</v>

1763
00:50:48.531 --> 00:50:49.640
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of these guys are,</v>

1764
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:50.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1765
00:50:50.331 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 2>you're probably already dedicated to like strength and conditioning,</v>

1766
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu class,</v>

1767
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:59.420
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing like maybe the style that Wonderboy has,</v>

1768
00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:01.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's a glimpse of the future.</v>

1769
00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody got to get on this eventually.</v>

1770
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.870
<v Speaker 2>So if you tell a guy who was just getting in to it,</v>

1771
00:51:05.871 --> 00:51:06.231
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1772
00:51:06.231 --> 00:51:09.470
<v Speaker 2>stick to the basic stick to Moitai or you could do that later.</v>

1773
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:10.760
<v Speaker 2>He won't get into it later.</v>

1774
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.001
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1775
00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:12.770
<v Speaker 2>you gotta do it like yesterday.</v>

1776
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.210
<v Speaker 2>You want to get right on it.</v>

1777
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 2>But here's the deal.</v>

1778
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.780
<v Speaker 2>When someone's not good at that stuff,</v>

1779
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:19.160
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to exploit.</v>

1780
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:20.413
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

1781
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 2>there's a learning curve where you have to go,</v>

1782
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.990
<v Speaker 2>you have to cross over a certain level of expertise.</v>

1783
00:51:26.991 --> 00:51:31.350
<v Speaker 2>We understand striking when you understand like what errors to make and like</v>

1784
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:33.200
<v Speaker 2>where to put momentum into things.</v>

1785
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.260
<v Speaker 2>And when you're learning like certain kinds of kicks,</v>

1786
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:37.970
<v Speaker 2>like they're awkward,</v>

1787
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.440
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're not that flexible.</v>

1788
00:51:39.441 --> 00:51:40.280
<v Speaker 2>You're not used to it.</v>

1789
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:41.330
<v Speaker 2>You haven't done it before.</v>

1790
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.950
<v Speaker 2>You tried it in an MMA fight,</v>

1791
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.090
<v Speaker 2>it could be a problem.</v>

1792
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.960
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a guy like Wonderboy,</v>

1793
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.170
<v Speaker 2>he's learned how to do it since he was a kid.</v>

1794
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean Wonderboy has been doing karate with his dad since he was a kid.</v>

1795
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1796
00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:53.690
<v Speaker 2>So like he's,</v>

1797
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.250
<v Speaker 2>he's a goddamn wizard.</v>

1798
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was,</v>

1799
00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:02.110
<v Speaker 2>he had some insane record of 50 something wins and kickboxing with no losses.</v>

1800
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:04.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1801
00:52:04.311 --> 00:52:07.470
<v Speaker 2>he used to fight on that Chuck Norris World Combat League.</v>

1802
00:52:07.471 --> 00:52:08.300
<v Speaker 2>You remember that?</v>

1803
00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Didn't we go to see him live once,</v>

1804
00:52:09.861 --> 00:52:10.161
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

1805
00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1806
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:10.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1807
00:52:10.781 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 2>We saw it was like Atlantic city or something.</v>

1808
00:52:12.861 --> 00:52:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember where it was.</v>

1809
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:14.833
<v Speaker 2>Where the hell was it?</v>

1810
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1811
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:17.300
<v Speaker 2>But we went to see it.</v>

1812
00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I hugged Chuck Norris for the first time.</v>

1813
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:20.270
<v Speaker 2>I've hugged him since,</v>

1814
00:52:20.271 --> 00:52:21.800
<v Speaker 2>but remember that,</v>

1815
00:52:21.801 --> 00:52:22.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1816
00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.720
<v Speaker 2>the greatest moments in my life,</v>

1817
00:52:23.721 --> 00:52:24.200
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1818
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.880
<v Speaker 2>it was a UFC fighter on that show.</v>

1819
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:27.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bullshitting either.</v>

1820
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Remember there was a UFC fighter on that show.</v>

1821
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:31.220
<v Speaker 2>A black guy who fought in the UFC.</v>

1822
00:52:31.221 --> 00:52:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Who did,</v>

1823
00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:32.960
<v Speaker 2>who did that Shell as well?</v>

1824
00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.370
<v Speaker 2>He's from Texas.</v>

1825
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:35.170
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name.</v>

1826
00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:36.003
<v Speaker 2>Damn it.</v>

1827
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1828
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:37.790
<v Speaker 2>he's a rapper too.</v>

1829
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.770
<v Speaker 2>He's a rapper.</v>

1830
00:52:39.771 --> 00:52:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Fought in the UFC.</v>

1831
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I think he got into rap after the UFC and then he followed that show.</v>

1832
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.891
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1833
00:52:45.891 --> 00:52:46.670
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name.</v>

1834
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Dammit.</v>

1835
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.050
<v Speaker 2>From Texas.</v>

1836
00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:48.943
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1837
00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.330
<v Speaker 2>See Jamie,</v>

1838
00:52:51.331 --> 00:52:52.164
<v Speaker 2>you'll find them.</v>

1839
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.023
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1840
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't give him moral combat league.</v>

1841
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:55.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1842
00:52:55.821 --> 00:52:56.654
<v Speaker 2>you fucked it up.</v>

1843
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.690
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it was his name.</v>

1844
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.370
<v Speaker 2>That world combat league was dope.</v>

1845
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.983
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed it.</v>

1846
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:04.303
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1847
00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:04.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1848
00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:05.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1849
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:07.740
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad idea to,</v>

1850
00:53:07.741 --> 00:53:08.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1851
00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:09.350
<v Speaker 2>have a,</v>

1852
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:10.340
<v Speaker 2>a surface,</v>

1853
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.800
<v Speaker 2>almost like a mini swimming pool type thing.</v>

1854
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:13.690
<v Speaker 2>The way they had it,</v>

1855
00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:15.230
<v Speaker 2>where there's an outside edge.</v>

1856
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:19.730
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with having a tournament based on just kicking,</v>

1857
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:20.241
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1858
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:21.650
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be just the best kickers.</v>

1859
00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:21.981
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1860
00:53:21.981 --> 00:53:23.390
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to really bring in striking.</v>

1861
00:53:23.391 --> 00:53:24.350
<v Speaker 2>You can't strike well,</v>

1862
00:53:24.351 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 2>you can kick anywhere you want or</v>

1863
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.960
<v Speaker 5>something like that or like whatever.</v>

1864
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:28.561
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1865
00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:29.394
<v Speaker 5>Like soccer,</v>

1866
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:31.370
<v Speaker 5>something just to spend it with Tyco.</v>

1867
00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like of wrestling is just one tiny aspect of MMA.</v>

1868
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:36.570
<v Speaker 5>The take down in the,</v>

1869
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 5>you know the base.</v>

1870
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:38.461
<v Speaker 5>It's not tiny.</v>

1871
00:53:38.461 --> 00:53:39.450
<v Speaker 5>Let me rephrase that.</v>

1872
00:53:39.451 --> 00:53:40.760
<v Speaker 5>It's a big part of that in the May,</v>

1873
00:53:40.761 --> 00:53:42.960
<v Speaker 5>but it's just one of the big three,</v>

1874
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.840
<v Speaker 5>the big three being striking,</v>

1875
00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 5>a wrestling and Jujitsu.</v>

1876
00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:52.230
<v Speaker 5>But then there's also samba with Jujitsu and ins takedowns there's judo with</v>

1877
00:53:52.231 --> 00:53:54.570
<v Speaker 5>wrestling and then in striking there's Moyie,</v>

1878
00:53:54.571 --> 00:53:56.130
<v Speaker 5>Thai boxing,</v>

1879
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.690
<v Speaker 5>traditional martial arts,</v>

1880
00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.141
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1881
00:53:58.141 --> 00:53:59.940
<v Speaker 5>but it's generally the big three.</v>

1882
00:53:59.941 --> 00:54:01.470
<v Speaker 5>And then there's like sisters and shit.</v>

1883
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.400
<v Speaker 3>But here's my thoughts on the taekwondo and Moy Tai thing.</v>

1884
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.031
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1885
00:54:06.031 --> 00:54:08.790
<v Speaker 3>you cannot get taekwondo off.</v>

1886
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.090
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to work if you don't know Moitai.</v>

1887
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:12.000
<v Speaker 3>That's what I believe.</v>

1888
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I believe that most Moitai cancels taekwondo and this is from me doing taekwondo</v>

1889
00:54:18.901 --> 00:54:23.550
<v Speaker 3>most of my younger life and then doing Muay Thai and then seeing like the holes</v>

1890
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:24.384
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

1891
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:25.560
<v Speaker 3>Like if you don't know it,</v>

1892
00:54:25.561 --> 00:54:27.030
<v Speaker 3>like if you ever watched like a taekwondo guy,</v>

1893
00:54:27.031 --> 00:54:28.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a few of them online.</v>

1894
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:29.940
<v Speaker 3>What were no guys fight Muay Thai guys took,</v>

1895
00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:30.960
<v Speaker 3>it will get lit up.</v>

1896
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:36.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's like a Molly tie his leg locks and boxing is a Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

1897
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 5>Boxing is very important and an inanimate very important,</v>

1898
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:44.100
<v Speaker 5>but if you don't know [inaudible],</v>

1899
00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.180
<v Speaker 5>you don't know how to check kicks,</v>

1900
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.440
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get exposed.</v>

1901
00:54:46.441 --> 00:54:47.290
<v Speaker 5>They're going to kick your leg.</v>

1902
00:54:47.291 --> 00:54:51.030
<v Speaker 5>Same thing if you know Bjj and you don't know leg locks,</v>

1903
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:53.400
<v Speaker 5>I see it all the time.</v>

1904
00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:53.910
<v Speaker 5>If you're going,</v>

1905
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:57.960
<v Speaker 5>if you're a traditional Brazilian Jujitsu guy who didn't get heavy on leg locks</v>

1906
00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:00.270
<v Speaker 5>and you go against a guy who's heavy on leg lots,</v>

1907
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 5>you could take a guy that's been doing leg locks for one year,</v>

1908
00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.020
<v Speaker 5>maybe two years,</v>

1909
00:55:04.021 --> 00:55:05.590
<v Speaker 5>and he just focuses on leg locks.</v>

1910
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:07.950
<v Speaker 5>He see when you're really good at leg locks,</v>

1911
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:09.510
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to pass the guard.</v>

1912
00:55:09.511 --> 00:55:12.660
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to sweep ever with pro tradition,</v>

1913
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:13.590
<v Speaker 5>traditional Jujitsu,</v>

1914
00:55:13.591 --> 00:55:15.270
<v Speaker 5>just straight chokes and armbars.</v>

1915
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:16.710
<v Speaker 5>You have to pass the guy.</v>

1916
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:17.970
<v Speaker 5>That goddamn guard.</v>

1917
00:55:17.971 --> 00:55:22.380
<v Speaker 5>Generally if you're on top to get any close to any submissions or you've got to</v>

1918
00:55:22.381 --> 00:55:23.100
<v Speaker 5>sweep,</v>

1919
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.150
<v Speaker 5>but we'd leg locks.</v>

1920
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.830
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to do shit.</v>

1921
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:26.341
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1922
00:55:26.341 --> 00:55:26.471
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1923
00:55:26.471 --> 00:55:29.580
<v Speaker 5>you can go right into leg locks from anywhere.</v>

1924
00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:30.511
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1925
00:55:30.511 --> 00:55:32.400
<v Speaker 5>That's the beautiful thing about leg locks.</v>

1926
00:55:32.401 --> 00:55:37.401
<v Speaker 5>When you add that to Jujitsu combined sambo catch wrestling and Brazilian</v>

1927
00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:39.210
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu,</v>

1928
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:39.840
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>

1929
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.340
<v Speaker 5>That right there is huge.</v>

1930
00:55:41.341 --> 00:55:43.530
<v Speaker 5>It's just like combining Moyie Thai and boxing.</v>

1931
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:45.300
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking huge.</v>

1932
00:55:45.301 --> 00:55:46.650
<v Speaker 5>Combining Muay Thai and boxing.</v>

1933
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.570
<v Speaker 5>Boxing by itself an MMA,</v>

1934
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.250
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get your legs kicked.</v>

1935
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.010
<v Speaker 5>Well</v>

1936
00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:51.610
<v Speaker 3>he does.</v>

1937
00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that it is important,</v>

1938
00:55:53.591 --> 00:55:55.660
<v Speaker 3>like if you were trying to develop a perfect fighter,</v>

1939
00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:59.440
<v Speaker 3>do you think that it's important to start out with one discipline and get really</v>

1940
00:55:59.441 --> 00:56:00.011
<v Speaker 3>good at it?</v>

1941
00:56:00.011 --> 00:56:05.011
<v Speaker 3>Like Damien Maia or do you think you should be a guy or a gal who learns</v>

1942
00:56:05.351 --> 00:56:06.170
<v Speaker 3>everything</v>

1943
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:07.010
<v Speaker 5>from scratch?</v>

1944
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:07.790
<v Speaker 5>Like it all depends.</v>

1945
00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:09.320
<v Speaker 5>When you start and what your,</v>

1946
00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.340
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1947
00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:13.580
<v Speaker 5>is your goal to becoming UFC champion?</v>

1948
00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:14.570
<v Speaker 3>You want to be the name.</v>

1949
00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:17.410
<v Speaker 3>How old is van Zandt and how old are you?</v>

1950
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

1951
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:19.691
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question,</v>

1952
00:56:19.691 --> 00:56:19.961
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1953
00:56:19.961 --> 00:56:21.040
<v Speaker 3>There's no one answer,</v>

1954
00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:21.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1955
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:22.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1956
00:56:22.181 --> 00:56:22.420
<v Speaker 3>If there,</v>

1957
00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:23.253
<v Speaker 3>if someone's,</v>

1958
00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 3>it's a big difference</v>

1959
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.390
<v Speaker 5>between that and you're a kid.</v>

1960
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 5>I would say we've talked to this,</v>

1961
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:29.650
<v Speaker 5>we've talked about this before.</v>

1962
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:32.710
<v Speaker 5>I would say get into break dancing and wrestling.</v>

1963
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.610
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:34.443

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:36.581
<v Speaker 5>break dance,</v>

1967
00:56:36.581 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 5>can rest and get into that heart and do Jujitsu on Sundays or whatever,</v>

1968

1973
00:56:48.731 --> 00:56:52.930

1974
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.310

<v Speaker 5>it's flexibility.</v>

2013
00:57:47.661 --> 00:57:48.610
<v Speaker 5>Anything you can put,</v>

2014
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.930
<v Speaker 5>there's Graham bees in it,</v>

2015
00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:51.300
<v Speaker 5>there's rubber guard in it.</v>

2016
00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.020
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of shit.</v>

2017
00:57:53.021 --> 00:57:54.850
<v Speaker 5>Breakdancing is endless,</v>

2018
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:58.030
<v Speaker 5>so it just makes sense on paper.</v>

2019
00:57:58.031 --> 00:58:02.200
<v Speaker 5>It makes sense that that would be the best thing to get your kids into a few,</v>

2020
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:02.861
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2021
00:58:02.861 --> 00:58:03.100
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2022
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:08.100
<v Speaker 5>to develop the ultimate base balance core strength that will translate into</v>

2023
00:58:11.051 --> 00:58:11.560
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

2024
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.080
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it over and over again with,</v>

2025
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:14.890
<v Speaker 5>with GL and Boogie and all his guys.</v>

2026
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.113
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2027
00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.700
<v Speaker 5>we got to shut off the break dancers.</v>

2028
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:18.130
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

2029
00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:18.590
<v Speaker 5>It's for,</v>

2030
00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:19.091
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

2031
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:20.400
<v Speaker 5>It's a good base for Jujitsu.</v>

2032
00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.393
<v Speaker 5>I got another time.</v>

2033
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.840
<v Speaker 5>The question becomes though,</v>

2034
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:23.703
<v Speaker 5>like what?</v>

2035
00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:26.440
<v Speaker 5>How much emphasis should be put on striking?</v>

2036
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:27.910
<v Speaker 5>If you're developing a guy,</v>

2037
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:29.860
<v Speaker 5>you're going to take it from the beginning.</v>

2038
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.000
<v Speaker 5>I would say,</v>

2039
00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2040
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:32.981
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of time,</v>

2041
00:58:32.981 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 5>I would say focus on the wrestling and the breakdancing,</v>

2042
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:39.370
<v Speaker 5>Anglo striking here on the side.</v>

2043
00:58:39.371 --> 00:58:40.360
<v Speaker 5>Just get 'em moving.</v>

2044
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:42.280
<v Speaker 5>Maybe taekwondo on Saturday,</v>

2045
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.233

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:50.500
<v Speaker 5>wrestling during the day,</v>

2053
00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:50.920

00:59:02.141 --> 00:59:02.471
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

00:59:02.471 --> 00:59:02.741
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2064
00:59:02.741 --> 00:59:04.270
<v Speaker 5>the only thing that I would wonder about,</v>

2065
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:07.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you run into a guy like Wonderboy,</v>

2066
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.450
<v Speaker 5>I'd wonder about it.</v>

2067
00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:09.693
<v Speaker 5>Get it.</v>

2068
00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:11.990
<v Speaker 5>When you look at a guy like wonder,</v>

2069
00:59:11.991 --> 00:59:12.370
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

2070
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.660
<v Speaker 5>if you can't take that guy down,</v>

2071
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:14.650
<v Speaker 5>you're kind of fucked.</v>

2072
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:16.480
<v Speaker 5>Unless you're a better striker,</v>

2073
00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:17.950
<v Speaker 5>unless you're to wind off.</v>

2074
00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:18.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2131
01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.510
<v Speaker 5>He's a perfect example.</v>

2132
01:00:55.511 --> 01:00:55.980
<v Speaker 5>Example</v>

<v Speaker 3>He goes down to in the background,</v>

2150
01:01:25.921 --> 01:01:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Ari should fear it goes like this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you see Ari Freak out background.</v>

2158
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Did someone make a special video on zoom in on him and shit and make a meme out</v>

2159
01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:41.670
<v Speaker 3>of it?</v>

2160
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:42.121
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2161
01:01:42.121 --> 01:01:43.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure someone asked someone.</v>

2162
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Someone's definitely,</v>

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:50.400
<v Speaker 3>like the way he throws it is perfect.</v>

2168

<v Speaker 3>Everything he does is perfect.</v>

2169
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.870
<v Speaker 3>His switch kick is the best switch kick I've ever seen in my life.</v>

2170
01:01:54.871 --> 01:01:56.520
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anybody throw a better switch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

2200
01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>UFC history in MMA history.</v>

2201
01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2202
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>and we're looking at Ra,</v>

2203
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>we're focusing like scientifically,</v>

2204
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.030
<v Speaker 1>forensically an Ari.</v>

2205
01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:42.243
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

2206
01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2207
01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.960

2208
01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>like his zero holes in his technique.</v>

2209
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:48.833
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

2210
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:52.380
<v Speaker 1>He's the one of the best kickers I've ever seen because he does everything he</v>

2211
01:02:52.381 --> 01:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>does the traditional kicks.</v>

2212
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>He does like a lot of,</v>

2213
01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Moyie Thai techniques.</v>

2214
01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 1>He's the first guy to ever stopped to opponents with leg kicks.</v>

2215
01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Hot Phala Olivera and um,</v>

01:03:09.141 --> 01:03:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was in danger for a little bit.</v>

2221
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:11.251
<v Speaker 1>That was legit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Conor is going to have $700 billion.</v>

2240
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.330
<v Speaker 1>When he retires,</v>

2241
01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:48.550
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be richer than that guy.</v>

2242
01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

2243
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.880
<v Speaker 1>When he found,</v>

2244

<v Speaker 1>What is that going to happen?</v>

2247
01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:59.280

2253
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:06.500
<v Speaker 1>He needs to get that.</v>

2254
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Look at this child Olvera closing in on pedes.</v>

2255
01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:11.280
<v Speaker 1>We're watching the Charles all Avera Anthony Pettis fight.</v>

2256
01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking forward to for awhile.</v>

2257
01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.940
<v Speaker 1>All Avara moved it on pedes.</v>

2258
01:04:14.941 --> 01:04:16.320
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to take him to the ground.</v>

2259
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.790
<v Speaker 1>He's wrestled fucking him.</v>

2260
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:19.770
<v Speaker 1>One strike that.</v>

2261
01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Do a lot of guys have done,</v>

2262
01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.250
<v Speaker 1>he's got all that taekwondo shall we were talking about.</v>

2263
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2264
01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.181
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2265
01:04:24.181 --> 01:04:26.460
<v Speaker 1>But Holly Vera's pretty fucking good on his feet too.</v>

2266
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2267
01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in this because I was wondering how Oliveira would approach this</v>

2268
01:04:31.261 --> 01:04:31.650
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2269
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:31.881
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

2270
01:04:31.881 --> 01:04:32.701
<v Speaker 1>his technique,</v>

2271
01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:34.110
<v Speaker 1>his stand up is very good man.</v>

2272
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:34.770
<v Speaker 1>There's approaches.</v>

2273
01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking this guy down.</v>

2274
01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>That's it seems like fuck that striking shit is good defense by Pedis though.</v>

2275
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Good take down defense so far.</v>

2276
01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:45.660
<v Speaker 1>All it varies.</v>

2277
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.860
<v Speaker 1>A good grappler man.</v>

2278
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>He submitted guys with a bunch of different shit too.</v>

2279
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.390

2286

<v Speaker 1>Maybe somebody out there can correct me.</v>

2292
01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:11.820

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:46.910

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:47.511
<v Speaker 5>if your pet is,</v>

01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 5>don't you let him stand up here.</v>

2436
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.850
<v Speaker 5>Don't you let them stand up here.</v>

2437
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:54.950
<v Speaker 5>I think a part of you says that there's no way he could knock me out here.</v>

01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:58.350
<v Speaker 5>So kind of see of the round and if they,</v>

01:09:01.221 --> 01:09:02.690
<v Speaker 5>why doesn't he let him up to fuck him up?</v>

2443
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:04.580
<v Speaker 5>And that's usually the best advice.</v>

2444
01:09:04.581 --> 01:09:05.540
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

2445
01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:06.603
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2446
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.590
<v Speaker 5>assume that they're thinking,</v>

2447
01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:09.981
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2448
01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:10.701
<v Speaker 5>if I let him up,</v>

2449
01:09:10.701 --> 01:09:11.534
<v Speaker 5>I'm beating him up.</v>

2450
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:13.580
<v Speaker 5>He still can throw,</v>

2451
01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.061
<v Speaker 5>he may be,</v>

2452
01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:16.570
<v Speaker 5>he recovers and he throws a big fucking shot or knocks me out.</v>

2453
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.433
<v Speaker 5>That happens a lot.</v>

2454
01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:21.760
<v Speaker 5>So there's no way he can knock me out on his back except for that upkick Weiland</v>

2455
01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:22.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm just stay right here.</v>

2456
01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.313
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2457
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.790
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what they're thinking.</v>

2458
01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:28.370
<v Speaker 5>But it could be also,</v>

2459
01:09:28.371 --> 01:09:30.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was a hard fought first round.</v>

2460
01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.430
<v Speaker 5>You let a guy stand up,</v>

2461
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:33.383
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

2462
01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:35.660
<v Speaker 5>he's got four limbs where he can knock you out,</v>

2463
01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.100
<v Speaker 5>you would keep him on his back.</v>

2464
01:09:37.101 --> 01:09:40.210
<v Speaker 5>You just got to watch that up kick and that shit's so low percentage.</v>

2465
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:41.870
<v Speaker 5>That's happened three times in history.</v>

2466
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:42.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2467
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:46.610
<v Speaker 5>And he also knows that it's probably the end of the round has happened a few</v>

2468
01:09:46.611 --> 01:09:47.360
<v Speaker 5>times in the UFC.</v>

2469
01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.890
<v Speaker 5>What's the greatest upkick ever?</v>

2470
01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:54.010
<v Speaker 5>I say Henzel Gracie versus Ole Tech Tar off and then there's a Marilla</v>

2471
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:55.460
<v Speaker 5>Bustamante on Jerry Bolander.</v>

2472
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:55.671
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2473
01:09:55.671 --> 01:09:56.241
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

2474
01:09:56.241 --> 01:09:56.601
<v Speaker 5>I remember that.</v>

2475
01:09:56.601 --> 01:09:59.030
<v Speaker 5>Which one was first or was that fabulous?</v>

2476
01:09:59.031 --> 01:10:00.200
<v Speaker 5>Your Gel on boat?</v>

2477
01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:00.321
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2478
01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:00.441
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2479
01:10:00.441 --> 01:10:01.070
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't Fabio.</v>

2480
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:02.490
<v Speaker 5>It was Morella booster McGuinness.</v>

2481
01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.590
<v Speaker 5>Boom Pedis with the body kick Oliver in deep shit.</v>

2482
01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:11.860
<v Speaker 5>Can you find Marillo Bustamante Jerry Boland who go up kick around.</v>

2483
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.100
<v Speaker 5>That would be awesome.</v>

2484
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.491
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

2485
01:10:13.491 --> 01:10:14.301
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean to be like,</v>

2486
01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:14.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2487
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 5>I like I own the show or anything like that,</v>

2488
01:10:16.461 --> 01:10:17.870
<v Speaker 5>so if I stepped over my bounds,</v>

2489
01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:19.970
<v Speaker 5>no worries to Joe because he's got my back.</v>

2490
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:20.300
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>

2491
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:20.600
<v Speaker 5>On the,</v>

2492
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.220
<v Speaker 5>unlike all the various technique,</v>

2493
01:10:22.221 --> 01:10:22.680
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2494
01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.250
<v Speaker 5>So he looks so smooth like that front kick to the body,</v>

2495
01:10:25.251 --> 01:10:26.084
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2496
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Olvera it looks very smooth on the feet,</v>

2497
01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:29.030
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2498
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.990
<v Speaker 5>Very smooth.</v>

2499
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:30.890
<v Speaker 5>Good rhythm.</v>

2500
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:32.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeti was trying to take him down right away.</v>

2501
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:32.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2502
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 5>Well I think he wants to just show them.</v>

2503
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:35.720
<v Speaker 5>You can beat him both ways.</v>

2504
01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:37.280
<v Speaker 5>It's taking them down again,</v>

2505
01:10:37.281 --> 01:10:38.114
<v Speaker 5>look at this,</v>

2506
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.080
<v Speaker 5>spins around,</v>

2507
01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.160
<v Speaker 5>gets the back.</v>

2508
01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 5>God Damn Petty.</v>

2509
01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.110
<v Speaker 5>No joke on course.</v>

2510
01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.673
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

2511
01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.940
<v Speaker 5>And he's going to let him out.</v>

2512
01:10:46.941 --> 01:10:47.850
<v Speaker 5>Now he's going to let him,</v>

2513
01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.860
<v Speaker 5>I was going to let him stand out.</v>

2514
01:10:48.861 --> 01:10:51.740
<v Speaker 5>He told me his timeline coaching in the corner.</v>

2515
01:10:51.741 --> 01:10:52.640
<v Speaker 5>They were probably saying,</v>

2516
01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.150
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2517
01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:54.890
<v Speaker 5>you going to fuck this guy up at that left kick?</v>

2518
01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.870
<v Speaker 5>Look at Bolunda right there.</v>

2519
01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:57.501
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2520
01:10:57.501 --> 01:10:58.220
<v Speaker 5>head kick.</v>

2521
01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:58.641
<v Speaker 5>Look at Dad.</v>

2522
01:10:58.641 --> 01:10:59.380
<v Speaker 5>He went over the top.</v>

2523
01:10:59.380 --> 01:10:59.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2524
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>

2525
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:01.123
<v Speaker 5>That's it</v>

2526
01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:03.800
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

2527
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2528
01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.930
<v Speaker 5>Olivera with a right hand.</v>

2529
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:08.900
<v Speaker 5>All the Avera has got a bad swelling on the left eye.</v>

2530
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.171
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2531
01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:10.430
<v Speaker 5>and he just got tagged there too,</v>

2532
01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:11.413
<v Speaker 5>probably from some of that.</v>

2533
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.811
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2534
01:11:11.811 --> 01:11:14.130

2535
01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.240
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2536
01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:16.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2537
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:17.380
<v Speaker 5>he's going to let him up.</v>

2538
01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.970
<v Speaker 5>I think all of our struggling,</v>

2539
01:11:18.971 --> 01:11:19.360
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2540
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.100
<v Speaker 5>he can't see very good out of that iron man.</v>

2541
01:11:21.101 --> 01:11:23.620
<v Speaker 5>He's really badly swollen up and when it,</v>

2542
01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.480
<v Speaker 5>when it starts swelling up that quick,</v>

2543
01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.520
<v Speaker 5>you gotta wonder like how bad that injury is,</v>

2544
01:11:27.521 --> 01:11:28.181
<v Speaker 5>how bad it is.</v>

2545
01:11:28.181 --> 01:11:29.230
<v Speaker 5>Man keeps coming forward.</v>

2546

2554
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:43.170
<v Speaker 5>I liked the way all of Eric Leeds with that front kick to that Chow.</v>

2555
01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.310
<v Speaker 5>He throws a lot of that left leg front kick.</v>

2556
01:11:45.311 --> 01:11:46.144
<v Speaker 5>It's nice.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's like countering beautifully.</v>

2576
01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:13.960
<v Speaker 5>He's taken a lot of shit,</v>

2577
01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:17.080
<v Speaker 5>but you know he's landing a lot of rights.</v>

2578

<v Speaker 5>He does a lot of real good tactics right hand.</v>

2588
01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:35.341
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2589
01:12:35.341 --> 01:12:36.174

2598
01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:52.650

<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

2604
01:12:59.100 --> 01:12:59.610
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

2605
01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:02.460
<v Speaker 5>this is why you need to be razor sharp on the back right here.</v>

2606
01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:04.200

2614
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:18.150
<v Speaker 5>You gotta be really good on the back.</v>

2615
01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.320
<v Speaker 5>You got the back.</v>

2616
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:21.240
<v Speaker 5>You should take advantage of it.</v>

2617
01:13:21.241 --> 01:13:22.080
<v Speaker 5>What else do you need?</v>

2618
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:23.040
<v Speaker 5>You've got the back,</v>

2619
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:23.941
<v Speaker 5>both leg hooks.</v>

2620
01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:24.980
<v Speaker 5>You've gotta add fucking low.</v>

2621
01:13:24.981 --> 01:13:26.190
<v Speaker 5>Look at body triangle.</v>

2622
01:13:26.191 --> 01:13:27.090
<v Speaker 5>What else do you mean?</v>

2623
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.250
<v Speaker 5>Is there something in capable?</v>

2624
01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:29.220
<v Speaker 5>What should he be doing here?</v>

2625
01:13:29.221 --> 01:13:29.790
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

2626
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:30.301
<v Speaker 5>he should,</v>

2627
01:13:30.301 --> 01:13:30.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2628
01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.493
<v Speaker 5>elder people.</v>

2629
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:32.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2630
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:32.731
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

2631
01:13:32.731 --> 01:13:34.220
<v Speaker 5>there's a risk.</v>

2632
01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:39.210
<v Speaker 5>There's a hand fight and it's just the catered and complicated and you got to</v>

2633
01:13:39.211 --> 01:13:39.550
<v Speaker 5>win.</v>

2634
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:40.890
<v Speaker 5>There's a battle going on.</v>

2635
01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:44.040
<v Speaker 5>Anthony Pettis is used in both his hands to defend his neck.</v>

2636
01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:45.323
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2637
01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.700
<v Speaker 5>and he's got good angle at that defense too.</v>

2638
01:13:47.701 --> 01:13:52.320
<v Speaker 5>So it's really difficult because even though Anthony Pettis has his back taken</v>

2639
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.420
<v Speaker 5>the way he would defend that choke,</v>

2640
01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:54.890
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2641
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:56.310
<v Speaker 5>it's like doing a pull up like this.</v>

2642
01:13:56.311 --> 01:13:57.330
<v Speaker 5>Very strong.</v>

2643
01:13:57.331 --> 01:13:57.990
<v Speaker 5>It's very,</v>

2644
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:59.590
<v Speaker 5>it becomes very sophisticated.</v>

2645
01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

2646
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:01.650
<v Speaker 5>he's broken through.</v>

2647
01:14:01.651 --> 01:14:02.520
<v Speaker 5>He's on top now.</v>

2648
01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.450
<v Speaker 5>A lot of grease,</v>

2649
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.681
<v Speaker 5>a lot of grease.</v>

2650
01:14:04.681 --> 01:14:05.461
<v Speaker 5>You got to keep that,</v>

2651
01:14:05.461 --> 01:14:06.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2652
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.410
<v Speaker 5>that the body lock triangle on as as much as you can when there's too much</v>

2653
01:14:10.411 --> 01:14:11.244
<v Speaker 5>grease.</v>

2654
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:14.800
<v Speaker 1>And by Greece I mean sweat.</v>

2655

01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean Brevile accuses people of greasing.</v>

2657
01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:19.281

2682
01:14:58.430 --> 01:15:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Traditional taekwondo style techniques.</v>

2683
01:15:01.431 --> 01:15:02.264

<v Speaker 1>Pedis taking some big deep breaths.</v>

2688
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:13.240
<v Speaker 1>It's what is called a video training.</v>

2689
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:15.410
<v Speaker 1>That's his jam.</v>

2690
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Gold.</v>

2691
01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:17.091
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2692
01:15:17.091 --> 01:15:18.460
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>

2693
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.730
<v Speaker 1>that's not the video that I saw.</v>

2694
01:15:19.731 --> 01:15:20.241
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

2695
01:15:20.241 --> 01:15:21.650
<v Speaker 1>in preparation for this fight,</v>

2696
01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:22.970
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not quite sure,</v>

2697
01:15:22.971 --> 01:15:24.740
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it is,</v>

2698
01:15:24.741 --> 01:15:26.420
<v Speaker 1>he's super well trained.</v>

2699
01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.254
<v Speaker 1>We should find out what,</v>

2700
01:15:27.570 --> 01:15:29.000
<v Speaker 1>what does a camp is?</v>

2701
01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Just give him a shout out.</v>

2702
01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.180
<v Speaker 1>If that was three girls rain,</v>

2703
01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:34.970
<v Speaker 1>if there was three rules are two or whatever you can think of.</v>

2704
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>You can make the change right now.</v>

2705
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Not The scoring system.</v>

2706
01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Just rules in the game.</v>

2707
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:43.430
<v Speaker 1>What would they be if you had all the power of this head,</v>

2708
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:47.090
<v Speaker 1>the commissioner of the Nevada State Athletic Commission came to you and said,</v>

2709
01:15:47.091 --> 01:15:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2710
01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:48.501
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want,</v>

2711
01:15:48.501 --> 01:15:49.490
<v Speaker 1>let's fix this sport.</v>

2712
01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:52.070
<v Speaker 1>What are the three major things you think we trust you?</v>

2713
01:15:52.071 --> 01:15:53.120
<v Speaker 1>You're so knowledgeable.</v>

2714
01:15:53.121 --> 01:15:53.811
<v Speaker 1>You fucking her.</v>

2715
01:15:53.811 --> 01:15:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Amazing man.</v>

2716
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2717
01:15:54.981 --> 01:15:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of getting blown here.</v>

2718
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:58.581
<v Speaker 1>Said no guy,</v>

2719
01:15:58.581 --> 01:15:59.060
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

2720
01:15:59.060 --> 01:15:59.893
<v Speaker 1>no guy over.</v>

2721
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:01.123
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2722
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:02.300
<v Speaker 1>what would I tell them to do?</v>

2723
01:16:02.301 --> 01:16:02.691
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2724
01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it needs to be fixed.</v>

2725
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I think we could all,</v>

2726
01:16:05.211 --> 01:16:05.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2727
01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I think the best way.</v>

2728
01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2729
01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:13.100
<v Speaker 1>the best way to find out what the best rule changes would be is to talk to all</v>

2730
01:16:15.051 --> 01:16:15.890
<v Speaker 1>the experts,</v>

2731
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:18.860
<v Speaker 1>talk to all the most respected trainers,</v>

2733
01:16:24.441 --> 01:16:29.441
<v Speaker 1>Talk to them and then talk to a former fighters that are really smart guys like</v>

2734
01:16:30.831 --> 01:16:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Brian Stan talk to guys like Dominick Cruz talked to guys who are added right</v>

2735
01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:35.931
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2736
01:16:35.931 --> 01:16:40.190
<v Speaker 1>like John Jones who were in their prime talk to everybody could talk to George</v>

2737
01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Saint Pierre and then get sort of an understanding of what everybody would like</v>

2738
01:16:43.971 --> 01:16:47.960
<v Speaker 1>to see change to what they think would be changed if they had their way.</v>

2739
01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably the best way to do it,</v>

2740
01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:54.090
<v Speaker 1>to do it as a a community because I think a,</v>

2741
01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.660
<v Speaker 1>there's not going to be a total agreement on things,</v>

2742
01:16:56.930 --> 01:17:01.930
<v Speaker 1>but I think we can come to like some reasonable reasonable agreements if we all</v>

2743
01:17:01.971 --> 01:17:06.971
<v Speaker 1>just sat down and explored what would be the best options for rules for safety</v>

2744
01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:08.330
<v Speaker 1>lead.</v>

2745
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:09.163
<v Speaker 1>Throw it up at our,</v>

2746
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:13.243
<v Speaker 3>that was slick.</v>

2747
01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:13.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2748
01:17:13.681 --> 01:17:14.700
<v Speaker 2>he just snapped on it.</v>

2749
01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>

2750
01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if he could pull it off.</v>

2751
01:17:16.570 --> 01:17:20.820
<v Speaker 2>But I'm talking about in a fast and in a fantasy world,</v>

2752
01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:21.750
<v Speaker 2>in a fantasy world,</v>

2753
01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I know you're talking about,</v>

2754
01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:24.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like the movement in the fantasy world.</v>

2755
01:17:24.031 --> 01:17:24.864
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would do.</v>

2756
01:17:25.770 --> 01:17:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2757
01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:26.731
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

2758
01:17:26.731 --> 01:17:26.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2759
01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:27.541
<v Speaker 2>I would definitely,</v>

2760
01:17:27.541 --> 01:17:28.560
<v Speaker 2>if it was up to me,</v>

2761
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:29.281
<v Speaker 2>that's what I would do.</v>

2762
01:17:29.281 --> 01:17:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I would put it up to,</v>

2763
01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.680
<v Speaker 2>and what would you be included?</v>

2764
01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Would you be included in that group of people?</v>

2765
01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:34.261
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2766
01:17:34.261 --> 01:17:34.980
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2767
01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:35.760
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

2768
01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.480
<v Speaker 2>everyone would have to vote on their top three and you put it all together and</v>

2769
01:17:39.481 --> 01:17:40.410
<v Speaker 2>then from there you decide,</v>

2770
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:41.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2771
01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.300
<v Speaker 2>pat is on top again.</v>

2772
01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Tim is a great fight.</v>

2773
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:44.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2774
01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.390
<v Speaker 2>I would think number one,</v>

2775
01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:47.130
<v Speaker 2>much more comprehensive rule system.</v>

2776
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out,</v>

2777
01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:48.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2778
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:49.291
<v Speaker 2>what's fine out.</v>

2779
01:17:49.291 --> 01:17:50.640
<v Speaker 2>What rules make sense,</v>

2780
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.850
<v Speaker 2>what rules are like the 12 to six elbow that's gone,</v>

2781
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:54.390
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2782
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:56.730
<v Speaker 2>that makes it illegal.</v>

2783
01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.280
<v Speaker 2>It's really from the mountain only word that comes into play,</v>

2784
01:17:59.281 --> 01:17:59.381
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2785
01:17:59.381 --> 01:18:00.390
<v Speaker 2>It's totally,</v>

2786
01:18:00.391 --> 01:18:01.530
<v Speaker 2>it's a legit technique.</v>

2787
01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:05.400
<v Speaker 2>And then I think you and I had a point and I think it should be discussed.</v>

2788
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you elbow someone in the back of the head when you can kick him in the</v>

2789
01:18:08.671 --> 01:18:12.310
<v Speaker 2>back of the head when you can you in transitions guys get kicked.</v>

2790
01:18:12.311 --> 01:18:12.780
<v Speaker 2>We this.</v>

2791
01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

2792
01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

2793
01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2794
01:18:18.631 --> 01:18:19.710
<v Speaker 2>and he's not a black belt.</v>

2795
01:18:19.711 --> 01:18:20.740
<v Speaker 2>He's getting it tomorrow morning.</v>

2796
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

2797
01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.320
<v Speaker 2>He caught him with a fucking good teen and tapped him shit.</v>

2798
01:18:25.321 --> 01:18:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Guillotine Woo entity.</v>

2799
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:30.480
<v Speaker 2>It's got some finishing power on the ground,</v>

2800
01:18:30.481 --> 01:18:31.260
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2801
01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.093
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

2802
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:33.240
<v Speaker 3>that's fantastic.</v>

2803
01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Look at that beautiful display right there to went over and hugged him.</v>

2804
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Olivera kissed him on the cheek.</v>

2805
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:38.910
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>

2806
01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:41.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why that's touching to me for real.</v>

2807
01:18:41.851 --> 01:18:42.630
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2808
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:42.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2809
01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.850
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a bullshit thing to say.</v>

2810
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:45.271
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2811
01:18:45.271 --> 01:18:45.510
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2812
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.870
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2813
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:46.441
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

2814
01:18:46.441 --> 01:18:47.131
<v Speaker 3>They made friends.</v>

2815
01:18:47.131 --> 01:18:47.964
<v Speaker 3>How cute.</v>

2816
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:49.770
<v Speaker 3>But like really it,</v>

2817
01:18:49.771 --> 01:18:50.604
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2818
01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:51.960
<v Speaker 3>that means a lot man.</v>

2819
01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:55.560
<v Speaker 3>When you see these two guys trained for each other for months at a time,</v>

2820
01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.870
<v Speaker 3>talk shit about how the fights going to go down.</v>

2821
01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:59.213
<v Speaker 3>Talk about,</v>

2822
01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:00.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2823
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.350
<v Speaker 3>beating each other's asses</v>

2824
01:19:02.230 --> 01:19:04.660
<v Speaker 2>and damn all that beautiful hold heat.</v>

2825
01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:05.570
<v Speaker 2>A full transition.</v>

2826
01:19:05.571 --> 01:19:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

2827
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:07.490
<v Speaker 2>He's going for the single,</v>

2828
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:08.511
<v Speaker 2>he misses it.</v>

2829
01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 2>And the transition to the double catches a guillotine and gets that perfect over</v>

2830
01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:12.800
<v Speaker 2>the top.</v>

2831
01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.210
<v Speaker 2>That is nasty as fuck.</v>

2832
01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.100
<v Speaker 2>That is locked down.</v>

2833
01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:19.040
<v Speaker 2>He got 'em in the chat that with that grip right under the chin,</v>

2834
01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:22.400
<v Speaker 2>right that pill and he can't get it out and you know what?</v>

2835
01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2836
01:19:24.181 --> 01:19:26.000
<v Speaker 2>I could follow the ride in the morning.</v>

2837
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2838
01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:28.940
<v Speaker 2>And he's pushing against it.</v>

2839
01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.920
<v Speaker 2>The fence is weird man.</v>

2840
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:34.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it helps things and I think it makes it way easy to take people down.</v>

2841
01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of wrestlers,</v>

2842
01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:36.800
<v Speaker 2>like if it,</v>

2843
01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.180
<v Speaker 2>if the fence didn't exist,</v>

2844
01:19:38.181 --> 01:19:39.680
<v Speaker 2>good fucking luck.</v>

2845
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Good luck trying to take them down.</v>

2846
01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:42.140
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

2847
01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:46.280
<v Speaker 2>the fence also makes it harder to take people down and in another sense where</v>

2848
01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:47.390
<v Speaker 2>you're leaning against the fence,</v>

2849
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:48.403
<v Speaker 2>you could put all,</v>

2850
01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:53.240
<v Speaker 2>it's an art totally to use all your weight into the fence and just to use a</v>

2851
01:19:53.241 --> 01:19:54.074
<v Speaker 2>fence as a,</v>

2852
01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.780
<v Speaker 2>as in your favor when you're working on your take down the fence,</v>

2853
01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:00.050
<v Speaker 2>there truly is a difference between MMA,</v>

2854
01:20:00.051 --> 01:20:01.220
<v Speaker 2>wrestling and wrestling.</v>

2855
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Speaker 2>There should be a tournament would call fence wrestling where you start and you</v>

2856
01:20:05.661 --> 01:20:08.030
<v Speaker 2>have a guy against the fence and as soon as he gets</v>

2857
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:10.200
<v Speaker 6>circle out now you switch and you go back and forth.</v>

2858
01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:12.210
<v Speaker 6>See who gets the most takedowns off the fence.</v>

2859
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:13.260
<v Speaker 6>That would be a great skill.</v>

2860
01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:16.440
<v Speaker 6>Like you know how you say taekwondo is a good skill to have.</v>

2861
01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:19.140
<v Speaker 6>If you're like a Wonderboy and you can throw those perfect kind of kicks.</v>

2862
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:20.550
<v Speaker 6>If you had a sport,</v>

2863
01:20:20.551 --> 01:20:22.250
<v Speaker 6>a separate sport fence wrestling,</v>

2864
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:23.370
<v Speaker 6>that was just fence wrestling.</v>

2865
01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.900
<v Speaker 6>That is actually a really good idea.</v>

2866
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.180
<v Speaker 6>That'd be for MMA.</v>

2867
01:20:26.230 --> 01:20:29.820
<v Speaker 6>It would prepare you better for him and that's a big difference.</v>

2868
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.050
<v Speaker 6>Do you think with fencing,</v>

2869
01:20:31.090 --> 01:20:32.490
<v Speaker 6>without fence difference?</v>

2870
01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.121
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah.</v>

2871
01:20:33.121 --> 01:20:34.140
<v Speaker 6>He couldn't run away either.</v>

2872
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:38.070
<v Speaker 6>So you think parents will let their kids wrestle in a cage if they had school</v>

2873
01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:39.600
<v Speaker 6>meets the parents?</v>

2874
01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:39.931
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

2875
01:20:39.931 --> 01:20:40.764
<v Speaker 6>Hell yeah.</v>

2876
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:46.650
<v Speaker 6>I got parents that they want their kids to fight in the UFC more than the kids</v>

2877
01:20:46.651 --> 01:20:49.230

2878
01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 6>Cajun Rubber Guard show it to all that shit.</v>

2879
01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:56.430

2882
01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 6>He's doing water polo for that explosion.</v>

2883
01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:06.470
<v Speaker 6>You imagine if like all wrestling meets turned into the cage wrestling meets.</v>

2884
01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.490
<v Speaker 6>I know Russell and attendance is down.</v>

2885
01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.620
<v Speaker 6>I've got good news and I've got bad news.</v>

2886
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:15.390
<v Speaker 6>Good news is we got a solution to bad news is involves your little angels</v>

2887
01:21:15.391 --> 01:21:16.490
<v Speaker 6>wrestling in a cage.</v>

2888
01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:21.150
<v Speaker 6>How about you have instead of instead of a six mats out there,</v>

2889
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 6>like in a high school,</v>

2890
01:21:22.171 --> 01:21:26.490
<v Speaker 6>you have six cages out there and it's just cage wrestling.</v>

2891
01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:28.020
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to get six fucking cages.</v>

2892
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:28.171
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2893
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:31.620
<v Speaker 6>but you can't have cages run simultaneously as you can just like a regular</v>

2894
01:21:31.621 --> 01:21:33.030
<v Speaker 6>wrestling tournament or just get a tournament.</v>

2895
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:36.420
<v Speaker 6>There's it at the world as 12 matches going on at the same time.</v>

2896
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:37.960
<v Speaker 6>You just put a little cages in each map.</v>

2897
01:21:38.050 --> 01:21:38.290
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2898
01:21:38.290 --> 01:21:39.850
<v Speaker 6>but doesn't it seem like,</v>

2899
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:40.561

01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:43.530
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ,</v>

2903
01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:46.734
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

2904
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:49.290
<v Speaker 6>he was $30,000 to get the cages,</v>

2905
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.340
<v Speaker 6>clothings optional.</v>

2906
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:51.480
<v Speaker 6>Who's going to bring the cages?</v>

2907
01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:52.960
<v Speaker 6>We got a cage.</v>

2908
01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.793
<v Speaker 6>Oils,</v>

2911
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:57.090
<v Speaker 6>You guys are going to oil it or are you guys going to go dry today?</v>

2912
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 6>Turkish oil wrestling,</v>

2913

<v Speaker 6>you know they have that shit,</v>

2914
01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.290
<v Speaker 6>the oil each other up.</v>

2915
01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:02.640
<v Speaker 6>You ever seen that dude?</v>

2916
01:22:02.641 --> 01:22:04.950
<v Speaker 6>They reach into each other's pants or grabbed their boulevard.</v>

2917
01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:09.980
<v Speaker 6>Greatest photoshops ever of all time back when Photoshop was first invented,</v>

2918
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.600
<v Speaker 6>they took one of them Turkish oil wrestling.</v>

2919
01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.180
<v Speaker 6>Was it like they look like they're in leather pants,</v>

2920
01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:17.010
<v Speaker 6>topless leather pants.</v>

2921
01:22:17.011 --> 01:22:18.660
<v Speaker 6>It looks like a Chippendale's outfit,</v>

2922
01:22:18.661 --> 01:22:23.070
<v Speaker 6>but it's actually serious sports going on without wrestling and they're</v>

2923
01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:28.071
<v Speaker 6>completely covered in oil and you can reach part of the sport is reaching inside</v>

2924
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:31.920
<v Speaker 6>the man's pants to grip around his balls.</v>

2925
01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:33.930
<v Speaker 6>That is part of the game.</v>

2926
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.780
<v Speaker 6>That is part of the game.</v>

2927
01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:36.710

2938
01:22:50.301 --> 01:22:54.200

2980
01:24:01.930 --> 01:24:03.550
<v Speaker 6>If you see the quiver on the hips,</v>

2986
01:24:13.541 --> 01:24:13.761
<v Speaker 6>grip.</v>

3016
01:25:10.031 --> 01:25:11.530
<v Speaker 6>gotten like in trouble for that.</v>

3017
01:25:11.531 --> 01:25:14.650
<v Speaker 6>Like didn't guys get arrested for um,</v>

3018
01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:15.940
<v Speaker 6>for assault,</v>

3019
01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.440
<v Speaker 6>for checking some kids oil.</v>

3020
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:21.940
<v Speaker 6>Didn't some two dudes wrestling and one kid check the kids oil and he got</v>

3021
01:25:21.941 --> 01:25:22.930
<v Speaker 6>arrested for assault.</v>

3022
01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure that really happened or I drink,</v>

3023
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:27.340
<v Speaker 6>you need to explain or checking the oil and gas.</v>

3024
01:25:27.341 --> 01:25:27.851
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

3025
01:25:27.851 --> 01:25:32.380
<v Speaker 6>Checking your oil means when you are grappling with a gentleman and you are</v>

3026
01:25:32.381 --> 01:25:33.430
<v Speaker 6>behind him,</v>

3027
01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:38.610
<v Speaker 6>you shoved with your fingers inside his bum hole in wrestling.</v>

3028
01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.730
<v Speaker 6>We're not sure if that's or not,</v>

3029
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:41.530
<v Speaker 6>but they do it.</v>

3030
01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:42.550
<v Speaker 6>They do it all the time.</v>

3031
01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:43.690
<v Speaker 6>This is a really radical,</v>

3032
01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:50.370
<v Speaker 6>it's a woman and she's like going full Tarzan on this girl's asshole and she's</v>

3033
01:25:50.471 --> 01:25:51.400
<v Speaker 6>not even flinching.</v>

3034
01:25:51.401 --> 01:25:51.880
<v Speaker 6>Look at that.</v>

3035
01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.570
<v Speaker 6>She's like,</v>

3036
01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:53.021
<v Speaker 6>bitch,</v>

3037
01:25:53.021 --> 01:25:53.681
<v Speaker 6>this is not the,</v>

3038
01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:54.514
<v Speaker 6>she likes it.</v>

3039
01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:56.003
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3040
01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:56.561
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3041
01:25:56.561 --> 01:25:57.250
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3042
01:25:57.250 --> 01:26:01.360
<v Speaker 6>the woman on top is definitely doing something questionable.</v>

3043
01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:02.690
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3044
01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:06.260
<v Speaker 6>who am to judge legal though in Turkish oil.</v>

3045
01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:07.740
<v Speaker 6>I want to know the rules of Turkish.</v>

3046
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:08.833
<v Speaker 6>Can someone</v>

3047
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:11.760
<v Speaker 6>who kills someone,</v>

3048
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.760
<v Speaker 6>someone tweet me please.</v>

3049
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:16.640
<v Speaker 6>If you could find the rules to Turkish oil,</v>

3050
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:17.421
<v Speaker 6>Chippendale's,</v>

3051
01:26:17.421 --> 01:26:18.254
<v Speaker 6>wrestling.</v>

3052
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm curious.</v>

3053
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.771
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3054
01:26:21.771 --> 01:26:22.604
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3055
01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:25.500
<v Speaker 1>What a great sport.</v>

3056
01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:27.840
<v Speaker 1>So how come they can't have that in the Olympics,</v>

3057
01:26:27.841 --> 01:26:29.910
<v Speaker 1>but they can have that women's volleyball bullshit.</v>

3058
01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:30.773
<v Speaker 1>It's a sexist,</v>

3059
01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:32.280
<v Speaker 1>total sexism.</v>

3060
01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.300
<v Speaker 1>It's all we need.</v>

3061
01:26:33.301 --> 01:26:34.170
<v Speaker 1>This is what we need.</v>

3062
01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:39.290
<v Speaker 1>We need one flamboyantly gay star who wants to compete and they won't let him</v>

3063
01:26:41.131 --> 01:26:41.401
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

3064
01:26:41.401 --> 01:26:44.790
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes like a global worldwide cause where people,</v>

3065
01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:45.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3066
01:26:45.150 --> 01:26:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3067
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:48.870
<v Speaker 1>they'd demand diversity and um,</v>

3068
01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.160
<v Speaker 1>what are the quality</v>

3069
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:51.280
<v Speaker 6>it would have?</v>

3070
01:26:51.281 --> 01:26:52.340
<v Speaker 6>It's shooting to be gay.</v>

3071
01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.360
<v Speaker 6>So they got a lie.</v>

3072
01:26:53.361 --> 01:26:55.550
<v Speaker 6>They're saying they're straight friends,</v>

3073
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:56.750
<v Speaker 1>girlfriends.</v>

3074
01:26:56.750 --> 01:27:00.050
<v Speaker 1>It's been proven that when you wrestle a gay man and he starts to,</v>

3075
01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:02.240
<v Speaker 1>when your testosterone drops significantly.</v>

3076
01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:02.991
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3077
01:27:02.991 --> 01:27:04.280
<v Speaker 1>It's been proven in science,</v>

3078
01:27:04.630 --> 01:27:05.540
<v Speaker 1>in the labs.</v>

3079
01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:08.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like cheating because it's like anti steroids.</v>

3080
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Cause when you getting whooped on by gay dude,</v>

3081
01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:12.320
<v Speaker 1>you start getting so meek.</v>

3082
01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like the nature's preparing you to be as bitch.</v>

3083
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3084
01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.900
<v Speaker 6>And there's no one true and there's no way you could.</v>

3085
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:19.260
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3086
01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:20.130
<v Speaker 6>Guy Can even be,</v>

3087
01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.520
<v Speaker 1>he looked at me like it's real question.</v>

3088
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:23.481
<v Speaker 1>What does this,</v>

3089
01:27:23.481 --> 01:27:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

3090
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:24.763
<v Speaker 1>are these the rules?</v>

3091
01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:27.080
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.com and check out number three.</v>

3092
01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:28.130
<v Speaker 1>These are alternatives.</v>

3093
01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Can you read that Joe,</v>

3094
01:27:30.081 --> 01:27:30.861
<v Speaker 1>for the audience?</v>

3095
01:27:30.861 --> 01:27:32.090
<v Speaker 1>This is very bizarre.</v>

3096
01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:32.900
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

3097
01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:33.733
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3098
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:38.950
<v Speaker 1>the crush of fighter may maneuver his opponent onto his stomach.</v>

3099
01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:41.210
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3100
01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:41.561
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

3101
01:27:41.561 --> 01:27:44.600
<v Speaker 1>can you make that bigger and then trap himself?</v>

3102
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Why is it all so blurry?</v>

3103
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:47.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not that blurry spa.</v>

3104
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.651
<v Speaker 1>You get your glasses.</v>

3105
01:27:48.651 --> 01:27:49.081
<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>

3106
01:27:49.081 --> 01:27:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have my glasses on and I could read that.</v>

3107
01:27:50.901 --> 01:27:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm shocked myself.</v>

3108
01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.510
<v Speaker 1>You can keep him down.</v>

3109
01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3110
01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:54.561
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>

3111
01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.550
<v Speaker 1>what are the rules against it?</v>

3112
01:27:55.551 --> 01:27:56.061
<v Speaker 1>Submission.</v>

3113
01:27:56.061 --> 01:28:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally the match under a hot summer sun so long and arduous that one</v>

3114
01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.250
<v Speaker 1>fightable simply signal his submission to the referee and it's a pin.</v>

3115
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Since the wrestlers not restricted from placing his hands inside his opponents</v>

3116
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.433
<v Speaker 1>kiss bit,</v>

3117
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:13.550
<v Speaker 1>he may not grab his balls or invade his rectum.</v>

3118
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:15.103
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

3119
01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.520
<v Speaker 1>however he may yacht grab his balls or invade his rectum,</v>

3120
01:28:19.521 --> 01:28:21.050
<v Speaker 1>however he can.</v>

3121
01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3122
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:25.550
<v Speaker 1>he can also use to waistband band over the other man to get to,</v>

3123
01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.200
<v Speaker 1>to hold the other man in place.</v>

3124
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3125
01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:30.780
<v Speaker 1>so you can't grab their balls in there and Dick in their ass hole right there.</v>

3126
01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:32.030
<v Speaker 1>If you lose your trunks,</v>

3127
01:28:32.031 --> 01:28:32.864
<v Speaker 1>you lose the match.</v>

3128
01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3129
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.400
<v Speaker 1>if a guy takes her pants off,</v>

3130
01:28:36.490 --> 01:28:37.323
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

3131
01:28:37.330 --> 01:28:38.260
<v Speaker 6>can you imagine?</v>

3132
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:41.370
<v Speaker 6>It's even worse than not on and grab the balls.</v>

3133
01:28:42.670 --> 01:28:44.830
<v Speaker 6>It's even worse because the cheaters,</v>

3134
01:28:45.010 --> 01:28:45.241
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

3135
01:28:45.241 --> 01:28:48.010
<v Speaker 6>the cheaters in the sport are always going to be the guys.</v>

3136
01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:49.450
<v Speaker 6>And how are you going to prove it?</v>

3137
01:28:49.451 --> 01:28:51.040
<v Speaker 6>There must be a guy in the sport,</v>

3138
01:28:52.050 --> 01:28:53.440
<v Speaker 6>the worst cheater ever.</v>

3139
01:28:53.650 --> 01:28:54.520
<v Speaker 6>There's got to be,</v>

3140
01:28:54.670 --> 01:28:55.210
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

3141
01:28:55.210 --> 01:28:56.410
<v Speaker 6>listen to the actual rule.</v>

3142
01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:58.840
<v Speaker 6>Occasionally the Kismet is yanked.</v>

3143
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:59.950
<v Speaker 6>So the carpet,</v>

3144
01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:01.060
<v Speaker 6>what is the thing that he wears?</v>

3145
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 6>Leather</v>

3146
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.040
<v Speaker 1>restup pass is dropped so far below his hips that the fighter being held cannot</v>

3147
01:29:08.911 --> 01:29:11.310
<v Speaker 1>rise without exposing himself,</v>

3148
01:29:11.490 --> 01:29:13.050
<v Speaker 1>having lost his trunks.</v>

3149
01:29:13.051 --> 01:29:14.580
<v Speaker 1>He also loses the match.</v>

3150
01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:14.891
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3151
01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:16.530
<v Speaker 6>you could pull down the trunks,</v>

3152
01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:18.940
<v Speaker 6>you lose the match.</v>

3153
01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:19.920
<v Speaker 6>Maybe this is like,</v>

3154
01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:21.163
<v Speaker 6>you're always like,</v>

3155
01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:25.390
<v Speaker 6>you could reach inside but you can't touch the asshole or the Dick and I'm sure</v>

3156
01:29:25.391 --> 01:29:27.880
<v Speaker 6>no one breaks that rule ever,</v>

3157
01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:28.661
<v Speaker 6>ever,</v>

3158
01:29:28.661 --> 01:29:28.991
<v Speaker 6>ever,</v>

3159
01:29:28.991 --> 01:29:29.291
<v Speaker 6>ever,</v>

3160
01:29:29.291 --> 01:29:29.621
<v Speaker 6>ever,</v>

3161
01:29:29.621 --> 01:29:30.040
<v Speaker 6>ever.</v>

3162
01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.230
<v Speaker 6>It's better that they're there,</v>

3163
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:37.000
<v Speaker 6>but they're not allowed to pulls your pants off.</v>

3164
01:29:37.001 --> 01:29:37.511
<v Speaker 6>He wins.</v>

3165
01:29:37.511 --> 01:29:39.520
<v Speaker 6>Can you imagine the discussions?</v>

3166
01:29:39.521 --> 01:29:40.354
<v Speaker 6>A podcast,</v>

3167
01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:42.700
<v Speaker 6>there must be podcasts about this sport,</v>

3168
01:29:42.701 --> 01:29:45.340
<v Speaker 6>like dudes that are seriously into it and they're talking about like,</v>

3169
01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:45.641
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3170
01:29:45.641 --> 01:29:47.760
<v Speaker 6>we're talking about like no need a down opponent,</v>

3171
01:29:47.770 --> 01:29:48.220
<v Speaker 6>all that.</v>

3172
01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:52.720
<v Speaker 6>They're talking about that the elephant in the room is the fact that everyone's</v>

3173
01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:56.170
<v Speaker 6>sticking fingers and everyone's an asshole and everyone's grabbing balls.</v>

3174
01:29:56.171 --> 01:29:58.210
<v Speaker 6>But no one's complaining because everyone just does it.</v>

3175
01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.810
<v Speaker 6>And so there's no complaints like in football,</v>

3176
01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.640
<v Speaker 6>like the defensive cornerback when there,</v>

3177
01:30:04.641 --> 01:30:05.860
<v Speaker 6>there's a receiver going out,</v>

3178
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:09.040
<v Speaker 6>you're not supposed to hit him outside of five yards,</v>

3179
01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:11.830
<v Speaker 6>but they're hitting him all the time and running into them.</v>

3180
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:12.760
<v Speaker 6>And when they throw passes,</v>

3181
01:30:12.761 --> 01:30:13.281
<v Speaker 6>they're all over.</v>

3182
01:30:13.281 --> 01:30:13.540
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3183
01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:14.350
<v Speaker 6>So they're like,</v>

3184
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:16.720
<v Speaker 6>and they call it sometimes and sometimes they don't.</v>

3185
01:30:16.721 --> 01:30:17.380
<v Speaker 6>And there's a,</v>

3186
01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:18.580
<v Speaker 6>there's big controversy,</v>

3187
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:19.271
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3188
01:30:19.271 --> 01:30:19.511
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3189
01:30:19.511 --> 01:30:20.080
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3190
01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.570
<v Speaker 6>there's a panist pass interference,</v>

3191
01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:22.540
<v Speaker 6>but no one's calling it.</v>

3192
01:30:22.541 --> 01:30:23.261
<v Speaker 6>It's a weird thing.</v>

3193
01:30:23.261 --> 01:30:25.150
<v Speaker 6>They call it every now and then when it's,</v>

3194
01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:26.140
<v Speaker 6>when it's playing,</v>

3195
01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.520
<v Speaker 6>when it's really obvious.</v>

3196
01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:31.570
<v Speaker 6>So there must be like tips of fingers going into the rectum,</v>

3197
01:30:31.571 --> 01:30:32.620
<v Speaker 6>but they don't call that,</v>

3198
01:30:32.710 --> 01:30:36.070
<v Speaker 6>they never call the tips and it's got to be full knuckle deep to call it.</v>

3199
01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:37.760
<v Speaker 6>And that's a problem line.</v>

3200
01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:40.270
<v Speaker 6>You have to cross 10 like a finger line.</v>

3201
01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:41.770
<v Speaker 6>Nobody puts the tip in.</v>

3202
01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.091
<v Speaker 6>Tip is fine,</v>

3203
01:30:43.091 --> 01:30:43.924
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

3204
01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:44.501

01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:46.300
<v Speaker 6>there's gotta be world championships.</v>

3207
01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.190

3208

3209
01:30:51.911 --> 01:30:52.630

3210
01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:53.470
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to see that.</v>

3242
01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:45.130
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be,</v>

3243
01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:48.160
<v Speaker 1>who is the Hixon Gracie of all Turkish oil,</v>

3244
01:31:48.490 --> 01:31:49.323
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3245
01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.020
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

3246
01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:50.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3247
01:31:50.261 --> 01:31:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Turkish people are tough people.</v>

3248
01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:52.920
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

3249
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough part of the world.</v>

3250
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:59.790
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to think it's a long heritage of having like fighting from Turkey.</v>

3251
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.990
<v Speaker 2>They're like known for being like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like that style of wrestling that they do.</v>

3255
01:32:10.721 --> 01:32:13.480

<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be girls doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They don't have to be,</v>

3268
01:32:37.201 --> 01:32:38.034

3275
01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:48.690

3276
01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:53.140
<v Speaker 2>get some kind of ball and socket in between their legs right next to their nuts</v>

3277
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.430
<v Speaker 2>and lift him up.</v>

3278
01:32:55.090 --> 01:32:58.180

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.460
<v Speaker 2>whoever is the baddest motherfucker at that sport,</v>

3301
01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:37.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3302
01:33:37.210 --> 01:33:41.460
<v Speaker 2>They have no fear of getting a gang raped by sure.</v>

3303
01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Vicious gay dudes especially cause there's just,</v>

3304
01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.800
<v Speaker 2>you never get that oil off the street gang of gay Jujitsu,</v>

3305
01:33:50.081 --> 01:33:50.541
<v Speaker 2>black belt.</v>

3306
01:33:50.541 --> 01:33:51.670
<v Speaker 2>We can imagine that.</v>

3307
01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.590
<v Speaker 2>And they taught,</v>

3308
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:56.770
<v Speaker 2>they teach Jujitsu to have sex with men.</v>

3309
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.101
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3310
01:33:57.101 --> 01:33:59.270
<v Speaker 2>What would be scarier that or</v>

3311
01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.190
<v Speaker 2>go to [inaudible] in West Hollywood.</v>

01:34:08.291 --> 01:34:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Hoofs greased up with good takedown defense.</v>

3316
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

3317

<v Speaker 2>Completely greased up in West Hollywood.</v>

3319
01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:16.720
<v Speaker 2>He'll go wherever the fuck he want.</v>

3320
01:34:16.721 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 2>One dude or a bunch of dudes,</v>

3321
01:34:18.130 --> 01:34:18.850
<v Speaker 2>seven of them.</v>

3322
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:20.090
<v Speaker 2>They look just like Melvin man.</v>

3323
01:34:20.110 --> 01:34:23.040
<v Speaker 2>They're looking for dudes to Caltrain man have clones.</v>

3324
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:23.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3325

<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

3328
01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Greasy rest live is one thing,</v>

3329
01:34:33.821 --> 01:34:36.220
<v Speaker 2>but greasy Melvin Manhoef throwing bombs on you.</v>

3330
01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3331
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want any once your juicy,</v>

3332
01:34:39.011 --> 01:34:40.550
<v Speaker 2>precious the rectum,</v>

3333
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:43.030
<v Speaker 2>that's their goal.</v>

3334
01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:45.060
<v Speaker 2>They got big patches of rectums on their,</v>

3335
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:47.620
<v Speaker 2>their their denim jackets and you can't keep him off you.</v>

3336
01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3337
01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:52.870
<v Speaker 2>He was one of those guys where I met him at the UFC like as a kickboxing fan.</v>

3338
01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:53.381
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

3339
01:34:53.381 --> 01:34:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

3340
01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I was giddy man.</v>

3341
01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I come up to him and shake his hand.</v>

3342
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:57.440
<v Speaker 2>It was good too.</v>

3343
01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge</v>

3344
01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:58.970
<v Speaker 3>fan.</v>

3345
01:34:58.970 --> 01:35:00.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm a huge fan.</v>

3346
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.240
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it weird that he never got into the UFC?</v>

3347
01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:03.163
<v Speaker 3>That's strange.</v>

3348
01:35:03.170 --> 01:35:03.321
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3349
01:35:03.321 --> 01:35:08.090
<v Speaker 3>it got to the strike force and Robbie Lawler had that ridiculously insane Kale</v>

3350
01:35:08.091 --> 01:35:08.391
<v Speaker 3>of him.</v>

3351
01:35:08.391 --> 01:35:10.970
<v Speaker 3>You remember that Robby Lawler there isn't that condit fight.</v>

3352
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.921
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3353
01:35:12.921 --> 01:35:15.890
<v Speaker 3>but Melvin Manhoef highlight reel is ridiculous.</v>

3354
01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Kickboxing and MMA highlight reel.</v>

3355
01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:21.350
<v Speaker 3>The hardest one to watch for me with a soccer raba.</v>

3356
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:22.453
<v Speaker 3>Remember that one?</v>

3357
01:35:24.230 --> 01:35:24.830
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

3358
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:27.100
<v Speaker 3>He beat the shit out of soccer,</v>

3359
01:35:27.101 --> 01:35:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Robert.</v>

3360
01:35:27.410 --> 01:35:27.841
<v Speaker 3>It was soccer,</v>

3361
01:35:27.841 --> 01:35:29.800
<v Speaker 3>but late in his career and soccer,</v>

3362
01:35:29.801 --> 01:35:30.450
<v Speaker 3>I have a loss.</v>

3363
01:35:30.450 --> 01:35:31.610
<v Speaker 3>I was a horrible law.</v>

3364
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:33.500
<v Speaker 3>It was soccer kicks,</v>

3365
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:35.660
<v Speaker 3>soccer kicks and hammer fist.</v>

3366
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:37.880
<v Speaker 3>They take soccer kicks out of one FC.</v>

3367
01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Didn't you hear about that day?</v>

3368
01:35:39.321 --> 01:35:39.921
<v Speaker 3>When was this?</v>

3369
01:35:39.921 --> 01:35:40.700
<v Speaker 3>They changed it.</v>

3370
01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:41.271
<v Speaker 3>They took it out.</v>

3371
01:35:41.271 --> 01:35:42.170
<v Speaker 3>When did they do this?</v>

3372
01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.700
<v Speaker 3>Unless it's some hoax.</v>

3373
01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:44.900
<v Speaker 3>But I think I read that,</v>

3374
01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:45.411
<v Speaker 3>that one of,</v>

3375
01:35:45.411 --> 01:35:48.350
<v Speaker 3>see the thing that separated them from the UFC,</v>

3376
01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:50.480
<v Speaker 3>like at least in one fc was kind of pride ish.</v>

3377
01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.090
<v Speaker 3>But they had that weird rule where they had to call it.</v>

3378
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:53.840
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3379
01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:54.051
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3380
01:35:54.051 --> 01:35:54.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3381
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I feel like Tate had this point first and uh,</v>

3382
01:35:57.831 --> 01:35:58.664
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

3383
01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:03.590
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard anybody accurately refuted that the problem with stomps and</v>

3384
01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:05.240
<v Speaker 3>soccer kicks in a ring</v>

3385
01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:07.850
<v Speaker 3>or in a cage rather,</v>

3386
01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.670
<v Speaker 3>is that you can't get out away from them like you do in a ring.</v>

3387
01:36:10.671 --> 01:36:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Like the cage becomes a problem.</v>

3388
01:36:12.261 --> 01:36:13.250
<v Speaker 3>Like you get trapped,</v>

3389
01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.620
<v Speaker 3>you get caught in a couple spots in the ring,</v>

3390
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:19.010
<v Speaker 3>but you should be able to move your head out of the way enough to compensate for</v>

3391
01:36:19.011 --> 01:36:20.750
<v Speaker 3>wherever the ring the ring posts are.</v>

3392
01:36:21.330 --> 01:36:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>

3393
01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:24.770
<v Speaker 3>But the idea of getting stuck in the cage,</v>

3394
01:36:24.771 --> 01:36:25.581
<v Speaker 3>we can't move.</v>

3395
01:36:25.581 --> 01:36:27.540
<v Speaker 3>And then getting need to that where the,</v>

3396
01:36:27.541 --> 01:36:30.200
<v Speaker 3>the environment becomes too big of a factor.</v>

3397
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:32.000
<v Speaker 3>And I thought about what he said and I said,</v>

3398
01:36:32.001 --> 01:36:33.320
<v Speaker 3>that makes a lot of sense.</v>

3399
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:34.730
<v Speaker 3>A skull could crush,</v>

3400
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 3>could be just squashed thinking about like what Michael Page did to Cyborg and</v>

3401
01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:42.710
<v Speaker 3>think of someone doing that to someone's face in the UFC,</v>

3402
01:36:42.711 --> 01:36:43.150
<v Speaker 3>which again,</v>

3403
01:36:43.150 --> 01:36:46.220
<v Speaker 3>when the faith see someone's face caved in and what if they cheat?</v>

3404
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:48.020
<v Speaker 3>What if someone cheats in the heat of the battle?</v>

3405
01:36:48.021 --> 01:36:49.520
<v Speaker 3>Maybe don't even realize they did it,</v>

3406
01:36:49.521 --> 01:36:52.700
<v Speaker 3>but they grabbed that fence and it helps them drive that knee down.</v>

3407
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:54.650
<v Speaker 3>You know that's happened before.</v>

3408
01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:55.490
<v Speaker 3>If you could,</v>

3409
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:59.880
<v Speaker 3>if you got a guy who was almost unconscious and he's on his way out and you grab</v>

3410
01:36:59.881 --> 01:37:03.680
<v Speaker 3>the fence and you some mash your knee down with all your body,</v>

3411
01:37:03.681 --> 01:37:04.700
<v Speaker 3>you get your hips up in the air.</v>

3412
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Like George Saint Pierre when he fought Matt Serra and the rematch and Montreal,</v>

3413
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:11.240
<v Speaker 3>remember that those knees to the body from side control,</v>

3414
01:37:11.241 --> 01:37:12.770
<v Speaker 3>just go deep with those knees.</v>

3415
01:37:12.850 --> 01:37:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

3416
01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:18.260
<v Speaker 3>If a guy does that to a guy on the ground and he's actually holding the fence,</v>

3417
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:19.700
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3418
01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.820
<v Speaker 3>that's a terrible place to be as a terror.</v>

3419
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:23.990
<v Speaker 3>There's like nowhere to go.</v>

3420
01:37:23.991 --> 01:37:25.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like everything's just getting absorbed.</v>

3421
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.200
<v Speaker 3>It's the worst way ever to get hit.</v>

3422
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:28.050
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like,</v>

3423
01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:28.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3424
01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:30.290
<v Speaker 3>an argument for not having a cage.</v>

3425
01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:34.190
<v Speaker 3>I've said this before and people think I'm an idiot and it probably right some</v>

3426
01:37:34.191 --> 01:37:34.970
<v Speaker 3>of the time,</v>

3427
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:39.440
<v Speaker 3>but I think that MMA should be in like basketball size place.</v>

3428
01:37:39.650 --> 01:37:40.011
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

3429
01:37:40.011 --> 01:37:42.200
<v Speaker 3>you have a basketball court and you're watching the game.</v>

3430
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:44.930
<v Speaker 3>I really think MMA should be a flat,</v>

3431
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:50.290
<v Speaker 3>padded area with no fence and they should go at it and a large area.</v>

3432
01:37:50.690 --> 01:37:52.490
<v Speaker 3>So there's plenty of room to move around.</v>

3433
01:37:52.491 --> 01:37:54.440
<v Speaker 3>There's no excuse to go into the crowd like that.</v>

3434
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:55.680
<v Speaker 3>That's how they should do it.</v>

3435
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:57.150
<v Speaker 5>So take downs,</v>

3436
01:37:57.151 --> 01:37:58.830
<v Speaker 5>defense submissions,</v>

3437
01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.040
<v Speaker 5>there's no getting off the fence and pushing off of it and flipping over and</v>

3438
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:03.030
<v Speaker 5>getting out of positions.</v>

3439
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:06.390
<v Speaker 5>Everything will take place on a flat neutral ground.</v>

3440
01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.900
<v Speaker 5>And I think you're going to find a lot of fucking people going to have a real</v>

3441
01:38:09.901 --> 01:38:11.040
<v Speaker 5>hard time with wrestlers.</v>

3442
01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:16.320
<v Speaker 5>Real hard time with wrestlers like real elite wrestlers when they keep driving</v>

3443
01:38:16.321 --> 01:38:18.900
<v Speaker 5>forward and you can only go back so much,</v>

3444
01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.850
<v Speaker 5>you know there's no cage anymore.</v>

3445
01:38:20.851 --> 01:38:22.290
<v Speaker 5>You can't push off the cage.</v>

3446
01:38:22.291 --> 01:38:24.150
<v Speaker 5>How bout this again,</v>

3447
01:38:24.151 --> 01:38:25.260
<v Speaker 5>this is all fantasy.</v>

3448
01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:26.670
<v Speaker 5>How about somebody,</v>

3449
01:38:26.671 --> 01:38:29.170
<v Speaker 5>maybe you maybe someone else with a um,</v>

3450
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:32.820
<v Speaker 5>the could financially but to put it together but go to some God damn Indian</v>

3451
01:38:32.821 --> 01:38:35.850
<v Speaker 5>reservation when you could do anything you want put together,</v>

3452
01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.713
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.920
<v Speaker 5>put together a show,</v>

3454
01:38:38.130 --> 01:38:38.671
<v Speaker 5>one show.</v>

3455
01:38:38.671 --> 01:38:39.810
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have to be elite fighters.</v>

3456
01:38:39.811 --> 01:38:41.640
<v Speaker 5>You don't put that much put together show.</v>

3457
01:38:42.210 --> 01:38:46.740
<v Speaker 5>You got to show them how it's done because one thing I learned with Ebi is when</v>

3458
01:38:46.741 --> 01:38:50.370
<v Speaker 5>I was presenting the overtime rules and all that to everybody,</v>

3459
01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:54.330
<v Speaker 5>nobody even thought it was cool for a second.</v>

3460
01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:55.530
<v Speaker 5>I talked to them.</v>

3461
01:38:55.531 --> 01:38:57.420
<v Speaker 5>Explain Ebi for people to know what we're talking about.</v>

3462
01:38:57.450 --> 01:38:58.800

<v Speaker 5>Invitationals.</v>

3464
01:38:59.701 --> 01:39:04.140
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Bravo's probably got the greatest Jujitsu tournament in the world as far</v>

3465
01:39:04.141 --> 01:39:07.920
<v Speaker 5>as professional Jujitsu because of these rules that you implemented.</v>

3507
01:40:12.481 --> 01:40:14.080
<v Speaker 5>Ebi Seven Gordon Ryan is going,</v>

3508
01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:15.270
<v Speaker 5>we're doing the one 85.</v>

3509
01:40:15.271 --> 01:40:16.110
<v Speaker 5>That was absolute.</v>

3510
01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:17.760
<v Speaker 5>This is the middleweight Gorn Ryan.</v>

01:40:17.761 --> 01:40:19.590
<v Speaker 5>That's his true wait one 85.</v>

3512
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:20.783
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

3513
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:21.630
<v Speaker 5>but anyways,</v>

3514
01:40:21.630 --> 01:40:22.560
<v Speaker 5>enough with that show,</v>

3515
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:23.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3516
01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.300
<v Speaker 5>the rules though,</v>

3517
01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:26.310
<v Speaker 5>when I presented the overtime rules,</v>

3518
01:40:26.311 --> 01:40:30.190
<v Speaker 5>I have special overtime rules that are based on submission and not based on take</v>

3519
01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:30.870
<v Speaker 5>downs.</v>

3520
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:31.171
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3521
01:40:31.171 --> 01:40:32.790
<v Speaker 5>it's all about the submission at Ebi.</v>

3522
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.380
<v Speaker 5>But when I first pres presented that like two different promoters,</v>

3523
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:38.760
<v Speaker 5>nobody wanted to hear it.</v>

3524
01:40:38.970 --> 01:40:39.540
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3525
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:40.870
<v Speaker 5>they didn't even entertain it.</v>

3526
01:40:40.871 --> 01:40:41.970
<v Speaker 5>They thought it was too crazy.</v>

3527
01:40:42.150 --> 01:40:44.100
<v Speaker 5>But now that we put together seven shows,</v>

3528
01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:46.200
<v Speaker 5>now the show people are going,</v>

3529
01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.273
<v Speaker 5>oh shit,</v>

3530
01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:47.941
<v Speaker 5>it's legit.</v>

3531
01:40:47.941 --> 01:40:51.840
<v Speaker 5>So everyone jumped on board and people agree that it's the best way to do</v>

3532
01:40:51.841 --> 01:40:52.301
<v Speaker 5>tournaments.</v>

3533
01:40:52.301 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 5>It really is because it forces action.</v>

3534
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:55.150
<v Speaker 2>You can't stall.</v>

3535
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:58.010
<v Speaker 2>You're starting out in a bad position at the end when you go into,</v>

3536
01:40:58.570 --> 01:40:59.770
<v Speaker 2>when you go into the overtime,</v>

3537
01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:01.083
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3538
01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.670
<v Speaker 2>the fights about start and I don't want to interrupt this fight,</v>

3539
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:05.830
<v Speaker 2>this fight we'll talk about,</v>

3540
01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:07.330
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about Dbi afterwards.</v>

3541
01:41:07.331 --> 01:41:10.120
<v Speaker 2>We'll hold please Carlos Condon.</v>

3542
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:12.390
<v Speaker 2>When he came out the Maya shed,</v>

3543
01:41:12.391 --> 01:41:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I have no fuck and I god Damn Dia.</v>

3544
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:19.390
<v Speaker 2>For me it's all about whether Damien Maia this Duh,</v>

3545
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's all about whether or not Damien Maia,</v>

3546
01:41:21.171 --> 01:41:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I can get ahold of him if Damien Maia and get ahold of him.</v>

3547
01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:26.140
<v Speaker 2>He's so big at one 70.</v>

3548
01:41:26.141 --> 01:41:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

3549
01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:29.770
<v Speaker 2>He's so strong in his Jujitsu.</v>

3550
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:31.480
<v Speaker 2>He's so good.</v>

3551
01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:32.613
<v Speaker 2>His Jujitsu,</v>

3552
01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:33.473
<v Speaker 2>so pretty.</v>

3553
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:34.900
<v Speaker 2>When he choked out,</v>

3554
01:41:34.901 --> 01:41:35.734
<v Speaker 2>Neil Magni,</v>

3555
01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching his transition.</v>

3556
01:41:37.061 --> 01:41:37.241
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3557
01:41:37.241 --> 01:41:39.220
<v Speaker 2>this guy is a fucking master.</v>

3558
01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:40.420
<v Speaker 2>He's a master.</v>

3559
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:42.490
<v Speaker 2>But he's the way he's getting the back.</v>

3560
01:41:42.491 --> 01:41:42.611
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3561
01:41:42.611 --> 01:41:43.990
<v Speaker 2>remember when he choked out Rick Story?</v>

3562
01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.090
<v Speaker 2>He just cleans to him like glue,</v>

3563
01:41:46.091 --> 01:41:49.360
<v Speaker 2>drags them in the deep water and sink their boat like that.</v>

3564
01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3565
01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:51.570
<v Speaker 2>he keeps getting better with his Jujitsu.</v>

3566
01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:52.391
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

3567
01:41:52.391 --> 01:41:53.224
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3568
01:41:53.710 --> 01:41:55.750
<v Speaker 2>do you see what dot Donna her wrote about on this week?</v>

3569
01:41:55.770 --> 01:41:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3570
01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:57.393

01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.920

3575
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:03.790
<v Speaker 2>He's probably the best Jujitsu player.</v>

3576
01:42:03.791 --> 01:42:05.110
<v Speaker 2>He has the best MMA,</v>

3577
01:42:05.111 --> 01:42:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

3578
01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:09.060
<v Speaker 2>totally different MMA digit two and a Nogi.</v>

3579
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is just as different as Nogi Jiu Jitsu and gauge Jujitsu.</v>

3580
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:16.300
<v Speaker 2>It's just as different.</v>

3581
01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.310
<v Speaker 2>It's so different when someone is trying to punch you an elbow,</v>

3582
01:42:20.311 --> 01:42:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Lou and everything's all greasy and slippery and slidey.</v>

3583
01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.210
<v Speaker 2>It's so different.</v>

3584
01:42:25.211 --> 01:42:28.990
<v Speaker 2>If you think that's the same as training and the gay,</v>

3585
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:31.450
<v Speaker 2>you're just a man.</v>

3586
01:42:31.930 --> 01:42:32.560
<v Speaker 2>You're a,</v>

3587
01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>

3588
01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:34.953
<v Speaker 2>what to say.</v>

3589
01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're just misinformed.</v>

3590
01:42:36.221 --> 01:42:40.060
<v Speaker 2>But Damian Maia has made that transition,</v>

3591
01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:40.900
<v Speaker 2>not it,</v>

3592
01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:41.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3593
01:42:41.111 --> 01:42:41.800
<v Speaker 2>right away.</v>

3594
01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.290
<v Speaker 2>He was really good at MMA,</v>

3595
01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:45.101
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu right away.</v>

3596
01:42:45.101 --> 01:42:46.660
<v Speaker 2>He was doing some half guard,</v>

3597
01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:47.611
<v Speaker 2>that stuff and,</v>

3598
01:42:47.611 --> 01:42:48.191
<v Speaker 2>and the UFC,</v>

3599
01:42:48.191 --> 01:42:48.821
<v Speaker 2>that was very,</v>

3600
01:42:48.821 --> 01:42:51.010
<v Speaker 2>very effective back in the day,</v>

3601
01:42:51.010 --> 01:42:51.340
<v Speaker 2>years and years ago.</v>

3602
01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:53.560
<v Speaker 2>But even as good as he was,</v>

3603
01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:55.840
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the top guys to make the transition.</v>

3604
01:42:55.841 --> 01:42:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Initially even as good as he was,</v>

3605
01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:59.530
<v Speaker 2>he continued to evolve.</v>

3606
01:42:59.531 --> 01:43:03.280
<v Speaker 2>And as Jujitsu now is better than ever on the ground.</v>

3607
01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.990
<v Speaker 2>But that being said,</v>

3608
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Carlos condit is very good on the ground.</v>

3609
01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Even a Damien Maia does take him down.</v>

3610
01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:11.470
<v Speaker 2>He might not be able to pass Carlos Condit his card.</v>

3611
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:12.820
<v Speaker 2>He might not be able to pass it.</v>

3612
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:18.100
<v Speaker 2>The big dangers in the standup because Carlos throw some nasty elbows and you</v>

3613
01:43:18.101 --> 01:43:21.760
<v Speaker 2>gotta think he stopped Tiago Alvarez recently looked real good and that fight</v>

3614
01:43:21.761 --> 01:43:23.500
<v Speaker 2>stopped him with that stepping in elbow.</v>

3615
01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:24.700
<v Speaker 2>He's nasty dude.</v>

3616
01:43:24.730 --> 01:43:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Very dangerous striker.</v>

3617
01:43:25.991 --> 01:43:27.850
<v Speaker 2>So Damien Maia has got to close that distance.</v>

3618
01:43:28.210 --> 01:43:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I think Damien Maia at one 70 is a different beast.</v>

3619
01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:33.790
<v Speaker 2>He's so God damn big.</v>

3620
01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:38.230
<v Speaker 2>And his striking has got himself to a point where he's not trying to be a</v>

3621
01:43:38.231 --> 01:43:39.550
<v Speaker 2>striker but he's good enough.</v>

3622
01:43:39.551 --> 01:43:41.500
<v Speaker 2>It's tracking that is distance is good.</v>

3623
01:43:41.501 --> 01:43:42.334
<v Speaker 2>See right there.</v>

3624
01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:44.590
<v Speaker 2>His comfort level and his distance are very high.</v>

3625
01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:47.500
<v Speaker 2>So because of that and he's not taking any big chances.</v>

3626
01:43:47.501 --> 01:43:48.610
<v Speaker 2>He's really just kinda like,</v>

3627
01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.061
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3628
01:43:49.061 --> 01:43:49.900
<v Speaker 2>that's what he's doing.</v>

3629
01:43:49.901 --> 01:43:50.171
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3630
01:43:50.171 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 2>They're closing that distance like a fucking</v>

3631
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:52.970
<v Speaker 5>cat.</v>

3632
01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:54.950
<v Speaker 5>Look at that dragon conduct to the ground.</v>

3633
01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:57.860
<v Speaker 5>Let's see what he does here though and he's been able to do this to everybody.</v>

3634
01:43:57.861 --> 01:44:00.500
<v Speaker 5>He fights Matt Brown who is a beast on the ground.</v>

3635
01:44:00.501 --> 01:44:01.334
<v Speaker 5>He did it to him.</v>

3636
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:03.200
<v Speaker 5>He crushed Neil Magni this way.</v>

3637
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:08.120
<v Speaker 5>He's a totally different animal when it comes to like his level of pressure and</v>

3638
01:44:08.121 --> 01:44:08.954
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>

3639
01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:14.140
<v Speaker 5>He's on another planet mean and he is really better at 38 then he's ever been</v>

3640
01:44:15.561 --> 01:44:20.110
<v Speaker 5>before including with is like submissions in his transitions striking you said</v>

3641
01:44:20.690 --> 01:44:22.790
<v Speaker 5>like not just as distance but he could,</v>

3642
01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:24.380
<v Speaker 5>he could get in there and take some fire,</v>

3643
01:44:24.381 --> 01:44:25.940
<v Speaker 5>take some shots and it's no big deal.</v>

3644
01:44:25.950 --> 01:44:27.560
<v Speaker 5>That pass beautiful.</v>

3645
01:44:27.710 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 5>But he's not trying to,</v>

3646
01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.720
<v Speaker 5>so far so good.</v>

3647
01:44:29.721 --> 01:44:30.680
<v Speaker 5>Now he's in top half.</v>

3648
01:44:30.681 --> 01:44:31.420
<v Speaker 5>He Palsy.</v>

3649
01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:32.930
<v Speaker 5>That's a 50 yard pass right there.</v>

3650
01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:34.160
<v Speaker 5>He got into top half.</v>

3651
01:44:34.161 --> 01:44:35.090
<v Speaker 5>He's not totally passed,</v>

3652
01:44:35.091 --> 01:44:35.924
<v Speaker 5>but this is,</v>

3653
01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:38.900
<v Speaker 5>look at this as three quarter mount.</v>

3654
01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:39.470
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

3655
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:40.040
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

3656
01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:40.761
<v Speaker 5>he's in the third now.</v>

3657
01:44:40.761 --> 01:44:45.140
<v Speaker 5>He's got the whole perfect position there to get the back.</v>

3658
01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:45.681
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

3659
01:44:45.681 --> 01:44:48.590
<v Speaker 5>he's so good that the understanding of top half right there,</v>

3660
01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:52.190
<v Speaker 5>that that position as opposed to just regular half guard man.</v>

3661
01:44:52.191 --> 01:44:55.280
<v Speaker 5>When you really understand how important mastering that position is,</v>

3662
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:57.020
<v Speaker 5>that's why he's where he's at right now.</v>

3663
01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:59.260
<v Speaker 5>He had just just have top how he's doing it.</v>

3664
01:44:59.261 --> 01:45:00.230
<v Speaker 5>He's going forward right here.</v>

3665
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:01.700
<v Speaker 5>He's going for right here.</v>

3666
01:45:01.701 --> 01:45:02.380
<v Speaker 5>It's done.</v>

3667
01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:03.130
<v Speaker 5>He's got a condo.</v>

3668
01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:03.740
<v Speaker 5>It's done.</v>

3669
01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:04.460
<v Speaker 5>He's done.</v>

3670
01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:05.900
<v Speaker 5>He's going to choke them out right over his face.</v>

3671
01:45:05.901 --> 01:45:06.734
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

3672
01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:07.911
<v Speaker 5>He's already asleep.</v>

3673
01:45:07.911 --> 01:45:08.241
<v Speaker 5>He's out.</v>

3674
01:45:08.241 --> 01:45:08.571
<v Speaker 5>He's out.</v>

3675
01:45:08.571 --> 01:45:09.320
<v Speaker 5>He's out.</v>

3676
01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:10.153
<v Speaker 5>He's out.</v>

3677
01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:12.290
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3678
01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:13.213
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>

3679
01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:14.180
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3680
01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:16.040
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

3681
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:17.900
<v Speaker 5>Goddamn Carlos Condit.</v>

3682
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:19.220
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

3683
01:45:19.221 --> 01:45:23.600
<v Speaker 5>He went right through them like Marcello Garcia would have to Damien Maia is</v>

3684
01:45:23.601 --> 01:45:24.830
<v Speaker 5>something special.</v>

3685
01:45:25.170 --> 01:45:26.140
<v Speaker 5>He's special.</v>

3686
01:45:27.770 --> 01:45:29.150
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

3687
01:45:29.151 --> 01:45:31.520
<v Speaker 5>A Jujitsu is on a completely different level.</v>

3688
01:45:31.521 --> 01:45:33.260
<v Speaker 5>That's some Hixon Gracie shit right there.</v>

3689
01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:36.320
<v Speaker 5>That's what we always wanted to see from Hixson.</v>

3690
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:38.630
<v Speaker 5>I think I've finally,</v>

3691
01:45:38.631 --> 01:45:39.710
<v Speaker 5>after all these years,</v>

3692
01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.260
<v Speaker 5>he's so adjusted.</v>

3693
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:46.490
<v Speaker 5>He made the transition 100% from the gay to MMA,</v>

3694
01:45:46.491 --> 01:45:47.324
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu,</v>

3695
01:45:47.490 --> 01:45:48.020
<v Speaker 5>MMA.</v>

3696
01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:49.310
<v Speaker 5>He understands that.</v>

3697
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:51.680
<v Speaker 5>The key was we took a bit by bit,</v>

3698
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.760
<v Speaker 5>bit by bit.</v>

3699
01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.530
<v Speaker 5>He takes him down and he's in his guard.</v>

3700
01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.150
<v Speaker 5>He's in his guard right here.</v>

3701
01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:58.400
<v Speaker 5>You know he's in his regular guard right here.</v>

3702
01:45:58.401 --> 01:45:59.630
<v Speaker 5>There's no top half yet,</v>

3703
01:45:59.870 --> 01:46:02.150
<v Speaker 5>but all he was fighting for here.</v>

3704
01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:03.440
<v Speaker 5>What's top half?</v>

3705
01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:04.270
<v Speaker 5>They aren't,</v>

3706
01:46:04.270 --> 01:46:05.103
<v Speaker 5>they're not showing it here.</v>

3707
01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:07.550
<v Speaker 5>All that in between shit that made this possible.</v>

3708
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:10.040
<v Speaker 5>So just listen to it,</v>

3709
01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.180
<v Speaker 5>keeps tightening it up and once he's,</v>

3710
01:46:12.181 --> 01:46:14.570
<v Speaker 5>he knows he's good at school and he's developed,</v>

3711
01:46:14.571 --> 01:46:18.470
<v Speaker 5>he's developed that world class Marcello squeeze right there.</v>

3712
01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:20.390
<v Speaker 5>That takes time to God.</v>

3713
01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:23.360
<v Speaker 5>But when I say barely there while he's tapping,</v>

3714
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:28.450
<v Speaker 5>but the way he got his back was all based on his knowledge of that top half</v>

3715
01:46:30.141 --> 01:46:31.070
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

3716
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:35.810
<v Speaker 5>It was all based on that because he didn't try to pass all at once he passed</v>

3717
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:36.820
<v Speaker 5>halfway,</v>

3718
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:39.680
<v Speaker 5>his leg was still stuck and then he never passed.</v>

3719
01:46:39.710 --> 01:46:40.543
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

3720
01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:42.620
<v Speaker 5>He never passed the fucking guard.</v>

3721
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:46.640
<v Speaker 5>He went from top half and he realized that if you've got a good top hat</v>

3722
01:46:46.641 --> 01:46:47.210
<v Speaker 5>position,</v>

3723
01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:49.010
<v Speaker 5>you could turn while you're facing the,</v>

3724
01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:50.123
<v Speaker 5>it can be.</v>

3725
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.170
<v Speaker 5>It gives up his back.</v>

3726
01:46:52.590 --> 01:46:52.831
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3727
01:46:52.831 --> 01:46:53.191
<v Speaker 5>he did,</v>

3728
01:46:53.191 --> 01:46:53.610
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3729
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:54.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3730
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.480
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

3731
01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.470
<v Speaker 5>Well exactly.</v>

3732
01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:59.740
<v Speaker 5>But he never passed his guard in the sense where he was in regular half guard or</v>

3733
01:46:59.741 --> 01:47:03.600
<v Speaker 5>get the little shield and that he fought for that inside position,</v>

3734
01:47:03.601 --> 01:47:07.770
<v Speaker 5>top half and then from top half as long as that leg that's caught as long as the</v>

3735
01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:08.521
<v Speaker 5>knees free,</v>

3736
01:47:08.521 --> 01:47:09.660
<v Speaker 5>you don't even have to pass the guard.</v>

3737
01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.160
<v Speaker 5>You dry the down.</v>

3738
01:47:11.250 --> 01:47:15.720
<v Speaker 5>Now you're in the three quarter amount and once you're in three quarter mount in</v>

3739
01:47:15.721 --> 01:47:16.710
<v Speaker 5>MMA,</v>

3740
01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.280
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't happen as easily in in grappling without punches,</v>

3741
01:47:20.281 --> 01:47:21.810
<v Speaker 5>but when he's in three quarter amount,</v>

3742
01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:23.520
<v Speaker 5>as soon as you start punching,</v>

3743
01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:25.110
<v Speaker 5>he turns to his back.</v>

3744
01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:26.370
<v Speaker 5>You never pass the guard.</v>

3745
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:27.900
<v Speaker 5>You never got inside control.</v>

3746
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:32.370
<v Speaker 5>You went from top half to three quarter mount to the back.</v>

3747
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:37.430
<v Speaker 5>That's what the punches do so that that pathway becomes so important.</v>

3748
01:47:38.210 --> 01:47:39.043
<v Speaker 5>MMA,</v>

3749
01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:39.991
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu guys,</v>

3750
01:47:39.991 --> 01:47:42.000
<v Speaker 5>that is so huge to understand that.</v>

3751
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:44.730
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you this because we've talked about this before.</v>

3752
01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:49.200
<v Speaker 5>If they did make the back of the head legal like they used to in the old days,</v>

3753
01:47:49.230 --> 01:47:51.000
<v Speaker 5>like when Henzel Gracie fought that guy,</v>

3754
01:47:51.001 --> 01:47:52.050
<v Speaker 5>Ben strikers,</v>

3755
01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:55.710
<v Speaker 5>remember that you thought that judo guy took his bass and just blast them with</v>

3756
01:47:55.711 --> 01:47:56.670
<v Speaker 5>elbows to the back of the head.</v>

3757
01:47:56.671 --> 01:47:59.760
<v Speaker 5>Early battle cage shows where John Lewis would get a guy's back.</v>

3758
01:47:59.910 --> 01:48:00.390
<v Speaker 5>He would just,</v>

3759
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:02.940
<v Speaker 5>he would just put his leg hooks and the guy would be in like in a turtle</v>

3760
01:48:02.941 --> 01:48:03.600
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

3761
01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.790
<v Speaker 5>He did got his legs and rear naked choke.</v>

3762
01:48:05.850 --> 01:48:10.850
<v Speaker 5>I remember saying telling people before they banned those strikes to the back of</v>

3763
01:48:11.881 --> 01:48:12.714
<v Speaker 5>the head.</v>

3764
01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.830
<v Speaker 5>I remember saying rear naked choke are so not important.</v>

3765
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.731
<v Speaker 5>All the,</v>

3766
01:48:17.731 --> 01:48:19.620
<v Speaker 5>what's important is getting the back control,</v>

3767
01:48:19.650 --> 01:48:23.010
<v Speaker 5>putting your leg hooks and getting good at writing and not get slipping up and</v>

3768
01:48:23.011 --> 01:48:24.330
<v Speaker 5>just throwing fucking elbows.</v>

3769
01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:25.770
<v Speaker 5>Rear naked choke is,</v>

3770
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.170
<v Speaker 5>is like if you want to be nice to the guy,</v>

3771
01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:29.160
<v Speaker 5>you don't even need it.</v>

3772
01:48:29.161 --> 01:48:30.330
<v Speaker 5>It's totally optional.</v>

3773
01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:35.570
<v Speaker 5>The the game is getting a guy's back and battering him with your elbows in the</v>

3774
01:48:35.611 --> 01:48:36.360
<v Speaker 5>back of the head.</v>

3775
01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.310
<v Speaker 5>That's how fights were ending instantly,</v>

3776
01:48:38.670 --> 01:48:39.420
<v Speaker 5>instantly.</v>

3777
01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:42.570
<v Speaker 5>If those back of the elbow strikes were legal today,</v>

3778
01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:43.590
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3779
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:45.660
<v Speaker 5>UFC so it'd be a lot shorter.</v>

3780
01:48:45.690 --> 01:48:47.280
<v Speaker 5>They would be bringing in them prelims,</v>

3781
01:48:47.370 --> 01:48:49.410
<v Speaker 5>they would have fucking 17 prelims,</v>

3782
01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:50.521
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3783
01:48:50.521 --> 01:48:55.170
<v Speaker 5>Because if you factor in all the time someone had someone's back and the fight</v>

3784
01:48:55.171 --> 01:48:57.990
<v Speaker 5>didn't end because they weren't allowed to strike,</v>

3785
01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:00.990
<v Speaker 5>there'd be short ass fights everywhere.</v>

3786
01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:05.790
<v Speaker 5>It's true because like I guess like medically it's really dangerous I guess.</v>

3787
01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:07.830
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that kick to the back of the head?</v>

3788
01:49:07.831 --> 01:49:08.281
<v Speaker 5>The same thing.</v>

3789
01:49:08.281 --> 01:49:09.840
<v Speaker 5>No one's jumping up and down to that,</v>

3790
01:49:09.841 --> 01:49:14.100
<v Speaker 5>but also like how much more dangerous is it then getting your eye socket blown</v>

3791
01:49:14.101 --> 01:49:14.370
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>

3792
01:49:14.370 --> 01:49:14.790
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3793
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:17.550
<v Speaker 5>Saw in that Barboza fight or that um,</v>

3794
01:49:17.650 --> 01:49:19.680
<v Speaker 5>Pettis fight with Charles Olivera.</v>

3795
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:22.700
<v Speaker 5>God Damn Damn Maya's,</v>

3796
01:49:22.930 --> 01:49:23.910
<v Speaker 5>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

3797
01:49:24.230 --> 01:49:26.250
<v Speaker 5>This is what we always wanted from Hixson.</v>

3798
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:27.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3799
01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:31.860
<v Speaker 5>We wanted a guy who could do like the kind of Jujitsu that we knew existed out</v>

3800
01:49:31.861 --> 01:49:32.670
<v Speaker 5>there in the world.</v>

3801
01:49:32.670 --> 01:49:34.080
<v Speaker 5>We wanted to see it in MMA.</v>

3802
01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:35.670
<v Speaker 5>Whereas the MMA Jujitsu,</v>

3803
01:49:35.671 --> 01:49:37.350
<v Speaker 5>you'd see like great flashes.</v>

3804
01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.500
<v Speaker 5>Occasionally you get a guy like a chocolate ray or someone who is like real high</v>

3805
01:49:40.501 --> 01:49:42.210
<v Speaker 5>levels fighting in MMA.</v>

3806
01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:47.720
<v Speaker 5>But the highest level expression of it is this guy right now in MMA.</v>

3807
01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3808
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:50.140
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck has got like tighter,</v>

3809
01:49:50.141 --> 01:49:50.974
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

3810
01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:52.510
<v Speaker 3>more worldclass,</v>

3811
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and MMA right now than Damien Maia.</v>

3812
01:49:55.091 --> 01:49:55.211
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3813
01:49:55.211 --> 01:49:56.990
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to argue her rise right up though.</v>

3814
01:49:57.010 --> 01:49:57.520
<v Speaker 3>He's right up.</v>

3815
01:49:57.520 --> 01:49:57.821
<v Speaker 3>Shocker.</v>

3816
01:49:57.821 --> 01:49:57.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3817
01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.540
<v Speaker 3>Could do that.</v>

3818
01:49:58.540 --> 01:49:58.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3819
01:49:58.811 --> 01:49:59.650
<v Speaker 3>So could hodge her.</v>

3820
01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:00.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3821
01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:00.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3822
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3823
01:50:00.431 --> 01:50:01.061
<v Speaker 3>isn't Jack Right?</v>

3824
01:50:01.061 --> 01:50:01.631
<v Speaker 3>One seven years.</v>

3825
01:50:01.631 --> 01:50:02.350
<v Speaker 3>The one 85.</v>

3826
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:03.340
<v Speaker 3>He's one 85.</v>

3827
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3828
01:50:03.850 --> 01:50:05.050
<v Speaker 3>so that's a different way class.</v>

3829
01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3830
01:50:05.770 --> 01:50:06.603
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3831
01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:08.500
<v Speaker 3>that level is just so,</v>

3832
01:50:08.530 --> 01:50:10.390
<v Speaker 3>it's so intense and so extreme.</v>

3833
01:50:10.530 --> 01:50:13.470
<v Speaker 4>It was a lawsuit for Damon MCAS in the beginning.</v>

3834
01:50:13.710 --> 01:50:14.311
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3835
01:50:14.311 --> 01:50:14.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3836
01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:16.830
<v Speaker 4>he knew he came from a solid,</v>

3837
01:50:16.831 --> 01:50:18.900
<v Speaker 4>you get to background was a world champion.</v>

3838
01:50:18.901 --> 01:50:19.780
<v Speaker 4>I think it was in Abu Dhabi.</v>

3839
01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:21.390
<v Speaker 4>He was a elite,</v>

3840
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:22.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3841
01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:25.260
<v Speaker 4>do Jitsu player who got into MMA and right away,</v>

3842
01:50:25.261 --> 01:50:27.540
<v Speaker 4>like most Jujitsu guys and most wrestlers,</v>

3843
01:50:27.541 --> 01:50:29.490
<v Speaker 4>they get into MMA there thinking,</v>

3844
01:50:29.491 --> 01:50:29.821
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

3845
01:50:29.821 --> 01:50:32.970
<v Speaker 4>the worst nightmare is getting taken out in a stretcher.</v>

3846
01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Bye.</v>

3847
01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:34.460
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] like a head kicked.</v>

3848
01:50:34.461 --> 01:50:35.161
<v Speaker 4>That's the worst slammer.</v>

3849
01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:36.360
<v Speaker 4>So let me take care of my striking.</v>

3850
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:37.620
<v Speaker 4>They get involved in a striking,</v>

3851
01:50:37.621 --> 01:50:38.454
<v Speaker 4>and Damien Maia,</v>

3852
01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.710
<v Speaker 4>he got his foot to work together fairly soon and he,</v>

3853
01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:41.910
<v Speaker 4>he was like up there with,</v>

3854
01:50:41.911 --> 01:50:42.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3855
01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:43.740
<v Speaker 4>when he's fighting with Anderson Silva,</v>

3856
01:50:43.741 --> 01:50:44.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3857
01:50:44.011 --> 01:50:46.980
<v Speaker 4>but he obviously wasn't complete as a striker,</v>

3858
01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:48.960
<v Speaker 4>but you can tell he made a lot of improvements,</v>

3859
01:50:48.961 --> 01:50:49.990
<v Speaker 4>but he was still at,</v>

3860
01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:51.480
<v Speaker 4>not a lot of work to do.</v>

3861
01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:52.980
<v Speaker 4>Now what is it?</v>

3862
01:50:53.070 --> 01:50:55.500
<v Speaker 4>Seven years later he stuck with it.</v>

3863
01:50:55.501 --> 01:50:56.334
<v Speaker 4>He didn't quit.</v>

3864
01:50:56.370 --> 01:50:57.203
<v Speaker 4>He stuck with it.</v>

3865
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:58.200
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys,</v>

3866
01:50:58.380 --> 01:50:58.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3867
01:50:58.711 --> 01:50:59.011
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3868
01:50:59.011 --> 01:50:59.370
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3869
01:50:59.370 --> 01:51:01.020
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not knocking them.</v>

3870
01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.030
<v Speaker 4>I understand a lot of guides.</v>

3871
01:51:02.031 --> 01:51:02.761
<v Speaker 4>How did you get to guys?</v>

3872
01:51:02.761 --> 01:51:04.050
<v Speaker 4>They peep into MMA.</v>

3873
01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:05.610
<v Speaker 4>They fuck with it for a year or two,</v>

3874
01:51:05.611 --> 01:51:08.340
<v Speaker 4>three and then like there's way too much.</v>

3875
01:51:08.341 --> 01:51:11.580
<v Speaker 4>I got to walk through too much fire to get where Damien Maia is.</v>

3876
01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:14.970
<v Speaker 4>So it's a lot of top Jiu Jitsu guys would dip in and they'll go,</v>

3877
01:51:14.971 --> 01:51:15.690
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

3878
01:51:15.690 --> 01:51:16.320
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3879
01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:17.730
<v Speaker 4>what do I need to do all this shit for?</v>

3880
01:51:17.731 --> 01:51:19.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm already known as a digital guy.</v>

3881
01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:20.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to teach Jujitsu.</v>

3882
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:25.790
<v Speaker 4>Fuck this MMA shit with Damien Maia did is what only a handful of these world</v>

3883
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:28.110
<v Speaker 4>class you get to play as you're doing.</v>

3884
01:51:28.290 --> 01:51:31.530
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna fucking walking through the fire that keep going and keep going.</v>

3885
01:51:31.530 --> 01:51:35.390
<v Speaker 4>They just fucking don't quit and eventually they become legit strikers.</v>

3886
01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:38.820
<v Speaker 4>Like they got eight years of striking 10 years of striking under their belt.</v>

3887
01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.480
<v Speaker 4>You're a legit striker now you're not just a BJJ world champion.</v>

3888
01:51:42.630 --> 01:51:44.940
<v Speaker 4>Very few stick it out,</v>

3889
01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:45.511
<v Speaker 4>Damian,</v>

3890
01:51:45.511 --> 01:51:47.220
<v Speaker 4>my stuck it out and now man,</v>

3891
01:51:47.221 --> 01:51:48.440
<v Speaker 4>he's got to the point now it's all,</v>

3892
01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:50.220
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like based on his model,</v>

3893
01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:53.520
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like you take a worldclass Jujitsu player and you're taking me wants</v>

3894
01:51:53.521 --> 01:51:53.701
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>

3895
01:51:53.701 --> 01:51:54.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm a mania asks you,</v>

3896
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:55.890
<v Speaker 4>what do you think you'd say,</v>

3897
01:51:55.891 --> 01:51:56.131
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3898
01:51:56.131 --> 01:51:58.920
<v Speaker 4>if you could hang in there for eight solid years,</v>

3899
01:51:58.921 --> 01:52:00.300
<v Speaker 4>no matter how many times you lose,</v>

3900
01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:01.800
<v Speaker 4>you just keep going forward.</v>

3901
01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:02.190
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3902
01:52:02.190 --> 01:52:03.760
<v Speaker 4>that you're going to get shut off a couple of times.</v>

3903
01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:06.690
<v Speaker 4>Try to eliminate that as much as possible and just keep going.</v>

3904
01:52:06.691 --> 01:52:07.620
<v Speaker 4>No matter what happens.</v>

3905
01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:11.370
<v Speaker 4>Just get to the eight year mark and as long as you spent those last eight years,</v>

3906
01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:13.650
<v Speaker 4>B always remaining a student.</v>

3907
01:52:13.650 --> 01:52:14.520
<v Speaker 4>Always learning,</v>

3908
01:52:14.610 --> 01:52:18.300
<v Speaker 4>training your motherfucking ass off in all aspects of the fighting game.</v>

3909
01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.070
<v Speaker 4>Remaining open minded.</v>

3910
01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:23.100
<v Speaker 4>I constantly adding weapons right down to the weapon.</v>

3911
01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:23.790
<v Speaker 4>If you as long,</v>

3912
01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:24.541
<v Speaker 4>no matter what happens,</v>

3913
01:52:24.541 --> 01:52:25.170
<v Speaker 4>win or lose,</v>

3914
01:52:25.170 --> 01:52:26.820
<v Speaker 4>as long as you're in the mix at the round,</v>

3915
01:52:26.821 --> 01:52:27.330
<v Speaker 4>the eight,</v>

3916
01:52:27.330 --> 01:52:27.751
<v Speaker 4>nine,</v>

3917
01:52:27.751 --> 01:52:28.590
<v Speaker 4>10 year mark,</v>

3918
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:30.390
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be fucking Damian.</v>

3919
01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:32.430
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be in that Damien Maia realm right there.</v>

3920
01:52:32.730 --> 01:52:33.660
<v Speaker 4>He figured it out.</v>

3921
01:52:33.690 --> 01:52:36.640
<v Speaker 4>He kept going and now we're talking about Damon minds like that.</v>

3922
01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:38.400
<v Speaker 4>One of the scariest guys out there.</v>

3923
01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:41.190
<v Speaker 4>We weren't doing that as much four or five years ago.</v>

3924
01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:42.210
<v Speaker 4>He stuck it out.</v>

3925
01:52:42.330 --> 01:52:43.920
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't worried about the wins and losses.</v>

3926
01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:45.380
<v Speaker 4>He just kept his down,</v>

3927
01:52:45.381 --> 01:52:47.390
<v Speaker 4>kept grinding bull and look what happened.</v>

3928
01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:48.710
<v Speaker 4>He also completed</v>

3929
01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:48.781
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3930
01:52:48.781 --> 01:52:51.740
<v Speaker 3>he devoted himself to fighting Jujitsu.</v>

3931
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:53.630
<v Speaker 3>Like you didn't try to be a kickboxer anymore,</v>

3932
01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:54.970
<v Speaker 4>just trying to enforce it.</v>

3933
01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:55.900
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu on guys.</v>

3934
01:52:56.010 --> 01:52:56.380
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3935
01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:00.560
<v Speaker 4>he did have that phase where he was trying to but a,</v>

3936
01:53:00.690 --> 01:53:02.700
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at it as a learning,</v>

3937
01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:05.190
<v Speaker 4>that was a perfect thing for him to do and they're like,</v>

3938
01:53:05.191 --> 01:53:09.150
<v Speaker 4>maybe like maybe in 200 years we're going to look back and based on all these</v>

3939
01:53:09.151 --> 01:53:09.990
<v Speaker 4>guys like Damien Meyer,</v>

3940
01:53:09.991 --> 01:53:10.620
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go,</v>

3941
01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:11.190
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3942
01:53:11.190 --> 01:53:15.810
<v Speaker 4>we need three or four fights where you just stand no matter what.</v>

3943
01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:16.620
<v Speaker 4>You're just standing.</v>

3944
01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:19.560
<v Speaker 4>You have to know that you could stand in there if you had to.</v>

3945
01:53:19.561 --> 01:53:20.570
<v Speaker 4>We we got to go to,</v>

3946
01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:23.250
<v Speaker 4>you can't be trying to take a guy down every God damn fight.</v>

3947
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:25.560
<v Speaker 4>You got to walk through the fire winner lose.</v>

3948
01:53:25.561 --> 01:53:26.394
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get caught.</v>

3949
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:27.630
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully you don't get caught.</v>

3950
01:53:27.631 --> 01:53:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully you'd end up being one of those guys that crushes.</v>

3951
01:53:30.031 --> 01:53:30.481
<v Speaker 4>People were like,</v>

3952
01:53:30.481 --> 01:53:30.991
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

3953
01:53:30.991 --> 01:53:31.824
<v Speaker 4>stay stand.</v>

3954
01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:33.030
<v Speaker 4>But you got to walk through that.</v>

3955
01:53:33.031 --> 01:53:33.960
<v Speaker 4>There's an win or lose.</v>

3956
01:53:33.961 --> 01:53:35.070
<v Speaker 4>You got to walk through that.</v>

3957
01:53:35.190 --> 01:53:36.510
<v Speaker 4>You got to stand with everybody.</v>

3958
01:53:36.511 --> 01:53:38.010
<v Speaker 4>You can't be afraid and you got to have,</v>

3959
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:40.110
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what Georgia Gel was going to cause.</v>

3960
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.480
<v Speaker 4>Georgia's hell was one of those guys who's a Jujitsu black belt.</v>

3961
01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.990
<v Speaker 4>He comes in and he fucking doesn't want to go to the ground and he's out there</v>

3962
01:53:45.991 --> 01:53:49.290
<v Speaker 4>in the cage fucking thrown down in these epic wars.</v>

3963
01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:50.151
<v Speaker 4>He wants some,</v>

3964
01:53:50.151 --> 01:53:50.731
<v Speaker 4>he lost some.</v>

3965
01:53:50.731 --> 01:53:51.564
<v Speaker 4>But you know what?</v>

3966
01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:54.390
<v Speaker 4>One thing about Georgia Shell is he,</v>

3967
01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:57.750
<v Speaker 4>he's just a fucking furious.</v>

3968
01:53:57.751 --> 01:53:58.261
<v Speaker 4>He was just,</v>

3969
01:53:58.261 --> 01:53:59.160
<v Speaker 4>he didn't give a shit.</v>

3970
01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:02.430
<v Speaker 4>He had a black belt in Jujitsu and was willing to stand with anybody.</v>

3971
01:54:02.490 --> 01:54:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Some people think that wasn't the best decision.</v>

3972
01:54:04.590 --> 01:54:05.040
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3973
01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:06.780
<v Speaker 4>but he had good kickboxing too though,</v>

3974
01:54:06.810 --> 01:54:10.950
<v Speaker 4>regardless wasn't standing because he wasn't good at Georgia jail is one of</v>

3975
01:54:10.951 --> 01:54:11.311
<v Speaker 4>those guys,</v>

3976
01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:13.500
<v Speaker 4>I think if he would've just kept going at this point,</v>

3977
01:54:13.501 --> 01:54:15.150
<v Speaker 4>you imagine if he would've just kept going,</v>

3978
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.771
<v Speaker 4>Georgia's,</v>

3979
01:54:15.771 --> 01:54:15.900
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3980
01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:17.250
<v Speaker 4>could have been like a Damien Maia.</v>

3981
01:54:17.370 --> 01:54:18.750
<v Speaker 4>He could've been just like that.</v>

3982
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:22.800
<v Speaker 4>But you got to have a man the,</v>

3983
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:25.080
<v Speaker 4>you've got to have the vision to see that shit.</v>

3984
01:54:25.081 --> 01:54:25.914
<v Speaker 4>Cause a lot of guys,</v>

3985
01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:27.540
<v Speaker 4>it's way too much goddamn work.</v>

3986
01:54:27.541 --> 01:54:28.560
<v Speaker 4>Brain damage.</v>

3987
01:54:28.561 --> 01:54:30.340
<v Speaker 4>And I got to kick box fuck kit,</v>

3988
01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:31.193
<v Speaker 4>but I want to get knocked.</v>

3989
01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:32.093
<v Speaker 4>I got shot.</v>

3990
01:54:32.130 --> 01:54:36.240
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's been Brazilian Jiu Jitsu world champions that have tried to do MMA</v>

3991
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:40.380
<v Speaker 4>and do the first five fights or like three shut offs and they're just getting</v>

3992
01:54:40.381 --> 01:54:40.861
<v Speaker 4>crushed.</v>

3993
01:54:40.861 --> 01:54:41.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to name any names.</v>

3994
01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:43.440
<v Speaker 4>That's a good reason to just say,</v>

3995
01:54:43.441 --> 01:54:44.070
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

3996
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:45.540
<v Speaker 4>let me stick with Jujitsu.</v>

3997
01:54:45.570 --> 01:54:46.081
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3998
01:54:46.081 --> 01:54:47.340
<v Speaker 4>There's some all time greats.</v>

3999
01:54:47.370 --> 01:54:47.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4000
01:54:47.850 --> 01:54:48.171
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

4001
01:54:48.171 --> 01:54:48.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4002
01:54:48.421 --> 01:54:52.770
<v Speaker 4>the small time grades who got into Jew from Jujitsu and got an MMA only had one</v>

4003
01:54:52.771 --> 01:54:53.381
<v Speaker 4>or two fights.</v>

4004
01:54:53.381 --> 01:54:53.780
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>

4005
01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:54.200
<v Speaker 4>we were like,</v>

4006
01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:55.060
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah.</v>

4007
01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:55.550
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4008
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:56.281
<v Speaker 4>and you know what?</v>

4009
01:54:56.281 --> 01:54:57.114
<v Speaker 4>I don't blame them.</v>

4010
01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:58.031
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4011
01:54:58.031 --> 01:54:59.090
<v Speaker 4>there's really good look at me.</v>

4012
01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:00.120
<v Speaker 4>I never fucking did.</v>

4013
01:55:00.121 --> 01:55:00.600
<v Speaker 4>MMM.</v>

4014
01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:00.990
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4015
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.591
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4016
01:55:01.591 --> 01:55:02.470
<v Speaker 4>what we were talking about</v>

4017
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:03.403
<v Speaker 3>came to,</v>

4018
01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:05.430
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about women's volleyball.</v>

4019
01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Like it's weird what sports become a hexagon.</v>

4020
01:55:08.670 --> 01:55:10.350
<v Speaker 3>It's weird what sports become,</v>

4021
01:55:10.530 --> 01:55:10.621
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4022
01:55:10.621 --> 01:55:14.280
<v Speaker 3>like a sport where you can make money and which ones don't,</v>

4023
01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:15.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4024
01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:20.480
<v Speaker 3>like it would be wonderful if just submission grappling by itself,</v>

4025
01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:21.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4026
01:55:21.811 --> 01:55:26.811
<v Speaker 3>became a sport where there was a real obvious transition between like amateur</v>

4027
01:55:28.561 --> 01:55:30.930
<v Speaker 3>level to like be in a professional,</v>

4028
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:31.910
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4029
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.991
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4030
01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:32.211
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

4031
01:55:32.211 --> 01:55:35.060
<v Speaker 4>I may like getting a demo or Matt or it had been even wrestling.</v>

4032
01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:35.630
<v Speaker 4>Wrestling.</v>

4033
01:55:35.630 --> 01:55:38.860
<v Speaker 4>How is it that golf is like this super gigantic,</v>

4034
01:55:38.861 --> 01:55:38.961
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4035
01:55:38.961 --> 01:55:39.621
<v Speaker 4>sports.</v>

4036
01:55:39.621 --> 01:55:40.310
<v Speaker 4>The media.</v>

4037
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:41.570
<v Speaker 4>I understand people enjoy it.</v>

4038
01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:42.430
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me wrong.</v>

4039
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:43.263
<v Speaker 4>Who controls,</v>

4040
01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm not</v>

4041
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:44.340
<v Speaker 5>kidding.</v>

4042
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:46.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a distinct golf.</v>

4043
01:55:46.321 --> 01:55:47.430
<v Speaker 5>I know people love that shit,</v>

4044
01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:52.820
<v Speaker 5>but how is that a professional sport but not wrestling like actual wrestling?</v>

4045
01:55:53.970 --> 01:55:56.730
<v Speaker 5>Like can you watch like how difficult it is for actual wrestling?</v>

4046
01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:57.330
<v Speaker 5>Didn't,</v>

4047
01:55:57.330 --> 01:55:57.780
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

4048
01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:58.980
<v Speaker 5>it didn't make it didn't make it.</v>

4049
01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:00.270
<v Speaker 5>What about basketball?</v>

4050
01:56:00.330 --> 01:56:01.163
<v Speaker 5>Basketball made it.</v>

4051
01:56:01.590 --> 01:56:04.680
<v Speaker 5>Basketball guys have mansions and they live in,</v>

4052
01:56:04.681 --> 01:56:05.880
<v Speaker 5>but we're both in the Olympics.</v>

4053
01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:06.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4054
01:56:06.630 --> 01:56:07.170
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

4055
01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:08.190
<v Speaker 5>nobody wants to see you.</v>

4056
01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:09.900
<v Speaker 5>You're only here because we're nice to you.</v>

4057
01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:11.190
<v Speaker 5>I bet if someone got behind Z,</v>

4058
01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:11.610
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4059
01:56:11.610 --> 01:56:13.680
<v Speaker 5>I bet if someone got behind female wrestling,</v>

4060
01:56:13.770 --> 01:56:14.603
<v Speaker 5>I bet.</v>

4061
01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:15.390
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4062
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:16.350
<v Speaker 5>they tried it for a while.</v>

4063
01:56:16.351 --> 01:56:19.680
<v Speaker 5>They had an actual wrestling event with wrestling rules.</v>

4064
01:56:19.681 --> 01:56:20.514
<v Speaker 5>You remember that?</v>

4065
01:56:20.730 --> 01:56:22.080
<v Speaker 5>It was a professional,</v>

4066
01:56:22.081 --> 01:56:24.660
<v Speaker 5>I think they called it real pro wrestling or something like that,</v>

4067
01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:26.130
<v Speaker 5>but it was actual,</v>

4068
01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:26.880
<v Speaker 5>goddammit,</v>

4069
01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.140
<v Speaker 5>see if you can find out.</v>

4070
01:56:28.170 --> 01:56:29.700
<v Speaker 5>It was fairly recently,</v>

4071
01:56:29.701 --> 01:56:31.070
<v Speaker 5>like within the last decade or so.</v>

4072
01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:31.950
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem with,</v>

4073
01:56:32.010 --> 01:56:32.821
<v Speaker 5>with wrestling.</v>

4074
01:56:32.821 --> 01:56:37.821
<v Speaker 5>I see crossing over to the mainstream is the glaring problems in wrestling when</v>

4075
01:56:39.670 --> 01:56:41.580
<v Speaker 5>transitioning and the May in wrestling,</v>

4076
01:56:41.581 --> 01:56:43.800
<v Speaker 5>it's totally okay to give your back.</v>

4077
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:48.830
<v Speaker 5>It's like you give your back to win fights and to prevent losses.</v>

4078
01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:52.760
<v Speaker 5>You give your backs up when you see that and you see two guys wrestling and the</v>

4079
01:56:52.761 --> 01:56:56.430
<v Speaker 5>guys flat on his back or flat on his face and then the guy's on his back.</v>

4080
01:56:57.090 --> 01:56:57.661
<v Speaker 5>We know too,</v>

4081
01:56:57.661 --> 01:56:59.310
<v Speaker 5>we've seen too many UFC is too.</v>

4082
01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:01.110
<v Speaker 5>We just know that is not right.</v>

4083
01:57:01.230 --> 01:57:02.880
<v Speaker 5>But I think if they made,</v>

4084
01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:03.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4085
01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:04.440
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4086
01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:06.600
<v Speaker 5>like a hybrid of wrestling and judo,</v>

4087
01:57:06.630 --> 01:57:08.430
<v Speaker 5>you could call it Gnocchi Judah because,</v>

4088
01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:09.060
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4089
01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:13.170
<v Speaker 5>although wrestling is closer to MMA because it's no gay,</v>

4090
01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:13.771
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4091
01:57:13.771 --> 01:57:16.070
<v Speaker 5>and there's no grabbing clothes and shit that's closer,</v>

4092
01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:17.850
<v Speaker 5>but you aren't given the back.</v>

4093
01:57:17.851 --> 01:57:19.950
<v Speaker 5>So that's fucked up in judo.</v>

4094
01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:21.031
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4095
01:57:21.031 --> 01:57:25.950
<v Speaker 5>It's further away from Mna in the sense that there's a g and a plan tug of war</v>

4096
01:57:25.951 --> 01:57:27.540
<v Speaker 5>with the callers and the sleeves and all that.</v>

4097
01:57:27.570 --> 01:57:30.660
<v Speaker 5>But when they get a takedown in judo,</v>

4098
01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:33.570
<v Speaker 5>they're allowed like 30 seconds on the ground to go for submissions.</v>

4099
01:57:33.690 --> 01:57:35.880
<v Speaker 5>So some guys get really good at arm bars.</v>

4100
01:57:35.881 --> 01:57:36.714
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to,</v>

4101
01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:37.620
<v Speaker 5>it's like extra.</v>

4102
01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:40.470
<v Speaker 5>If you do judo and you never work on arm bars,</v>

4103
01:57:40.471 --> 01:57:41.041
<v Speaker 5>you're fine.</v>

4104
01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:42.720
<v Speaker 5>The most important thing is that front line.</v>

4105
01:57:42.721 --> 01:57:44.640
<v Speaker 5>What's going to happen in that front line?</v>

4106
01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:47.640
<v Speaker 5>The in judo submissions are like gravy.</v>

4107
01:57:47.641 --> 01:57:50.180
<v Speaker 5>You could be good at some guys or get really good at Amr,</v>

4108
01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:53.850
<v Speaker 5>like Shinya Aoki for instance in judo and when he wrestled a nationally in</v>

4109
01:57:53.851 --> 01:57:54.420
<v Speaker 5>Japan,</v>

4110
01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:56.250
<v Speaker 5>he was known as not as the takedown guy.</v>

4111
01:57:56.251 --> 01:57:58.260
<v Speaker 5>All of those take downs are really good obviously because he's a black belt in</v>

4112
01:57:58.261 --> 01:57:58.441
<v Speaker 5>judo,</v>

4113
01:57:58.441 --> 01:58:01.020
<v Speaker 5>but he was known for flying armbars in judo.</v>

4114
01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:02.550
<v Speaker 5>Totally unnecessary.</v>

4115
01:58:02.551 --> 01:58:03.990
<v Speaker 5>That's the rule in judo.</v>

4116
01:58:03.991 --> 01:58:05.220
<v Speaker 5>Like how,</v>

4117
01:58:05.250 --> 01:58:08.970
<v Speaker 5>how quickly do you have to go to a submission once you're scrambling on the</v>

4118
01:58:08.971 --> 01:58:09.271
<v Speaker 5>ground?</v>

4119
01:58:09.271 --> 01:58:11.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't know it specifically or technically,</v>

4120
01:58:11.791 --> 01:58:15.110
<v Speaker 5>all I know is they give you time for submissions than they allow submissions and</v>

4121
01:58:15.111 --> 01:58:16.140
<v Speaker 5>in wrestling they don't.</v>

4122
01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:21.260
<v Speaker 5>But if you combined for the sake of MMA for the sake of creating the ultimate</v>

4123
01:58:21.970 --> 01:58:25.440
<v Speaker 5>takedown system geared directly for him and me,</v>

4124
01:58:25.441 --> 01:58:28.020
<v Speaker 5>I think you would have to go with a no guid judo style.</v>

4125
01:58:28.021 --> 01:58:29.330
<v Speaker 5>Like it's part wrestling part Judah.</v>

4126
01:58:29.331 --> 01:58:32.130
<v Speaker 5>Like you take the rules with oil,</v>

4127
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:37.140
<v Speaker 5>those pants yet and we got the sport and you allow grabbing of the shaft because</v>

4128
01:58:37.141 --> 01:58:38.250
<v Speaker 5>that's more realistic.</v>

4129
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:40.380
<v Speaker 5>You know what in the fuck is this Jamie?</v>

4130
01:58:40.381 --> 01:58:41.214
<v Speaker 5>What are you showing us?</v>

4131
01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:43.890
<v Speaker 3>What are you showing us sites are over on Fox.</v>

4132
01:58:43.891 --> 01:58:44.850
<v Speaker 3>They price which over overdose</v>

4133
01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:48.100
<v Speaker 3>animal video.</v>

4134
01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:48.933
<v Speaker 3>Just put up,</v>

4135
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:49.900
<v Speaker 3>what is this like?</v>

4136
01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:52.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh it's a ferret or something running around this lawn.</v>

4137
01:58:52.810 --> 01:58:54.310
<v Speaker 3>It picked up an egg,</v>

4138
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:55.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4139
01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Take a quick best.</v>

4140
01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:56.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4141
01:58:56.291 --> 01:58:57.010
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

4142
01:58:57.010 --> 01:58:57.371
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4143
01:58:57.371 --> 01:58:58.240
<v Speaker 3>what is Jamie showing me?</v>

4144
01:58:58.241 --> 01:58:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Is this like breaking news?</v>

4145
01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:04.030
<v Speaker 3>There's a date that gets Zika virus written ferret.</v>

4146
01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking when you're talking about the high paid athletes,</v>

4147
01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:06.281
<v Speaker 3>they weren't,</v>

4148
01:59:06.281 --> 01:59:08.230
<v Speaker 3>oh had they haven't always been high paid though.</v>

4149
01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:09.093
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like,</v>

4150
01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:09.970
<v Speaker 3>it's a good question.</v>

4151
01:59:09.970 --> 01:59:10.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a good point there.</v>

4152
01:59:10.841 --> 01:59:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Last 30 years there's been big revenue sharing.</v>

4153
01:59:13.570 --> 01:59:15.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when sports became huge though.</v>

4154
01:59:15.521 --> 01:59:18.080
<v Speaker 3>I know the Yankees were huge back in the day.</v>

4155
01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:20.200
<v Speaker 3>You know the the old time days,</v>

4156
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:22.390
<v Speaker 3>TV money I think is where a lot of it came from.</v>

4157
01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4158
01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:23.510
<v Speaker 3>When did,</v>

4159
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:27.040
<v Speaker 3>when did football become like the biggest thing in the world was in the fifties</v>

4160
01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:27.660
<v Speaker 3>that's when it really hurts.</v>

4161
01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Bloom started in the 50s he's not amazing like 50 years ago.</v>

4162
01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:35.830
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing that the super bowl is only that.</v>

4163
01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:37.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean we would just say 50 years I think.</v>

4164
01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Think 51 or 50 that's incredible.</v>

4165
01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:41.380
<v Speaker 3>55 they're not,</v>

4166
01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:42.640
<v Speaker 3>they're not that deep into it.</v>

4167
01:59:43.330 --> 01:59:46.870
<v Speaker 3>That's really incredible when you think about it cause it seems like inexorable,</v>

4168
01:59:46.871 --> 01:59:49.000
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like he couldn't pull it out of America.</v>

4169
01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Like if you tried to pull football out of America,</v>

4170
01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:55.570
<v Speaker 3>people were like you are in even Mercan it's only been around for like a</v>

4171
01:59:55.571 --> 01:59:57.430
<v Speaker 3>fraction of American baseball is dying,</v>

4172
01:59:57.431 --> 01:59:59.770
<v Speaker 3>but it's making just as much money as it ever has.</v>

4173
02:00:00.190 --> 02:00:04.930
<v Speaker 3>But the problem would flip ball is now we know if Fox your head up,</v>

4174
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:10.470
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure the case is the same or similar with MMA and I'm sure it's the same</v>

4175
02:00:12.401 --> 02:00:17.401
<v Speaker 3>or similar with a lot of different high impact combat sports,</v>

4176
02:00:17.891 --> 02:00:18.461
<v Speaker 3>boxing,</v>

4177
02:00:18.461 --> 02:00:19.330
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing.</v>

4178
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to do it,</v>

4179
02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:23.050
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

4180
02:00:23.250 --> 02:00:25.420
<v Speaker 3>the fact that that's our number one sport.</v>

4181
02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:26.111
<v Speaker 3>It's a sport.</v>

4182
02:00:26.111 --> 02:00:29.080
<v Speaker 3>We know you're getting lit up all the time.</v>

4183
02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Bong dudes or crash into each other.</v>

4184
02:00:31.751 --> 02:00:32.680
<v Speaker 3>Bong.</v>

4185
02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Last time we talked about this,</v>

4186
02:00:34.661 --> 02:00:37.630
<v Speaker 3>some people will send us some videos of like people playing football.</v>

4187
02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:38.510
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

4188
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:40.540
<v Speaker 3>Looked like high level football without pads.</v>

4189
02:00:40.610 --> 02:00:41.443
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4190
02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Cuts going on now,</v>

4191
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:43.363
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4192
02:00:43.530 --> 02:00:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4193
02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:44.553
<v Speaker 3>You can drink,</v>

4194
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:45.900
<v Speaker 3>you will allow him to dress.</v>

4195
02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:46.773
<v Speaker 3>He could drink.</v>

4196
02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4197
02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:48.701
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

4198
02:00:48.701 --> 02:00:49.511
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting man.</v>

4199
02:00:49.511 --> 02:00:52.030
<v Speaker 3>Because I wonder like at what point in time they say,</v>

4200
02:00:52.031 --> 02:00:52.690
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

4201
02:00:52.690 --> 02:00:53.200
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

4202
02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:53.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4203
02:00:53.590 --> 02:00:55.030
<v Speaker 3>it is just a fact of the game.</v>

4204
02:00:55.210 --> 02:00:56.080
<v Speaker 3>People are going to get hurt.</v>

4205
02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Let's just accept the fact.</v>

4206
02:00:58.011 --> 02:00:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

4207
02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:58.470
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4208
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:59.140
<v Speaker 3>Don't want to watch it.</v>

4209
02:00:59.140 --> 02:00:59.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4210
02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:01.710
<v Speaker 3>Let's just accept the fact and uh,</v>

4211
02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:04.240
<v Speaker 3>these gentlemen should get paid a significant amount of money.</v>

4212
02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:05.193
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4213
02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:07.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4214
02:01:07.391 --> 02:01:07.991
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

4215
02:01:07.991 --> 02:01:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just the revenue sharing theirs.</v>

4216
02:01:09.670 --> 02:01:10.870
<v Speaker 3>I just look something up real quick.</v>

4217
02:01:10.871 --> 02:01:11.650
<v Speaker 3>Just really quick.</v>

4218
02:01:11.650 --> 02:01:12.483
<v Speaker 3>Baseball,</v>

4219
02:01:12.570 --> 02:01:17.570
<v Speaker 3>MLB and NFL both are getting over over $3 billion a year that they're sharing</v>

4220
02:01:17.741 --> 02:01:18.640
<v Speaker 3>with their players.</v>

4221
02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:21.310
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how much it is in fighting,</v>

4222
02:01:21.311 --> 02:01:21.910
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4223
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:22.743
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4224
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:24.820
<v Speaker 3>baseball's totally different,</v>

4225
02:01:24.821 --> 02:01:25.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4226
02:01:25.210 --> 02:01:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Because baseball,</v>

4227
02:01:26.081 --> 02:01:26.950
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting hurt.</v>

4228
02:01:27.250 --> 02:01:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Like the football thing is a total,</v>

4229
02:01:29.021 --> 02:01:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean you obviously have the potential to get hurt.</v>

4230
02:01:30.941 --> 02:01:32.320
<v Speaker 3>You definitely get hit by a pitch.</v>

4231
02:01:32.710 --> 02:01:33.491
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>

4232
02:01:33.491 --> 02:01:33.821
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4233
02:01:33.821 --> 02:01:34.331
<v Speaker 3>that was that.</v>

4234
02:01:34.331 --> 02:01:34.750
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4235
02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:35.261
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

4236
02:01:35.261 --> 02:01:35.621
<v Speaker 3>Tony.</v>

4237
02:01:35.621 --> 02:01:37.360
<v Speaker 3>See that guy that died,</v>

4238
02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:38.530
<v Speaker 3>he got hit by a pitch,</v>

4239
02:01:38.531 --> 02:01:39.590
<v Speaker 3>I believe was a,</v>

4240
02:01:39.591 --> 02:01:44.591
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Boston red sox player and he got hit with a pitch and got really badly,</v>

4241
02:01:46.011 --> 02:01:47.570
<v Speaker 3>badly hurt by the pitch.</v>

4242
02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:49.520
<v Speaker 3>Tony Conigliaro.</v>

4243
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:52.840
<v Speaker 3>Is that it clinically Ari or oh or,</v>

4244
02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:54.140
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

4245
02:01:54.770 --> 02:01:56.660
<v Speaker 3>That was a big thing when I was a kid.</v>

4246
02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember thinking,</v>

4247
02:01:57.891 --> 02:01:58.221
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

4248
02:01:58.221 --> 02:01:58.850
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

4249
02:01:58.850 --> 02:02:02.150
<v Speaker 3>you can get that fucked up by a pitch that you're never the same again,</v>

4250
02:02:04.130 --> 02:02:05.450
<v Speaker 3>guys getting hit by fast balls.</v>

4251
02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:06.170
<v Speaker 3>It was no joke.</v>

4252
02:02:06.170 --> 02:02:10.200
<v Speaker 3>And you have to think what kind of helmets did they have at the beginning and</v>

4253
02:02:10.210 --> 02:02:11.360
<v Speaker 3>they have no helmets at all.</v>

4254
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:12.883
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4255
02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:15.320
<v Speaker 3>what kind of helmets did they have in baseball?</v>

4256
02:02:16.890 --> 02:02:18.120
<v Speaker 6>Like a regular,</v>

4257
02:02:18.121 --> 02:02:18.954
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4258
02:02:19.170 --> 02:02:20.940
<v Speaker 6>like they're almost like football helmets now.</v>

4259
02:02:20.941 --> 02:02:21.570
<v Speaker 6>They do.</v>

4260
02:02:21.570 --> 02:02:22.650
<v Speaker 6>But when did they come up with those?</v>

4261
02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:27.210
<v Speaker 6>Not until they made little league baseball players wear them all the time.</v>

4262
02:02:27.211 --> 02:02:28.044
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

4263
02:02:28.190 --> 02:02:28.550
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

4264
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:31.110
<v Speaker 6>I guess they always made professionals wear helmets.</v>

4265
02:02:31.170 --> 02:02:31.770
<v Speaker 6>I got a pizza.</v>

4266
02:02:31.770 --> 02:02:32.630
<v Speaker 6>You guys talked this up?</v>

4267
02:02:32.730 --> 02:02:32.911
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4268
02:02:32.911 --> 02:02:34.110
<v Speaker 6>because then like hockey,</v>

4269
02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:35.270
<v Speaker 6>there's not,</v>

4270
02:02:35.610 --> 02:02:36.340
<v Speaker 6>there was a,</v>

4271
02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:39.210
<v Speaker 6>when I was younger there were players that didn't have to wear helmets and</v>

4272
02:02:39.211 --> 02:02:41.580
<v Speaker 6>there's even guys who wear a face mask.</v>

4273
02:02:41.610 --> 02:02:44.880
<v Speaker 6>I remember that in hockey you had wearing a helmet mount and you are a pussy or</v>

4274
02:02:44.881 --> 02:02:45.241
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

4275
02:02:45.241 --> 02:02:45.451
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4276
02:02:45.451 --> 02:02:46.260
<v Speaker 6>In hockey.</v>

4277
02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:47.610
<v Speaker 6>But then little by little,</v>

4278
02:02:47.670 --> 02:02:48.990
<v Speaker 6>the grandfathered in thing like,</v>

4279
02:02:48.991 --> 02:02:49.350
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

4280
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:50.790
<v Speaker 6>there's got to be a movie about that guy.</v>

4281
02:02:50.791 --> 02:02:54.450
<v Speaker 6>The first guy that wore the helmet and all the persecution he got,</v>

4282
02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.480
<v Speaker 6>he must've fucking,</v>

4283
02:02:57.720 --> 02:02:59.130
<v Speaker 6>he must've had a good excuse.</v>

4284
02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:01.350
<v Speaker 6>He probably had some kind of head trauma were like,</v>

4285
02:03:01.351 --> 02:03:01.531
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

4286
02:03:01.531 --> 02:03:02.430
<v Speaker 6>I gotta wear a helmet.</v>

4287
02:03:02.431 --> 02:03:06.330
<v Speaker 6>One more hit and I'm a vegetable or I'm from in Ohio.</v>

4288
02:03:06.331 --> 02:03:10.660
<v Speaker 6>I think it was the first place in a NHL game that someone died in the crowd</v>

4289
02:03:10.661 --> 02:03:12.420
<v Speaker 6>because the puck came flying into the crowd.</v>

4290
02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:13.620
<v Speaker 6>A little girl died.</v>

4291
02:03:14.250 --> 02:03:15.330
<v Speaker 6>She got hit by a puck.</v>

4292
02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:16.510
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

4293
02:03:16.510 --> 02:03:19.080
<v Speaker 6>that's up all around the outside so it doesn't,</v>

4294
02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:20.220
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't happen anymore.</v>

4295
02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.110
<v Speaker 6>But did it happen every now and then?</v>

4296
02:03:22.530 --> 02:03:24.360
<v Speaker 6>Catching a puck at a game used to be a thing.</v>

4297
02:03:24.361 --> 02:03:29.361
<v Speaker 6>So we're like a foul ball flying in and keep your eyes open because you fucked</v>

4298
02:03:29.491 --> 02:03:30.360
<v Speaker 6>up from foul balls.</v>

4299
02:03:30.361 --> 02:03:32.640
<v Speaker 6>I always wondered that like line drives and showed people,</v>

4300
02:03:32.641 --> 02:03:36.900
<v Speaker 6>I've seen him come flying at people had serious like head trauma.</v>

4301
02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:39.360
<v Speaker 6>Broken bats have come flying into the crowd too.</v>

4302
02:03:39.650 --> 02:03:41.110
<v Speaker 6>Shit flying.</v>

4303
02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:44.350
<v Speaker 6>Anybody get stabbed in the eye with the bat?</v>

4304
02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:45.573
<v Speaker 6>I'll look up a bat.</v>

4305
02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:47.280
<v Speaker 6>That's definitely happened.</v>

4306
02:03:47.730 --> 02:03:48.180
<v Speaker 6>How many,</v>

4307
02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:50.370
<v Speaker 6>how often do people get fucked up at baseball games?</v>

4308
02:03:50.371 --> 02:03:52.800
<v Speaker 6>Like in the audience like foul ball,</v>

4309

<v Speaker 6>foul balls and shit hurt man.</v>

4310
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:56.280
<v Speaker 6>Cause some of them get hurt them.</v>

4311
02:03:56.281 --> 02:03:57.810
<v Speaker 6>The line drive foul balls.</v>

4312
02:03:57.811 --> 02:03:57.961
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4313
02:03:57.961 --> 02:03:59.910
<v Speaker 6>right through someone's fucking forehead.</v>

4314
02:03:59.970 --> 02:04:00.271
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

4315
02:04:00.271 --> 02:04:01.081
<v Speaker 6>And how about bats?</v>

4316
02:04:01.081 --> 02:04:02.010
<v Speaker 6>They get hit with bats.</v>

4317
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:03.420
<v Speaker 6>Bats are real scary.</v>

4318
02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:04.980
<v Speaker 6>Don't blame.</v>

4319
02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:06.720
<v Speaker 6>Don't try to fucking put that evil on me.</v>

4320
02:04:06.721 --> 02:04:08.070
<v Speaker 6>Jamie Barner videos.</v>

4321
02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:09.620
<v Speaker 6>It's just a picture of it,</v>

4322
02:04:09.630 --> 02:04:10.463
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

4323
02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:12.240
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to see it.</v>

4324
02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:13.073
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

4325
02:04:13.130 --> 02:04:15.600
<v Speaker 3>A baseball is a hard fucking rock.</v>

4326
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:18.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a rock with a piece of fucking leather over it.</v>

4327
02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:20.041
<v Speaker 6>They're all dangerous.</v>

4328
02:04:20.041 --> 02:04:23.010
<v Speaker 6>It's just sort of what ads some of the risks and excitement to it that there's</v>

4329
02:04:23.011 --> 02:04:24.300
<v Speaker 6>something bad that can't happen.</v>

4330
02:04:24.650 --> 02:04:25.483
<v Speaker 6>You wouldn't want to get hit</v>

4331
02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:26.850
<v Speaker 3>the head with a soft ball.</v>

4332
02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Fuck a baseball.</v>

4333
02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:31.660
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to get hit in the head with a basketball.</v>

4334
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:33.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4335
02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:33.950
<v Speaker 6>around those flying.</v>

4336
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:36.020
<v Speaker 6>They've jumped into the crowd and land on you and fuck up.</v>

4337
02:04:36.110 --> 02:04:37.290
<v Speaker 6>Not only to your clothes are,</v>

4338
02:04:37.291 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 6>but like they could break</v>

4339
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:39.570
<v Speaker 1>your leg or hurt a person.</v>

4340
02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:40.461
<v Speaker 1>People could.</v>

4341
02:04:40.461 --> 02:04:40.820
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

4342
02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:44.340
<v Speaker 1>we get hit because I'm not stupid and I'm a pussy.</v>

4343
02:04:44.670 --> 02:04:45.061
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4344
02:04:45.061 --> 02:04:45.894
<v Speaker 1>you happy?</v>

4345
02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get hit by a fucking baseball.</v>

4346
02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.860
<v Speaker 1>If I went to a baseball game,</v>

4347
02:04:49.861 --> 02:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like an armored knight out of a shield and shit.</v>

4348
02:04:52.741 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I'd be looking through the shield.</v>

4349
02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:57.690
<v Speaker 1>You walked down when I said it and Columbus where I'm from.</v>

4350
02:04:57.691 --> 02:04:57.961
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>

4351
02:04:57.961 --> 02:05:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it was one of the first times it happened to a hockey puck when flying</v>

4352
02:05:00.811 --> 02:05:02.310
<v Speaker 1>into the crowd and it killed a little girl,</v>

4353
02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:04.470
<v Speaker 1>so they had to start putting nets up around,</v>

4354
02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it started happening when they've extended in baseball.</v>

4355
02:05:07.231 --> 02:05:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Now they're extending the nets where people,</v>

4356
02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:09.671
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy,</v>

4357
02:05:09.671 --> 02:05:10.660
<v Speaker 4>Joe doesn't want me to have that.</v>

4362
02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:13.441

02:06:39.631 --> 02:06:39.811
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

4427
02:06:39.811 --> 02:06:40.381
<v Speaker 4>what's in that?</v>

4428
02:06:40.381 --> 02:06:40.741
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

4429
02:06:40.741 --> 02:06:41.401
<v Speaker 4>wine coolers.</v>

4430
02:06:41.401 --> 02:06:42.540
<v Speaker 4>I just admitted to him like,</v>

4431
02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:43.860
<v Speaker 4>I been drinking,</v>

4432
02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:44.701
<v Speaker 4>I got admitted,</v>

4433
02:06:44.701 --> 02:06:45.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm drunk.</v>

4434
02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:46.200
<v Speaker 4>I started crying.</v>

4435
02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:49.530
<v Speaker 4>I was just crying like a fucking little bitch.</v>

4436
02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:54.680
<v Speaker 4>And then he pulls out my ashtray and there's this all this brown ashy stuff that</v>

4437
02:06:54.811 --> 02:06:56.490
<v Speaker 4>to this day I don't know what it is.</v>

4438
02:06:56.670 --> 02:06:57.720
<v Speaker 4>And he pulls out and goes,</v>

4439
02:06:57.721 --> 02:06:58.554
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>

4440
02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:59.393
<v Speaker 4>I looked at it,</v>

4441
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:02.190
<v Speaker 4>it's weed,</v>

4442
02:07:02.191 --> 02:07:03.180
<v Speaker 4>it's marijuana.</v>

4443
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:04.110
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't,</v>

4444
02:07:04.111 --> 02:07:06.300
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't even know what weed and marijuana look like.</v>

4445
02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:07.433
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know.</v>

4446
02:07:07.530 --> 02:07:08.220
<v Speaker 4>But he goes,</v>

4447
02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:09.490
<v Speaker 4>that's read and marijuana go.</v>

4448
02:07:09.491 --> 02:07:09.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4449
02:07:09.930 --> 02:07:11.050
<v Speaker 4>it's weed and marijuana.</v>

4450
02:07:11.051 --> 02:07:11.884
<v Speaker 4>It's his.</v>

4451
02:07:12.330 --> 02:07:13.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm crying,</v>

4452
02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:14.790
<v Speaker 4>throwing my friend under the bus.</v>

4453
02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:18.510
<v Speaker 4>And it was obviously not weed and there's the,</v>

4454
02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:20.093
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

4455
02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:20.491
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4456
02:07:20.491 --> 02:07:22.140
<v Speaker 4>Some kind of some kind of ash.</v>

4457
02:07:22.290 --> 02:07:23.340
<v Speaker 4>I was so stupid.</v>

4458
02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:24.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm crying in the meeting.</v>

4459
02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:25.021
<v Speaker 4>Even the cops,</v>

4460
02:07:25.021 --> 02:07:25.260
<v Speaker 4>guests,</v>

4461
02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:25.921
<v Speaker 4>I've been drinking.</v>

4462
02:07:25.921 --> 02:07:26.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm drunk,</v>

4463
02:07:26.650 --> 02:07:27.483
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4464
02:07:27.570 --> 02:07:28.620
<v Speaker 4>That's marijuana.</v>

4465
02:07:28.710 --> 02:07:29.820
<v Speaker 4>And he's sitting there thinking,</v>

4466
02:07:30.090 --> 02:07:31.290
<v Speaker 4>that's not marijuana.</v>

4467
02:07:31.291 --> 02:07:33.000
<v Speaker 4>But he's saying it's marijuana.</v>

4468
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:35.010
<v Speaker 4>They were confused.</v>

4469
02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:35.920
<v Speaker 4>You know what they did?</v>

4470
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:38.080
<v Speaker 2>They said getting your car and go home.</v>

4471
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:41.290
<v Speaker 2>They didn't arrest me or anything.</v>

4472
02:07:41.650 --> 02:07:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

4473
02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:42.581
<v Speaker 2>getting your car.</v>

4474
02:07:42.581 --> 02:07:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

4475
02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I confessed everything.</v>

4476
02:07:45.731 --> 02:07:46.990
<v Speaker 2>I confess too much.</v>

4477
02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:48.100
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what to do with it.</v>

4478
02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I told them I was drinking and drunk and they let me go.</v>

4479
02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:56.560
<v Speaker 2>You told them that something wasn't pot or it was pot when it was a pot and they</v>

4480
02:07:56.561 --> 02:07:57.940
<v Speaker 2>knew it wasn't pot and I'm like crying.</v>

4481
02:07:57.941 --> 02:07:58.774
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

4482
02:07:59.890 --> 02:08:01.120
<v Speaker 2>It's weed.</v>

4483
02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:02.180
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>

4484
02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:03.013
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4485
02:08:03.290 --> 02:08:06.100
<v Speaker 2>we just saw you and saw just a gang of paperwork.</v>

4486
02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4487
02:08:06.970 --> 02:08:08.020
<v Speaker 2>this is too much work.</v>

4488
02:08:08.190 --> 02:08:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Let me drive,</v>

4489
02:08:09.521 --> 02:08:10.354
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

4490
02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:11.590
<v Speaker 2>They let me drive.</v>

4491
02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:12.970
<v Speaker 2>They were so confused.</v>

4492
02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:17.130
<v Speaker 2>I told them I was drunk and they let a 16 year old boy drive home.</v>

4493
02:08:17.710 --> 02:08:18.451
<v Speaker 2>Did they follow you?</v>

4494
02:08:18.451 --> 02:08:20.560
<v Speaker 2>That was the coolest cop ever.</v>

4495
02:08:20.590 --> 02:08:21.423
<v Speaker 2>Did they follow you?</v>

4496
02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4497
02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking drove home.</v>

4498
02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:26.110
<v Speaker 2>That's that Peter Parker Spiderman thing though.</v>

4499
02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Like what if a cop lets you go and you kill somebody?</v>

4500
02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:30.250
<v Speaker 2>You know and you know that story.</v>

4501
02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:32.523
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4502
02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:36.100
<v Speaker 2>it's really fascinating because I'm sure Joseph Campbell would say that it's in</v>

4503
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:38.980
<v Speaker 2>one of those heroes journeys that,</v>

4504
02:08:38.981 --> 02:08:39.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4505
02:08:39.101 --> 02:08:39.310
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4506
02:08:39.310 --> 02:08:39.600
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4507
02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:40.331
<v Speaker 2>he talks about,</v>

4508
02:08:40.331 --> 02:08:41.790
<v Speaker 2>but in Spiderman,</v>

4509
02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Peter Parker,</v>

4510
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:48.340
<v Speaker 2>who's this scientist kid gets bitten by this radioactive spider and he gains the</v>

4511
02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:53.380
<v Speaker 2>superpowers and he sort of realized that he gains these superpowers and he's</v>

4512
02:08:53.831 --> 02:08:57.010
<v Speaker 2>headed towards his,</v>

4513
02:08:57.011 --> 02:08:57.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4514
02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:00.340
<v Speaker 2>w was his grandparents that he lived with,</v>

4515
02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:03.130
<v Speaker 2>or his aunt and his uncle was his aunt and his uncle.</v>

4516
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:04.870
<v Speaker 2>And they took,</v>

4517
02:09:04.871 --> 02:09:06.070
<v Speaker 2>they were taking care of them.</v>

4518
02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:07.031
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4519
02:09:07.031 --> 02:09:11.740
<v Speaker 2>along the way he ran into some robber and he let the Robert go cause he's like,</v>

4520
02:09:11.741 --> 02:09:13.120
<v Speaker 2>this is a story of Spiderman.</v>

4521
02:09:13.150 --> 02:09:13.441
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4522
02:09:13.441 --> 02:09:13.751
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4523
02:09:13.751 --> 02:09:15.040
<v Speaker 2>this is not my business.</v>

4524
02:09:15.110 --> 02:09:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4525
02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:18.310
<v Speaker 2>The robber kills his uncle.</v>

4526
02:09:19.330 --> 02:09:22.750
<v Speaker 2>So he had the opportunity to stop the Robert and he didn't do anything and his</v>

4527
02:09:22.751 --> 02:09:23.650
<v Speaker 2>uncle died.</v>

4528
02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:27.370
<v Speaker 2>And so now he takes care of his aunt and he's fucking Spiderman.</v>

4529
02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:28.780
<v Speaker 2>He's pissed.</v>

4530
02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:30.340
<v Speaker 2>So he puts a mask on.</v>

4531
02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:35.090
<v Speaker 2>He uses his powers now and stops crime all around golf.</v>

4532
02:09:35.110 --> 02:09:35.861
<v Speaker 2>And that makes sense.</v>

4533
02:09:35.861 --> 02:09:37.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's why he's obsessed with New York.</v>

4534
02:09:37.390 --> 02:09:37.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4535
02:09:37.601 --> 02:09:37.871
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

4536
02:09:37.871 --> 02:09:38.560
<v Speaker 2>my fault,</v>

4537
02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:39.393
<v Speaker 2>my fault,</v>

4538
02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:41.530
<v Speaker 2>all my fault.</v>

4539
02:09:41.710 --> 02:09:43.450
<v Speaker 2>If I had only stopped him when I could have,</v>

4540
02:09:43.451 --> 02:09:44.171
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't.</v>

4541
02:09:44.171 --> 02:09:48.100
<v Speaker 2>And now my uncle Ben is dead and I didn't know the backstory.</v>

4542
02:09:48.370 --> 02:09:48.731
<v Speaker 2>I hate,</v>

4543
02:09:48.731 --> 02:09:49.480
<v Speaker 2>you know me.</v>

4544
02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I've said it several times.</v>

4545
02:09:50.471 --> 02:09:53.530
<v Speaker 2>I hate super hero movies.</v>

4546
02:09:53.531 --> 02:09:54.670
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking stand him.</v>

4547
02:09:54.671 --> 02:09:55.504
<v Speaker 2>But guess what?</v>

4548
02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:56.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm addicted to Gotham.</v>

4549
02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Fucking love the backstory of that man.</v>

4550
02:09:58.930 --> 02:09:59.201
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

4551
02:09:59.201 --> 02:09:59.921

4552
02:09:59.921 --> 02:10:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen it?</v>

4553
02:10:00.610 --> 02:10:00.891
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4554
02:10:00.891 --> 02:10:01.601
<v Speaker 2>it was at a show.</v>

4555
02:10:01.601 --> 02:10:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Is it a Netflix show?</v>

4556
02:10:02.710 --> 02:10:03.401
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4557
02:10:03.401 --> 02:10:04.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared dude.</v>

4558
02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:07.680
<v Speaker 2>It's the backstory of Batman.</v>

4559
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Batman as a kid.</v>

4560
02:10:09.570 --> 02:10:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that time.</v>

4561
02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh it's so good.</v>

4562
02:10:11.730 --> 02:10:12.040

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

02:11:11.901 --> 02:11:12.734

4602
02:11:12.810 --> 02:11:13.880
<v Speaker 4>you were telling me this.</v>

4603
02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:19.060
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if you lived in a world that looked like those fucking Batman movies</v>

4604
02:11:20.181 --> 02:11:25.181
<v Speaker 4>look like all gray and gloomy and they're trying to make it super realistic.</v>

4605
02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:27.080
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to like,</v>

4606
02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:28.550
<v Speaker 4>like how are these guys,</v>

4607
02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:32.690
<v Speaker 4>how do they end up in these fucking tights and these outfits,</v>

4608
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:36.640
<v Speaker 4>they're showing how it's happening in the in crime and the show.</v>

4609
02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:38.630
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying is when you watch those movies,</v>

4610
02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:39.740
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to make it believable.</v>

4611
02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:40.491
<v Speaker 4>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

4612
02:11:40.491 --> 02:11:42.800
<v Speaker 4>It's always like gloomy and dark and black.</v>

4613
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:44.720
<v Speaker 4>Like if you lived in that world.</v>

4614
02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:45.250
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

02:11:45.641 --> 02:11:47.180
<v Speaker 4>What kind of happiness do you think you,</v>

4617
02:11:47.210 --> 02:11:49.240
<v Speaker 4>what level of happiness do you think people would find it?</v>

4618
02:11:49.250 --> 02:11:50.570
<v Speaker 4>A world where it never got sunny.</v>

4619
02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:51.680
<v Speaker 4>It's all shot like that too.</v>

4620
02:11:51.681 --> 02:11:52.820
<v Speaker 4>It's all like real.</v>

4621
02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.160
<v Speaker 4>It's like game of Thrones production.</v>

4622
02:11:55.161 --> 02:11:55.980
<v Speaker 4>The lighting is,</v>

4623
02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:57.800
<v Speaker 4>every shot is magical.</v>

4624
02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:01.010
<v Speaker 4>It isn't like when you watch like the office and shit about the shot,</v>

4625
02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:01.611

02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:03.253
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

4628
02:12:03.330 --> 02:12:04.100
<v Speaker 4>the lighting,</v>

4629
02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:05.810
<v Speaker 4>not like game of Thrones style,</v>

4630
02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:06.940
<v Speaker 4>like they're trying to make it look,</v>

4631
02:12:07.150 --> 02:12:07.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't have,</v>

4632

4633
02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:11.330
<v Speaker 4>epic's not as much of a feature that's epic.</v>

4634
02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:12.290
<v Speaker 4>Like every shot,</v>

4635
02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:14.060
<v Speaker 4>they spend a lot of time on the,</v>

4636
02:12:14.210 --> 02:12:15.043
<v Speaker 4>on the lighting.</v>

4637
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.883
<v Speaker 4>It's re shot.</v>

02:13:48.391 --> 02:13:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he called in and I was there,</v>

4715
02:13:49.770 --> 02:13:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I forget how it worked.</v>

4716
02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:51.660
<v Speaker 2>I forget what you think.</v>

4717
02:13:51.661 --> 02:13:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Michio Kaku smokes.</v>

4718
02:13:52.590 --> 02:13:53.850
<v Speaker 2>Wade negative.</v>

4719
02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:54.713
<v Speaker 2>Negative sir.</v>

4720
02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Negative does not do any drugs.</v>

4721
02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:57.313
<v Speaker 2>Cause I said to him,</v>

4722
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:59.010
<v Speaker 2>you asked him about psychedelics?</v>

4723
02:13:59.011 --> 02:13:59.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4724
02:13:59.161 --> 02:13:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4725
02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:01.080
<v Speaker 2>I asked him about mushrooms.</v>

4726
02:14:01.081 --> 02:14:01.501
<v Speaker 2>He said well,</v>

4727
02:14:01.501 --> 02:14:02.870
<v Speaker 2>we're not trying to uh,</v>

4728
02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.280
<v Speaker 2>give ourselves brain damage.</v>

4729
02:14:04.281 --> 02:14:05.310
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to get smarter.</v>

4730
02:14:05.490 --> 02:14:06.323
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those like,</v>

4731
02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:07.140
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>

4732
02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:10.680
<v Speaker 2>that guy is like a paid science educator.</v>

4733
02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4734
02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:11.401
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

4735
02:14:11.401 --> 02:14:15.720
<v Speaker 2>What he does is try to spread science all over the world and when you're in that</v>

4736
02:14:15.721 --> 02:14:18.180
<v Speaker 2>realm you need funding for stuff.</v>

4737
02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:21.570
<v Speaker 2>You need people to greenlight your TV projects.</v>

4738
02:14:21.571 --> 02:14:26.070
<v Speaker 2>You've got to avoid criticism at all costs and any,</v>

4739
02:14:26.970 --> 02:14:31.970
<v Speaker 2>anytime your saying that it's probably a good idea to do certain drugs.</v>

4740
02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:34.500
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4741
02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:35.333
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

4742
02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:36.330
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

4743
02:14:36.330 --> 02:14:39.000
<v Speaker 2>that you can't say yes if you do mushrooms.</v>

4744
02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:39.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4745
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:43.200
<v Speaker 2>it's very possible that you might be in contact with entities from other</v>

4746
02:14:43.201 --> 02:14:45.420
<v Speaker 2>dimensions for which to be dead.</v>

4747
02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:47.430
<v Speaker 2>If he did do me probably wouldn't said,</v>

4748
02:14:47.490 --> 02:14:47.671
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4749
02:14:47.671 --> 02:14:48.570
<v Speaker 2>he's probably what?</v>

4750
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Almost anybody who's really smart who does like a dose of DMT comes back and</v>

4751
02:14:54.601 --> 02:14:54.751
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

4752
02:14:54.751 --> 02:14:54.991
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4753
02:14:54.991 --> 02:14:56.820
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that all about?</v>

4754
02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:57.511
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

4755
02:14:57.511 --> 02:14:59.660
<v Speaker 2>He was in this amazing documentary,</v>

4756
02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:03.210
<v Speaker 2>just a fucking life changing documentary called the principal.</v>

4757
02:15:03.211 --> 02:15:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that?</v>

4758
02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:03.961
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4759
02:15:03.961 --> 02:15:04.794
<v Speaker 2>I have not.</v>

4760
02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:05.551
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

4761
02:15:05.551 --> 02:15:06.630
<v Speaker 2>And Kokkos in it,</v>

4762
02:15:06.631 --> 02:15:07.680
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of physicists,</v>

4763
02:15:07.681 --> 02:15:09.480
<v Speaker 2>like professors from Mit.</v>

4764
02:15:09.630 --> 02:15:11.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just a bunch of dudes and like route,</v>

4765
02:15:11.371 --> 02:15:12.690
<v Speaker 2>like religious scientists too.</v>

4766
02:15:12.690 --> 02:15:13.900
<v Speaker 2>They have like two or three of that.</v>

4767
02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:15.740
<v Speaker 2>And the reason it's 10,</v>

4768
02:15:15.741 --> 02:15:16.531
<v Speaker 2>it's called the principal.</v>

4769
02:15:16.531 --> 02:15:17.161
<v Speaker 2>Is it recent?</v>

4770
02:15:17.161 --> 02:15:17.994
<v Speaker 2>Two years.</v>

4771
02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:18.701
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4772
02:15:18.701 --> 02:15:18.811
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4773
02:15:18.811 --> 02:15:19.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4774
02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:23.280
<v Speaker 2>it's just like 10 dude's like a navigation expert,</v>

4775
02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:25.890
<v Speaker 2>physicist Michio Kaku.</v>

4776
02:15:25.891 --> 02:15:27.330
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll just go on back and forth,</v>

4777
02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:27.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4778
02:15:27.811 --> 02:15:31.470
<v Speaker 2>all these astrophysicists and cosmologists and she'd gone back and forth,</v>

4779
02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:32.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4780
02:15:32.100 --> 02:15:32.970
<v Speaker 2>discussing,</v>

4781
02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:34.313
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4782
02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:37.650
<v Speaker 2>space and they give you a timeline.</v>

4783
02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:39.870
<v Speaker 2>It's an awesome high end document.</v>

4784
02:15:39.871 --> 02:15:44.871
<v Speaker 2>They give you a timeline of why we believe what we believe about space and shit.</v>

4785
02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it is,</v>

4786
02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:51.390
<v Speaker 2>it will melt your fucking brain.</v>

4787
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Do the craziest shit.</v>

4788
02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of the cosmic microwave background?</v>

4789
02:15:56.250 --> 02:15:59.670
<v Speaker 2>You know what that is the noise that they indicate that they,</v>

4790
02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:01.280
<v Speaker 2>it indicates the Big Bang.</v>

4791
02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:04.950
<v Speaker 2>It's the afterglow of the big bang.</v>

4792
02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:06.630
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>

4793
02:16:06.631 --> 02:16:06.811
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

4794
02:16:06.811 --> 02:16:09.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is what we called the afterglow radiation.</v>

4795
02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:11.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like the big bang.</v>

4796
02:16:11.671 --> 02:16:15.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like the radiation rounds left over after the big bank.</v>

4797
02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck that means.</v>

4798
02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>

4799
02:16:18.650 --> 02:16:20.400
<v Speaker 2>But when you start going on about that,</v>

4800
02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:22.230
<v Speaker 2>I get lost in the mix.</v>

4801
02:16:22.290 --> 02:16:23.760
<v Speaker 2>But the crazy thing about it though,</v>

4802
02:16:23.790 --> 02:16:24.810
<v Speaker 2>this is the crazy thing about,</v>

4803
02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:26.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know shit about that.</v>

4804
02:16:26.221 --> 02:16:28.590
<v Speaker 2>All I do is just watch them space documentaries were fed.</v>

4805
02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:30.100
<v Speaker 2>I used to be addicted at space</v>

4806
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:30.933
<v Speaker 4>documentaries.</v>

4807
02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.310
<v Speaker 4>And then when you watch this documentary,</v>

4808
02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:37.870
<v Speaker 4>you're fine and you find out why we believe what we believe and the,</v>

4809
02:16:37.890 --> 02:16:38.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4810
02:16:38.141 --> 02:16:39.550
<v Speaker 4>the timeline of,</v>

4811
02:16:39.551 --> 02:16:40.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4812
02:16:40.010 --> 02:16:42.460
<v Speaker 4>a taller may to Copernicus,</v>

4813
02:16:42.610 --> 02:16:43.570
<v Speaker 4>to Kepler,</v>

4814
02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:45.230
<v Speaker 4>to Galileo and all that,</v>

4815
02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:45.670
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4816
02:16:45.670 --> 02:16:45.870
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4817
02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:48.660
<v Speaker 4>that timeline of what people thought and believe in everywhere.</v>

4818
02:16:48.670 --> 02:16:52.920
<v Speaker 4>It was always a battle of all of these astronomers study and the,</v>

4819
02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:54.340
<v Speaker 4>the lights in the sky,</v>

4820
02:16:54.341 --> 02:16:56.140
<v Speaker 4>that's all they saw was the lights in the sky.</v>

4821
02:16:56.290 --> 02:16:57.010
<v Speaker 4>Stunning goes,</v>

4822
02:16:57.010 --> 02:16:58.090
<v Speaker 4>everything goes this way,</v>

4823
02:16:58.091 --> 02:16:59.680
<v Speaker 4>except those wandering stars.</v>

4824
02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:02.140
<v Speaker 4>And then they figured out those wandering stars were planets.</v>

4825
02:17:02.141 --> 02:17:02.801
<v Speaker 4>And then from there I'll go,</v>

4826
02:17:02.801 --> 02:17:03.400
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4827
02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:04.151
<v Speaker 4>those are the plants,</v>

4828
02:17:04.151 --> 02:17:06.910
<v Speaker 4>because they're the only ones that are on their own course.</v>

4829
02:17:07.150 --> 02:17:08.590
<v Speaker 4>So they're all trying to figure out,</v>

4830
02:17:08.890 --> 02:17:12.820
<v Speaker 4>is the universe spinning around us or are we spin around universe?</v>

4831
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.040
<v Speaker 4>That's always the fucking at,</v>

4832
02:17:15.041 --> 02:17:15.970
<v Speaker 4>it's always been,</v>

4833
02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:17.530
<v Speaker 4>we think like,</v>

4834
02:17:17.530 --> 02:17:18.610
<v Speaker 4>like I always thought,</v>

4835
02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:19.001
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4836
02:17:19.001 --> 02:17:19.570
<v Speaker 4>they're dumb.</v>

4837
02:17:19.570 --> 02:17:24.280
<v Speaker 4>Back then they thought they thought the world was the center of the universe and</v>

4838
02:17:24.281 --> 02:17:25.060
<v Speaker 4>all that shit.</v>

4839
02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:26.110
<v Speaker 4>And you look back at that,</v>

4840
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:27.730
<v Speaker 4>you don't really look into,</v>

4841
02:17:27.850 --> 02:17:29.980
<v Speaker 4>unless you know the actual timeline.</v>

4842
02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:30.761
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

4843
02:17:30.761 --> 02:17:33.940
<v Speaker 4>Hearing all these scientists going back to the and you hear them explaining</v>

4844
02:17:34.210 --> 02:17:34.661
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

4845
02:17:34.661 --> 02:17:35.890
<v Speaker 4>how it all went down.</v>

4846
02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:36.550
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

4847
02:17:36.550 --> 02:17:38.140
<v Speaker 4>once you go through that whole,</v>

4848
02:17:38.350 --> 02:17:41.720
<v Speaker 4>the whole story of what we think about space and all that,</v>

4849
02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:43.690
<v Speaker 4>they tell you,</v>

4850
02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:47.290
<v Speaker 4>they tell you we don't know shit.</v>

4851
02:17:47.590 --> 02:17:50.690
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at a bunch of lights and the Goddamn sky.</v>

4852
02:17:50.970 --> 02:17:55.900
<v Speaker 4>You're going to tell me that that light and that light that's 200 and 5,000</v>

4853
02:17:55.901 --> 02:17:57.490
<v Speaker 4>trillion light years away.</v>

4854
02:17:57.790 --> 02:18:00.450
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck did you figure that out and you learn?</v>

4855
02:18:00.490 --> 02:18:02.020
<v Speaker 4>Don't they have an explanation for that shit?</v>

4856
02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:02.381
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4857
02:18:02.381 --> 02:18:03.041
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

4858
02:18:03.041 --> 02:18:05.350
<v Speaker 4>That's what every what you just said right now.</v>

4859
02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Now's what everyone's natural reaction because anytime someone says anything</v>

4860
02:18:09.701 --> 02:18:10.810
<v Speaker 4>about space,</v>

4861
02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:15.190
<v Speaker 4>you automatically think someone figured it out.</v>

4862
02:18:15.250 --> 02:18:16.600
<v Speaker 4>You don't know the guy's name.</v>

4863
02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:18.280
<v Speaker 4>You don't know the name of the experiment.</v>

4864
02:18:18.370 --> 02:18:19.930
<v Speaker 4>You didn't look into it yourself.</v>

4865
02:18:19.931 --> 02:18:23.830
<v Speaker 4>You just think when someone tells you how far is the earth from the sun?</v>

4866
02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:24.131
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4867
02:18:24.131 --> 02:18:24.964
<v Speaker 4>say Oh,</v>

4868
02:18:25.390 --> 02:18:27.430
<v Speaker 4>93 million miles away.</v>

4869
02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:28.473
<v Speaker 4>Like you just,</v>

4870
02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:28.970
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4871
02:18:28.970 --> 02:18:29.530
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4872
02:18:29.530 --> 02:18:34.530
<v Speaker 4>everybody relies on someone figured that out and someone double checked it.</v>

4873
02:18:36.130 --> 02:18:36.401
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

4874
02:18:36.401 --> 02:18:37.240
<v Speaker 4>it's math.</v>

4875
02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:38.230
<v Speaker 4>It's science.</v>

4876
02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:38.890
<v Speaker 4>It's math.</v>

4877
02:18:38.890 --> 02:18:42.630
<v Speaker 4>But no one really knows you're going on what you read and whatever hits you for</v>

4878
02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:42.960
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

4879
02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:43.810
<v Speaker 4>No one like that.</v>

4880
02:18:43.811 --> 02:18:44.680
<v Speaker 4>We're talking to you.</v>

4881
02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:46.133
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to buy.</v>

4882
02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:47.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4883
02:18:47.350 --> 02:18:50.140
<v Speaker 4>if I told you if I told you right now,</v>

4884
02:18:50.141 --> 02:18:51.760
<v Speaker 4>logical method of measurement.</v>

4885
02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:52.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4886
02:18:52.540 --> 02:18:53.570
<v Speaker 4>Like yeah.</v>

4887
02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:55.600
<v Speaker 4>Like you figured someone figured that out.</v>

4888
02:18:55.630 --> 02:18:55.811
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4889
02:18:55.811 --> 02:18:56.081
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4890
02:18:56.081 --> 02:18:59.110
<v Speaker 4>I just assumed that if there's a bunch of guys that are trying to figure out how</v>

4891
02:18:59.111 --> 02:19:01.310
<v Speaker 4>to get to the moon and back Marza back,</v>

4892
02:19:01.330 --> 02:19:03.730
<v Speaker 4>and I said of these rovers around that are shooting video back.</v>

4893
02:19:03.850 --> 02:19:05.020
<v Speaker 4>They know how many miles it is.</v>

4894
02:19:05.050 --> 02:19:05.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4895
02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:06.970
<v Speaker 4>They've got it figured out.</v>

4896
02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:09.370
<v Speaker 4>I just don't know what the method they use.</v>

4897
02:19:09.371 --> 02:19:10.540
<v Speaker 4>Someone figured it out.</v>

4898
02:19:10.570 --> 02:19:11.530
<v Speaker 4>You don't know the guy's name.</v>

4899
02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:15.490
<v Speaker 4>There's names of experiments like you could actually look in and you look at,</v>

4900
02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:18.730
<v Speaker 4>there was an experiment called the Michelson Morley experiment.</v>

4901
02:19:18.910 --> 02:19:21.040
<v Speaker 4>They tried to prove that the earth was moving.</v>

4902
02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:21.790
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

4903
02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:22.241
<v Speaker 4>so they,</v>

4904
02:19:22.241 --> 02:19:22.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4905
02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:23.230
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4906
02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:27.560
<v Speaker 4>they assumed that the space is filled with an ether.</v>

4907
02:19:27.620 --> 02:19:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what dark matter maybe is dark energy.</v>

4908
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.823
<v Speaker 4>There's an ether.</v>

4909
02:19:30.890 --> 02:19:32.240
<v Speaker 4>So it's like measure,</v>

4910
02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:32.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4911
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:37.700
<v Speaker 4>the light waves going through the ether as it hits the Earth.</v>

4912
02:19:37.701 --> 02:19:41.780
<v Speaker 4>And then we'll measure it back and we'll be able to tell if there's an ether</v>

4913
02:19:41.781 --> 02:19:45.080
<v Speaker 4>based on the light going against the ether.</v>

4914
02:19:45.170 --> 02:19:45.950
<v Speaker 4>And with the code,</v>

4915
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:48.380
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're swimming relative to the ground.</v>

4916
02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:48.741
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4917
02:19:48.741 --> 02:19:49.910
<v Speaker 4>they're swimming against the current,</v>

4918
02:19:49.970 --> 02:19:52.970
<v Speaker 4>you go one way and you're going a certain speed,</v>

4919
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:54.920
<v Speaker 4>but if you go along the court or the other way,</v>

4920
02:19:54.921 --> 02:19:55.880
<v Speaker 4>you're going away faster.</v>

4921
02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:56.661
<v Speaker 4>It's like that,</v>

4922
02:19:56.661 --> 02:19:57.800
<v Speaker 4>but they couldn't measure shit.</v>

4923
02:19:57.801 --> 02:19:58.550
<v Speaker 4>When you look in,</v>

4924
02:19:58.550 --> 02:20:00.680
<v Speaker 4>when you look in the Michelson Morley experiment,</v>

4925
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:02.330
<v Speaker 4>the results were,</v>

4926
02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:05.780
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't measure that we're moving at all.</v>

4927
02:20:05.810 --> 02:20:07.280
<v Speaker 4>So it's always been a debate.</v>

4928
02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:08.600
<v Speaker 4>Are we moving?</v>

4929
02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:09.800
<v Speaker 4>Are we moving?</v>

4930
02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:11.060
<v Speaker 4>Even with Einstein,</v>

4931
02:20:11.061 --> 02:20:14.150
<v Speaker 4>it was a debate did like in the fucking 20s and 30s,</v>

4932
02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:15.740
<v Speaker 4>they still didn't know.</v>

4933
02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:16.693
<v Speaker 4>You assume.</v>

4934
02:20:16.820 --> 02:20:17.151
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4935
02:20:17.151 --> 02:20:17.870
<v Speaker 4>it's moving.</v>

4936
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:20.120
<v Speaker 4>It says right here at thousand miles an hour.</v>

4937
02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:21.290
<v Speaker 4>It's rotating.</v>

4938
02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:22.070
<v Speaker 4>But they,</v>

4939
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:24.470
<v Speaker 4>the people at the top don't even know.</v>

4940
02:20:24.650 --> 02:20:25.483
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know.</v>

4941
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:28.790
<v Speaker 4>But we assumed because we read it somewhere that they know.</v>

4942
02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:30.110
<v Speaker 4>But it's all guesswork.</v>

4943
02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:30.561
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>

4944
02:20:30.561 --> 02:20:31.700
<v Speaker 4>when you watch this documentary,</v>

4945
02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:33.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm just repeating shit dude.</v>

4946
02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:33.710
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

4947
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:34.543
<v Speaker 4>when you watch this,</v>

4948
02:20:34.580 --> 02:20:35.500
<v Speaker 4>they're all sand.</v>

4949
02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:37.040
<v Speaker 4>It's we're studying.</v>

4950
02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:38.960
<v Speaker 4>This is what they found.</v>

4951
02:20:38.961 --> 02:20:40.460
<v Speaker 4>What they found in the cosmic background.</v>

4952
02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:45.520
<v Speaker 4>They took one reading in 2006 and one in 2013 and the one in 2006 this is what</v>

4953
02:20:46.191 --> 02:20:47.030
<v Speaker 4>the documentary is about.</v>

4954
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:49.610
<v Speaker 4>All the signs were talking about it is they took a picture.</v>

4955
02:20:49.611 --> 02:20:51.590
<v Speaker 4>It's called the cosmic microwave background.</v>

4956
02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:56.680
<v Speaker 4>It's a picture of all the galaxies through all the way around you and they took</v>

4957
02:20:56.721 --> 02:20:57.111
<v Speaker 4>a picture.</v>

4958
02:20:57.111 --> 02:20:59.480
<v Speaker 4>They did it in 2006 it's not a conspiracy.</v>

4959
02:20:59.690 --> 02:21:01.880
<v Speaker 4>This is a science documentary that I'm talking about.</v>

4960
02:21:02.030 --> 02:21:03.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about conspiracy theory.</v>

4961
02:21:03.831 --> 02:21:05.770
<v Speaker 4>Documentary is a science doc and there aren't.</v>

4962
02:21:05.780 --> 02:21:08.600
<v Speaker 4>Michio Kaku was talking about the principle,</v>

4963
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.561
<v Speaker 4>the principle.</v>

4964
02:21:09.561 --> 02:21:12.320
<v Speaker 4>It's called the Copernicus principal and what they found,</v>

4965
02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:14.930
<v Speaker 4>this is what they found and in the first reading,</v>

4966
02:21:14.931 --> 02:21:16.250
<v Speaker 4>and they thought there must be a mistake.</v>

4967
02:21:16.310 --> 02:21:20.120
<v Speaker 4>There must be a space until 2013 the European Space Ng,</v>

4968
02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:21.590
<v Speaker 4>they found the same thing and this,</v>

4969
02:21:21.591 --> 02:21:24.220
<v Speaker 4>this is what right now cosmology it.</v>

4970
02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:25.280
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what the fuck to do.</v>

4971
02:21:25.570 --> 02:21:29.900
<v Speaker 4>You know what they found out that cosmic microwave background shows?</v>

4972
02:21:30.260 --> 02:21:35.260
<v Speaker 4>Did all of the galaxies are on shelves lined up to us that we are this,</v>

4973
02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:38.450
<v Speaker 4>we're at the fucking center.</v>

4974
02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:39.690
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what to think about.</v>

4975
02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:42.230
<v Speaker 4>That's what the documentary is about.</v>

4976
02:21:42.410 --> 02:21:43.243
<v Speaker 4>This is a rate,</v>

4977
02:21:43.430 --> 02:21:44.190
<v Speaker 4>pull this down.</v>

4978
02:21:44.190 --> 02:21:46.010
<v Speaker 4>So this is a recent documentary.</v>

4979
02:21:46.011 --> 02:21:48.590
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of controversy going on about it,</v>

4980
02:21:50.020 --> 02:21:50.601
<v Speaker 4>but who is it?</v>

4981
02:21:50.601 --> 02:21:52.700
<v Speaker 4>The thinks that the universe is in shelves.</v>

4982
02:21:53.300 --> 02:21:54.450
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're analyzing.</v>

4983
02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:54.940
<v Speaker 4>They're going,</v>

4984
02:21:54.940 --> 02:21:58.160
<v Speaker 4>they're looking at heat in space.</v>

4985
02:21:58.220 --> 02:21:58.971
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're looking to.</v>

4986
02:21:58.971 --> 02:22:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Just heat and all the heat.</v>

4987
02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:05.540
<v Speaker 4>All the heat is all lined up like in shelves and it's all surround.</v>

4988
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:06.560
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what to think.</v>

4989
02:22:06.561 --> 02:22:09.650
<v Speaker 4>That's what this documentary is about is in 2006 they go,</v>

4990
02:22:09.651 --> 02:22:09.951
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4991
02:22:09.951 --> 02:22:10.970
<v Speaker 4>but that must be a mistake.</v>

4992
02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:12.020
<v Speaker 4>That must be a mistake.</v>

4993
02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:16.070
<v Speaker 4>So they didn't do it again until 2013 European space agency in Paris.</v>

4994
02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:18.020
<v Speaker 4>They had fucking press conference about it.</v>

4995
02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:18.800
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

4996
02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:20.420
<v Speaker 4>it was the exact same thing.</v>

4997
02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:21.800
<v Speaker 4>So they don't know what to think right now.</v>

4998
02:22:21.801 --> 02:22:23.060
<v Speaker 4>Right now cosmology is like,</v>

4999
02:22:23.180 --> 02:22:24.200
<v Speaker 4>if that's true,</v>

5000
02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:27.600
<v Speaker 4>if we are the center of the universe,</v>

5001
02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:31.050
<v Speaker 4>that means everything that we've ever taught her ever,</v>

5002
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.351
<v Speaker 4>ever,</v>

5003
02:22:31.351 --> 02:22:32.610
<v Speaker 4>ever new is all wrong.</v>

5004
02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:34.020
<v Speaker 4>So that's where they're at,</v>

5005
02:22:34.021 --> 02:22:34.171
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5006
02:22:34.171 --> 02:22:35.310
<v Speaker 4>That's what the documentary is about.</v>

5007
02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:39.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's true that cosmic microwave background could be total</v>

5008
02:22:39.090 --> 02:22:39.923
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

5009
02:22:39.930 --> 02:22:42.750
<v Speaker 4>That could easily be like a mind game in itself.</v>

5010
02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't know what the fuck that is.</v>

5011
02:22:44.490 --> 02:22:45.330
<v Speaker 4>What you find out</v>

5012
02:22:45.490 --> 02:22:48.370
<v Speaker 3>got assumed that the top astronomers know what the fuck.</v>

5013
02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:49.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5014
02:22:49.030 --> 02:22:50.080
<v Speaker 3>So either way,</v>

5015
02:22:50.170 --> 02:22:50.561
<v Speaker 3>either way,</v>

5016
02:22:50.561 --> 02:22:50.980
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

5017
02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Constantly updating what they know to be true.</v>

5018
02:22:54.220 --> 02:22:55.750
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like something that's rigid.</v>

5019
02:22:56.080 --> 02:22:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Like astronomy is one of those things.</v>

5020
02:22:58.361 --> 02:22:59.194
<v Speaker 3>It's like they all,</v>

5021
02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:00.340
<v Speaker 3>they all release.</v>

5022
02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:02.980
<v Speaker 3>See every time they find out something new,</v>

5023
02:23:03.010 --> 02:23:05.170
<v Speaker 3>every time they find out something new about a planet,</v>

5024
02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:07.330
<v Speaker 3>like it's important to release that information.</v>

5025
02:23:07.331 --> 02:23:11.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they have like a strict narrative that they have to hold on to.</v>

5026
02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:13.180
<v Speaker 3>So if someone comes around and says,</v>

5027
02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:18.010
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that our measurement was inaccurate and the moon is,</v>

5028
02:23:18.011 --> 02:23:18.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5029
02:23:18.730 --> 02:23:23.590
<v Speaker 3>x amount of miles further and weighs x amount of tons less than we thought it</v>

5030
02:23:23.591 --> 02:23:24.670
<v Speaker 3>did or more,</v>

5031
02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:27.310
<v Speaker 3>you don't really think that would be a bad thing for science.</v>

5032
02:23:27.311 --> 02:23:27.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5033
02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:28.091
<v Speaker 3>That was new.</v>

5034
02:23:28.091 --> 02:23:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Just a new discovery with better equipment.</v>

5035
02:23:30.750 --> 02:23:31.860
<v Speaker 3>But the new discovery,</v>

5036
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:32.400
<v Speaker 3>wonder what,</v>

5037
02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:33.150
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

5038
02:23:33.150 --> 02:23:33.983
<v Speaker 8>Interviewed on the,</v>

5039
02:23:34.020 --> 02:23:37.610
<v Speaker 8>according to the Wikipedia for this documentary claimed that they weren't told</v>

5040
02:23:37.611 --> 02:23:39.550
<v Speaker 8>what they were being interviewed for and meet you.</v>

5041
02:23:39.551 --> 02:23:43.430
<v Speaker 8>A caucus said that this was likely clever editing and that whole shipments</v>

5042
02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:45.070
<v Speaker 8>bordered on fresh honesty.</v>

5043
02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:47.660
<v Speaker 8>George Ellis has said that I was interviewed for it,</v>

5044
02:23:47.661 --> 02:23:49.220
<v Speaker 8>but they did not disclose this agenda,</v>

5045
02:23:49.221 --> 02:23:50.780
<v Speaker 8>which of course is nonsense.</v>

5046
02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:54.110
<v Speaker 8>I don't think it was worth responding to and he goes on to talk more about it.</v>

5047
02:23:54.410 --> 02:23:58.070
<v Speaker 8>There was counter claims just that this is all little false hope.</v>

5048
02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:58.391
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5049
02:23:58.391 --> 02:24:00.160
<v Speaker 4>There's controversy going on man.</v>

5050
02:24:00.370 --> 02:24:01.690
<v Speaker 4>So the guy who produced it,</v>

5051
02:24:01.880 --> 02:24:03.040
<v Speaker 4>the guy who produced it,</v>

5052
02:24:03.370 --> 02:24:04.270
<v Speaker 4>the guy who produced it,</v>

5053
02:24:04.570 --> 02:24:06.280
<v Speaker 4>he put put out interview.</v>

5054
02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:07.920
<v Speaker 4>Like there's people</v>

5055
02:24:07.970 --> 02:24:09.110
<v Speaker 3>that are getting pressured.</v>

5056
02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:09.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5057
02:24:09.650 --> 02:24:10.640
<v Speaker 3>This is what they're saying.</v>

5058
02:24:10.820 --> 02:24:11.810
<v Speaker 3>This could all be bullshit.</v>

5059
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.981
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5060
02:24:11.981 --> 02:24:13.010
<v Speaker 3>but then also be bullshit.</v>

5061
02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:13.451
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

5062
02:24:13.451 --> 02:24:15.860
<v Speaker 3>those documentaries case so juiced up.</v>

5063
02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:16.520
<v Speaker 3>They're so,</v>

5064
02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:17.420
<v Speaker 3>they're so juicy.</v>

5065
02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:18.410
<v Speaker 3>They seem so good.</v>

5066
02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:19.670
<v Speaker 3>They seem so real.</v>

5067
02:24:19.671 --> 02:24:22.220
<v Speaker 3>You get fired up and then once you get fired up,</v>

5068
02:24:22.250 --> 02:24:23.690
<v Speaker 3>it's tough to get unfired up.</v>

5069
02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Cosmic microwave background could be total bullshit.</v>

5070
02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:27.950
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be total bullshit.</v>

5071
02:24:27.980 --> 02:24:29.390
<v Speaker 3>I've read really recently.</v>

5072
02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:29.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5073
02:24:29.890 --> 02:24:34.890
<v Speaker 3>You believe that there's been some debate as to whether or not it's an eternal</v>

5074
02:24:35.151 --> 02:24:35.984
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

5075
02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:40.130
<v Speaker 3>that there was no beginning or end to the universe in that what you're seeing</v>

5076
02:24:40.131 --> 02:24:42.980
<v Speaker 3>when you're seeing a big bang is not the beginning.</v>

5077
02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:44.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just that beginning.</v>

5078
02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:46.160
<v Speaker 4>It's all theories.</v>

5079
02:24:46.161 --> 02:24:47.370
<v Speaker 4>When you watch this documentary,</v>

5080
02:24:47.420 --> 02:24:48.253
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

5081
02:24:48.290 --> 02:24:49.940
<v Speaker 4>they don't know shit.</v>

5082
02:24:49.970 --> 02:24:50.151
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5083
02:24:50.151 --> 02:24:50.961
<v Speaker 4>they know a lot,</v>

5084
02:24:50.961 --> 02:24:52.700
<v Speaker 4>but they definitely don't know everything.</v>

5085
02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:53.690
<v Speaker 4>Lights,</v>

5086
02:24:53.690 --> 02:24:54.800
<v Speaker 4>that's all they're looking at.</v>

5087
02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:57.230
<v Speaker 4>They're not looking at mass or anything.</v>

5088
02:24:57.270 --> 02:24:57.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5089
02:24:57.450 --> 02:24:58.283
<v Speaker 4>there's some things.</v>

5090
02:24:58.310 --> 02:25:03.310
<v Speaker 4>They're measuring the galaxy because the red light is elongated.</v>

5091
02:25:03.620 --> 02:25:03.880
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

5092
02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:08.880
<v Speaker 4>that's a galaxy and it's 700 trillion light years away.</v>

5093
02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:11.360
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck it sounds,</v>

5094
02:25:11.630 --> 02:25:15.680
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like there's a lotta bullshit with cosmology.</v>

5095
02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:17.030
<v Speaker 4>They're telling you this.</v>

5096
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:21.260
<v Speaker 4>They're telling you who is day though as scientists and Mitchell Kako,</v>

5097
02:25:21.261 --> 02:25:22.094
<v Speaker 4>he'll tell us,</v>

5098
02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:23.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5099
02:25:23.290 --> 02:25:23.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5100
02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:25.180
<v Speaker 4>the Kapernick is principal.</v>

5101
02:25:25.181 --> 02:25:26.800
<v Speaker 4>The one that we live by is the,</v>

5102
02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:28.240
<v Speaker 4>were insignificant.</v>

5103
02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:29.620
<v Speaker 4>We mean nothing.</v>

5104
02:25:29.650 --> 02:25:33.640
<v Speaker 4>We're a speck in the universe and then there's a geocentric model.</v>

5105
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:36.460
<v Speaker 4>That's the heliocentric model that we go around the sun.</v>

5106
02:25:36.610 --> 02:25:39.910
<v Speaker 4>The geocentric model means that everything goes around us.</v>

5107
02:25:40.090 --> 02:25:41.350
<v Speaker 4>That's what this says in the Bible.</v>

5108
02:25:41.410 --> 02:25:43.180
<v Speaker 4>That's what the first astronomers were saying.</v>

5109
02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:43.830
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5110
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:44.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5111
02:25:44.190 --> 02:25:45.520
<v Speaker 4>taller may was the first one said,</v>

5112
02:25:45.521 --> 02:25:45.671
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5113
02:25:45.671 --> 02:25:46.504
<v Speaker 4>we are the center.</v>

5114
02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:49.000
<v Speaker 4>You can tell based on his own observations,</v>

5115
02:25:49.650 --> 02:25:51.640
<v Speaker 4>everything is revolving around us.</v>

5116
02:25:51.970 --> 02:25:53.350
<v Speaker 4>And then other people came by.</v>

5117
02:25:53.351 --> 02:25:54.184
<v Speaker 4>Copernicus said,</v>

5118
02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:54.570
<v Speaker 4>HAH,</v>

5119
02:25:54.570 --> 02:25:55.403
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5120
02:25:55.450 --> 02:25:57.340
<v Speaker 4>based on these observations,</v>

5121
02:25:57.400 --> 02:25:58.270
<v Speaker 4>this could also work.</v>

5122
02:25:58.360 --> 02:25:59.710
<v Speaker 4>The Sun's going around.</v>

5123
02:25:59.890 --> 02:26:00.011
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5124
02:26:00.011 --> 02:26:01.240
<v Speaker 4>we're going around the sun.</v>

5125
02:26:01.241 --> 02:26:01.410
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

5126
02:26:01.410 --> 02:26:04.840
<v Speaker 4>and then there was a third one where we're the center of the sun's going around</v>

5127
02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:05.021
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

5128
02:26:05.021 --> 02:26:06.640
<v Speaker 4>but the planets are going around the sun.</v>

5129
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:09.910
<v Speaker 4>There was three models and they were all based on observations.</v>

5130
02:26:09.911 --> 02:26:11.410
<v Speaker 4>Like dude's just looking at lights,</v>

5131
02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:12.380
<v Speaker 4>they're looking at light,</v>

5132
02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:13.300
<v Speaker 4>sort of figure out,</v>

5133
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:14.110
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5134
02:26:14.110 --> 02:26:17.380
<v Speaker 4>are we going around the sun or the sun going around us?</v>

5135
02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:18.011
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

5136
02:26:18.011 --> 02:26:18.990
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

5137
02:26:19.090 --> 02:26:23.080
<v Speaker 4>even like Einstein's times he has a quote saying that we don't have the</v>

5138
02:26:23.081 --> 02:26:28.081
<v Speaker 4>technology to even prove that the earth is even spinning.</v>

5139
02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:28.930
<v Speaker 4>They can't even,</v>

5140
02:26:28.930 --> 02:26:30.220
<v Speaker 4>there's still a debate.</v>

5141
02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:31.700
<v Speaker 4>Are we even moving?</v>

5142
02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:32.560
<v Speaker 4>Are we still,</v>

5143
02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:33.461
<v Speaker 4>do we have to move?</v>

5144
02:26:33.461 --> 02:26:35.710
<v Speaker 4>Because apparently the moon doesn't spend it.</v>

5145
02:26:35.711 --> 02:26:36.460
<v Speaker 4>It's still,</v>

5146
02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:37.293
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't,</v>

5147
02:26:37.330 --> 02:26:39.070
<v Speaker 4>why is it so hard to believe that we're still,</v>

5148
02:26:39.071 --> 02:26:42.670
<v Speaker 4>because they haven't even improve even at it since Einstein.</v>

5149
02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

5150
02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:44.460
<v Speaker 2>maybe they did prove it.</v>

5151
02:26:44.461 --> 02:26:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Earth is the center of the universe and we stand still and the universe spins</v>

5152
02:26:48.481 --> 02:26:50.220
<v Speaker 2>around us 24 hours a day.</v>

5153
02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:52.193
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't,</v>

5154
02:26:52.530 --> 02:26:54.780
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't that be not to think they're measuring that though.</v>

5155
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:56.190
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what they're saying.</v>

5156
02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:56.950
<v Speaker 2>The copper,</v>

5157
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I feel them emailing me right now and tell her to go fuck myself.</v>

5158
02:27:00.690 --> 02:27:04.800
<v Speaker 2>This is a disrespectful conversation that files that could be totally bullshit,</v>

5159
02:27:04.830 --> 02:27:06.060
<v Speaker 2>but we need to get near the grass.</v>

5160
02:27:06.061 --> 02:27:06.894
<v Speaker 2>Tyson,</v>

5161
02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo.</v>

5162
02:27:08.690 --> 02:27:08.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5163
02:27:08.881 --> 02:27:09.750
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're saying.</v>

5164
02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:10.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5165
02:27:10.381 --> 02:27:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who the fuck is they and I don't know what this,</v>

5166
02:27:13.051 --> 02:27:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I have to watch this documentary.</v>

5167
02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Michio Kaku news all about it.</v>

5168
02:27:16.531 --> 02:27:17.364
<v Speaker 2>He's in it,</v>

5169
02:27:17.550 --> 02:27:18.240
<v Speaker 2>he's in it,</v>

5170
02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:19.430
<v Speaker 2>and then there are the fuckers,</v>

5171
02:27:19.431 --> 02:27:20.101
<v Speaker 2>the conspiracy,</v>

5172
02:27:20.101 --> 02:27:20.934
<v Speaker 2>but everything,</v>

5173
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:22.200
<v Speaker 2>if that's true,</v>

5174
02:27:22.410 --> 02:27:24.030
<v Speaker 2>all the Shit we've learned about scientists,</v>

5175
02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:24.660
<v Speaker 2>trash,</v>

5176
02:27:24.660 --> 02:27:25.201
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

5177
02:27:25.201 --> 02:27:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Even Einstein's theory of relativity,</v>

5178
02:27:28.140 --> 02:27:29.040
<v Speaker 2>if this is true,</v>

5179
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:30.090
<v Speaker 2>that goes down,</v>

5180
02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:32.310
<v Speaker 2>that Copernicus principle goes down,</v>

5181
02:27:32.370 --> 02:27:34.050
<v Speaker 2>everything goes down about space.</v>

5182
02:27:34.050 --> 02:27:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Everything hazard comes back or the rebel flag on the roof of the car.</v>

5183
02:27:37.441 --> 02:27:38.940
<v Speaker 2>The world is up and down.</v>

5184
02:27:38.941 --> 02:27:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Cats and dogs living together.</v>

5185
02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:42.031
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think?</v>

5186
02:27:42.031 --> 02:27:46.380
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that we spin and the water doesn't fall off the plant somehow</v>

5187
02:27:46.381 --> 02:27:47.610
<v Speaker 2>magically it gravity.</v>

5188
02:27:47.611 --> 02:27:49.650
<v Speaker 2>It's just that we dealing with mass on it.</v>

5189
02:27:49.651 --> 02:27:52.380
<v Speaker 2>It's such a grand scale that even though it's circular,</v>

5190
02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:57.560
<v Speaker 2>like what we think of as being flat is just our inability to grasp the</v>

5191
02:27:57.751 --> 02:28:02.250
<v Speaker 2>perspective of a 24,000 miles circumference.</v>

5192
02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5193
02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:03.893
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5194
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:05.880
<v Speaker 2>You don't believe that?</v>

5195
02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:06.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5196
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:07.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5197
02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done experiments on it.</v>

5198
02:28:09.330 --> 02:28:11.400
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to know other people did it?</v>

5199
02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5200
02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Read what the scientists believe Shit other people done.</v>

5201
02:28:15.570 --> 02:28:18.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe any of the loving people you two videos that are not.</v>

5202
02:28:18.020 --> 02:28:18.660
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>

5203
02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:19.920
<v Speaker 2>I believe people talking when I,</v>

5204
02:28:19.980 --> 02:28:23.450
<v Speaker 2>when I see their video as they're talking like it's a physicist and he's</v>

5205
02:28:23.451 --> 02:28:23.901
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>

5206
02:28:23.901 --> 02:28:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

5207
02:28:24.530 --> 02:28:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I liked that kind of shit.</v>

5208
02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's written,</v>

5209
02:28:26.541 --> 02:28:28.350
<v Speaker 2>like anybody could have wrote whatever I want,</v>

5210
02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I need to see interviews.</v>

5211
02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:30.523
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

5212
02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Watch the principal,</v>

5213
02:28:31.791 --> 02:28:32.810
<v Speaker 2>your fucking mind will melt.</v>

5214
02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:34.430
<v Speaker 2>This is not a conspiracy theory of video.</v>

5215
02:28:34.610 --> 02:28:36.890
<v Speaker 2>This is a sudden be a bullshit video.</v>

5216
02:28:36.891 --> 02:28:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Because what Jamie was saying was these people that were in it were saying they</v>

5217
02:28:39.561 --> 02:28:42.440
<v Speaker 2>were edited out of context and they didn't know the true intention of the movie.</v>

5218
02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:43.251
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5219
02:28:43.251 --> 02:28:43.731
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5220
02:28:43.731 --> 02:28:44.564
<v Speaker 2>cause you seed it.</v>

5221
02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm just parroting when he's just talking,</v>

5222
02:28:47.421 --> 02:28:49.400
<v Speaker 2>we're just talking about [inaudible].</v>

5223
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:50.450
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about Dick?</v>

5224
02:28:50.450 --> 02:28:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really into it.</v>

5225
02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Cut To,</v>

5226
02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:54.020
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about space?</v>

5227
02:28:54.021 --> 02:28:54.854
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really into it.</v>

5228
02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:57.793
<v Speaker 2>It's not my thing.</v>

5229
02:28:57.860 --> 02:28:58.461
<v Speaker 2>It's not your thing.</v>

5230
02:28:58.461 --> 02:28:58.551
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5231
02:28:58.551 --> 02:28:59.384
<v Speaker 2>how'd you get this job?</v>

5232
02:28:59.470 --> 02:29:00.350
<v Speaker 2>It's probably,</v>

5233
02:29:00.351 --> 02:29:00.681
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5234
02:29:00.681 --> 02:29:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I went to school at the University of Arizona.</v>

5235
02:29:02.391 --> 02:29:02.900
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

5236
02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:03.990
<v Speaker 2>They have this like yeah,</v>

5237
02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:05.150
<v Speaker 2>it's probably bullshit.</v>

5238
02:29:05.151 --> 02:29:06.110
<v Speaker 2>But what you learned from that,</v>

5239
02:29:06.111 --> 02:29:08.780
<v Speaker 2>whether it's true or not about the cosmic microwave background,</v>

5240
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.823
<v Speaker 2>whether we're rolling,</v>

5241
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:11.650
<v Speaker 2>whether the universe is rotating around us,</v>

5242
02:29:11.930 --> 02:29:13.160
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean it doesn't mean shit.</v>

5243
02:29:13.161 --> 02:29:17.330
<v Speaker 2>What you learn is there so many different points of views and everything is just</v>

5244
02:29:17.331 --> 02:29:21.200
<v Speaker 2>a theory and you learned that they still haven't figured a lot of shit out that</v>

5245
02:29:21.201 --> 02:29:22.820
<v Speaker 2>we think people will figure it out,</v>

5246
02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:24.830
<v Speaker 2>but they actually didn't figure out.</v>

5247
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:26.150
<v Speaker 2>They still haven't figured out.</v>

5248
02:29:26.210 --> 02:29:26.540
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

5249
02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:26.811
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5250
02:29:26.811 --> 02:29:27.770
<v Speaker 2>the earth spins.</v>

5251
02:29:27.860 --> 02:29:30.020
<v Speaker 2>We have a pendulum that fucking approves.</v>

5252
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:31.220
<v Speaker 2>If you see a pendulum,</v>

5253
02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:35.280
<v Speaker 2>you prove that it proves that it spins like really a fucking Pendleton.</v>

5254
02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:35.691
<v Speaker 2>He don't.</v>

5255
02:29:35.691 --> 02:29:37.970
<v Speaker 2>You think this is something that you should probably really know what you're</v>

5256
02:29:37.971 --> 02:29:39.830
<v Speaker 2>talking about before you go on these long rants?</v>

5257
02:29:39.831 --> 02:29:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Cause I don't know what I'm talking about.</v>

5258
02:29:42.321 --> 02:29:43.300
<v Speaker 2>The show stone or tile.</v>

5259
02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:43.581
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

5260
02:29:43.581 --> 02:29:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm talking about,</v>

5261
02:29:44.631 --> 02:29:46.700
<v Speaker 2>but what scientists we're funding.</v>

5262
02:29:47.580 --> 02:29:49.730
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take an idiot to fit.</v>

5263
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:52.783
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

5264
02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:53.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5265
02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:53.451
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5266
02:29:53.451 --> 02:29:53.661
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5267
02:29:53.661 --> 02:29:53.841
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5268
02:29:53.841 --> 02:29:54.401
<v Speaker 2>It's just this,</v>

5269
02:29:54.401 --> 02:29:54.621
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

5270
02:29:54.621 --> 02:29:55.790
<v Speaker 2>this is not something we should,</v>

5271
02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:01.000
<v Speaker 2>this is like some really dumb dudes who have head injuries talking about jet Lee</v>

5272
02:30:01.251 --> 02:30:01.850
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

5273
02:30:01.850 --> 02:30:02.683
<v Speaker 2>Turn it Hollywood,</v>

5274
02:30:02.690 --> 02:30:03.590
<v Speaker 2>use that shit.</v>

5275
02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:04.400
<v Speaker 2>Turn it off.</v>

5276
02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:06.170
<v Speaker 2>That's how they use that shot on the street.</v>

5277
02:30:06.410 --> 02:30:07.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't mean that's fascinating.</v>

5278
02:30:08.130 --> 02:30:08.961
<v Speaker 2>If it's real,</v>

5279
02:30:08.961 --> 02:30:09.711
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating,</v>

5280
02:30:09.711 --> 02:30:10.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5281
02:30:10.140 --> 02:30:10.701
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>

5282
02:30:10.701 --> 02:30:11.570
<v Speaker 2>It's life changing.</v>

5283
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:12.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5284
02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:13.520
<v Speaker 2>If it's rules,</v>

5285
02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:15.920
<v Speaker 2>guys who were in it and say they were tricked a lot of things,</v>

5286
02:30:16.820 --> 02:30:17.630
<v Speaker 2>I have to watch it.</v>

5287
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:19.310
<v Speaker 2>You got to watch why they said they were trick.</v>

5288
02:30:19.311 --> 02:30:19.761
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason.</v>

5289
02:30:19.761 --> 02:30:20.340
<v Speaker 2>There's reasons.</v>

5290
02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:21.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to admit they changes.</v>

5291
02:30:21.951 --> 02:30:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Everything did it crushes it crushes their careers,</v>

5292
02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:26.510
<v Speaker 2>but why does it even have to be conspiracy?</v>

5293
02:30:26.511 --> 02:30:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just look at what,</v>

5294
02:30:27.810 --> 02:30:29.960
<v Speaker 2>what is absolute about space?</v>

5295
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Forget about all the measurements.</v>

5296
02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Like forget about all the numbers because we don't really,</v>

5297
02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know and you don't know.</v>

5298
02:30:34.970 --> 02:30:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Just forget about that.</v>

5299
02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Just just like what they're figuring out right now about Mars.</v>

5300
02:30:39.550 --> 02:30:42.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean that they're sending back these images from this rovers and these</v>

5301
02:30:42.191 --> 02:30:44.300
<v Speaker 2>scientists are debating what this is,</v>

5302
02:30:44.301 --> 02:30:44.931
<v Speaker 2>what that is.</v>

5303
02:30:44.931 --> 02:30:47.330
<v Speaker 2>If this is actual running water at one point in time,</v>

5304
02:30:47.331 --> 02:30:48.590
<v Speaker 2>if this is some sort of a strange,</v>

5305
02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:52.280
<v Speaker 2>all that for sure is really happening 100% that's all bullshit.</v>

5306
02:30:52.490 --> 02:30:53.690
<v Speaker 2>You don't think they're really unmarked?</v>

5307
02:30:53.740 --> 02:30:54.573
<v Speaker 2>They're faking everything.</v>

5308
02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:56.290
<v Speaker 2>I think they're faking everything.</v>

5309
02:30:57.170 --> 02:30:58.070
<v Speaker 2>I think all that's fake.</v>

5310
02:30:58.100 --> 02:30:58.980
<v Speaker 2>You don't think they,</v>

5311
02:30:58.981 --> 02:31:01.190
<v Speaker 2>they landed on Mars with a rover fake.</v>

5312
02:31:01.310 --> 02:31:02.143
<v Speaker 2>How come?</v>

5313
02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:03.050
<v Speaker 2>It's just too hard.</v>

5314
02:31:03.290 --> 02:31:04.123
<v Speaker 2>It's too hard to do.</v>

5315
02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:05.270
<v Speaker 2>They got to,</v>

5316
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.631
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

5317
02:31:05.631 --> 02:31:06.620
<v Speaker 2>They've lied so much.</v>

5318
02:31:06.621 --> 02:31:09.510
<v Speaker 2>NASA slides so goddamn much that I don't believe she,</v>

5319
02:31:09.530 --> 02:31:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

5320
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:10.663
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

5321
02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:15.350
<v Speaker 2>I believe for sure they have shot rockets into space because we can watch it</v>

5322
02:31:15.351 --> 02:31:19.650
<v Speaker 2>happen and also for sure people died when they've launched those rockets into</v>

5323
02:31:19.651 --> 02:31:20.484
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

5324
02:31:20.610 --> 02:31:25.260
<v Speaker 1>But they definitely have a way to move rovers around on Mars now.</v>

5325
02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:25.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>

5326
02:31:25.890 --> 02:31:27.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not a biological impediment.</v>

5327
02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:29.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they have to keep people,</v>

5328
02:31:29.281 --> 02:31:31.110
<v Speaker 1>like they're saying if they're going to fly people out there,</v>

5329
02:31:31.111 --> 02:31:34.800
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take six months and you know they have to have enough food to stay</v>

5330
02:31:34.801 --> 02:31:37.290
<v Speaker 1>alive and air and whatever the fuck it,</v>

5331
02:31:37.291 --> 02:31:39.930
<v Speaker 1>they have to make sure they don't get hit by micro meteors and they going to put</v>

5332
02:31:39.931 --> 02:31:41.190
<v Speaker 1>them on the surface of Mars.</v>

5333
02:31:41.970 --> 02:31:43.740
<v Speaker 1>But that's not a person though.</v>

5334
02:31:43.741 --> 02:31:47.070
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about like a rover and it looks like fucking Arizona with like a</v>

5335
02:31:47.071 --> 02:31:47.611
<v Speaker 1>red tent.</v>

5336
02:31:47.611 --> 02:31:49.710
<v Speaker 1>We rally cause mom shops like Arizona,</v>

5337
02:31:49.711 --> 02:31:50.420
<v Speaker 1>but we were ready.</v>

5338
02:31:50.420 --> 02:31:50.701
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

5339
02:31:50.701 --> 02:31:51.300
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

5340
02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all bull.</v>

5341
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:53.783
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe anything.</v>

5342
02:31:53.970 --> 02:31:54.331
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>

5343
02:31:54.331 --> 02:31:57.720
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing on Mars that doesn't exist on earth.</v>

5344
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:58.783
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say.</v>

5345
02:31:59.240 --> 02:31:59.820
<v Speaker 1>All the mean,</v>

5346
02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:00.360
<v Speaker 1>isn't that,</v>

5347
02:32:00.360 --> 02:32:01.193
<v Speaker 1>isn't that correct?</v>

5348
02:32:01.230 --> 02:32:04.950
<v Speaker 1>As far as like the minerals that they're finding in the soil or the kind of dirt</v>

5349
02:32:04.951 --> 02:32:05.940
<v Speaker 1>that they're experiencing.</v>

5350
02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:06.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5351
02:32:06.721 --> 02:32:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I think it's different in its appearance and its imagery,</v>

5352
02:32:09.271 --> 02:32:12.810
<v Speaker 1>but it could just be that that's what is without water look like.</v>

5353
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:14.150
<v Speaker 1>When you see a real picture of Mars,</v>

5354
02:32:14.151 --> 02:32:15.600
<v Speaker 1>you CEO's A.</v>

5355
02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:15.601
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

5356
02:32:15.601 --> 02:32:16.250
<v Speaker 1>A light.</v>

5357
02:32:16.250 --> 02:32:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5358
02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:17.521
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

5359
02:32:17.521 --> 02:32:18.600
<v Speaker 1>But that's what we see.</v>

5360
02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:20.820
<v Speaker 1>But like when you're looking at Mars,</v>

5361
02:32:21.090 --> 02:32:21.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5362
02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Or you're looking at the,</v>

5363
02:32:22.810 --> 02:32:25.500
<v Speaker 1>the desert like in Arizona,</v>

5364
02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:26.760
<v Speaker 1>like that crazy desert,</v>

5365
02:32:26.770 --> 02:32:27.421
<v Speaker 1>the Utah,</v>

5366
02:32:27.421 --> 02:32:28.171
<v Speaker 1>Arizona,</v>

5367
02:32:28.171 --> 02:32:29.640
<v Speaker 1>you know those rocks and shit,</v>

5368
02:32:29.641 --> 02:32:30.600
<v Speaker 1>all that crazy desert.</v>

5369
02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:30.931
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5370
02:32:30.931 --> 02:32:31.470
<v Speaker 1>that looks,</v>

5371
02:32:31.470 --> 02:32:32.700
<v Speaker 1>that might as well be Mars.</v>

5372
02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:33.933
<v Speaker 1>That could be anything.</v>

5373
02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:36.480
<v Speaker 1>If you thought Maurice was completely different from Earth,</v>

5374
02:32:36.481 --> 02:32:38.040
<v Speaker 1>think again that could be Pomona</v>

5375
02:32:39.840 --> 02:32:40.441
<v Speaker 1>are warm.</v>

5376
02:32:40.441 --> 02:32:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Blue Planet is more similar in some ways.</v>

5377
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I the desolate red planathon,</v>

5378
02:32:46.350 --> 02:32:47.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5379
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.600
<v Speaker 1>and we have comparison images to prove it at,</v>

5380
02:32:50.610 --> 02:32:51.960
<v Speaker 1>find out about the actual,</v>

5381
02:32:51.961 --> 02:32:52.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5382
02:32:52.200 --> 02:32:55.980
<v Speaker 1>minerals in it and see if you can find like if the soil is significantly</v>

5383
02:32:55.981 --> 02:32:56.814
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

5384
02:32:56.970 --> 02:32:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean the soil varies all over the place on earth,</v>

5385
02:32:59.641 --> 02:32:59.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5386
02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5387
02:33:00.450 --> 02:33:01.350
<v Speaker 1>soils everywhere.</v>

5388
02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:03.030
<v Speaker 1>You don't think there's a little tiny chance,</v>

5389
02:33:03.031 --> 02:33:04.920
<v Speaker 1>small little percentage that they can be faking and then,</v>

5390
02:33:04.921 --> 02:33:05.754
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5391
02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

5392
02:33:06.690 --> 02:33:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's hard to do.</v>

5393
02:33:08.010 --> 02:33:08.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5394
02:33:08.221 --> 02:33:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard to do,</v>

5395
02:33:09.211 --> 02:33:10.020
<v Speaker 1>but they've done it.</v>

5396
02:33:10.020 --> 02:33:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

5397
02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:13.020
<v Speaker 1>they've already got all these crazy satellite images of earth.</v>

5398
02:33:13.290 --> 02:33:16.020
<v Speaker 1>They got satellite images all the way out to,</v>

5399
02:33:16.021 --> 02:33:16.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5400
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Jupiter's moons.</v>

5401
02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:20.450
<v Speaker 1>They've got that satellite image of a,</v>

5402
02:33:20.460 --> 02:33:22.020
<v Speaker 1>that frozen moon.</v>

5403
02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:22.981
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

5404
02:33:22.981 --> 02:33:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Frozen Moon.</v>

5405
02:33:24.060 --> 02:33:24.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5406
02:33:24.151 --> 02:33:25.490
<v Speaker 1>let me see if that's CGI.</v>

5407
02:33:25.500 --> 02:33:26.333
<v Speaker 1>Find that Bro.</v>

5408
02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:28.470
<v Speaker 1>We got a picture of a frozen fucking moon.</v>

5409
02:33:28.890 --> 02:33:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you it's CGI.</v>

5410
02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:33.720
<v Speaker 1>The frozen,</v>

5411
02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:34.710
<v Speaker 1>the water moon.</v>

5412
02:33:35.010 --> 02:33:35.680
<v Speaker 1>What is it called?</v>

5413
02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:38.340
<v Speaker 1>No way they can take a picture of a second man.</v>

5414
02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:41.490
<v Speaker 1>What does Mars made of comparison to Planet Mars?</v>

5415
02:33:41.491 --> 02:33:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Marsh and soil is the fine,</v>

5416
02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:44.091
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

5417
02:33:44.091 --> 02:33:44.281
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

02:33:44.761 --> 02:33:46.480
<v Speaker 1>blah on differ,</v>

5421
02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:47.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5422
02:33:47.430 --> 02:33:51.480
<v Speaker 1>properties can differ significantly from those on terrestrial,</v>

5423
02:33:51.630 --> 02:33:52.860
<v Speaker 1>those of terrestrial soil,</v>

5424
02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:57.840
<v Speaker 1>the term Martian soil typically refers to the fine fraction of re.</v>

5425
02:33:57.900 --> 02:33:58.733
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

5426
02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:00.760
<v Speaker 1>what does that word recall?</v>

5427
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:01.943
<v Speaker 1>Regolith.</v>

5428
02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Regolith on earth.</v>

5429
02:34:03.390 --> 02:34:06.990
<v Speaker 1>The term soil usually includes organic content.</v>

5430
02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:07.231
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5431
02:34:07.231 --> 02:34:08.100
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

5432
02:34:08.220 --> 02:34:09.810
<v Speaker 1>So because everything's dead,</v>

5433
02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:10.711
<v Speaker 1>it's dirt.</v>

5434
02:34:10.711 --> 02:34:11.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not soil.</v>

5435
02:34:12.090 --> 02:34:12.923
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

5436
02:34:13.710 --> 02:34:14.543
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

5437
02:34:14.730 --> 02:34:15.031
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5438
02:34:15.031 --> 02:34:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Like soil is a fucking life form.</v>

5439
02:34:17.290 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what people don't</v>

5440
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:18.370
<v Speaker 3>think about.</v>

5441
02:34:18.370 --> 02:34:20.380
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen one of those documentaries where they show,</v>

5442
02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:21.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5443
02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:21.630
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5444
02:34:21.630 --> 02:34:21.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5445
02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:24.850
<v Speaker 3>interaction between the mycelium and the,</v>

5446
02:34:24.851 --> 02:34:25.031
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5447
02:34:25.031 --> 02:34:27.880
<v Speaker 3>the roots of the trees and even rocks themselves?</v>

5448
02:34:28.060 --> 02:34:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Like how they have this sort of crazy relationship?</v>

5449
02:34:30.830 --> 02:34:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Radio lab did this amazing podcast on it.</v>

5450
02:34:33.221 --> 02:34:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

5451
02:34:33.790 --> 02:34:33.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5452
02:34:33.971 --> 02:34:35.740
<v Speaker 3>we think of a tree as being like,</v>

5453
02:34:35.741 --> 02:34:36.371
<v Speaker 3>this is a tree.</v>

5454
02:34:36.371 --> 02:34:37.204
<v Speaker 3>It's in the ground,</v>

5455
02:34:37.210 --> 02:34:39.310
<v Speaker 3>it's by itself and there's another tree over there.</v>

5456
02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:44.580
<v Speaker 3>Now they're all connected like it's some crazy super highway of give and take.</v>

5457
02:34:44.980 --> 02:34:48.600
<v Speaker 3>They give each other sugars and minerals and the,</v>

5458
02:34:48.601 --> 02:34:53.380
<v Speaker 3>the mycelium actually cleans to rocks and pulls minerals out of the rocks and</v>

5459
02:34:53.381 --> 02:34:56.200
<v Speaker 3>they all exist together in this crazy ecosystem.</v>

5460
02:34:56.530 --> 02:34:58.000
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing podcast,</v>

5461
02:34:58.001 --> 02:34:58.271
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5462
02:34:58.271 --> 02:34:59.080
<v Speaker 3>If you listen to it,</v>

5463
02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:00.310
<v Speaker 3>it's a mind blower.</v>

5464
02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:01.271
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

5465
02:35:01.271 --> 02:35:02.950
<v Speaker 3>it's just how they look and all that out.</v>

5466
02:35:03.310 --> 02:35:05.440
<v Speaker 3>They actually have seen these things under the microscope.</v>

5467
02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:10.180
<v Speaker 3>They were showing these things that these things exist in a just a small area.</v>

5468
02:35:10.181 --> 02:35:15.181
<v Speaker 3>You'll find miles and miles of this like sort of fungus growth and fungus.</v>

5469
02:35:16.301 --> 02:35:20.020
<v Speaker 3>Apparently the week's explained to me it like when you see like mushrooms,</v>

5470
02:35:20.021 --> 02:35:21.370
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms aren't like a plant.</v>

5471
02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:24.820
<v Speaker 3>They're closer to a person and the to plant mushrooms,</v>

5472
02:35:24.821 --> 02:35:25.720
<v Speaker 3>breathe air.</v>

5473
02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:27.483
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute,</v>

5474
02:35:29.170 --> 02:35:32.770
<v Speaker 3>you just said mushrooms are closer to a person than a plant than they are a</v>

5475
02:35:32.771 --> 02:35:33.604
<v Speaker 3>plant.</v>

5476
02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:35.140
<v Speaker 3>They're more like a life form.</v>

5477
02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:36.740
<v Speaker 3>They're more like they're,</v>

5478
02:35:36.770 --> 02:35:37.930
<v Speaker 3>they're weird man.</v>

5479
02:35:38.450 --> 02:35:40.960
<v Speaker 3>You believe that mushrooms are weird,</v>

5480
02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:42.220
<v Speaker 3>so weird growth.</v>

5481
02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:47.290
<v Speaker 3>It's some sort of a living thing that doesn't move but they interconnect and</v>

5482
02:35:47.291 --> 02:35:52.000
<v Speaker 3>some strange way with all the plants around them and become like a highway</v>

5483
02:35:52.001 --> 02:35:52.834
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

5484
02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:54.280
<v Speaker 3>They even this,</v>

5485
02:35:54.281 --> 02:35:54.551
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

5486
02:35:54.551 --> 02:35:55.361
<v Speaker 3>this in this,</v>

5487
02:35:55.361 --> 02:35:56.194
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5488
02:35:56.290 --> 02:36:00.700
<v Speaker 3>this podcast they were talking about how they find a tree that's like</v>

5489
02:36:00.701 --> 02:36:04.300
<v Speaker 3>specifically needy and they channel resources to that tree.</v>

5490
02:36:04.660 --> 02:36:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Like there's like some sort of a way that these plants are communicating with</v>

5491
02:36:07.691 --> 02:36:08.470
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

5492
02:36:08.470 --> 02:36:12.580
<v Speaker 3>They're just struggling to understand right now they really don't know what the</v>

5493
02:36:12.581 --> 02:36:13.450
<v Speaker 3>fuck they're doing.</v>

5494
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:18.250
<v Speaker 3>They just know that something is happening and that we may have looked at plants</v>

5495
02:36:18.370 --> 02:36:22.360
<v Speaker 3>as being these inanimate things or these things that lie that they live,</v>

5496
02:36:22.361 --> 02:36:25.060
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have any awareness whatsoever of their surroundings.</v>

5497
02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Now they know that they can play the sound of caterpillars.</v>

5498
02:36:28.481 --> 02:36:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Chewing leaves around plants and these plants were,</v>

5499
02:36:31.961 --> 02:36:34.540
<v Speaker 3>was release a toxin that makes their leaves,</v>

5500
02:36:34.541 --> 02:36:37.500
<v Speaker 3>tastes like shit to discourage predation.</v>

5501
02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Like Karen's the eight,</v>

5502
02:36:40.270 --> 02:36:41.920
<v Speaker 3>they can get any spray on them.</v>

5503
02:36:41.950 --> 02:36:42.850
<v Speaker 3>They ran out of spray.</v>

5504
02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:43.960
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

5505
02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:47.800
<v Speaker 3>The ones that the bugs delete is probably the ones that pay probably they don't</v>

5506
02:36:47.801 --> 02:36:48.760
<v Speaker 3>spray the old one.</v>

5507
02:36:48.761 --> 02:36:51.280
<v Speaker 3>This is not a re they don't use real bugs for this.</v>

5508
02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:52.390
<v Speaker 3>They take the sound,</v>

5509
02:36:52.391 --> 02:36:53.380
<v Speaker 3>this is where it's fucked up.</v>

5510
02:36:53.650 --> 02:36:58.650
<v Speaker 3>They take a recording of caterpillar eating leaves and they make the recording</v>

5511
02:36:59.170 --> 02:37:02.860
<v Speaker 3>go off next to the tree and the tree starts releasing those chemicals.</v>

5512
02:37:03.010 --> 02:37:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Somehow or another.</v>

5513
02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:09.420
<v Speaker 3>It's taking in the sound waves cause that's all they are of a caterpillar eating</v>

5514
02:37:10.511 --> 02:37:12.910
<v Speaker 3>leaves and it's causing the leaves to become more bitter.</v>

5515
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:17.600
<v Speaker 3>Eventually there's going to be one plant that knows its trick and then I'm breed</v>

5516
02:37:17.601 --> 02:37:18.440
<v Speaker 3>and evolve.</v>

5517
02:37:18.890 --> 02:37:20.600
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got to change the systems.</v>

5518
02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:21.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5519
02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:22.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5520
02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:23.960
<v Speaker 3>All the animals are gonna Starve to death.</v>

5521
02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:25.241
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

5522
02:37:25.241 --> 02:37:30.080
<v Speaker 3>they've had problems where animals will eat up stream from other animals.</v>

5523
02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:34.280
<v Speaker 3>So if a bunch of animals are eating the sound of the animals eating,</v>

5524
02:37:34.281 --> 02:37:37.180
<v Speaker 3>that plant gets into the system and all the,</v>

5525
02:37:37.181 --> 02:37:40.730
<v Speaker 3>the leaves go bitter and the animals won't eat the leaves and then they wind up</v>

5526
02:37:40.731 --> 02:37:41.810
<v Speaker 3>getting sick and dying.</v>

5527
02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5528
02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:43.230
<v Speaker 3>here's where it gets Chepe.</v>

5529
02:37:43.350 --> 02:37:43.621
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

5530
02:37:43.621 --> 02:37:43.991
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

5531
02:37:43.991 --> 02:37:46.370
<v Speaker 3>what gets where clappy though the animals,</v>

5532
02:37:46.371 --> 02:37:47.780
<v Speaker 3>they get sick and die because they don't eat.</v>

5533
02:37:47.781 --> 02:37:51.790
<v Speaker 3>They starve to death because the plants tastes like she's a plants.</v>

5534
02:37:51.820 --> 02:37:52.653
<v Speaker 3>Tastes like shit.</v>

5535
02:37:53.060 --> 02:37:53.571
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

5536
02:37:53.571 --> 02:37:56.360
<v Speaker 3>There's a war going on that were right under our nose and we didn't know.</v>

5537
02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Here's where it gets really weird.</v>

5538
02:37:58.220 --> 02:38:00.590
<v Speaker 3>That plant that they're talking about that does all this.</v>

5539
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:02.210
<v Speaker 3>That's the acacia plant.</v>

5540
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:06.380
<v Speaker 3>That's the plant that those Jerusalem scholars think might be DMT.</v>

5541
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:11.710
<v Speaker 3>It might be what Moses saw when Moses saw the burning Bush that became God like</v>

5542
02:38:12.231 --> 02:38:12.831
<v Speaker 3>that was God.</v>

5543
02:38:12.831 --> 02:38:13.880
<v Speaker 3>It was communicating with them.</v>

5544
02:38:13.881 --> 02:38:16.610
<v Speaker 3>They think it might be the Acacia tree cause he,</v>

5545
02:38:16.611 --> 02:38:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Acacia tree is rich in dimethyltryptamine and the acacia trees.</v>

5546
02:38:20.811 --> 02:38:23.990
<v Speaker 3>The tree that when animals are eating it upstream,</v>

5547
02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:25.880
<v Speaker 3>the ones downstream,</v>

5548
02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:27.650
<v Speaker 3>they changed their taste.</v>

5549
02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:32.210
<v Speaker 3>They smell it or they hear it or somehow or another they become aware of through</v>

5550
02:38:32.211 --> 02:38:37.211
<v Speaker 3>the ground that the ones up hill or getting eaten so they all taste like shit</v>

5551
02:38:37.351 --> 02:38:39.290
<v Speaker 3>and animals start starving to death.</v>

5552
02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:41.010
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

5553
02:38:41.010 --> 02:38:41.390
<v Speaker 3>monitor.</v>

5554
02:38:41.390 --> 02:38:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Some of that may not be true,</v>

5555
02:38:44.090 --> 02:38:46.490
<v Speaker 3>but I believe it is according to that Radiolab podcast.</v>

5556
02:38:46.491 --> 02:38:47.090
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's true.</v>

5557
02:38:47.090 --> 02:38:47.361
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

5558
02:38:47.361 --> 02:38:48.170
<v Speaker 3>you never know.</v>

5559
02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:49.580

5599
02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Tell a girl,</v>

5600
02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:05.720

<v Speaker 3>you mock marketable a girl or a guy in the sport.</v>

5602
02:40:08.931 --> 02:40:10.160
<v Speaker 3>You're in the sport for two reasons,</v>

5603
02:40:10.161 --> 02:40:10.371
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5604

<v Speaker 3>But two is you want to make a fuck</v>

5606
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:15.360
<v Speaker 1>load of money and get out while you can.</v>

5607
02:40:15.510 --> 02:40:17.640
<v Speaker 1>And she was even saying when she realized what she was doing,</v>

5608
02:40:17.641 --> 02:40:18.460
<v Speaker 1>dancing with the stars,</v>

5609
02:40:18.460 --> 02:40:20.620
<v Speaker 1>didn't an interview recently where she was talking about,</v>

5610
02:40:20.621 --> 02:40:24.660
<v Speaker 1>she realized how much money other athletes make in comparison to fighters.</v>

5611
02:40:24.710 --> 02:40:26.070
<v Speaker 1>And she wasn't complaining.</v>

5612
02:40:26.071 --> 02:40:27.630
<v Speaker 1>She was just saying like,</v>

5613
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm still blessed,</v>

5614
02:40:28.651 --> 02:40:29.670
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

5617
02:40:32.971 --> 02:40:33.601
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

5618
02:40:33.601 --> 02:40:35.880
<v Speaker 1>you find out what some athletes make another sports,</v>

5619
02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:38.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's just the way it goes.</v>

5620
02:40:38.300 --> 02:40:42.930
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way this sport is in this particular period of development.</v>

5621
02:40:42.931 --> 02:40:44.460
<v Speaker 1>And eventually the money will be there.</v>

5622
02:40:44.461 --> 02:40:45.221
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

5623
02:40:45.221 --> 02:40:47.130
<v Speaker 1>for people to say that it's just the way it is,</v>

5624
02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:48.540
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be there for her though.</v>

5625
02:40:48.541 --> 02:40:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5627
02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:50.910
<v Speaker 1>it's for sure going to be there for her.</v>

5628
02:40:51.990 --> 02:40:52.823
<v Speaker 1>She's laughing.</v>

5629
02:40:52.890 --> 02:40:54.600
<v Speaker 1>She's laughing at missing her own kick.</v>

5630
02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:57.990
<v Speaker 1>But what's funny is right after that,</v>

5631
02:40:58.650 --> 02:40:58.981
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

5632
02:40:58.981 --> 02:40:59.814

<v Speaker 1>this is a crazy kick man.</v>

5635
02:41:04.411 --> 02:41:06.540
<v Speaker 1>This is like some Liotta Machida type shit.</v>

5636
02:41:06.541 --> 02:41:07.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a highlight reel kid.</v>

5637
02:41:07.861 --> 02:41:08.694
<v Speaker 1>His brother,</v>

5638
02:41:08.730 --> 02:41:09.271

<v Speaker 1>How did he do?</v>

5642
02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:13.620
<v Speaker 1>He's got some serious striking,</v>

5643
02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:15.060
<v Speaker 1>nasty karate duty.</v>

5644
02:41:15.061 --> 02:41:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Throw an uppercut clipped.</v>

5645
02:41:16.411 --> 02:41:19.160
<v Speaker 1>The guy won one opera cut any fights just like him.</v>

5646
02:41:19.170 --> 02:41:21.240
<v Speaker 1>That crime stands where they're jumping up and down in there.</v>

5647
02:41:21.490 --> 02:41:21.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5648
02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:22.681
<v Speaker 1>it's like fencing,</v>

5649
02:41:22.681 --> 02:41:23.670
<v Speaker 1>like a fencing stance.</v>

5650
02:41:24.180 --> 02:41:25.860
<v Speaker 1>He looks legit.</v>

5651
02:41:25.861 --> 02:41:27.330
<v Speaker 1>He's been hurt over the last few years.</v>

5652
02:41:27.331 --> 02:41:28.020

5657
02:41:37.350 --> 02:41:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I watched him fight in something else.</v>

5658
02:41:39.211 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Might've been the RFA.</v>

5659
02:41:40.201 --> 02:41:42.420
<v Speaker 1>What did he find him before this RFI.</v>

5660
02:41:42.510 --> 02:41:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Rfi?</v>

5663
02:41:43.591 --> 02:41:44.161
<v Speaker 1>I saw him fight.</v>

5664
02:41:44.161 --> 02:41:44.401
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

5665
02:41:44.401 --> 02:41:47.270
<v Speaker 1>he looked real good and he does look a lot like Liotta.</v>

5666
02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of the way he moves and see,</v>

5667
02:41:49.390 --> 02:41:49.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5674
02:41:52.591 --> 02:41:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking when I was watching them fight in the early days,</v>

5675
02:41:54.961 --> 02:41:55.291
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5676
02:41:55.291 --> 02:41:55.471
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5677
02:41:55.471 --> 02:41:57.420
<v Speaker 1>what a grind it is to get into MMA.</v>

5678
02:41:57.960 --> 02:41:58.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5679
02:41:58.231 --> 02:42:02.040
<v Speaker 1>you've got these guys that are really good at a sport and they get to a level,</v>

5680

5681
02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:03.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5682
02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:05.133
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

5683
02:42:05.150 --> 02:42:05.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5684
02:42:05.331 --> 02:42:05.751
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

5685
02:42:05.751 --> 02:42:08.180
<v Speaker 1>I saw some highlights of this online.</v>

5686
02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:09.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5687
02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:10.900
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly like Liotta well,</v>

5688
02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5689
02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:12.790
<v Speaker 1>confidence and he throws bombs.</v>

5690
02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Did they both learn from their dad?</v>

5691
02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:16.033
<v Speaker 7>What is hard?</v>

5692
02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:17.580
<v Speaker 1>See that little combo.</v>

5693
02:42:17.630 --> 02:42:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5694
02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:20.670
<v Speaker 1>He did that a another time and really I think he put,</v>

5695
02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:21.920
<v Speaker 1>put the guy on his butt with it.</v>

5696
02:42:21.950 --> 02:42:22.661
<v Speaker 1>Damn Chins.</v>

5697

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5700
02:42:24.650 --> 02:42:26.210
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why the UFC didn't sign them.</v>

5701
02:42:28.190 --> 02:42:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Seems like that would be a good signing.</v>

5702
02:42:29.900 --> 02:42:30.733
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5703
02:42:31.370 --> 02:42:35.720

5738
02:43:22.241 --> 02:43:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Rory is over there.</v>

5739
02:43:23.141 --> 02:43:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Roy McDonald just signed to Bella tour.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5748
02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:40.810
<v Speaker 1>like Bella [inaudible].</v>

5749
02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good for MMA.</v>

5750
02:43:42.670 --> 02:43:43.870
<v Speaker 1>It's good for the UFC.</v>

5751
02:43:43.900 --> 02:43:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It's good for business.</v>

5752
02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:47.670
<v Speaker 1>It's good for business,</v>

5753
02:43:48.460 --> 02:43:49.270
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

5754
02:43:49.270 --> 02:43:50.103
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

5755
02:43:50.770 --> 02:43:52.630
<v Speaker 1>We need a bunch of organizations.</v>

5756
02:43:52.810 --> 02:43:53.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5757
02:43:53.081 --> 02:43:53.351
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

5758
02:43:53.351 --> 02:43:53.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5759
02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:56.710
<v Speaker 1>there's an a large potential for growth in this sport.</v>

5760
02:43:56.711 --> 02:43:57.221
<v Speaker 1>Bella tours,</v>

5761
02:43:57.221 --> 02:43:58.001
<v Speaker 1>probably number two,</v>

5762
02:43:58.001 --> 02:43:58.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5763
02:43:58.720 --> 02:43:58.871
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5764
02:43:58.871 --> 02:43:59.500
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

5765
02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:00.333
<v Speaker 1>Who's number three?</v>

5766
02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Probably one IFC.</v>

5767
02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:02.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5768
02:44:02.081 --> 02:44:02.914
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5769
02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:04.200
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be a,</v>

5770
02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:04.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5771
02:44:04.540 --> 02:44:05.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5772
02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:05.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5773
02:44:05.530 --> 02:44:08.650
<v Speaker 1>world series of fighting does have some really good fighters but doesn't get</v>

5774
02:44:08.651 --> 02:44:10.720
<v Speaker 1>another enough love for some reason.</v>

5775
02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:11.621
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of interesting,</v>

5776
02:44:11.621 --> 02:44:12.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5777
02:44:12.130 --> 02:44:12.963
<v Speaker 1>It's on NBC.</v>

5778
02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:15.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5779
02:44:15.580 --> 02:44:17.890
<v Speaker 1>But like world series of fighting has Fitch.</v>

5780
02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:20.560
<v Speaker 1>They had Paul Horace until they kicked him out.</v>

5781
02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Take Shield.</v>

5782
02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:22.540
<v Speaker 1>They have Jake shields.</v>

5783
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5784
02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:24.810
<v Speaker 1>they got Marlin Mris.</v>

5785
02:44:24.811 --> 02:44:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Who's a bad motherfucker.</v>

5786
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:27.460
<v Speaker 1>They got just engage you.</v>

5787
02:44:27.461 --> 02:44:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Who's a bad motherfucker.</v>

5788
02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:30.251
<v Speaker 1>They got some good for,</v>

5789
02:44:30.251 --> 02:44:31.600
<v Speaker 1>they had Tyrone Spong.</v>

5790
02:44:31.601 --> 02:44:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Taiwan spawn is still doing MMA though.</v>

5791
02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I think Taiwan spawn might have decided to go to straight boxing.</v>

5792
02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:40.600
<v Speaker 1>He's doing really well and straight boxing.</v>

5793
02:44:41.050 --> 02:44:42.520
<v Speaker 1>It's got nasty hands man.</v>

5794
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.361
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

5795
02:44:43.361 --> 02:44:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And he got Alan Jobe on pot.</v>

5796
02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:46.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5797
02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:46.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5798
02:44:46.301 --> 02:44:46.451
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5799
02:44:46.451 --> 02:44:47.284
<v Speaker 1>He's much larger.</v>

5800
02:44:47.590 --> 02:44:48.450
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

5801
02:44:48.470 --> 02:44:48.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5802
02:44:48.970 --> 02:44:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Weiss,</v>

5803
02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:49.751
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

5804
02:44:49.751 --> 02:44:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Essentially he's a light heavyweight.</v>

5805
02:44:51.341 --> 02:44:52.600
<v Speaker 1>If he was an MMA fighter,</v>

5806
02:44:52.810 --> 02:44:54.220
<v Speaker 1>but he could fight heavyweight too.</v>

5807
02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:55.113
<v Speaker 1>He's fought,</v>

5808
02:44:55.170 --> 02:44:55.520
<v Speaker 1>he's fun.</v>

5809
02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:56.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty big boys.</v>

5810
02:44:57.010 --> 02:44:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know what he,</v>

5811
02:44:58.060 --> 02:44:59.030
<v Speaker 1>what Wade he fights at.</v>

5812
02:44:59.031 --> 02:44:59.411
<v Speaker 1>And I would,</v>

5813
02:44:59.411 --> 02:45:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it would be in the two twenties or something like that.</v>

5814
02:45:02.650 --> 02:45:04.000
<v Speaker 1>What's the latest with Mark Hunt?</v>

5815
02:45:04.170 --> 02:45:04.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5816
02:45:04.451 --> 02:45:04.841
<v Speaker 1>he's out.</v>

5817
02:45:04.841 --> 02:45:06.450
<v Speaker 1>He been protested about that.</v>

5818
02:45:06.451 --> 02:45:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar's test Zuma.</v>

5819
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:10.343
<v Speaker 1>That's Obama.</v>

5820
02:45:10.570 --> 02:45:12.040
<v Speaker 1>And he's really a bummer for him.</v>

5821
02:45:12.130 --> 02:45:12.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5822
02:45:12.481 --> 02:45:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a bummer for him,</v>

5823
02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:14.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5824
02:45:14.471 --> 02:45:14.861

5825
02:45:14.861 --> 02:45:15.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5826
02:45:15.250 --> 02:45:17.320
<v Speaker 1>that's stuff that Brock tested for.</v>

5827
02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:17.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5828
02:45:17.741 --> 02:45:18.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not a,</v>

5829
02:45:18.190 --> 02:45:19.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a steroid.</v>

5830
02:45:19.601 --> 02:45:20.800
<v Speaker 1>It's something that helps you,</v>

5834
02:45:26.231 --> 02:45:26.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor.</v>

5835
02:45:26.921 --> 02:45:27.754
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

5836

5841
02:45:32.891 --> 02:45:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they released.</v>

5842
02:45:34.430 --> 02:45:38.770
<v Speaker 1>What that stuff is an estrogen blocker and it helps your body produce</v>

5843
02:45:38.771 --> 02:45:39.700
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:52.540
<v Speaker 1>overdosed it,</v>

5851
02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:53.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5852
02:45:53.300 --> 02:45:54.400
<v Speaker 1>shut the balls down.</v>

5853
02:45:54.850 --> 02:45:55.451
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

5854
02:45:55.451 --> 02:45:56.830
<v Speaker 1>that's the real concern.</v>

5855
02:45:56.831 --> 02:45:59.140
<v Speaker 1>When people hear that someone was taking an estrogen blocker,</v>

5856
02:45:59.350 --> 02:45:59.561
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

5857
02:45:59.561 --> 02:45:59.801
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5858
02:45:59.801 --> 02:46:00.634
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

5859
02:46:00.850 --> 02:46:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the Jon Jones story,</v>

5860
02:46:02.890 --> 02:46:07.270
<v Speaker 1>which red band predicted hilariously is a boner pills.</v>

5861
02:46:07.300 --> 02:46:09.590
<v Speaker 1>What did predict that boner pills?</v>

5862
02:46:09.770 --> 02:46:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Because red pen is taking those boner pills a bunch of times.</v>

5863
02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:13.281
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

5864
02:46:13.281 --> 02:46:13.491
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

5865
02:46:13.491 --> 02:46:14.720
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely steroids in them.</v>

5866
02:46:14.780 --> 02:46:15.980
<v Speaker 1>They make you like crazy.</v>

5867
02:46:16.370 --> 02:46:16.671
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

5868
02:46:16.671 --> 02:46:16.851
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

5869
02:46:16.851 --> 02:46:17.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of shit in there.</v>

5870
02:46:17.841 --> 02:46:18.674
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what's in there?</v>

5871
02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Like he just buy these gas station boner pills and that's what Brian said.</v>

5872
02:46:23.181 --> 02:46:23.481
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

5873
02:46:23.481 --> 02:46:23.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5874
02:46:23.571 --> 02:46:24.231
<v Speaker 1>it makes you think that.</v>

5875
02:46:24.231 --> 02:46:24.950
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

5876
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:25.161
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5877
02:46:25.161 --> 02:46:26.270
<v Speaker 1>because he,</v>

5878
02:46:26.271 --> 02:46:27.170
<v Speaker 1>he likes to party,</v>

5879
02:46:27.171 --> 02:46:27.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5880
02:46:27.411 --> 02:46:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Like John Jones tested positive for coke.</v>

5881
02:46:29.061 --> 02:46:29.361
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

5882
02:46:29.361 --> 02:46:30.380
<v Speaker 1>people that like to do coke,</v>

5883
02:46:30.410 --> 02:46:32.690
<v Speaker 1>they want to take like boner pills to get their dick hard.</v>

5884
02:46:33.770 --> 02:46:34.041
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5885
02:46:34.041 --> 02:46:34.874
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

5886
02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:35.930
<v Speaker 1>he nailed it.</v>

5887
02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:36.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5888
02:46:36.201 --> 02:46:37.034
<v Speaker 1>he nailed it.</v>

5889
02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:39.081
<v Speaker 1>He nailed it.</v>

5890
02:46:39.081 --> 02:46:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Good CSI shit.</v>

5891
02:46:40.580 --> 02:46:42.230
<v Speaker 1>You should be an investigative reporter.</v>

5892
02:46:43.650 --> 02:46:44.483
<v Speaker 1>Crop the case.</v>

5893
02:46:44.930 --> 02:46:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And he was right.</v>

5894
02:46:45.650 --> 02:46:46.483
<v Speaker 1>It was bro.</v>

5895
02:46:46.970 --> 02:46:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Gonna Forgive John John's like,</v>

5896
02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:48.591
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

5897
02:46:48.591 --> 02:46:49.820
<v Speaker 1>those are just boner pills.</v>

5898
02:46:50.060 --> 02:46:50.841
<v Speaker 1>I think that's okay.</v>

5899
02:46:50.841 --> 02:46:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5900
02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:51.711
<v Speaker 1>Well the,</v>

5901
02:46:51.711 --> 02:46:55.080
<v Speaker 1>there was even talk about about how long the suspension would be for Brock</v>

5902
02:46:55.080 --> 02:46:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Lesnar.</v>

5903
02:46:55.470 --> 02:46:56.520
<v Speaker 1>It's all weird man.</v>

5904
02:46:56.550 --> 02:46:57.241
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>

5905
02:46:57.241 --> 02:46:59.580
<v Speaker 1>And here's another thing about like things like Bella Tura.</v>

5906
02:46:59.581 --> 02:47:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Somebody brought this up online on Twitter,</v>

5907
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:04.010
<v Speaker 1>whether Bella tour,</v>

5908
02:47:04.110 --> 02:47:04.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5909
02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:07.920
<v Speaker 1>gets tested by Usada and I don't know the answer to that.</v>

5910
02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they,</v>

5911
02:47:09.580 --> 02:47:11.230
<v Speaker 1>how they test or what they test.</v>

5912
02:47:11.231 --> 02:47:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I know people have tested positive for some shit before it Bella tour,</v>

5913
02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:16.900
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know when,</v>

5914
02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:18.250
<v Speaker 1>and not to know what commission,</v>

5915
02:47:18.251 --> 02:47:23.251
<v Speaker 1>but I do not imagine in any way that it's as stringent as the test of the UFC</v>

5916
02:47:24.251 --> 02:47:25.084
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

5917
02:47:25.330 --> 02:47:26.163
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5918
02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:27.960
<v Speaker 1>There's no way peers,</v>

5919
02:47:27.961 --> 02:47:31.490
<v Speaker 1>the peers that like Bobby Lashley yeah.</v>

5920
02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Does not pass the smell test.</v>

5921
02:47:33.361 --> 02:47:33.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5922
02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:34.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5923
02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:34.791
<v Speaker 1>no offense.</v>

5924
02:47:34.791 --> 02:47:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Bobby,</v>

5925
02:47:35.230 --> 02:47:36.660
<v Speaker 1>you literally a hell of an athlete,</v>

5926
02:47:37.140 --> 02:47:38.750
<v Speaker 1>but that looks like your job.</v>

5927
02:47:38.850 --> 02:47:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Or one 58 they were tested by the Mohegan Department of Athletic Regulation</v>

5928
02:47:43.690 --> 02:47:44.190
<v Speaker 1>testing.</v>

5929
02:47:44.190 --> 02:47:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5930
02:47:44.610 --> 02:47:46.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's more Mohegan Sun.</v>

5931
02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:48.480
<v Speaker 1>That must be where the casino is.</v>

5932
02:47:48.510 --> 02:47:50.880
<v Speaker 1>They probably have their own athletic commission and a,</v>

5933
02:47:50.881 --> 02:47:51.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5934
02:47:51.450 --> 02:47:54.280
<v Speaker 1>who knows what methods they use and who knows whether it's a,</v>

5935
02:47:54.570 --> 02:47:58.260
<v Speaker 1>just a post fight test like they used to do in the UFC and a lot of guys had</v>

5936
02:47:58.261 --> 02:47:59.640
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to crack the system.</v>

5937
02:47:59.670 --> 02:48:00.503
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

5938
02:48:00.890 --> 02:48:01.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>

5939
02:48:01.980 --> 02:48:02.813
<v Speaker 1>Who knows.</v>

5940
02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:05.490
<v Speaker 1>It'd be an interesting choice for people that,</v>

5941
02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:06.353
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5942
02:48:06.690 --> 02:48:07.650
<v Speaker 1>wanted to,</v>

5943
02:48:07.651 --> 02:48:08.484
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5944
02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:10.050
<v Speaker 1>wanted to get some help.</v>

5945
02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:12.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5946
02:48:12.061 --> 02:48:17.061
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to completely jump into this new school of constant testing.</v>

5947
02:48:17.730 --> 02:48:18.061
<v Speaker 1>I feel like.</v>

5948
02:48:18.061 --> 02:48:19.980
<v Speaker 1>How would you just test me after the fight and just,</v>

5949
02:48:19.981 --> 02:48:21.510
<v Speaker 1>we'll just work this out in camp.</v>

5950
02:48:21.940 --> 02:48:26.940
<v Speaker 1>How about Nate Diaz pulling out that vape pen and his press conference that took</v>

5951
02:48:27.071 --> 02:48:27.541
<v Speaker 1>balls,</v>

5952
02:48:27.541 --> 02:48:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

5953
02:48:28.300 --> 02:48:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Shit against,</v>

5954
02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:30.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5955
02:48:30.750 --> 02:48:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think he thought he was doing anything wrong.</v>

5956
02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:33.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a CBD oil pen.</v>

5957
02:48:34.180 --> 02:48:35.440
<v Speaker 1>He probably didn't realize.</v>

5958
02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Most people just can't,</v>

5959
02:48:38.170 --> 02:48:41.260
<v Speaker 1>they can't make the distinction between CBD oil and pot.</v>

5960
02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:41.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5961
02:48:41.831 --> 02:48:42.664
<v Speaker 1>that CBD oils,</v>

5962
02:48:42.700 --> 02:48:43.870
<v Speaker 1>just some shit that you do.</v>

5963
02:48:44.140 --> 02:48:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I take that every day just as a antioxidant,</v>

5964
02:48:47.660 --> 02:48:48.820
<v Speaker 1>antiinflammatory.</v>

5965
02:48:49.530 --> 02:48:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5966
02:48:49.810 --> 02:48:51.160
<v Speaker 1>CBD oils natural.</v>

5967
02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:56.520
<v Speaker 1>If people aren't taking that and there's been lots of reports of success taking,</v>

5968
02:48:57.960 --> 02:48:58.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5969
02:48:58.300 --> 02:49:01.270
<v Speaker 1>this CBD oil when you have any kind of cancer,</v>

5970
02:49:01.271 --> 02:49:01.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5971
02:49:01.541 --> 02:49:02.374
<v Speaker 1>they've been,</v>

5972
02:49:02.530 --> 02:49:03.520
<v Speaker 1>they've been good studies.</v>

5973
02:49:03.521 --> 02:49:04.000
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

5974
02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:07.180
<v Speaker 1>why not just take it before just maybe as a preventative,</v>

5975
02:49:07.350 --> 02:49:07.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5976
02:49:07.660 --> 02:49:08.430
<v Speaker 1>can't hurt.</v>

5977
02:49:08.430 --> 02:49:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5978
02:49:09.170 --> 02:49:10.003
<v Speaker 2>that's what I do.</v>

5979
02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5980
02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:12.750
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people report good results with it,</v>

5981
02:49:13.290 --> 02:49:13.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5982
02:49:13.651 --> 02:49:14.000
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

5983
02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.420
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be really good for pain.</v>

5984
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:16.500
<v Speaker 2>People have crazy.</v>

5985
02:49:16.501 --> 02:49:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Is it that,</v>

5986
02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:18.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5987
02:49:18.990 --> 02:49:21.180
<v Speaker 2>we have a state like Colorado and there's other states too,</v>

5988
02:49:21.181 --> 02:49:22.560
<v Speaker 2>like Washington and Oregon now,</v>

5989
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:24.570
<v Speaker 2>but there's states where it's,</v>

5990
02:49:24.890 --> 02:49:25.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

5991
02:49:25.710 --> 02:49:26.161
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>

5992
02:49:26.161 --> 02:49:27.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like going to Amsterdam.</v>

5993
02:49:27.361 --> 02:49:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Colorado is like Amsterdam,</v>

5994
02:49:28.801 --> 02:49:30.000
<v Speaker 2>but then we got another Amsterdam,</v>

5995
02:49:30.001 --> 02:49:30.751
<v Speaker 2>we got to Washington,</v>

5996
02:49:30.751 --> 02:49:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Amsterdam,</v>

5997
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:32.370
<v Speaker 2>we've got an Oregon Amsterdam.</v>

5998
02:49:32.670 --> 02:49:33.750
<v Speaker 2>But Colorado is,</v>

5999
02:49:34.110 --> 02:49:38.880
<v Speaker 2>that's probably the most famous state for legalizing recreational use.</v>

6000
02:49:38.970 --> 02:49:42.840
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is it that we're living in a world like that do to change their whole</v>

6001
02:49:42.841 --> 02:49:44.780
<v Speaker 2>economy chaser economy?</v>

6002
02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Denver is booming.</v>

6003
02:49:46.270 --> 02:49:46.660
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

6004
02:49:46.660 --> 02:49:47.820
<v Speaker 2>it's like a gold rush.</v>

6005
02:49:47.850 --> 02:49:48.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like they found gold,</v>

02:49:49.391 --> 02:49:51.710
<v Speaker 2>and they just like skyscrapers everywhere.</v>

6008
02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Is it like that?</v>

6009
02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:52.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6010
02:49:52.561 --> 02:49:54.810
<v Speaker 2>the real estate has gone up by a significant amount.</v>

6011
02:49:54.810 --> 02:49:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Last time I heard it was like 14 or 16%,</v>

6012
02:49:57.390 --> 02:49:58.950
<v Speaker 2>like the real estate prices have gone up.</v>

6013
02:49:59.270 --> 02:50:00.103
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6014
02:50:00.330 --> 02:50:02.910
<v Speaker 2>drunk driving is the lowest it's been in decades.</v>

6015
02:50:03.090 --> 02:50:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Violent crimes,</v>

6016
02:50:04.021 --> 02:50:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Lowe's has been in a long time.</v>

6017
02:50:06.930 --> 02:50:07.561

<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

6020
02:50:08.910 --> 02:50:09.481
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

6021
02:50:09.481 --> 02:50:11.610
<v Speaker 2>People will run instances of teenage drunk.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6023
02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:13.020

<v Speaker 2>getting pulled over with booze lot.</v>

6025
02:50:14.810 --> 02:50:18.810
<v Speaker 2>A lot of less instances of teenagers getting families from all over the world</v>

6026
02:50:18.990 --> 02:50:22.080
<v Speaker 2>uprooting and taking their kids that have seizures.</v>

6031
02:50:30.241 --> 02:50:30.980
<v Speaker 2>maybe even the last.</v>

6032
02:50:30.980 --> 02:50:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6033

<v Speaker 2>rather where they had that kid who was,</v>

6046
02:50:50.191 --> 02:50:51.024
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6047
02:50:51.150 --> 02:50:52.650
<v Speaker 2>he was having some seizures.</v>

6048
02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:53.310
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>

6049
02:50:53.310 --> 02:50:56.580
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know what to do and they were like at their last rope and they tried</v>

6050
02:50:56.581 --> 02:50:57.091
<v Speaker 2>cannabis,</v>

6051

<v Speaker 2>they started giving this kid a Charlotte's web was in like a mango.</v>

6052
02:51:01.051 --> 02:51:04.440
<v Speaker 2>They would give it to them and like pieces of fruit or a melon or something like</v>

6053
02:51:04.441 --> 02:51:05.030
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

6054
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean this kid is completely stopped all the seizures,</v>

6055
02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:09.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's apparently really,</v>

6056
02:51:09.121 --> 02:51:09.481
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

6057
02:51:09.481 --> 02:51:10.680
<v Speaker 2>really effective for that.</v>

6058

<v Speaker 2>there's a whole shit load of them out there.</v>

6063
02:51:18.270 --> 02:51:19.740
<v Speaker 2>There is hope for them.</v>

6064
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:22.110
<v Speaker 2>You got to move to Colorado or you know,</v>

6065
02:51:22.111 --> 02:51:23.030

<v Speaker 2>but there's a place you can go,</v>

6072
02:51:29.950 --> 02:51:30.541
<v Speaker 2>Colorado,</v>

6073
02:51:30.541 --> 02:51:31.051
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

6074
02:51:31.051 --> 02:51:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Oregon,</v>

02:51:33.130 --> 02:51:35.040
<v Speaker 2>your kids seizures are the kids that,</v>

6077
02:51:35.041 --> 02:51:35.874
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6078
02:51:35.880 --> 02:51:36.511
<v Speaker 2>relatives,</v>

6079
02:51:36.511 --> 02:51:36.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

6080
02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:38.790
<v Speaker 2>You could take them to once a week,</v>

6081
02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:40.500
<v Speaker 2>maybe once every two weeks.</v>

6082
02:51:40.800 --> 02:51:42.480
<v Speaker 2>That those are the results I'm hearing.</v>

6083
02:51:42.510 --> 02:51:42.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6084
02:51:42.721 --> 02:51:45.810
<v Speaker 2>And there's also other parts of the same country that we live in right now where</v>

6085
02:51:45.811 --> 02:51:48.720
<v Speaker 2>if you took that same medics and and you got caught with it,</v>

6086
02:51:48.750 --> 02:51:49.680
<v Speaker 2>you go to jail,</v>

6087
02:51:49.770 --> 02:51:50.940
<v Speaker 2>a guaranteed go to jail.</v>

6088
02:51:50.970 --> 02:51:53.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of stupid spots in this country,</v>

6089
02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:55.260
<v Speaker 2>but they're not bad people.</v>

6090
02:51:55.261 --> 02:51:59.010
<v Speaker 2>They're just operating on bad old ideas and they think of themselves as being</v>

6091
02:51:59.011 --> 02:51:59.844
<v Speaker 2>good people.</v>

6092
02:52:00.180 --> 02:52:02.400
<v Speaker 2>And I bet in your head you are a good person.</v>

6093
02:52:02.940 --> 02:52:07.940
<v Speaker 2>But if you're enforcing marijuana laws in 2016 you're on the wrong side.</v>

6094
02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:11.500
<v Speaker 2>You were on the wrong side.</v>

6095
02:52:11.530 --> 02:52:13.240
<v Speaker 2>It helps a lot of people with a lot of shit.</v>

6096
02:52:13.241 --> 02:52:17.020
<v Speaker 2>And if somebody is trying to get their kid some medicine and,</v>

6097
02:52:17.060 --> 02:52:19.870
<v Speaker 2>and you are trying to stop them and lock them in a cage,</v>

6098
02:52:20.110 --> 02:52:22.510
<v Speaker 2>and this is a medicine that grew out of the ground.</v>

6099
02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:23.770
<v Speaker 2>You're out of your fucking mind.</v>

6100
02:52:24.190 --> 02:52:24.401
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

6101
02:52:24.401 --> 02:52:26.680
<v Speaker 2>you're operating on some old voodoo schedule,</v>

6102
02:52:26.681 --> 02:52:27.514
<v Speaker 2>one drug,</v>

6103
02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:29.680
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't change it.</v>

6104
02:52:29.681 --> 02:52:31.180
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't change the classification.</v>

6105
02:52:32.350 --> 02:52:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a Hillary's going to do it when she gets in.</v>

6106
02:52:35.170 --> 02:52:36.003
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they made a deal.</v>

6107
02:52:36.250 --> 02:52:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Let's make the big change when we get it.</v>

6108
02:52:37.391 --> 02:52:38.440
<v Speaker 2>And let's hold on to her cards.</v>

6109
02:52:38.980 --> 02:52:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6110
02:52:39.220 --> 02:52:40.053
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get in</v>

6111
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:45.010
<v Speaker 2>this country is in some serious trouble.</v>

6112
02:52:45.130 --> 02:52:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

6113
02:52:46.090 --> 02:52:47.440
<v Speaker 2>We get to make a new system.</v>

6114
02:52:47.470 --> 02:52:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking,</v>

6115
02:52:48.430 --> 02:52:49.210
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to,</v>

6116
02:52:49.210 --> 02:52:50.120
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to do it.</v>

6117
02:52:50.690 --> 02:52:53.140
<v Speaker 2>System so obvious that it's rigged.</v>

6118
02:52:53.170 --> 02:52:53.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6119
02:52:53.411 --> 02:52:54.640
<v Speaker 2>when you got Hillary and Trump,</v>

6120
02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:56.290
<v Speaker 2>that's rig fucking,</v>

6121
02:52:57.670 --> 02:52:58.690
<v Speaker 2>they're clawing at it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So red,</v>

6125
02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:05.350
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be interesting to see how much longer we can continue to,</v>

6126
02:53:05.650 --> 02:53:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what if,</v>

6137
02:53:18.250 --> 02:53:18.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6138
02:53:18.420 --> 02:53:19.450
<v Speaker 2>there's always speculation.</v>

6139
02:53:19.451 --> 02:53:21.100
<v Speaker 2>What's been proven about voter fraud?</v>

6140
02:53:21.130 --> 02:53:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything you've been proven or no,</v>

6141
02:53:23.500 --> 02:53:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

6142
02:53:24.010 --> 02:53:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6143
02:53:24.610 --> 02:53:25.450
<v Speaker 2>it's not something,</v>

6144
02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:27.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that uh,</v>

6145
02:53:27.460 --> 02:53:27.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6146
02:53:27.730 --> 02:53:29.710
<v Speaker 2>that shocked where I need them to evidence.</v>

6147
02:53:29.711 --> 02:53:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6148
02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:31.900
<v Speaker 2>it's like telling me that some horror fucks.</v>

6149
02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:32.531
<v Speaker 2>Some other dude,</v>

6150
02:53:32.531 --> 02:53:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to,</v>

6151
02:53:33.340 --> 02:53:33.491
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6152
02:53:33.491 --> 02:53:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I need to fucking video.</v>

6153
02:53:34.601 --> 02:53:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6154
02:53:34.960 --> 02:53:36.070
<v Speaker 2>it would just be nice.</v>

6155
02:53:36.310 --> 02:53:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Just be nice.</v>

6156
02:53:37.210 --> 02:53:38.043
<v Speaker 2>Make sense?</v>

6157
02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:41.770
<v Speaker 2>It would just be nice if you couldn't get rich running the government.</v>

6158
02:53:42.040 --> 02:53:44.020
<v Speaker 2>It'd be nice if you could just,</v>

6159
02:53:44.021 --> 02:53:44.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6160
02:53:44.471 --> 02:53:46.150
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you could do this to get rich.</v>

6161
02:53:46.270 --> 02:53:47.020
<v Speaker 2>You just can't do it.</v>

6162
02:53:47.020 --> 02:53:47.853
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

6163
02:53:48.250 --> 02:53:49.083
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6164
02:53:50.020 --> 02:53:50.441
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

6165
02:53:50.441 --> 02:53:51.430
<v Speaker 2>there's this no hope.</v>

6166
02:53:51.640 --> 02:53:52.310
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

6167
02:53:52.310 --> 02:53:53.050
<v Speaker 2>there are too many,</v>

6168
02:53:53.050 --> 02:53:55.180
<v Speaker 2>too many people are just there with it.</v>

6169
02:53:55.210 --> 02:53:56.860
<v Speaker 2>They just got him on that media.</v>

6170
02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:59.140
<v Speaker 2>They're addicted to that media.</v>

6171
02:53:59.170 --> 02:54:01.000
<v Speaker 2>There's just no way around it.</v>

6172
02:54:01.450 --> 02:54:02.283
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a,</v>

6173
02:54:02.530 --> 02:54:05.620
<v Speaker 2>there's a quote that I posted on Instagram from Jim Morrison,</v>

6174
02:54:06.010 --> 02:54:06.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6175
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.920
<v Speaker 2>at him.</v>

6176
02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he didn't make it up,</v>

6177
02:54:08.380 --> 02:54:12.790
<v Speaker 2>but it says those who control the media control the mind is that says Jim</v>

6178
02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:12.791
<v Speaker 2>Morris.</v>

6179
02:54:12.791 --> 02:54:14.620
<v Speaker 2>That got a bunch of it was,</v>

6180
02:54:14.860 --> 02:54:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it was,</v>

6181
02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:16.953
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

6182
02:54:17.260 --> 02:54:17.830
<v Speaker 2>that isn't,</v>

6183
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

6184
02:54:19.330 --> 02:54:21.010
<v Speaker 2>that's everything right there.</v>

6185
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6186
02:54:21.521 --> 02:54:21.731
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6187
02:54:21.731 --> 02:54:22.091
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

6188
02:54:22.091 --> 02:54:24.620
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is today isn't the media.</v>

6189
02:54:24.621 --> 02:54:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

6190
02:54:25.090 --> 02:54:25.570
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

6191
02:54:25.570 --> 02:54:27.430
<v Speaker 2>what a slippery grip they have on it.</v>

6192
02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:29.230
<v Speaker 2>It seems so slippery than me.</v>

6193
02:54:29.350 --> 02:54:29.861
<v Speaker 2>They got it.</v>

6194
02:54:29.861 --> 02:54:31.270
<v Speaker 2>They got it all under control.</v>

6195
02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's a lot.</v>

6196
02:54:32.170 --> 02:54:34.540
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like there's everybody's the media now,</v>

6197
02:54:34.860 --> 02:54:37.170
<v Speaker 2>like there's so many different accesses,</v>

6198
02:54:37.430 --> 02:54:39.210
<v Speaker 2>so many points of access to trick them.</v>

6199
02:54:39.220 --> 02:54:40.360
<v Speaker 2>They still took them all day,</v>

6200
02:54:40.820 --> 02:54:41.800
<v Speaker 2>still tricking them all day.</v>

6201
02:54:41.810 --> 02:54:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

6202
02:54:42.010 --> 02:54:43.320
<v Speaker 2>we got Hillary on Jimmy saying,</v>

6203
02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:44.380
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't this be,</v>

6204
02:54:44.710 --> 02:54:46.870
<v Speaker 2>this could be someone's main source of entertainment.</v>

6205
02:54:46.871 --> 02:54:47.171
<v Speaker 2>Slash,</v>

6206
02:54:47.171 --> 02:54:50.920
<v Speaker 2>news and this we would be at their media and how would we be tricking them?</v>

6207
02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:54.130
<v Speaker 2>But what we're trying to do is we're actually trying to tell the truth,</v>

6208
02:54:54.131 --> 02:54:55.450
<v Speaker 2>like we're trying to get to the truth.</v>

6209
02:54:55.700 --> 02:54:55.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6210
02:54:55.990 --> 02:54:58.270
<v Speaker 2>usually what you see in the media,</v>

6211
02:54:58.300 --> 02:55:00.010
<v Speaker 2>it has an agenda behind it.</v>

6212
02:55:01.060 --> 02:55:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Keep talking this through.</v>

6213
02:55:01.850 --> 02:55:02.681
<v Speaker 2>I don't have an agenda.</v>

6214
02:55:02.681 --> 02:55:04.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making money off conspiracy</v>

6215
02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:04.791
<v Speaker 4>theory money.</v>

6216
02:55:04.791 --> 02:55:05.211
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

6217
02:55:05.211 --> 02:55:06.050
<v Speaker 4>There's no agenda here.</v>

6218
02:55:06.290 --> 02:55:08.000
<v Speaker 4>So conspiracy theorist,</v>

6219
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:08.983
<v Speaker 4>no matter how,</v>

6220
02:55:08.990 --> 02:55:09.621
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>

6221
02:55:09.621 --> 02:55:13.340
<v Speaker 4>the CIA created the word conspiracy theorist to demonize like people that are</v>

6222
02:55:13.341 --> 02:55:14.570
<v Speaker 4>against the establishment.</v>

6223
02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:16.310
<v Speaker 4>So that's not a conspiracy theory.</v>

6224
02:55:16.370 --> 02:55:19.790
<v Speaker 4>Can the word conspiracy theories to make people seem like tin hat foil,</v>

6225
02:55:20.090 --> 02:55:20.960
<v Speaker 4>tin foil,</v>

6226
02:55:20.961 --> 02:55:22.790
<v Speaker 4>hat wearing Wackos.</v>

6227
02:55:22.850 --> 02:55:23.683
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

6228
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:24.703
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6229
02:55:24.980 --> 02:55:25.813
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6230
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:26.930
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the motive,</v>

6231
02:55:26.931 --> 02:55:29.900
<v Speaker 4>like what's the motive behind being a conspiracy theorist?</v>

6232
02:55:30.170 --> 02:55:32.150
<v Speaker 4>No matter how paranoid you are,</v>

6233
02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:33.710
<v Speaker 4>the most power,</v>

6234
02:55:33.711 --> 02:55:34.490
<v Speaker 4>noise,</v>

6235
02:55:34.490 --> 02:55:37.430
<v Speaker 4>worst case scenario type people when you,</v>

6236
02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:37.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6237
02:55:37.990 --> 02:55:38.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6238
02:55:38.210 --> 02:55:41.690
<v Speaker 4>some people are more paranoid than others and they jumped a more conclusions</v>

6239
02:55:41.691 --> 02:55:42.111
<v Speaker 4>than others.</v>

6240
02:55:42.111 --> 02:55:44.240
<v Speaker 4>But all conspiracy theorists,</v>

6241
02:55:44.510 --> 02:55:45.590
<v Speaker 4>they have one thing in common.</v>

6242
02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:46.573
<v Speaker 4>They're not trying to,</v>

6243
02:55:46.780 --> 02:55:47.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6244
02:55:47.140 --> 02:55:49.310
<v Speaker 4>they're worried about their family,</v>

6245
02:55:49.311 --> 02:55:50.300
<v Speaker 4>their health,</v>

6246
02:55:50.570 --> 02:55:50.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6247
02:55:50.781 --> 02:55:51.950
<v Speaker 4>even if it is paranoia,</v>

6248
02:55:51.951 --> 02:55:53.210
<v Speaker 4>maybe they go too far.</v>

6249
02:55:53.570 --> 02:55:54.403
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

6250
02:55:54.530 --> 02:55:55.151
<v Speaker 4>it's what's,</v>

6251
02:55:55.151 --> 02:55:55.360
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

6252
02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:56.360
<v Speaker 4>it's what's in the heart.</v>

6253
02:55:56.361 --> 02:55:59.900
<v Speaker 4>We're concerned about the people and what's going on and how we're being fooled</v>

6254
02:55:59.901 --> 02:56:03.680
<v Speaker 4>and where we're headed and where we're led and all this bullshit that's going on</v>

6255
02:56:03.681 --> 02:56:04.460
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>

6256
02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:05.690
<v Speaker 4>We're concerned with that.</v>

6257
02:56:05.930 --> 02:56:07.220
<v Speaker 4>The people on the other side,</v>

6258
02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:09.290
<v Speaker 4>they're not concerned with that at all.</v>

6259
02:56:09.890 --> 02:56:14.510
<v Speaker 4>The people in power are not concerned with the right thing.</v>

6260
02:56:14.690 --> 02:56:17.600
<v Speaker 4>They're concerned about one thing and one thing only.</v>

6261
02:56:17.601 --> 02:56:21.290
<v Speaker 4>Keeping as much power as they can for as long as possible.</v>

6262
02:56:21.291 --> 02:56:22.730
<v Speaker 4>And no matter what you see conspiracy.</v>

6263
02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:24.170
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

6264
02:56:25.850 --> 02:56:26.421
<v Speaker 4>What are we talking about?</v>

6265
02:56:26.421 --> 02:56:27.260
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about like,</v>

6266
02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:28.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6267
02:56:28.060 --> 02:56:28.620
<v Speaker 4>like I was,</v>

6268
02:56:28.620 --> 02:56:29.130
<v Speaker 4>I was at,</v>

6269
02:56:29.130 --> 02:56:30.290
<v Speaker 4>I was having a conversation,</v>

6270
02:56:30.380 --> 02:56:32.800
<v Speaker 4>I was having a conversation about Alex Jones with my,</v>

6271
02:56:32.830 --> 02:56:33.351
<v Speaker 4>my buddy,</v>

6272
02:56:33.351 --> 02:56:33.600
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6273
02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:34.520
<v Speaker 4>Dawson who thinks like,</v>

6274
02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:34.881
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

6275
02:56:34.881 --> 02:56:35.780
<v Speaker 4>he's just too paranoid.</v>

6276
02:56:35.781 --> 02:56:36.350
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

6277
02:56:36.350 --> 02:56:36.741
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>

6278
02:56:36.741 --> 02:56:37.670
<v Speaker 4>he's just too crazy.</v>

6279
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:38.870

02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:45.200
<v Speaker 4>He may be a little more um,</v>

6285
02:56:45.290 --> 02:56:47.300
<v Speaker 4>concerned slash paranoid,</v>

6286
02:56:47.301 --> 02:56:47.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6287

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6294
02:56:59.811 --> 02:57:01.490
<v Speaker 4>no conspiracy theorists Ha.</v>

6295
02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:05.270
<v Speaker 4>It's all theories based on mostly circumstantial evidence.</v>

6296
02:57:05.271 --> 02:57:06.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not like raw real evidence.</v>

6297
02:57:06.621 --> 02:57:07.280
<v Speaker 4>We're just saying,</v>

6298
02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:07.731
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

6299
02:57:07.731 --> 02:57:12.620
<v Speaker 4>you've got you guys done this before and you've done this for forever and it</v>

6300
02:57:12.621 --> 02:57:14.570
<v Speaker 4>seems like it's happening again based on that.</v>

6301
02:57:14.571 --> 02:57:15.770
<v Speaker 4>And based on that and based on this,</v>

6302
02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:16.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6303
02:57:16.430 --> 02:57:17.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6304
02:57:17.511 --> 02:57:19.640
<v Speaker 4>you guys are probably still doing this shit.</v>

6305
02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:20.121
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6306
02:57:20.121 --> 02:57:21.520
<v Speaker 4>it's still the same criminals are look,</v>

6307
02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:21.761
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

6308
02:57:21.761 --> 02:57:22.594
<v Speaker 4>it's all good now.</v>

6309
02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:22.851
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6310
02:57:22.851 --> 02:57:24.590
<v Speaker 4>they used to do it after 50 years.</v>

6311
02:57:24.591 --> 02:57:26.690
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to prove a conspiracy theory.</v>

6312
02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:28.430
<v Speaker 4>What are we talking about exactly though?</v>

6313
02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:29.780
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about,</v>

6314
02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:30.850
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6315
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:32.810
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about,</v>

6316
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:35.060
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6317
02:57:35.060 --> 02:57:35.810
<v Speaker 4>Alex Jones,</v>

6318
02:57:35.810 --> 02:57:36.643
<v Speaker 4>Alex.</v>

6319
02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:39.500
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't matter that he's so paranoid.</v>

6320
02:57:39.501 --> 02:57:40.940
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't have to be right about everything.</v>

6321
02:57:40.941 --> 02:57:42.470
<v Speaker 4>He's sometimes he's too paranoid,</v>

6322
02:57:42.750 --> 02:57:45.470
<v Speaker 4>but I'm talking about Alex Jones is his heart's in it.</v>

6323
02:57:45.650 --> 02:57:48.320
<v Speaker 4>I know one thing about Alex Jones is he's not a shill.</v>

6324
02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:49.340
<v Speaker 4>He's for real.</v>

6325
02:57:49.780 --> 02:57:53.330
<v Speaker 4>He maybe he stays away from certain subjects getting all,</v>

6326
02:57:53.340 --> 02:57:54.050
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

6327
02:57:54.050 --> 02:57:54.801
<v Speaker 4>maybe he does,</v>

6328
02:57:54.801 --> 02:57:56.810
<v Speaker 4>but overall the message is,</v>

6329
02:57:57.170 --> 02:57:57.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6330

02:58:00.231 --> 02:58:00.650
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

6335
02:58:00.650 --> 02:58:02.370
<v Speaker 4>don't buy</v>

6336
02:58:02.370 --> 02:58:03.840
<v Speaker 2>into this game,</v>

6337
02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:05.650
<v Speaker 2>this game show that,</v>

6338
02:58:05.651 --> 02:58:06.630
<v Speaker 2>that were being fed.</v>

6339
02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Don't buy into that.</v>

6340
02:58:07.780 --> 02:58:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6341
02:58:08.370 --> 02:58:09.203
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6342
02:58:09.330 --> 02:58:10.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's going on.</v>

6343
02:58:10.590 --> 02:58:11.250
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

6344
02:58:11.250 --> 02:58:11.760
<v Speaker 2>unless,</v>

6345
02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:13.620
<v Speaker 2>unless you're sitting me sitting here telling me,</v>

6346
02:58:13.621 --> 02:58:17.050
<v Speaker 2>you believe what you see when you see someone speaking and CNN,</v>

6347
02:58:18.180 --> 02:58:18.870
<v Speaker 8>do you think he would?</v>

6348
02:58:18.870 --> 02:58:21.270
<v Speaker 8>Do you think he believes everything he's saying?</v>

6349
02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:23.000
<v Speaker 8>W what does it match?</v>

6350
02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:27.920
<v Speaker 8>There's people on ESPN that there's no way they believe everything they show.</v>

6351
02:58:27.940 --> 02:58:28.890
<v Speaker 8>They used to be on ESPN,</v>

6352
02:58:28.891 --> 02:58:29.660
<v Speaker 8>I should say.</v>

6353
02:58:29.660 --> 02:58:29.971
<v Speaker 8>No Way.</v>

6354
02:58:29.971 --> 02:58:32.520
<v Speaker 8>They believe everything they're saying cause it's contradicts itself.</v>

6355
02:58:32.820 --> 02:58:34.860
<v Speaker 8>When looked at what do you mean guys in slack,</v>

6356
02:58:34.861 --> 02:58:36.960
<v Speaker 8>CNN broadcast on Espn,</v>

6357
02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:42.120
<v Speaker 8>just guys talking about sports will say something very salacious and two days</v>

6358
02:58:42.121 --> 02:58:44.100
<v Speaker 8>later say something that contradicts itself,</v>

6359
02:58:44.490 --> 02:58:48.210
<v Speaker 8>but they're just doing it because that's their job and they're paid to talk all</v>

6360
02:58:48.211 --> 02:58:48.750
<v Speaker 8>day long.</v>

6361
02:58:48.750 --> 02:58:49.583
<v Speaker 8>Of course.</v>

6362
02:58:50.030 --> 02:58:52.500
<v Speaker 8>And that turned into other people that like that are also paid.</v>

6363
02:58:52.810 --> 02:58:53.700
<v Speaker 2>The Alex Jones,</v>

6364
02:58:54.190 --> 02:58:56.100
<v Speaker 2>John Jones is completely independent.</v>

6365
02:58:56.110 --> 02:58:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I've known Alex literally for,</v>

6366
02:58:58.840 --> 02:58:59.651
<v Speaker 2>I hate literally,</v>

6367
02:58:59.651 --> 02:59:04.120
<v Speaker 2>but I've only known him since 99 and he's always been like this and he's been</v>

6368
02:59:04.121 --> 02:59:04.931
<v Speaker 2>doing it himself,</v>

6369
02:59:04.931 --> 02:59:06.760
<v Speaker 2>doing his radio show and do it now.</v>

6370
02:59:06.770 --> 02:59:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Is Internet show he's getting paid to do.</v>

6371
02:59:09.370 --> 02:59:10.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6372
02:59:11.290 --> 02:59:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

6373
02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:13.750
<v Speaker 2>if that dude had a fucking insurance job,</v>

6374
02:59:13.751 --> 02:59:14.321
<v Speaker 2>he'd spill it.</v>

6375
02:59:14.321 --> 02:59:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Still be talking about this stuff.</v>

6376
02:59:15.790 --> 02:59:16.750
<v Speaker 2>He talks about this stuff.</v>

6377
02:59:18.470 --> 02:59:21.700
<v Speaker 2>You could be at a honky tonk bar to clock in the morning and it was the black</v>

6378
02:59:21.701 --> 02:59:24.130
<v Speaker 2>helicopters and the cattle mutilations are connected.</v>

6379
02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:28.060
<v Speaker 2>You can't have one without the guard that at all.</v>

6380
02:59:29.320 --> 02:59:30.760
<v Speaker 2>When you listen to him talk.</v>

6381
02:59:31.500 --> 02:59:32.190
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

6382
02:59:32.190 --> 02:59:32.950
<v Speaker 2>He's very,</v>

6383
02:59:32.950 --> 02:59:33.940
<v Speaker 2>he knows his shit.</v>

6384
02:59:34.090 --> 02:59:34.923
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>

6385
02:59:34.990 --> 02:59:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes he exaggerates on some shit like a y two k exaggerate on that.</v>

6386
02:59:39.500 --> 02:59:41.530
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people thought she was coming to an end.</v>

6387
02:59:41.980 --> 02:59:43.270
<v Speaker 2>We got a real one example.</v>

6388
02:59:43.390 --> 02:59:44.081
<v Speaker 2>Here's one example.</v>

6389
02:59:44.081 --> 02:59:45.280
<v Speaker 2>There was a problem though.</v>

6390
02:59:45.281 --> 02:59:47.020
<v Speaker 2>When you have a business of doom,</v>

6391
02:59:47.350 --> 02:59:48.610
<v Speaker 2>you're always looking for doom.</v>

6392
02:59:48.910 --> 02:59:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Like that's your business,</v>

6393
02:59:50.170 --> 02:59:50.530
<v Speaker 2>will they've,</v>

6394
02:59:50.530 --> 02:59:51.311
<v Speaker 2>you're selling doom,</v>

6395
02:59:51.311 --> 02:59:52.150
<v Speaker 2>you gotta look for doom.</v>

6396
02:59:52.300 --> 02:59:54.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not these not right a lot.</v>

6397
02:59:54.100 --> 02:59:55.450
<v Speaker 2>He's right about a lot of things.</v>

6398
02:59:55.690 --> 02:59:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Like he was right about a bunch of shit that no one ever thought about that.</v>

6399
02:59:59.531 --> 03:00:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Now we think of as,</v>

6400
03:00:01.570 --> 03:00:02.830
<v Speaker 2>because of Edward Snowden,</v>

6401
03:00:03.010 --> 03:00:06.210
<v Speaker 2>we think of just as a part of the problem that he was,</v>

6402
03:00:06.211 --> 03:00:06.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6403
03:00:06.370 --> 03:00:09.700
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about worldwide surveillance of emails,</v>

6404
03:00:10.060 --> 03:00:14.800
<v Speaker 2>emails and text messages and he was talking about that all the Lori time actions</v>

6405
03:00:14.801 --> 03:00:15.581
<v Speaker 2>on the inside.</v>

6406
03:00:15.581 --> 03:00:16.590
<v Speaker 2>He's got sources did,</v>

6407
03:00:16.591 --> 03:00:17.470
<v Speaker 2>he won't reveal their name.</v>

6408
03:00:17.471 --> 03:00:18.700
<v Speaker 2>He's getting a lot of information.</v>

6409
03:00:18.701 --> 03:00:19.510
<v Speaker 2>It's proven right.</v>

6410
03:00:19.510 --> 03:00:23.200
<v Speaker 2>He knows that we're living in the goddamn matrix to,</v>

6411
03:00:23.210 --> 03:00:28.210
<v Speaker 2>if you believe the thing that Burns me the most is super smart people,</v>

6412
03:00:28.360 --> 03:00:29.230
<v Speaker 2>really smart,</v>

6413
03:00:29.710 --> 03:00:30.670
<v Speaker 2>and they just,</v>

6414
03:00:30.940 --> 03:00:34.030
<v Speaker 2>they know the people running shit are,</v>

6415
03:00:34.031 --> 03:00:35.130
<v Speaker 2>are controlling us.</v>

6416
03:00:35.270 --> 03:00:36.370
<v Speaker 2>They know this.</v>

6417
03:00:36.550 --> 03:00:37.300
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>

6418
03:00:37.300 --> 03:00:41.080
<v Speaker 2>when it comes down to any topic they side with,</v>

6419
03:00:41.530 --> 03:00:43.690
<v Speaker 2>there were the criminals were that,</v>

6420
03:00:44.020 --> 03:00:48.850
<v Speaker 2>that burns me more than anything is you know that criminals,</v>

6421
03:00:48.940 --> 03:00:49.601
<v Speaker 2>you know they are,</v>

6422
03:00:49.601 --> 03:00:50.800
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to side with them.</v>

6423
03:00:50.801 --> 03:00:51.700
<v Speaker 2>You're going to believe them.</v>

6424
03:00:51.910 --> 03:00:53.530
<v Speaker 2>You don't criminals.</v>

6425
03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:55.120
<v Speaker 2>They have to prove everything.</v>

6426
03:00:55.180 --> 03:00:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some things they're saying are true,</v>

6427
03:00:57.010 --> 03:00:58.290
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to believe you.</v>

6428
03:00:58.291 --> 03:00:58.661
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

6429
03:00:58.661 --> 03:00:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe Shit.</v>

6430
03:00:59.531 --> 03:01:00.010
<v Speaker 2>You say just like</v>

6431
03:01:00.010 --> 03:01:02.770
<v Speaker 4>some fucking liar that you know some dude at the comedy store,</v>

6432
03:01:02.920 --> 03:01:04.660
<v Speaker 4>some duty just lies about fucking everything.</v>

6433
03:01:04.780 --> 03:01:05.613
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to believe,</v>

6434
03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:07.450
<v Speaker 4>even though some shit he's telling you it might be true.</v>

6435
03:01:07.451 --> 03:01:07.960
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

6436
03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:11.530
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to prove all that shit cause you fucking lie about</v>

6437
03:01:11.531 --> 03:01:13.480
<v Speaker 4>everything you lie about where you're from.</v>

6438
03:01:13.660 --> 03:01:15.400
<v Speaker 4>You were never a wrestling champion.</v>

6439
03:01:15.550 --> 03:01:16.730
<v Speaker 4>You didn't fucking Oh no,</v>

6440
03:01:16.731 --> 03:01:17.650
<v Speaker 4>God Damn Harley,</v>

6441
03:01:17.740 --> 03:01:18.580
<v Speaker 4>you're a fucking liar.</v>

6442
03:01:18.581 --> 03:01:20.530
<v Speaker 4>Why am I going to believe anything you say?</v>

6443
03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:21.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going on.</v>

6444
03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:23.560
<v Speaker 4>So I think we should,</v>

6445
03:01:23.830 --> 03:01:25.270
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to conspiracy theories,</v>

6446
03:01:25.271 --> 03:01:26.020
<v Speaker 4>we should,</v>

6447
03:01:26.020 --> 03:01:26.500
<v Speaker 4>we should,</v>

6448
03:01:26.500 --> 03:01:31.110
<v Speaker 4>we should always be at least skeptical of the official story that may be true or</v>

6449
03:01:31.120 --> 03:01:31.601
<v Speaker 4>maybe not,</v>

6450
03:01:31.601 --> 03:01:32.620
<v Speaker 4>but I mean</v>

6451
03:01:33.750 --> 03:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>was here right now and I'll put a tie on him and a bat Mr. Official story.</v>

6452
03:01:38.670 --> 03:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Now you guys can Duke it out.</v>

6453
03:01:40.140 --> 03:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6454
03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:41.431
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to do that.</v>

6455
03:01:41.431 --> 03:01:41.731
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

6456
03:01:41.731 --> 03:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I sat enough just like come on.</v>

6457
03:01:44.041 --> 03:01:44.701
<v Speaker 1>People are done.</v>

6458
03:01:44.701 --> 03:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Question everything.</v>

6459
03:01:45.780 --> 03:01:46.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6460
03:01:46.141 --> 03:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point in time we can't keep talking about this.</v>

6461
03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6462
03:01:52.140 --> 03:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>what'd you think about um,</v>

6463
03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>some other fights that were happening?</v>

6464
03:01:57.210 --> 03:01:59.850
<v Speaker 1>How bout trying steer this UFC fights.</v>

6465
03:01:59.910 --> 03:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Try to steer this away in this fucking conspiracy swamp that we keep falling</v>

6466
03:02:04.261 --> 03:02:05.094
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

6467
03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Non nonproductive.</v>

6468
03:02:07.410 --> 03:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is not opening people's minds.</v>

6469
03:02:10.980 --> 03:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not always right.</v>

6470
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:13.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not always right.</v>

6471
03:02:13.420 --> 03:02:14.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff that's getting,</v>

6472
03:02:14.820 --> 03:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>trying to get everything right.</v>

6473
03:02:16.380 --> 03:02:16.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6474
03:02:16.651 --> 03:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>But it's a giant quagmire.</v>

6475
03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Like if you start chasing down whether or not the CA created Jim Morrison,</v>

6476
03:02:22.921 --> 03:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>like that shit takes a lot of time and hours and hours of speculation and</v>

6477
03:02:27.061 --> 03:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>thinking it's not worth it.</v>

6478
03:02:29.270 --> 03:02:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Just like very inner smoke,</v>

6479
03:02:30.680 --> 03:02:31.111
<v Speaker 1>a joint,</v>

6480
03:02:31.111 --> 03:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>enjoy the music.</v>

6481
03:02:31.770 --> 03:02:32.780
<v Speaker 1>It's very entertaining.</v>

6482
03:02:32.830 --> 03:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>You feel like it's like,</v>

6483
03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:36.640
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like an open ended puzzle that your plan</v>

6484
03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:39.580
<v Speaker 4>people are in the game of Thrones.</v>

6485
03:02:39.581 --> 03:02:39.911
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

6486
03:02:39.911 --> 03:02:41.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not real at all.</v>

6487
03:02:41.621 --> 03:02:43.930
<v Speaker 4>It's a made up that story with all,</v>

6488
03:02:43.931 --> 03:02:44.411
<v Speaker 4>they get loud.</v>

6489
03:02:44.411 --> 03:02:45.760
<v Speaker 4>They wa I want some made up,</v>

6490
03:02:45.820 --> 03:02:47.770
<v Speaker 4>but they don't want to watch like a documentary,</v>

6491
03:02:47.920 --> 03:02:49.190
<v Speaker 4>like a conspiracy documentary.</v>

6492
03:02:49.191 --> 03:02:50.020
<v Speaker 4>They maybe,</v>

6493
03:02:50.020 --> 03:02:50.920
<v Speaker 4>maybe not true.</v>

6494
03:02:50.921 --> 03:02:51.700
<v Speaker 4>Maybe exaggerated,</v>

6495
03:02:51.700 --> 03:02:52.990
<v Speaker 4>but God damn,</v>

6496
03:02:53.170 --> 03:02:54.730
<v Speaker 4>it's really bit,</v>

6497
03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:56.950
<v Speaker 4>it's close to the truth and maybe it is true,</v>

6498
03:02:57.220 --> 03:02:57.731
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

6499
03:02:57.731 --> 03:02:58.720
<v Speaker 4>we ain't gonna Watch that.</v>

6500
03:02:58.810 --> 03:03:01.240
<v Speaker 4>We want to watch total fake shit.</v>

6501
03:03:01.390 --> 03:03:03.030
<v Speaker 4>I just want to make sure it's all thanks.</v>

6502
03:03:03.070 --> 03:03:03.280
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

6503
03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>total fake shit.</v>

6504
03:03:04.331 --> 03:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>At least like I don't feel stupid because I know that it's fake.</v>

6505
03:03:08.381 --> 03:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm enjoying something.</v>

6506
03:03:09.190 --> 03:03:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being watched conspiracy theories as it's it.</v>

6507
03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>It's probably fake,</v>

6508
03:03:13.541 --> 03:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>but who knows.</v>

6509
03:03:14.290 --> 03:03:14.741
<v Speaker 1>There may be.</v>

6510
03:03:14.741 --> 03:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>There's a little too tight man.</v>

6511
03:03:16.271 --> 03:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are fun too.</v>

6512
03:03:17.261 --> 03:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

6513
03:03:17.530 --> 03:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>My favorite one though was the one where the dude thought that there was rod's</v>

6514
03:03:21.011 --> 03:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>flying around.</v>

6515
03:03:22.010 --> 03:03:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6516
03:03:22.370 --> 03:03:26.040
<v Speaker 1>turned out just the way camera's view can move faster.</v>

6517
03:03:26.060 --> 03:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Close that conspiracy theory didn't last at all.</v>

6518
03:03:28.410 --> 03:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

6519
03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:29.531
<v Speaker 1>that's proof.</v>

6520
03:03:29.531 --> 03:03:30.180
<v Speaker 1>The conspiracy.</v>

6521
03:03:30.180 --> 03:03:32.580
<v Speaker 1>There's what was rotten motherfuckers a little drop one.</v>

6522
03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Drop it hot dude.</v>

6523
03:03:33.761 --> 03:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>It was drop.</v>

6524
03:03:34.420 --> 03:03:34.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6525
03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>cause they're stuck with that.</v>

6526
03:03:35.801 --> 03:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird thing we saw there was nobody wasn't dropped.</v>

6527
03:03:39.220 --> 03:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>That guy came to one of my fucking Q and A's and they believe that.</v>

6528
03:03:42.281 --> 03:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>See people still believe that his,</v>

6529
03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>the guy who made the documentary,</v>

6530
03:03:45.491 --> 03:03:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I think his name is Jose Escamia.</v>

6531
03:03:47.300 --> 03:03:49.530
<v Speaker 1>No gentlemen is a fine gentleman.</v>

6532
03:03:49.531 --> 03:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>This is not a bad man at all.</v>

6533
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>But he came to one of the UFT,</v>

6534
03:03:52.780 --> 03:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>see things and he waited in line to ask me a question and he yelled it out.</v>

6535
03:03:56.140 --> 03:03:57.440
<v Speaker 1>The products that</v>

6536
03:03:58.090 --> 03:03:58.620
<v Speaker 3>I have done,</v>

6537
03:03:58.620 --> 03:03:59.440
<v Speaker 3>documentaries,</v>

6538
03:03:59.440 --> 03:04:00.840
<v Speaker 3>you have city of</v>

6539
03:04:03.080 --> 03:04:05.600
<v Speaker 3>that monster quest show is what fucked him up.</v>

6540
03:04:05.601 --> 03:04:06.434
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that?</v>

6541
03:04:06.860 --> 03:04:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6542
03:04:07.370 --> 03:04:10.370
<v Speaker 3>It was that monster quest show that show that they were doing for the history</v>

6543
03:04:10.371 --> 03:04:12.470
<v Speaker 3>channel with the monsters?</v>

6544
03:04:12.471 --> 03:04:12.621
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6545
03:04:12.621 --> 03:04:13.454
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened.</v>

6546
03:04:13.700 --> 03:04:16.700
<v Speaker 3>Monster Quest did an experiment on one side,</v>

6547
03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:21.460
<v Speaker 3>they used a high speed camera that does like like very high rates of frame a</v>

6548
03:04:21.500 --> 03:04:24.770
<v Speaker 3>frame rates and he could film like slow motion shit.</v>

6549
03:04:24.771 --> 03:04:26.810
<v Speaker 3>So you see like every pixel it looks perfect.</v>

6550
03:04:26.930 --> 03:04:29.090
<v Speaker 3>You know they do that with those slow mo cameras.</v>

6551
03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:31.490
<v Speaker 3>They could film at a very high rate of speed,</v>

6552
03:04:31.870 --> 03:04:36.870
<v Speaker 3>like really calm kin next to it and then next to it was a shitty camera and the</v>

6553
03:04:36.891 --> 03:04:40.640
<v Speaker 3>shitty camera couldn't capture a quick enough so everything got elongated.</v>

6554
03:04:40.641 --> 03:04:43.850
<v Speaker 3>So the image got blurred and elongated and it looks like tubes.</v>

6555
03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:45.170
<v Speaker 3>We're flying through the sky,</v>

6556
03:04:45.320 --> 03:04:48.830
<v Speaker 3>but two cameras side by side captured completely different things.</v>

6557
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:51.140
<v Speaker 3>One of them captured super obvious bugs.</v>

6558
03:04:51.290 --> 03:04:52.670
<v Speaker 3>He gets slowed down in slow motion.</v>

6559
03:04:52.671 --> 03:04:55.700
<v Speaker 3>You can see there are bugs and then it would literally cross over into the other</v>

6560
03:04:55.701 --> 03:04:58.790
<v Speaker 3>camera and turn into this tube because it was just moving too quick.</v>

6561
03:04:58.820 --> 03:04:59.780
<v Speaker 3>So it's an artifact.</v>

6562
03:04:59.810 --> 03:05:00.643
<v Speaker 3>It's what's called a,</v>

6563
03:05:00.900 --> 03:05:02.850
<v Speaker 6>that was a conspiracy theory that lasts.</v>

6564
03:05:02.860 --> 03:05:05.850
<v Speaker 6>That was hot for about maybe three years,</v>

6565
03:05:05.980 --> 03:05:07.800
<v Speaker 6>and then we even we even,</v>

6566
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:08.580
<v Speaker 6>we were in debt.</v>

6567
03:05:08.580 --> 03:05:09.690
<v Speaker 6>I didn't really get high</v>

6568
03:05:11.430 --> 03:05:12.263
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

6569
03:05:12.460 --> 03:05:14.760
<v Speaker 6>There's fucking aliens flying around everywhere.</v>

6570
03:05:14.790 --> 03:05:16.110
<v Speaker 6>We thought those were aliens.</v>

6571
03:05:16.140 --> 03:05:16.771
<v Speaker 6>They were alive.</v>

6572
03:05:16.771 --> 03:05:17.101
<v Speaker 6>They were like,</v>

6573
03:05:17.101 --> 03:05:17.761
<v Speaker 6>if these things,</v>

6574
03:05:17.761 --> 03:05:19.110
<v Speaker 6>they're invisible snakes.</v>

6575
03:05:19.150 --> 03:05:22.400
<v Speaker 6>I remember we were convinced that God,</v>

6576
03:05:22.410 --> 03:05:23.520
<v Speaker 6>there was no Twitter back then.</v>

6577
03:05:23.521 --> 03:05:24.354
<v Speaker 6>They would've,</v>

6578
03:05:24.450 --> 03:05:25.830
<v Speaker 6>they would've kept bringing that shit up.</v>

6579
03:05:26.540 --> 03:05:29.730
<v Speaker 6>So that's proof that if we get debunked proof,</v>

6580
03:05:30.180 --> 03:05:31.480
<v Speaker 6>they were not like married to it.</v>

6581
03:05:31.481 --> 03:05:32.520
<v Speaker 6>I'm not married to that,</v>

6582
03:05:32.720 --> 03:05:33.553
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

6583
03:05:34.620 --> 03:05:34.891
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

6584
03:05:34.891 --> 03:05:37.890
<v Speaker 3>you can't see with your eyes it and you need a video cam to see,</v>

6585
03:05:38.100 --> 03:05:38.850
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

6586
03:05:38.850 --> 03:05:41.940
<v Speaker 3>We were thinking that like science hadn't discovered and then the web,</v>

6587
03:05:41.941 --> 03:05:43.650
<v Speaker 3>but then you don't want one time we were like,</v>

6588
03:05:43.651 --> 03:05:44.490
<v Speaker 3>where are the dead ones?</v>

6589
03:05:45.240 --> 03:05:46.230
<v Speaker 3>Where's all the dead ones?</v>

6590
03:05:47.940 --> 03:05:49.410
<v Speaker 6>Lion Fish live forever.</v>

6591
03:05:49.440 --> 03:05:50.101
<v Speaker 6>What if it's real?</v>

6592
03:05:50.101 --> 03:05:50.491
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to go,</v>

6593
03:05:50.491 --> 03:05:52.020
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to live rods.</v>

6594
03:05:52.050 --> 03:05:52.680
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>

6595
03:05:52.680 --> 03:05:55.440
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that monstrous thing was bullshit.</v>

6596
03:05:55.710 --> 03:05:56.543
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

6597
03:05:56.550 --> 03:05:58.560
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure it's going to be a rod guy.</v>

6598
03:05:58.730 --> 03:06:01.820
<v Speaker 3>But you imagine if you're the poor dude who made that documentary and you've got</v>

6599
03:06:01.821 --> 03:06:03.530
<v Speaker 3>all this money invested in those rods.</v>

6600
03:06:03.560 --> 03:06:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I never hear anybody talking about raw.</v>

6601
03:06:05.210 --> 03:06:05.441
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6602
03:06:05.441 --> 03:06:06.040
<v Speaker 3>they're done.</v>

6603
03:06:06.040 --> 03:06:07.540
<v Speaker 6>Someone did come up to me and say,</v>

6604
03:06:07.690 --> 03:06:08.490
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

6605
03:06:08.490 --> 03:06:09.323
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6606
03:06:09.330 --> 03:06:12.340
<v Speaker 6>if you heard that conspiracy theory where there's no forests,</v>

6607
03:06:13.060 --> 03:06:13.893
<v Speaker 6>have you heard about this?</v>

6608
03:06:14.410 --> 03:06:16.960
<v Speaker 6>There's a conspiracy theory where there's no chorus.</v>

6609
03:06:17.740 --> 03:06:18.573
<v Speaker 6>Look into it.</v>

6610
03:06:18.850 --> 03:06:19.450
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

6611
03:06:19.450 --> 03:06:20.221
<v Speaker 6>no forest.</v>

6612
03:06:20.221 --> 03:06:21.580
<v Speaker 6>I bet you love these things.</v>

6613
03:06:21.581 --> 03:06:21.851
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

6614
03:06:21.851 --> 03:06:22.690
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what that is.</v>

6615
03:06:22.691 --> 03:06:22.961
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

6616
03:06:22.961 --> 03:06:23.510
<v Speaker 6>I didn't even look,</v>

6617
03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:28.510
<v Speaker 6>I watched 30 seconds cause someone in class told me Ziggy came across hip.</v>

6618
03:06:28.700 --> 03:06:30.150
<v Speaker 6>You're at that conspiracy theory about Noah.</v>

6619
03:06:30.170 --> 03:06:31.003
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

6620
03:06:31.120 --> 03:06:31.890
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

6621
03:06:31.890 --> 03:06:35.920
<v Speaker 6>Cause I went home and I put no forest and I was 13 seconds.</v>

6622
03:06:36.090 --> 03:06:37.170
<v Speaker 6>I just stopped it.</v>

6623
03:06:38.740 --> 03:06:41.800
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen the one with this due to the dinosaurs aren't real and we've seen</v>

6624
03:06:41.801 --> 03:06:43.900
<v Speaker 6>that one that I don't,</v>

6625
03:06:43.980 --> 03:06:45.280
<v Speaker 6>that I don't know.</v>

6626
03:06:45.460 --> 03:06:46.293
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

6627
03:06:46.390 --> 03:06:48.220
<v Speaker 6>That's like some other shit where I'm like,</v>

6628
03:06:48.221 --> 03:06:50.230
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe any science.</v>

6629
03:06:50.290 --> 03:06:52.270
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe in the early science.</v>

6630
03:06:52.271 --> 03:06:53.270
<v Speaker 6>I believe it is.</v>

6631
03:06:53.950 --> 03:06:55.180
<v Speaker 6>You Rub two sticks together.</v>

6632
03:06:55.260 --> 03:06:56.090
<v Speaker 6>There's fire.</v>

6633
03:06:56.090 --> 03:06:56.923
<v Speaker 4>Other than that,</v>

6634
03:06:57.180 --> 03:06:58.300
<v Speaker 4>you've got to prove that shit.</v>

6635
03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ignore that shit.</v>

6636
03:07:01.920 --> 03:07:04.470
<v Speaker 1>All you gotta just tobacco science.</v>

6637
03:07:04.471 --> 03:07:04.931
<v Speaker 1>What about that,</v>

6638
03:07:04.931 --> 03:07:06.000
<v Speaker 1>that you think that Shit's gone?</v>

6639
03:07:06.030 --> 03:07:08.550
<v Speaker 1>You think tobacco science has gone stronger than ever?</v>

6640
03:07:08.610 --> 03:07:11.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the one of the weirdest thing was tobacco science.</v>

6641
03:07:12.240 --> 03:07:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Things that politicians don't talk about.</v>

6642
03:07:14.370 --> 03:07:17.670
<v Speaker 1>If you really stop and think about all the threats they talk about to this</v>

6643
03:07:17.671 --> 03:07:19.470
<v Speaker 1>country and the people in our health,</v>

6644
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:21.780
<v Speaker 1>and they'll even discuss drugs,</v>

6645
03:07:22.290 --> 03:07:27.290
<v Speaker 1>but how alcohol kills way more people than illegal drugs and for sure cigarettes</v>

6646
03:07:30.031 --> 03:07:31.740
<v Speaker 1>kill way more people than alcohol.</v>

6647
03:07:32.040 --> 03:07:37.040
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll occasionally hear a politician discuss underage drinking or</v>

6648
03:07:38.191 --> 03:07:39.750
<v Speaker 1>drinking and driving,</v>

6649
03:07:40.050 --> 03:07:45.050
<v Speaker 1>but will they ever discuss abstinence like [inaudible] and professing their hope</v>

6650
03:07:45.271 --> 03:07:46.140
<v Speaker 1>for abstinence?</v>

6651
03:07:46.320 --> 03:07:47.850
<v Speaker 1>No fucking way.</v>

6652
03:07:48.010 --> 03:07:50.640
<v Speaker 1>You mean one alcohol from alcohol.</v>

6653
03:07:51.200 --> 03:07:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6654
03:07:51.920 --> 03:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>If they never got to propose that right there.</v>

6655
03:07:55.290 --> 03:07:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Definitely never going to talk about cigarettes.</v>

6656
03:07:57.001 --> 03:08:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Cigarettes is their dirty friend that murders the giant elephant in the fucking</v>

6657
03:08:00.271 --> 03:08:00.870
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>

6658
03:08:00.870 --> 03:08:03.960
<v Speaker 1>They got a dirty friend that kills 500,000 people.</v>

6659
03:08:03.970 --> 03:08:08.970
<v Speaker 1>A clear example of why you should be a conspiracy theory.</v>

6660
03:08:10.050 --> 03:08:13.050
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely fascinating conspiracy.</v>

6661
03:08:13.080 --> 03:08:16.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a fascinating space and no one says shit in your face.</v>

6662
03:08:16.380 --> 03:08:16.621
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

6663
03:08:16.621 --> 03:08:17.700
<v Speaker 1>no one even talks about it.</v>

6664
03:08:17.701 --> 03:08:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Nobody talks about it.</v>

6665
03:08:18.420 --> 03:08:18.840
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

6666
03:08:18.840 --> 03:08:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I'm on board with know there's gotta be some money in there.</v>

6667
03:08:22.951 --> 03:08:23.400
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

6668
03:08:23.400 --> 03:08:23.580
<v Speaker 4>Miss,</v>

6669
03:08:23.580 --> 03:08:24.600
<v Speaker 4>this is me guessing.</v>

6670
03:08:24.690 --> 03:08:25.440
<v Speaker 4>I know this.</v>

6671
03:08:25.440 --> 03:08:28.050
<v Speaker 4>I know that sometimes greed,</v>

6672
03:08:28.560 --> 03:08:33.560
<v Speaker 4>greed will actually result in something beneficial to mankind.</v>

6673
03:08:33.960 --> 03:08:35.340
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it does.</v>

6674
03:08:35.460 --> 03:08:36.420
<v Speaker 4>In one instance,</v>

6675
03:08:36.720 --> 03:08:38.520
<v Speaker 4>a seatbelt laws,</v>

6676
03:08:38.670 --> 03:08:39.570
<v Speaker 4>seatbelt laws.</v>

6677
03:08:39.630 --> 03:08:42.600
<v Speaker 4>It looks like government was trying to take care of us and they really were</v>

6678
03:08:42.601 --> 03:08:43.560
<v Speaker 4>concerned with our health.</v>

6679
03:08:43.770 --> 03:08:47.560
<v Speaker 4>But when you looked into the seat belt law and the helmet law for motorcycles in</v>

6680
03:08:47.561 --> 03:08:48.394
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>

6681
03:08:48.480 --> 03:08:52.350
<v Speaker 4>it was the insurance company's paying for all that,</v>

6682
03:08:52.560 --> 03:08:52.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6683
03:08:52.890 --> 03:08:55.980
<v Speaker 4>the bill because they thought it was cheaper.</v>

6684
03:08:56.460 --> 03:08:57.480
<v Speaker 4>You know what if you didn't have,</v>

6685
03:08:57.520 --> 03:09:00.290
<v Speaker 4>if you got an accident and you weren't wearing your seatbelt,</v>

6686
03:09:00.420 --> 03:09:00.630
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

6687
03:09:00.630 --> 03:09:02.010
<v Speaker 4>if you'd turned into a vegetable,</v>

6688
03:09:02.040 --> 03:09:03.210
<v Speaker 4>you're expensive.</v>

6689
03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:07.590
<v Speaker 4>All those accidents with no seat belts were costing these insurance companies</v>

6690
03:09:07.591 --> 03:09:08.424
<v Speaker 4>Kazillions.</v>

6691
03:09:08.490 --> 03:09:13.380
<v Speaker 4>So it was better to make them wear seat belts then it wasn't as expensive to pay</v>

6692
03:09:13.381 --> 03:09:14.214
<v Speaker 4>for these bills.</v>

6693
03:09:14.260 --> 03:09:14.580
<v Speaker 4>They don't wait.</v>

6694
03:09:14.580 --> 03:09:16.830
<v Speaker 4>They don't have as many as many vegetable bills and shit.</v>

6695
03:09:17.160 --> 03:09:17.701
<v Speaker 4>Overall,</v>

6696
03:09:17.701 --> 03:09:20.220
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense so that when you find that out,</v>

6697
03:09:20.430 --> 03:09:21.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm just guessing here,</v>

6698
03:09:21.451 --> 03:09:24.240
<v Speaker 4>when you see those tobacco commercials where the,</v>

6699
03:09:24.241 --> 03:09:26.010
<v Speaker 4>I've seen the latest tobacco commercial with some,</v>

6700
03:09:26.130 --> 03:09:28.770
<v Speaker 4>some African American girl who's like,</v>

6701
03:09:28.830 --> 03:09:30.090
<v Speaker 4>she's wrapping poetry,</v>

6702
03:09:30.091 --> 03:09:30.900
<v Speaker 4>no music,</v>

6703
03:09:30.900 --> 03:09:33.220
<v Speaker 4>and it's all like being super ultra street.</v>

6704
03:09:33.221 --> 03:09:34.054
<v Speaker 4>She's in an alley.</v>

6705
03:09:34.140 --> 03:09:34.770
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

6706
03:09:34.770 --> 03:09:35.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6707
03:09:35.310 --> 03:09:35.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

6708
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:38.130
<v Speaker 4>all I do is just go out there and do my thing.</v>

6709
03:09:38.190 --> 03:09:39.030
<v Speaker 4>I ain't going to smoke.</v>

6710
03:09:39.060 --> 03:09:39.871
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do that.</v>

6711
03:09:39.871 --> 03:09:40.380
<v Speaker 4>Dang.</v>

6712
03:09:40.380 --> 03:09:40.591
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6713
03:09:40.591 --> 03:09:42.440
<v Speaker 4>just talk stupid rat.</v>

6714
03:09:42.480 --> 03:09:43.313
<v Speaker 4>Not Stupid rap,</v>

6715
03:09:43.350 --> 03:09:44.000
<v Speaker 4>but just,</v>

6716
03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:44.840
<v Speaker 4>I picked that back.</v>

6717
03:09:46.200 --> 03:09:47.840
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing rap.</v>

6718
03:09:48.210 --> 03:09:49.210
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing work,</v>

6719
03:09:49.530 --> 03:09:50.970
<v Speaker 4>but it was all about not smoking.</v>

6720
03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:51.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm cool.</v>

6721
03:09:51.780 --> 03:09:52.613
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to smoke.</v>

6722
03:09:52.680 --> 03:09:53.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

6723
03:09:53.300 --> 03:09:54.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the street.</v>

6724
03:09:54.080 --> 03:09:54.913
<v Speaker 4>Yo.</v>

6725
03:09:56.020 --> 03:09:56.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm just guessing.</v>

6726
03:09:57.160 --> 03:09:57.993
<v Speaker 4>I'm just guessing.</v>

6727
03:09:58.090 --> 03:09:59.170
<v Speaker 4>I bet if you look into that,</v>

6728
03:09:59.260 --> 03:10:00.100
<v Speaker 4>it's the same thing.</v>

6729
03:10:00.250 --> 03:10:03.430
<v Speaker 4>I bet the insurance companies have figured out that uh,</v>

6730
03:10:03.610 --> 03:10:03.731
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6731
03:10:03.731 --> 03:10:07.030
<v Speaker 4>diseases from smoking are expensive as fuck.</v>

6732
03:10:07.090 --> 03:10:08.050
<v Speaker 4>We got to stop this.</v>

6733
03:10:08.110 --> 03:10:09.250
<v Speaker 4>This is crushing us.</v>

6734
03:10:09.280 --> 03:10:10.270
<v Speaker 4>That's me guessing.</v>

6735
03:10:10.390 --> 03:10:11.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

6736
03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:14.330
<v Speaker 4>But do they really care if we smoke pot?</v>

6737
03:10:14.350 --> 03:10:14.860
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

6738
03:10:14.860 --> 03:10:17.110
<v Speaker 4>Why is this on and must be some,</v>

6739
03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:18.700
<v Speaker 4>you must be able to follow the money.</v>

6740
03:10:18.760 --> 03:10:19.750
<v Speaker 4>That's me guessing,</v>

6741
03:10:20.080 --> 03:10:21.310
<v Speaker 4>but of course I'm wrong.</v>

6742
03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:22.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6743
03:10:22.150 --> 03:10:22.831
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely,</v>

6744
03:10:22.831 --> 03:10:22.950
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6745
03:10:22.950 --> 03:10:24.630
<v Speaker 3>billions of dollars in cigarettes.</v>

6746
03:10:24.690 --> 03:10:25.650
<v Speaker 3>I think about people,</v>

6747
03:10:25.651 --> 03:10:29.850
<v Speaker 3>they buy so many cigarettes over the world to shut that business down.</v>

6748
03:10:30.390 --> 03:10:31.650
<v Speaker 3>You've got a real problem.</v>

6749
03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:31.951
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6750
03:10:31.951 --> 03:10:35.820
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people invested in that business is distribution companies.</v>

6751
03:10:35.821 --> 03:10:37.500
<v Speaker 3>There's people that make those things.</v>

6752
03:10:37.501 --> 03:10:41.160
<v Speaker 3>There's people that like those things and he'd get to get them the dark market.</v>

6753
03:10:41.220 --> 03:10:43.320
<v Speaker 3>They're going to figure out a way how to get them the dark market,</v>

6754
03:10:43.350 --> 03:10:44.183
<v Speaker 3>the black market,</v>

6755
03:10:44.420 --> 03:10:47.100
<v Speaker 3>but you can't make things illegal because you can't tell people what they can</v>

6756
03:10:47.101 --> 03:10:47.880
<v Speaker 3>and can't do.</v>

6757
03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:49.320
<v Speaker 3>If somebody wants to smoke cigarettes,</v>

6758
03:10:49.650 --> 03:10:50.580
<v Speaker 3>they should be allowed to,</v>

6759
03:10:50.820 --> 03:10:54.900
<v Speaker 3>but it's just real weird that the government professes to care about us,</v>

6760
03:10:54.901 --> 03:10:58.260
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't bring up this one thing that kills a half a million people every</v>

6761
03:10:58.260 --> 03:10:59.340
<v Speaker 3>year in this country alone.</v>

6762
03:10:59.550 --> 03:11:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Millions,</v>

6763
03:11:00.540 --> 03:11:01.120
<v Speaker 3>millions worldwide.</v>

6764
03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:03.310
<v Speaker 4>One cool thing that that was another law,</v>

6765
03:11:03.311 --> 03:11:07.060
<v Speaker 4>the cigarette law where you couldn't smoke inside.</v>

6766
03:11:07.300 --> 03:11:09.190
<v Speaker 4>That was one of those fucking laws.</v>

6767
03:11:09.191 --> 03:11:11.080
<v Speaker 4>It was beneficial for humanity.</v>

6768
03:11:11.100 --> 03:11:11.350
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6769
03:11:11.350 --> 03:11:13.430
<v Speaker 4>But was rooted in mining.</v>

6770
03:11:13.680 --> 03:11:13.870
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6771
03:11:13.870 --> 03:11:14.703
<v Speaker 4>Somehow it just,</v>

6772
03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:17.140
<v Speaker 4>it just turned out that it was actually a good thing for us.</v>

6773
03:11:17.290 --> 03:11:18.400
<v Speaker 4>Helmets are good thing.</v>

6774
03:11:18.460 --> 03:11:19.750
<v Speaker 4>Seatbelts are great thing.</v>

6775
03:11:19.930 --> 03:11:20.660
<v Speaker 4>You don't want people like,</v>

6776
03:11:20.660 --> 03:11:20.980
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

6777
03:11:20.980 --> 03:11:21.290
<v Speaker 4>people who,</v>

6778
03:11:21.290 --> 03:11:22.123
<v Speaker 4>people that say,</v>

6779
03:11:22.150 --> 03:11:24.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't want the government telling me I have to put a seatbelt on.</v>

6780
03:11:24.760 --> 03:11:25.960
<v Speaker 4>If I didn't want to wear a seatbelt,</v>

6781
03:11:26.050 --> 03:11:26.351
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

6782
03:11:26.351 --> 03:11:26.950
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

6783
03:11:26.950 --> 03:11:28.030
<v Speaker 4>if you don't wear a seatbelt,</v>

6784
03:11:28.090 --> 03:11:29.030
<v Speaker 4>you get an accident.</v>

6785
03:11:29.031 --> 03:11:30.160
<v Speaker 4>He turned into a vegetable,</v>

6786
03:11:30.310 --> 03:11:31.143
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking,</v>

6787
03:11:31.390 --> 03:11:34.180
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have people that you love that I'd have to wipe your ass.</v>

6788
03:11:34.181 --> 03:11:34.990
<v Speaker 4>You want to put them,</v>

6789
03:11:34.990 --> 03:11:38.620
<v Speaker 4>put a fucking seatbelt on so then I have to wipe your ass dude.</v>

6790
03:11:38.680 --> 03:11:39.513
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

6791
03:11:39.550 --> 03:11:40.480
<v Speaker 4>Take care of yourself.</v>

6792
03:11:41.290 --> 03:11:41.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6793
03:11:41.770 --> 03:11:42.730
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

6794
03:11:42.740 --> 03:11:42.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6795
03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:43.120
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6796
03:11:43.120 --> 03:11:43.720
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

6797
03:11:43.720 --> 03:11:45.550
<v Speaker 4>So safer to wear a seatbelt for sure.</v>

6798
03:11:45.551 --> 03:11:48.820
<v Speaker 4>It's safer to have a very big sturdy car.</v>

6799
03:11:49.570 --> 03:11:51.970
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of safers most likely.</v>

6800
03:11:52.870 --> 03:11:53.703
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

6801
03:11:53.710 --> 03:11:53.951
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6802
03:11:53.951 --> 03:11:54.280
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

6803
03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:54.581
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

6804
03:11:54.581 --> 03:11:55.414
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6805
03:11:55.780 --> 03:11:56.260
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

6806
03:11:56.260 --> 03:11:56.710
<v Speaker 4>it's weird</v>

6807
03:11:56.710 --> 03:12:00.000
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a believer that people should have personal freedom.</v>

6808
03:12:00.060 --> 03:12:01.170
<v Speaker 3>You should be able to do whatever you want.</v>

6809
03:12:01.440 --> 03:12:03.840
<v Speaker 3>But I think that when it comes to like young kids,</v>

6810
03:12:04.050 --> 03:12:07.890
<v Speaker 3>they're too likely to do stupid shit if you allow them to and cars.</v>

6811
03:12:07.891 --> 03:12:08.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

6812
03:12:08.370 --> 03:12:09.300
<v Speaker 3>it's a one mistake,</v>

6813
03:12:09.301 --> 03:12:11.010
<v Speaker 3>stupid shit and you're fucked up for life.</v>

6814
03:12:11.011 --> 03:12:11.880
<v Speaker 3>It's not worth it.</v>

6815
03:12:12.300 --> 03:12:14.460
<v Speaker 3>We should enforce it in any way we can,</v>

6816
03:12:14.670 --> 03:12:17.130
<v Speaker 3>but that's sort of the same way I feel about cigarettes.</v>

6817
03:12:17.131 --> 03:12:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Like we should kind of figure out how to enforce that.</v>

6818
03:12:19.970 --> 03:12:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not a smart thing to get involved with.</v>

6819
03:12:23.350 --> 03:12:26.890
<v Speaker 4>Would you be opposed to a law that made it illegal?</v>

6820
03:12:27.070 --> 03:12:27.940
<v Speaker 4>Seriously illegal?</v>

6821
03:12:27.941 --> 03:12:28.061
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6822
03:12:28.061 --> 03:12:28.181
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6823
03:12:28.181 --> 03:12:28.301
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6824
03:12:28.301 --> 03:12:28.510
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6825
03:12:28.510 --> 03:12:28.661
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

6826
03:12:28.661 --> 03:12:29.480
<v Speaker 4>There's something else,</v>

6827
03:12:29.480 --> 03:12:29.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6828
03:12:29.710 --> 03:12:34.710
<v Speaker 4>illegal to be paid to paint all day to go out and,</v>

6829
03:12:35.540 --> 03:12:35.820
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

6830
03:12:35.820 --> 03:12:36.071
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

6831
03:12:36.071 --> 03:12:36.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6832
03:12:36.390 --> 03:12:36.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6833
03:12:36.610 --> 03:12:37.060
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

6834
03:12:37.060 --> 03:12:37.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6835
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:39.550
<v Speaker 4>spew propaganda on a certain subject.</v>

6836
03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:40.210
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

6837
03:12:40.210 --> 03:12:41.980
<v Speaker 4>would you vote on a law?</v>

6838
03:12:42.340 --> 03:12:44.140
<v Speaker 4>Would you pass a law to make that illegal?</v>

6839
03:12:44.690 --> 03:12:45.523
<v Speaker 4>I'm confused.</v>

6840
03:12:45.790 --> 03:12:46.331
<v Speaker 4>To be illegal,</v>

6841
03:12:46.331 --> 03:12:48.320
<v Speaker 4>to pay someone to get</v>

6842
03:12:50.290 --> 03:12:51.790
<v Speaker 4>to lie on it should be,</v>

6843
03:12:51.800 --> 03:12:52.730
<v Speaker 4>I should be illegal.</v>

6844
03:12:52.731 --> 03:12:53.090
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6845
03:12:53.090 --> 03:12:55.310
<v Speaker 4>Especially if it's a government that save a lot of things.</v>

6846
03:12:55.400 --> 03:12:56.060
<v Speaker 4>Anybody.</v>

6847
03:12:56.060 --> 03:13:01.060
<v Speaker 4>If it was a serious crime to get paid to get online and spew propaganda,</v>

6848
03:13:02.600 --> 03:13:03.800
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody would say,</v>

6849
03:13:03.801 --> 03:13:04.590
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6850
03:13:04.590 --> 03:13:05.000
<v Speaker 4>that would,</v>

6851
03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:06.080
<v Speaker 4>that should be really illegal.</v>

6852
03:13:06.140 --> 03:13:08.690
<v Speaker 4>It should be really illegal for a company to pay someone,</v>

6853
03:13:08.780 --> 03:13:09.850
<v Speaker 4>so if you were going to do that,</v>

6854
03:13:09.851 --> 03:13:12.040
<v Speaker 4>that'd be some underground black market shit.</v>

6855
03:13:12.041 --> 03:13:14.990
<v Speaker 4>We're going to give you an envelope with fucking $2,000 we need to get shit in</v>

6856
03:13:14.991 --> 03:13:15.291
<v Speaker 4>the fucking,</v>

6857
03:13:15.291 --> 03:13:16.101
<v Speaker 4>here's the online,</v>

6858
03:13:16.101 --> 03:13:17.090
<v Speaker 4>you've got to Ip address,</v>

6859
03:13:17.210 --> 03:13:18.043
<v Speaker 4>you got to run.</v>

6860
03:13:18.230 --> 03:13:18.681
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

6861
03:13:18.681 --> 03:13:20.540
<v Speaker 4>That's gotta be super illegal to do that.</v>

6862
03:13:20.541 --> 03:13:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6863
03:13:20.850 --> 03:13:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6864
03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:23.810
<v Speaker 4>I think it's too easy because everyone's talking about,</v>

6865
03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:24.081
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

6866
03:13:24.081 --> 03:13:24.710
<v Speaker 4>the internet,</v>

6867
03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:26.180
<v Speaker 4>there's so much information out there.</v>

6868
03:13:26.181 --> 03:13:27.260
<v Speaker 4>We can find the truth,</v>

6869
03:13:27.380 --> 03:13:28.970
<v Speaker 4>but also it works against you.</v>

6870
03:13:28.971 --> 03:13:29.301
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

6871
03:13:29.301 --> 03:13:30.230
<v Speaker 4>you can find the truth,</v>

6872
03:13:30.410 --> 03:13:35.410
<v Speaker 4>but you could also get strategically flooded with misinformation strategically,</v>

6873
03:13:35.781 --> 03:13:36.950
<v Speaker 4>and that's a companies are doing,</v>

6874
03:13:37.100 --> 03:13:42.050
<v Speaker 4>they will strategically hire people to sway opinion and then and then and then</v>

6875
03:13:42.051 --> 03:13:45.350
<v Speaker 4>put it under science daily.com or science,</v>

6876
03:13:45.390 --> 03:13:46.280
<v Speaker 4>whatever.com</v>

6877
03:13:46.890 --> 03:13:50.650
<v Speaker 3>that's been confirmed that that's been done with climate climate change.</v>

6878
03:13:51.460 --> 03:13:52.600
<v Speaker 3>You seen that documentary?</v>

6879
03:13:52.601 --> 03:13:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Merchants of doubt.</v>

6880
03:13:54.190 --> 03:13:55.120
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

6881
03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:58.120
<v Speaker 3>It's about a bunch of guys who get paid and it coincidentally,</v>

6882
03:13:58.121 --> 03:13:59.830
<v Speaker 3>this two subjects are actually connected.</v>

6883
03:14:00.010 --> 03:14:02.470
<v Speaker 3>They used to get paid for going on.</v>

6884
03:14:02.471 --> 03:14:07.450
<v Speaker 3>These talk shows and disputing the fact that cigarettes are addictive and that</v>

6885
03:14:07.451 --> 03:14:08.980
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes caused health problems.</v>

6886
03:14:08.981 --> 03:14:09.970
<v Speaker 3>He would dispute these things.</v>

6887
03:14:09.971 --> 03:14:13.420
<v Speaker 3>How many shows that they were doing it in like the seventies and the eighties</v>

6888
03:14:13.850 --> 03:14:14.650
<v Speaker 3>tobacco science.</v>

6889
03:14:14.650 --> 03:14:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6890
03:14:14.980 --> 03:14:19.980
<v Speaker 3>and so then these guys from then then went to climate change later in life.</v>

6891
03:14:20.560 --> 03:14:24.760
<v Speaker 3>The same people are trying to debunk climate change and they have these,</v>

6892
03:14:24.761 --> 03:14:26.140
<v Speaker 3>these things where they'll,</v>

6893
03:14:26.470 --> 03:14:31.470
<v Speaker 3>they'll show the same people that were involved in trying to debunk cigarettes</v>

6894
03:14:31.990 --> 03:14:34.570
<v Speaker 3>causing cancer and being addictive.</v>

6895
03:14:34.690 --> 03:14:38.230
<v Speaker 3>The same exact people were trying to say climate change is just a cycle.</v>

6896
03:14:38.350 --> 03:14:39.340
<v Speaker 3>It just the way it is.</v>

6897
03:14:39.341 --> 03:14:40.540
<v Speaker 3>It's always going to be this way.</v>

6898
03:14:40.830 --> 03:14:41.550
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

6899
03:14:41.550 --> 03:14:42.270
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>

6900
03:14:42.270 --> 03:14:43.820
<v Speaker 4>do you think that is a,</v>

6901
03:14:43.830 --> 03:14:46.740
<v Speaker 4>a sign that something fishy is going on?</v>

6902
03:14:46.770 --> 03:14:46.861
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6903
03:14:46.861 --> 03:14:47.370
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

6904
03:14:47.370 --> 03:14:47.890
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

6905
03:14:47.890 --> 03:14:48.040
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

6906
03:14:48.040 --> 03:14:49.410
<v Speaker 4>That's like basic detective shit.</v>

6907
03:14:49.530 --> 03:14:49.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6908
03:14:49.720 --> 03:14:50.730
<v Speaker 3>and they're using these,</v>

6909
03:14:50.790 --> 03:14:51.300
<v Speaker 3>what's going on,</v>

6910
03:14:51.300 --> 03:14:52.133
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

6911
03:14:52.470 --> 03:14:53.430
<v Speaker 3>You guys are talking about this.</v>

6912
03:14:53.431 --> 03:14:54.110
<v Speaker 3>I just Google it.</v>

6913
03:14:54.110 --> 03:14:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Put the propaganda ban being lifted.</v>

6914
03:14:55.730 --> 03:14:55.841
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6915
03:14:55.841 --> 03:14:57.300
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were talking about Mickey Rourke.</v>

6916
03:14:57.301 --> 03:14:57.451
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6917
03:14:57.451 --> 03:14:57.570
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6918
03:14:57.570 --> 03:14:57.690
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

6919
03:14:57.690 --> 03:14:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Make your work plan on two screens here.</v>

6920
03:14:59.171 --> 03:15:02.880
<v Speaker 3>And he's screaming at people and they keep showing me who wrote this article.</v>

6921
03:15:04.110 --> 03:15:04.950
<v Speaker 3>That's Mickey Rourke.</v>

6922
03:15:05.010 --> 03:15:05.910
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen him lately?</v>

6923
03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:06.833
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

6924
03:15:06.930 --> 03:15:07.763
<v Speaker 3>He's uh,</v>

6925
03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:12.830
<v Speaker 3>he's gotten very weird congressman seek to lift propaganda ban happened in the</v>

6926
03:15:12.961 --> 03:15:13.471
<v Speaker 3>NDA,</v>

6927
03:15:13.471 --> 03:15:15.710
<v Speaker 3>but Michael Hastings is the one that was right.</v>

6928
03:15:15.780 --> 03:15:16.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

6929
03:15:16.470 --> 03:15:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Propaganda was supposed to target.</v>

6930
03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Foreigners can now be aimed at Americans reversing a longstanding,</v>

6931
03:15:21.690 --> 03:15:22.051
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

6932
03:15:22.051 --> 03:15:22.381
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

6933
03:15:22.381 --> 03:15:22.831
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

6934
03:15:22.831 --> 03:15:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Can you scroll up?</v>

6935
03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:25.193
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

6936
03:15:25.740 --> 03:15:26.573
<v Speaker 3>What you said about it.</v>

6937
03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:27.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

6938
03:15:27.511 --> 03:15:29.550
<v Speaker 3>It's called the Smith modernization.</v>

6939
03:15:29.640 --> 03:15:29.911
<v Speaker 3>The new,</v>

6940
03:15:29.911 --> 03:15:33.870
<v Speaker 3>what would give the new law would give sweeping powers to State Department and</v>

6941
03:15:33.871 --> 03:15:35.040
<v Speaker 3>Pentagon is pushed television,</v>

6942
03:15:35.041 --> 03:15:35.341
<v Speaker 3>radio,</v>

6943
03:15:35.341 --> 03:15:35.751
<v Speaker 3>newspaper,</v>

6944
03:15:35.751 --> 03:15:37.980
<v Speaker 3>and social media onto the US public.</v>

6945
03:15:37.980 --> 03:15:40.000
<v Speaker 3>It removes the protection for Americans.</v>

6946
03:15:40.001 --> 03:15:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Has a Pentagon official,</v>

6947
03:15:41.700 --> 03:15:42.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6948
03:15:42.420 --> 03:15:44.040
<v Speaker 3>who is concerned about the law.</v>

6949
03:15:44.280 --> 03:15:48.840
<v Speaker 3>It removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information.</v>

6950
03:15:48.841 --> 03:15:50.700
<v Speaker 3>There no checks and balances.</v>

6951
03:15:50.910 --> 03:15:55.350
<v Speaker 3>No one knows if the information is accurate or partially accurate or entirely</v>

6952
03:15:55.351 --> 03:15:55.741
<v Speaker 3>false.</v>

6953
03:15:55.741 --> 03:15:56.940
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

6954
03:15:57.300 --> 03:16:02.300
<v Speaker 3>That is so fucking crazy that they just try to make bills where they will out</v>

6955
03:16:03.721 --> 03:16:05.410
<v Speaker 3>and out lie about things.</v>

6956
03:16:05.411 --> 03:16:10.170
<v Speaker 3>So that's your strategy for dealing with terror is to create a feeling of total</v>

6957
03:16:10.171 --> 03:16:11.520
<v Speaker 3>imbalance in this country.</v>

6958
03:16:12.180 --> 03:16:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Like whether or not it's effective or not.</v>

6959
03:16:14.131 --> 03:16:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Like as far as a long term strategy for freedom,</v>

6960
03:16:17.160 --> 03:16:20.460
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the worst ideas ever to say.</v>

6961
03:16:20.580 --> 03:16:22.950
<v Speaker 3>We as your elders,</v>

6962
03:16:22.951 --> 03:16:25.140
<v Speaker 3>your daddy and mommy of the government.</v>

6963
03:16:25.141 --> 03:16:28.710
<v Speaker 3>We're going to look over you and we're going to tell you about Santa Claus and</v>

6964
03:16:28.711 --> 03:16:30.480
<v Speaker 3>the Easter bunny and we're going to just,</v>

6965
03:16:30.500 --> 03:16:31.800
<v Speaker 3>we're just gonna make shit up.</v>

6966
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:35.160
<v Speaker 3>We're going to make shit up for it all up and we think we should be able to</v>

6967
03:16:35.161 --> 03:16:36.910
<v Speaker 3>because we know better than you because,</v>

6968
03:16:36.911 --> 03:16:37.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6969
03:16:37.080 --> 03:16:39.120
<v Speaker 3>we were elected allegedly.</v>

6970
03:16:39.340 --> 03:16:40.110
<v Speaker 3>That's what's gone well,</v>

6971
03:16:40.110 --> 03:16:41.600
<v Speaker 3>we have the information that he brought up.</v>

6972
03:16:43.140 --> 03:16:44.790
<v Speaker 4>Science daily.com.</v>

6973
03:16:44.940 --> 03:16:45.480
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

6974
03:16:45.480 --> 03:16:46.313
<v Speaker 4>If you look at that,</v>

6975
03:16:46.320 --> 03:16:47.310
<v Speaker 4>they got the truth there.</v>

6976
03:16:47.311 --> 03:16:48.420
<v Speaker 4>That's it's right there.</v>

6977
03:16:48.421 --> 03:16:49.254
<v Speaker 4>It's a science.</v>

6978
03:16:49.330 --> 03:16:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Did you see what happened with um,</v>

6979
03:16:51.970 --> 03:16:53.620
<v Speaker 3>that fucking doctor drew show?</v>

6980
03:16:54.070 --> 03:16:57.820
<v Speaker 3>Dr Drew talked the other day about Hillary Clinton having a brain injury.</v>

6981
03:16:58.060 --> 03:17:02.590
<v Speaker 3>He talked about it on TV and what her brain injury was and how dangerous it was,</v>

6982
03:17:02.591 --> 03:17:03.640
<v Speaker 3>what she was taking.</v>

6983
03:17:03.820 --> 03:17:07.420
<v Speaker 3>And he didn't agree with her treatment and they canceled his fucking show.</v>

6984
03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Canceled his fucking show.</v>

6985
03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:13.411
<v Speaker 3>Doctor drew.</v>

6986
03:17:13.411 --> 03:17:17.500
<v Speaker 3>So canceled days after host gives negative speculation about Hillary Clinton's</v>

6987
03:17:17.501 --> 03:17:17.980

7077
03:19:37.341 --> 03:19:39.860
<v Speaker 1>hung the lunar limb on the lunar module?</v>

7078
03:19:40.490 --> 03:19:41.323
<v Speaker 1>Grissom.</v>

03:19:42.171 --> 03:19:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Gus Grissom.</v>

7081
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:43.783
<v Speaker 1>Gus Grissom.</v>

7082
03:19:44.080 --> 03:19:44.590
<v Speaker 1>You hang on.</v>

7083
03:19:44.590 --> 03:19:44.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7084
03:19:44.930 --> 03:19:45.471
<v Speaker 1>they all knew.</v>

7085
03:19:45.471 --> 03:19:45.731
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

7086
03:19:45.731 --> 03:19:47.160
<v Speaker 1>remember the name of the inspectors.</v>

7087
03:19:47.161 --> 03:19:47.961
<v Speaker 1>They knew they weren't going,</v>

7088
03:19:47.961 --> 03:19:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the name of the inspector.</v>

7089
03:19:49.371 --> 03:19:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised about my,</v>

7090
03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I used to be able to recite that shit,</v>

7091
03:19:51.730 --> 03:19:52.940
<v Speaker 4>but look into him too.</v>

7092
03:19:52.941 --> 03:19:53.660
<v Speaker 4>They killed him.</v>

7093
03:19:53.660 --> 03:19:54.110
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

7094
03:19:54.110 --> 03:19:55.070
<v Speaker 4>he was testifying.</v>

7095
03:19:55.100 --> 03:19:55.330
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

7096
03:19:55.330 --> 03:19:57.850
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing here and get home and it caught,</v>

7097
03:19:57.980 --> 03:20:01.460
<v Speaker 4>I think it costs $30 billion or something to adjust it.</v>

7098
03:20:01.461 --> 03:20:03.500
<v Speaker 4>I think that's adjusted to American dollars.</v>

7099
03:20:03.760 --> 03:20:04.593
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7100
03:20:05.360 --> 03:20:05.931
<v Speaker 4>like the fence.</v>

7101
03:20:05.931 --> 03:20:06.890
<v Speaker 4>Like here's another example.</v>

7102
03:20:06.891 --> 03:20:07.724
<v Speaker 4>Like the fence,</v>

7103
03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:08.833
<v Speaker 4>the fence,</v>

7104
03:20:08.910 --> 03:20:09.740
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

7105
03:20:09.740 --> 03:20:11.330
<v Speaker 4>congressmen lobbied for it.</v>

7106
03:20:11.480 --> 03:20:12.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly how it got passed,</v>

7107
03:20:12.771 --> 03:20:13.610
<v Speaker 4>but they got paid,</v>

7108
03:20:13.860 --> 03:20:14.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

7109
03:20:14.320 --> 03:20:16.340
<v Speaker 4>like $3 billion to build that fence.</v>

7110
03:20:16.400 --> 03:20:19.550
<v Speaker 4>The fence that separates Mexico from the United States all the way across the</v>

7111
03:20:19.551 --> 03:20:20.384
<v Speaker 4>south west.</v>

7112
03:20:20.480 --> 03:20:21.500
<v Speaker 4>They never finished it.</v>

7113
03:20:21.501 --> 03:20:22.400
<v Speaker 4>They got paid for everything.</v>

7114
03:20:22.610 --> 03:20:23.720
<v Speaker 4>It's so not finished.</v>

7115
03:20:23.721 --> 03:20:24.950
<v Speaker 4>It's like half finished.</v>

7116
03:20:25.330 --> 03:20:26.360
<v Speaker 4>It's abandoned it.</v>

7117
03:20:26.480 --> 03:20:27.051
<v Speaker 4>You know what that was?</v>

7118
03:20:27.051 --> 03:20:27.801
<v Speaker 4>It was a money grab.</v>

7119
03:20:27.801 --> 03:20:29.030
<v Speaker 4>It's simple political.</v>

7120
03:20:29.190 --> 03:20:29.410
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

7121
03:20:29.410 --> 03:20:33.860
<v Speaker 4>we create all this funding for something and then fucking Skimm pay for some of</v>

7122
03:20:33.861 --> 03:20:34.160
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

7123
03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:35.260
<v Speaker 4>but then if it falls apart,</v>

7124
03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:36.410
<v Speaker 4>no one even keeps track of it.</v>

7125
03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:39.260
<v Speaker 4>There's a documentary called the fence will blow your fucking mind.</v>

7126
03:20:39.380 --> 03:20:40.220
<v Speaker 4>They never finished that.</v>

7127
03:20:40.221 --> 03:20:41.054
<v Speaker 4>They abandoned it.</v>

7128
03:20:41.210 --> 03:20:42.080
<v Speaker 4>It's deserted.</v>

7129
03:20:42.290 --> 03:20:43.180
<v Speaker 4>Mexican dudes are going,</v>

7130
03:20:43.190 --> 03:20:44.420
<v Speaker 4>what are these Americans doing?</v>

7131
03:20:44.540 --> 03:20:46.250
<v Speaker 4>They're interviewing Mexicans that are just like,</v>

7132
03:20:46.430 --> 03:20:47.263
<v Speaker 4>this is easy.</v>

7133
03:20:47.330 --> 03:20:47.750
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

7134
03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:49.280
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>

7135
03:20:49.340 --> 03:20:50.240
<v Speaker 4>But that's what it is.</v>

7136
03:20:50.330 --> 03:20:51.980
<v Speaker 4>Like anytime they put a satellite into space,</v>

7137
03:20:52.130 --> 03:20:53.600
<v Speaker 4>fucking $35 million,</v>

7138
03:20:53.601 --> 03:20:53.781
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

7139
03:20:53.781 --> 03:20:54.291
<v Speaker 4>we need a sound.</v>

7140
03:20:54.291 --> 03:20:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Like the more telecommunications,</v>

7141
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:57.260
<v Speaker 4>they fucking launched some shit.</v>

7142
03:20:57.290 --> 03:20:59.480
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what that satellites doing?</v>

7143
03:20:59.570 --> 03:21:00.440
<v Speaker 4>They got paid.</v>

7144
03:21:00.500 --> 03:21:01.640
<v Speaker 4>They do it all the Goddamn time.</v>

7145
03:21:01.641 --> 03:21:02.331
<v Speaker 4>It's a scam.</v>

7146
03:21:02.331 --> 03:21:03.720
<v Speaker 4>It's a mom with you Alex</v>

7147
03:21:04.110 --> 03:21:04.500
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

7148
03:21:04.500 --> 03:21:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I lose you when we went from Mexicans getting into the cross the border,</v>

7149
03:21:07.750 --> 03:21:08.583
<v Speaker 1>no fun.</v>

7150
03:21:09.120 --> 03:21:10.720
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about Scott in the satellites.</v>

7151
03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:11.820
<v Speaker 1>It's all a scam.</v>

7152
03:21:11.820 --> 03:21:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

7153
03:21:12.300 --> 03:21:12.711
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

7154
03:21:12.711 --> 03:21:13.560
<v Speaker 1>the Mexican one?</v>

7155
03:21:13.561 --> 03:21:13.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7156
03:21:13.741 --> 03:21:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't they finish that?</v>

7157
03:21:14.941 --> 03:21:16.770
<v Speaker 1>How much money do they need to finish that fence?</v>

7158
03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:18.930
<v Speaker 1>But the problem and they dig holes,</v>

7159
03:21:19.170 --> 03:21:20.370
<v Speaker 1>even if you finish the fence,</v>

7160
03:21:20.430 --> 03:21:20.960
<v Speaker 4>they never,</v>

7161
03:21:20.960 --> 03:21:21.541
<v Speaker 4>they could have,</v>

7162
03:21:21.541 --> 03:21:22.620
<v Speaker 4>but they never even finished.</v>

7163
03:21:22.920 --> 03:21:23.630
<v Speaker 4>They just go around them.</v>

7164
03:21:23.630 --> 03:21:25.650
<v Speaker 4>They fill areas that the documentary is like,</v>

7165
03:21:25.680 --> 03:21:27.180
<v Speaker 4>they show Mexico around the fence.</v>

7166
03:21:27.390 --> 03:21:27.870
<v Speaker 4>How much,</v>

7167
03:21:27.870 --> 03:21:28.860
<v Speaker 4>how much fences left.</v>

7168
03:21:29.210 --> 03:21:30.030
<v Speaker 4>They leave behind.</v>

7169
03:21:30.030 --> 03:21:35.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't know enough not to have enough until I've made what they put up a</v>

7170
03:21:35.581 --> 03:21:36.414
<v Speaker 4>complete waste.</v>

7171
03:21:36.670 --> 03:21:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

7172
03:21:37.320 --> 03:21:41.670
<v Speaker 1>well that's when Trump gets into office to fence is going to get 10 yeah,</v>

7173
03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:42.960
<v Speaker 1>10 foot higher.</v>

7174
03:21:43.500 --> 03:21:44.221
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that?</v>

7175
03:21:44.221 --> 03:21:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7176
03:21:44.400 --> 03:21:45.990
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times thing through P,</v>

7177
03:21:46.030 --> 03:21:47.270
<v Speaker 3>they're coming after him today.</v>

7178
03:21:47.730 --> 03:21:51.470
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about racial bias and like renting houses and stuff,</v>

7179
03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:53.350
<v Speaker 3>renting property.</v>

7180
03:21:53.410 --> 03:21:54.243
<v Speaker 4>Pretty</v>

7181
03:21:56.880 --> 03:21:57.341
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

7182
03:21:57.341 --> 03:21:59.680
<v Speaker 4>He's so close to being the president of United States.</v>

7183
03:22:00.490 --> 03:22:01.323
<v Speaker 4>You don't think so.</v>

7184
03:22:01.390 --> 03:22:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Hundred percent.</v>

7185
03:22:02.261 --> 03:22:02.930
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

7186
03:22:02.930 --> 03:22:05.210
<v Speaker 4>what if he does he know when it's so,</v>

7187
03:22:06.040 --> 03:22:08.710
<v Speaker 4>it's so obvious it's Hillary's going to win,</v>

7188
03:22:08.711 --> 03:22:09.544
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

7189
03:22:09.700 --> 03:22:14.020
<v Speaker 4>100% I think so 100% it's so obvious what Trump,</v>

7190
03:22:14.020 --> 03:22:15.010
<v Speaker 4>Trump's just there to say whatever.</v>

7191
03:22:15.011 --> 03:22:17.680
<v Speaker 4>He's super smart and he just says whatever he says,</v>

7192
03:22:17.681 --> 03:22:19.600
<v Speaker 4>whatever it takes to win a certain debate.</v>

7193
03:22:19.810 --> 03:22:20.590
<v Speaker 4>And he just goes up.</v>

7194
03:22:20.590 --> 03:22:21.670
<v Speaker 4>They're letting them go off.</v>

7195
03:22:21.671 --> 03:22:22.091
<v Speaker 4>They're just like,</v>

7196
03:22:22.091 --> 03:22:22.331
<v Speaker 4>they said,</v>

7197
03:22:22.331 --> 03:22:23.000
<v Speaker 4>go off.</v>

7198
03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Get crazy.</v>

7199
03:22:23.830 --> 03:22:27.520
<v Speaker 4>So now the former head of the CIA,</v>

7200
03:22:27.800 --> 03:22:28.330
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

7201
03:22:28.330 --> 03:22:33.330
<v Speaker 4>there's a video where it says a c had a CIA denounced as Hillary and Trump.</v>

7202
03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:34.511
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

7203
03:22:34.511 --> 03:22:35.710
<v Speaker 4>He's denouncing Trump.</v>

7204
03:22:35.711 --> 03:22:36.970
<v Speaker 4>He's crucified Trump.</v>

7205
03:22:37.150 --> 03:22:38.500
<v Speaker 4>And when they ask about Hillary,</v>

7206
03:22:38.620 --> 03:22:39.161
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

7207
03:22:39.161 --> 03:22:39.994
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

7208
03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:40.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

7209
03:22:40.720 --> 03:22:42.220
<v Speaker 4>I got a lot of issues with Hillary,</v>

7210
03:22:42.221 --> 03:22:42.671
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

7211
03:22:42.671 --> 03:22:43.030
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

7212
03:22:43.030 --> 03:22:44.140
<v Speaker 4>she was better than Trump.</v>

7213
03:22:44.290 --> 03:22:47.170
<v Speaker 4>And in a lot of ways she's better than Obama too,</v>

7214
03:22:47.171 --> 03:22:49.180
<v Speaker 4>but I got my issues with Hillary.</v>

7215
03:22:49.181 --> 03:22:50.014
<v Speaker 4>But Trump,</v>

7216
03:22:50.050 --> 03:22:50.770
<v Speaker 4>that dude,</v>

7217
03:22:50.770 --> 03:22:51.401
<v Speaker 4>so really,</v>

7218
03:22:51.401 --> 03:22:54.640
<v Speaker 4>he's the head of the CIA is bearing Trump.</v>

7219
03:22:54.880 --> 03:22:56.500
<v Speaker 4>They want Hillary to win really,</v>

7220
03:22:56.501 --> 03:22:57.190
<v Speaker 4>really mad.</v>

7221
03:22:57.190 --> 03:22:58.600
<v Speaker 4>And if they want Hillary to win,</v>

7222
03:22:58.780 --> 03:22:59.410
<v Speaker 4>trust me,</v>

7223
03:22:59.410 --> 03:23:00.310
<v Speaker 4>Hillary's going to win.</v>

7224
03:23:00.311 --> 03:23:01.144
<v Speaker 4>That's all</v>

7225
03:23:01.210 --> 03:23:04.000
<v Speaker 3>devil's advocate and conspiracy theorists at the same time,</v>

7226
03:23:04.240 --> 03:23:05.560
<v Speaker 3>if he did win,</v>

7227
03:23:05.830 --> 03:23:10.240
<v Speaker 3>they should be fucking terrified because if Donald Trump actually does win and</v>

7228
03:23:10.241 --> 03:23:12.550
<v Speaker 3>gets into office and actually gets to explode,</v>

7229
03:23:12.610 --> 03:23:14.110
<v Speaker 3>he's a loose cannon.</v>

7230
03:23:14.290 --> 03:23:16.000
<v Speaker 3>He's not playing by their fucking rules.</v>

7231
03:23:16.180 --> 03:23:20.920
<v Speaker 3>If they pull him aside and tell him him some crazy shit about Afghanistan or</v>

7232
03:23:21.700 --> 03:23:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Rwanda or Africa,</v>

7233
03:23:24.100 --> 03:23:24.211
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

7234
03:23:24.211 --> 03:23:25.420
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is about the world,</v>

7235
03:23:25.690 --> 03:23:30.460
<v Speaker 3>who knows what protocol he's going to follow this as far as how he decides to</v>

7236
03:23:30.461 --> 03:23:31.780
<v Speaker 3>react to that information.</v>

7237
03:23:31.930 --> 03:23:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what government organizations,</v>

7238
03:23:34.241 --> 03:23:35.650
<v Speaker 3>he's going to try to disband who?</v>

7239
03:23:35.730 --> 03:23:36.880
<v Speaker 3>He's a wild man.</v>

7240
03:23:37.200 --> 03:23:38.710
<v Speaker 3>He might slash and burn</v>

7241
03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:41.190
<v Speaker 4>the way Hillary won California.</v>

7242
03:23:41.191 --> 03:23:41.731
<v Speaker 4>This is just me,</v>

7243
03:23:41.731 --> 03:23:41.911
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

7244
03:23:41.911 --> 03:23:42.744
<v Speaker 4>I don't know shit,</v>

7245
03:23:42.810 --> 03:23:43.710
<v Speaker 4>but this is my guest.</v>

7246
03:23:43.770 --> 03:23:44.680
<v Speaker 4>The way she won,</v>

7247
03:23:44.900 --> 03:23:45.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

7248
03:23:45.390 --> 03:23:46.830
<v Speaker 4>in California and the way,</v>

7249
03:23:46.950 --> 03:23:48.330
<v Speaker 4>remember George W.</v>

7250
03:23:48.330 --> 03:23:49.200
<v Speaker 4>Bush won in Florida.</v>

7251
03:23:49.201 --> 03:23:54.201
<v Speaker 4>I remember that one going the way they did whatever was involved in that shit is</v>

7252
03:23:54.721 --> 03:23:58.890
<v Speaker 4>going to be involved in the main shit this year and Hillary's going to win.</v>

7253
03:23:58.920 --> 03:23:59.753
<v Speaker 4>That's my opinion.</v>

7254
03:24:00.140 --> 03:24:01.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what that thought was right.</v>

7255
03:24:02.420 --> 03:24:02.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

7256
03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:03.673
<v Speaker 3>you might be right.</v>

7257
03:24:03.800 --> 03:24:04.311
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

7258
03:24:04.311 --> 03:24:04.581
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

7259
03:24:04.581 --> 03:24:07.760
<v Speaker 3>it's just weird that this is all the Republicans have and it's weird that this</v>

7260
03:24:07.761 --> 03:24:08.221
<v Speaker 3>is all the demo,</v>

7261
03:24:08.221 --> 03:24:08.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

7262
03:24:08.330 --> 03:24:08.790
<v Speaker 4>Grads hat.</v>

7263
03:24:08.790 --> 03:24:09.461
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just,</v>

7264
03:24:09.461 --> 03:24:11.720
<v Speaker 4>it's just the way I think that's the way they planned it.</v>

7265
03:24:12.440 --> 03:24:12.681
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

7266
03:24:12.681 --> 03:24:13.101
<v Speaker 3>I don't though.</v>

7267
03:24:13.101 --> 03:24:14.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's very many people who,</v>

7268
03:24:14.991 --> 03:24:15.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

7269
03:24:15.620 --> 03:24:17.840
<v Speaker 3>want to be a president anyway.</v>

7270
03:24:18.080 --> 03:24:20.360
<v Speaker 4>I think Trump is on their side and he's playing along.</v>

7271
03:24:20.361 --> 03:24:20.901
<v Speaker 4>He's doing that.</v>

7272
03:24:20.901 --> 03:24:25.901
<v Speaker 4>He's just being obnoxious and being crazy and then no one's going to be sad when</v>

7273
03:24:26.611 --> 03:24:26.861
<v Speaker 4>he loads.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I need to pick a shot of a girl throwing a drink in a guy's face.</v>

7304
03:25:14.530 --> 03:25:16.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like hypnosis though,</v>

7305
03:25:16.001 --> 03:25:16.241
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

03:25:16.241 --> 03:25:17.080
<v Speaker 4>Like you get stuck.</v>

7307
03:25:17.081 --> 03:25:19.990
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm talking and I'm watching all this go on in the background.</v>

7308
03:25:19.991 --> 03:25:20.171
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

7309
03:25:20.171 --> 03:25:20.351
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

7310
03:25:20.351 --> 03:25:20.560
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

7311
03:25:20.560 --> 03:25:20.860
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

7312
03:25:20.860 --> 03:25:21.400
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

7313
03:25:21.400 --> 03:25:22.450
<v Speaker 4>What's happening back there?</v>

7314
03:25:23.080 --> 03:25:23.800
<v Speaker 4>It's funny how you</v>

7315
03:25:23.800 --> 03:25:24.370
<v Speaker 3>get a,</v>

7316
03:25:24.370 --> 03:25:25.203
<v Speaker 3>like you were talking,</v>

7317
03:25:25.210 --> 03:25:29.110
<v Speaker 3>you were the one who explained that to me once the first time about music videos</v>

7318
03:25:29.230 --> 03:25:31.510
<v Speaker 3>that music videos have to be like smash cuts.</v>

7319
03:25:31.630 --> 03:25:33.180
<v Speaker 3>You've got to go from one scene to the next scene.</v>

7320
03:25:33.230 --> 03:25:34.600
<v Speaker 3>The next scene to the next split second,</v>

7321
03:25:34.601 --> 03:25:35.180
<v Speaker 3>fourth.</v>

7322
03:25:35.180 --> 03:25:37.660
<v Speaker 3>You can't have anything play on for a long time.</v>

7323
03:25:37.661 --> 03:25:39.040
<v Speaker 3>People just stop paying attention.</v>

7324
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:40.343
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7325
03:25:40.420 --> 03:25:41.110
<v Speaker 4>And the more,</v>

7326
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:42.190
<v Speaker 4>the less continuity,</v>

7327
03:25:42.191 --> 03:25:42.880
<v Speaker 4>the better.</v>

7328
03:25:42.880 --> 03:25:43.780
<v Speaker 4>The only reason they,</v>

7329
03:25:43.830 --> 03:25:46.780
<v Speaker 4>they keep going back to certain sets because they only could afford seven sets.</v>

7330
03:25:47.440 --> 03:25:50.530
<v Speaker 4>But really the ultimate video would be you never go,</v>

7331
03:25:50.540 --> 03:25:51.550
<v Speaker 4>you use every set,</v>

7332
03:25:51.551 --> 03:25:52.450
<v Speaker 4>just one shot.</v>

7333
03:25:52.990 --> 03:25:53.860
<v Speaker 4>That would be the ultimate,</v>

7334
03:25:53.861 --> 03:25:54.820
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to have seven.</v>

7335
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:57.010
<v Speaker 4>And he threw it to three minute video shit.</v>

7336
03:25:57.011 --> 03:25:59.740
<v Speaker 4>We got to hit that set like maybe six times each.</v>

7337
03:25:59.741 --> 03:26:00.574
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

7338
03:26:00.580 --> 03:26:01.413
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

7339
03:26:01.420 --> 03:26:02.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

7340
03:26:02.140 --> 03:26:04.240
<v Speaker 4>that's how the videos are just uh,</v>

7341
03:26:04.720 --> 03:26:07.640
<v Speaker 4>just we got to bombard you with shit to,</v>

7342
03:26:07.750 --> 03:26:08.583
<v Speaker 4>and it goes,</v>

7343
03:26:08.710 --> 03:26:11.320
<v Speaker 4>everything's cut to the music nice and fast.</v>

7344
03:26:11.321 --> 03:26:13.060
<v Speaker 4>And there was a lot of bands got cars,</v>

7345
03:26:13.450 --> 03:26:14.470
<v Speaker 4>real visual.</v>

7346
03:26:14.530 --> 03:26:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Dude's driving in cars.</v>

7347
03:26:15.850 --> 03:26:18.970
<v Speaker 4>You got to have a video and you somewhat disagree or driving.</v>

7348
03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:19.833
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

7349

<v Speaker 4>DMX has a video of him driving the ultimate video of him driving it.</v>

7350
03:26:24.610 --> 03:26:27.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like some weird sin city type special effects.</v>

7351
03:26:27.521 --> 03:26:28.570

7352
03:26:28.571 --> 03:26:29.251
<v Speaker 4>Fuck what?</v>

7353

7415
03:28:12.041 --> 03:28:15.190
<v Speaker 1>When you see like the interior and the way it's all constructed,</v>

7416
03:28:15.191 --> 03:28:18.790
<v Speaker 1>it's all handmade with these crazy gauges and just beautiful leathers,</v>

7417
03:28:19.120 --> 03:28:21.430
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't look like any other modern car.</v>

7418
03:28:21.640 --> 03:28:25.960
<v Speaker 1>It looks like something like someone from the Hg wells days who was trying to</v>

7419
03:28:25.961 --> 03:28:27.790
<v Speaker 1>draw like a future supercar.</v>

7420
03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:29.080
<v Speaker 1>You would draw some weird,</v>

7421
03:28:29.410 --> 03:28:31.600
<v Speaker 1>we've got Eva Ron type spaceship thing.</v>

7422
03:28:31.720 --> 03:28:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>

7423
03:28:32.591 --> 03:28:34.210
<v Speaker 1>It's very much its own kind of car,</v>

7424
03:28:34.690 --> 03:28:37.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's stupid expensive and insanely fast.</v>

7425
03:28:37.690 --> 03:28:40.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it has more than a thousand horsepower,</v>

7426
03:28:41.440 --> 03:28:45.700
<v Speaker 1>which is just as faster than a motorcycle and 1200 horsepower.</v>

7427
03:28:46.420 --> 03:28:48.730
<v Speaker 1>What's the in sand right now with the motorcycle?</v>

7428
03:28:48.731 --> 03:28:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Zero to 60 and what?</v>

7429
03:28:50.600 --> 03:28:51.520
<v Speaker 1>They just disappear.</v>

7430
03:28:51.521 --> 03:28:52.450
<v Speaker 1>They just vanish.</v>

7431
03:28:52.740 --> 03:28:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Travel through time.</v>

7432
03:28:53.740 --> 03:28:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Record two seconds.</v>

7433
03:28:55.570 --> 03:28:56.620
<v Speaker 1>It's probably less than that.</v>

7434
03:28:56.640 --> 03:28:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Once.</v>

7435
03:28:57.070 --> 03:28:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Zero to 60 in one second.</v>

7436
03:28:58.540 --> 03:28:58.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7437
03:28:58.841 --> 03:28:59.081
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

7438
03:28:59.081 --> 03:29:02.830
<v Speaker 1>they have these cars now that are doing it in less than three like regular cars.</v>

7439
03:29:02.831 --> 03:29:03.970
<v Speaker 1>You can go and buy at the store.</v>

7440
03:29:03.971 --> 03:29:04.421
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

7441
03:29:04.421 --> 03:29:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7442
03:29:04.720 --> 03:29:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I think the Tesla does it very quickly.</v>

7443
03:29:06.370 --> 03:29:07.180
<v Speaker 1>What's the lettuce with that?</v>

7444
03:29:07.180 --> 03:29:10.090
<v Speaker 1>They've got some new shit coming up fast as a Tesla goes zero to 60 I was</v>

7445
03:29:10.091 --> 03:29:10.841
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the,</v>

7446
03:29:10.841 --> 03:29:11.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7447
03:29:11.650 --> 03:29:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I heard about the Porsche nine 11 turbo s I think it does it in 2.8 seconds.</v>

7448
03:29:17.050 --> 03:29:17.691
<v Speaker 1>Zero to six.</v>

7449
03:29:17.691 --> 03:29:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Does it ever get to one?</v>

7450
03:29:18.880 --> 03:29:19.713
<v Speaker 1>Does that happen?</v>

7451
03:29:19.720 --> 03:29:20.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7452
03:29:21.250 --> 03:29:22.840
<v Speaker 1>If it got as far as it got,</v>

7453
03:29:22.850 --> 03:29:23.950
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get to that.</v>

7454
03:29:24.040 --> 03:29:25.090
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get to one,</v>

7455
03:29:25.330 --> 03:29:27.670
<v Speaker 1>but there's gotta be a lot of g force in that jets.</v>

7456
03:29:27.700 --> 03:29:28.240
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

7457
03:29:28.240 --> 03:29:30.170
<v Speaker 1>that's not an easy thing to model.</v>

7458
03:29:30.240 --> 03:29:32.560
<v Speaker 1>S can do it in 2.5 Jesus,</v>

7459
03:29:33.870 --> 03:29:36.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a nine 11 not Tesla.</v>

7460
03:29:36.400 --> 03:29:36.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7461
03:29:36.581 --> 03:29:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Tesla s 2.5 2.5 is that faster than a motorcycle?</v>

7462
03:29:41.110 --> 03:29:41.943
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

7463
03:29:42.370 --> 03:29:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I think a motorcycle could still do it and the tuition range if I had entirely</v>

7464
03:29:48.190 --> 03:29:48.881
<v Speaker 1>an electric car.</v>

7465
03:29:48.881 --> 03:29:49.600
<v Speaker 1>That looks cool.</v>

7466
03:29:49.600 --> 03:29:50.740
<v Speaker 1>How about the drives itself?</v>

7467
03:29:51.490 --> 03:29:52.600
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>

7468
03:29:52.660 --> 03:29:52.891
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

7469
03:29:52.891 --> 03:29:53.920
<v Speaker 1>it has the cameras.</v>

7470
03:29:54.160 --> 03:29:55.630
<v Speaker 1>It's reading the ground and the,</v>

7471
03:29:55.631 --> 03:29:55.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

7472
03:29:55.890 --> 03:29:57.010
<v Speaker 1>the distance around it.</v>

7473
03:29:57.070 --> 03:29:59.320
<v Speaker 1>That's faster than a lot of motorcycles on this list.</v>

7474
03:29:59.380 --> 03:30:00.213
<v Speaker 1>Is it really?</v>

7475
03:30:00.310 --> 03:30:03.030
<v Speaker 1>What about later high Bussa perilla is on.</v>

7476
03:30:03.340 --> 03:30:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Hi Bruce is a motorcycle</v>

7477
03:30:06.280 --> 03:30:06.850
<v Speaker 1>was shit.</v>

7478
03:30:06.850 --> 03:30:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was just a great uh,</v>

7479
03:30:10.090 --> 03:30:11.200
<v Speaker 1>NMA apparel.</v>

7480
03:30:11.230 --> 03:30:12.790
<v Speaker 1>It is great MMA apparel,</v>

7481
03:30:12.940 --> 03:30:14.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a bird.</v>

7482
03:30:14.620 --> 03:30:17.650
<v Speaker 1>A very fast bird gets fast.</v>

7483
03:30:18.190 --> 03:30:19.480
<v Speaker 1>What's the fastest bird ever?</v>

7484
03:30:19.481 --> 03:30:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the pair of Jean Falcon.</v>

7485
03:30:21.970 --> 03:30:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a falcon that goes like 200 miles an hour.</v>

7486
03:30:24.731 --> 03:30:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I did a commercial for them once where I was,</v>

7487
03:30:26.660 --> 03:30:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I was like for the Falcons for Hyatt Bussa.</v>

7488
03:30:29.350 --> 03:30:30.183
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7489
03:30:30.200 --> 03:30:31.033
<v Speaker 1>what do you got here Jamie?</v>

7490
03:30:32.080 --> 03:30:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>

7491
03:30:32.900 --> 03:30:34.030
<v Speaker 1>The fastest bird in the world.</v>

7492
03:30:34.060 --> 03:30:35.590
<v Speaker 1>242 miles an hour.</v>

7493
03:30:38.470 --> 03:30:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Which of course down fast risperidone</v>

7494
03:30:40.260 --> 03:30:45.260
<v Speaker 3>or what it does is it looks for a critter to Jack and when it's flying around it</v>

7495
03:30:46.641 --> 03:30:51.380
<v Speaker 3>finds one that who wants to fuck with and then it died dive bombs and just</v>

7496
03:30:51.530 --> 03:30:53.180
<v Speaker 3>achieves insane speed.</v>

7497
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:56.750
<v Speaker 3>I guess it like just flaps its wings willy quick.</v>

7498
03:30:56.930 --> 03:30:58.580
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to the perspective,</v>

7499
03:30:58.581 --> 03:31:00.230
<v Speaker 3>it's like you'd see a video on it,</v>

7500
03:31:00.231 --> 03:31:03.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard to like grasp how fast it's actually moving.</v>

7501
03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:06.380
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem to make sense when you're looking at it.</v>

7502
03:31:06.381 --> 03:31:07.940
<v Speaker 3>It just looks like it's going fast.</v>

7503
03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:09.030
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any perspective,</v>

7504
03:31:09.070 --> 03:31:09.980
<v Speaker 3>not on the ground,</v>

7505
03:31:10.370 --> 03:31:13.700
<v Speaker 3>but if like flew by you when you're on the ground,</v>

7506
03:31:13.701 --> 03:31:14.241
<v Speaker 3>you're probably like,</v>

7507
03:31:14.241 --> 03:31:15.590
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

7508
03:31:15.770 --> 03:31:16.603
<v Speaker 3>It's a rod.</v>

7509
03:31:16.900 --> 03:31:19.430
<v Speaker 3>Like that's faster than any car I've ever seen.</v>

7510
03:31:19.610 --> 03:31:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Like what's a fast car?</v>

7511
03:31:20.960 --> 03:31:22.040
<v Speaker 3>250 miles an hour.</v>

7512
03:31:22.041 --> 03:31:24.380
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be like what those Nascar guys do,</v>

7513
03:31:24.381 --> 03:31:24.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

7514
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:26.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think there you go that fast.</v>

7515
03:31:26.121 --> 03:31:27.230
<v Speaker 3>That's like a formula one speed.</v>

7516
03:31:27.231 --> 03:31:28.064
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

7517
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:30.770
<v Speaker 3>How fast is Nascar go?</v>

7518
03:31:33.380 --> 03:31:34.970
<v Speaker 3>One 80 Eddie Bravo.</v>

7519
03:31:34.971 --> 03:31:35.804
<v Speaker 3>Hate standards.</v>

7520
03:31:35.810 --> 03:31:38.330
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing me and Eddie Brown would just not have in common.</v>

7521
03:31:38.900 --> 03:31:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

7522
03:31:39.560 --> 03:31:41.360
<v Speaker 3>standard manual stick shift cars.</v>

7523
03:31:41.410 --> 03:31:44.350
<v Speaker 5>It's 2016 st the Flintstones.</v>

7524
03:31:44.880 --> 03:31:45.713
<v Speaker 3>I love them.</v>

7525
03:31:47.010 --> 03:31:47.843
<v Speaker 3>I love them.</v>

7526
03:31:48.510 --> 03:31:51.630
<v Speaker 3>I buy certain cars that are older just because they have stick shifts.</v>

7527
03:31:51.960 --> 03:31:53.460
<v Speaker 3>I like that they're there.</v>

7528
03:31:53.480 --> 03:31:56.400
<v Speaker 3>It's engaging but you you like associated with man,</v>

7529
03:31:56.401 --> 03:31:57.480
<v Speaker 3>I want to have to shift these fuckers.</v>

7530
03:31:57.550 --> 03:31:58.490
<v Speaker 5>I just want to tell her,</v>

7531
03:31:58.491 --> 03:31:59.291
<v Speaker 5>listen to music.</v>

7532
03:31:59.291 --> 03:32:02.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to fucking shift gears the same to forget it.</v>

7533
03:32:02.770 --> 03:32:03.603
<v Speaker 5>You must be</v>

7534
03:32:05.170 --> 03:32:06.280
<v Speaker 5>nothing wrong with thinking that way,</v>

7535
03:32:06.281 --> 03:32:06.960
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

7536
03:32:06.960 --> 03:32:07.480
<v Speaker 5>For me.</v>

7537
03:32:07.480 --> 03:32:09.640
<v Speaker 5>You should get an engine with the fucking front crank.</v>

7538
03:32:10.480 --> 03:32:11.313
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

7539
03:32:12.130 --> 03:32:13.780
<v Speaker 5>that would be the coolest shit out when I like,</v>

7540
03:32:13.840 --> 03:32:16.250
<v Speaker 5>I like to start my booking engine man manually.</v>

7541
03:32:16.300 --> 03:32:17.133
<v Speaker 5>There's a zen</v>

7542
03:32:17.160 --> 03:32:21.140
<v Speaker 3>state that you achieve when you shifting through the gears yourself and you're,</v>

7543
03:32:21.141 --> 03:32:24.240
<v Speaker 3>you're revving the engine up to a certain point and you're all tuned in to the</v>

7544
03:32:24.241 --> 03:32:25.320
<v Speaker 3>action of the car.</v>

7545
03:32:25.830 --> 03:32:27.480
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a lot of people and those kinds of cars,</v>

7546
03:32:27.481 --> 03:32:28.590
<v Speaker 3>they don't even listen to music.</v>

7547
03:32:28.830 --> 03:32:30.160
<v Speaker 3>The music becomes like them.</v>

7548
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:32.100
<v Speaker 3>The mechanics of the vehicle,</v>

7549
03:32:32.101 --> 03:32:32.970
<v Speaker 3>the engineering,</v>

7550
03:32:32.971 --> 03:32:34.440
<v Speaker 3>the way the tires grip the road,</v>

7551
03:32:34.441 --> 03:32:35.430
<v Speaker 3>you feel it in your ass.</v>

7552
03:32:35.700 --> 03:32:38.880
<v Speaker 3>He shifted gears and you lift up the clutch and he give it the gas.</v>

7553
03:32:38.881 --> 03:32:43.881
<v Speaker 3>Then you hear the Warhol Wall and you become an tuned with the machine and you</v>

7554
03:32:45.061 --> 03:32:46.770
<v Speaker 3>start feeling where the machines going.</v>

7555
03:32:47.250 --> 03:32:48.930
<v Speaker 3>And it becomes more of like a,</v>

7556
03:32:48.931 --> 03:32:51.840
<v Speaker 3>an exercise and stimulation than it does just drive it.</v>

7557
03:32:52.140 --> 03:32:53.370
<v Speaker 3>But I like driving too.</v>

7558
03:32:53.760 --> 03:32:56.670
<v Speaker 3>Like I like driving in a fucking a big suburban.</v>

7559
03:32:56.970 --> 03:32:59.010
<v Speaker 3>Like I rented a suburban this past weekend.</v>

7560
03:32:59.310 --> 03:32:59.521

7565
03:33:08.791 --> 03:33:09.800
<v Speaker 5>Like I saw minivan,</v>

03:33:16.890 --> 03:33:17.431
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

7570
03:33:17.431 --> 03:33:18.264
<v Speaker 5>Super Smart.</v>

7571
03:33:18.390 --> 03:33:19.470
<v Speaker 5>That's actually wicked smart.</v>

7572
03:33:20.050 --> 03:33:20.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

7573
03:33:20.321 --> 03:33:20.591
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

7574
03:33:20.591 --> 03:33:20.771
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

7575
03:33:20.771 --> 03:33:21.604
<v Speaker 3>they um,</v>

7576
03:33:22.090 --> 03:33:22.511
<v Speaker 3>this uh,</v>

7577
03:33:22.511 --> 03:33:24.280
<v Speaker 3>those suburbans they're like a,</v>

7578
03:33:24.281 --> 03:33:27.550
<v Speaker 3>they have that Cadillac escalades Cadillac escalades suspension,</v>

7579
03:33:27.760 --> 03:33:28.541
<v Speaker 3>but it's just cheaper.</v>

7580
03:33:28.541 --> 03:33:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Trim doesn't look as fancy,</v>

7581
03:33:30.460 --> 03:33:32.740
<v Speaker 3>but it's a nice car or renting one of those man,</v>

7582
03:33:32.741 --> 03:33:34.330
<v Speaker 3>they drive so comfortable.</v>

7583
03:33:34.331 --> 03:33:35.440
<v Speaker 3>They're so relaxed.</v>

7584
03:33:35.650 --> 03:33:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Just like the way it go over bumps.</v>

7585
03:33:37.140 --> 03:33:40.320
<v Speaker 3>Shit I cars of today are so God damn good.</v>

7586
03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Like if you had like I was thinking when I was driving this suburban,</v>

7587
03:33:43.800 --> 03:33:45.300
<v Speaker 3>it's like a 2016 suburban.</v>

7588
03:33:45.540 --> 03:33:45.961
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

7589
03:33:45.961 --> 03:33:50.100
<v Speaker 3>if you got an a 1950s Mercedes and you'll like,</v>

7590
03:33:50.101 --> 03:33:52.080
<v Speaker 3>this is the shit right now,</v>

7591
03:33:52.110 --> 03:33:53.580
<v Speaker 3>this is as good as it gets.</v>

7592
03:33:53.780 --> 03:33:55.350
<v Speaker 3>And you've gotten a senior like wow,</v>

7593
03:33:55.380 --> 03:33:56.310
<v Speaker 3>leather seats.</v>

7594
03:33:56.540 --> 03:33:57.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh real would handle.</v>

7595
03:33:58.080 --> 03:33:58.291
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

7596
03:33:58.291 --> 03:33:59.580
<v Speaker 3>you'd be driving this thing around.</v>

7597
03:33:59.820 --> 03:34:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Thinking is incredible.</v>

7598
03:34:01.140 --> 03:34:03.000
<v Speaker 3>I got the top of the line Mercedes man.</v>

7599
03:34:03.180 --> 03:34:08.180
<v Speaker 3>And then someone shoots you to 2016 and puts you in a regular family truck,</v>

7600
03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:09.600
<v Speaker 3>like a suburban,</v>

7601
03:34:09.720 --> 03:34:13.530
<v Speaker 3>which is just this big huge ass hunk of metal and dude,</v>

7602
03:34:13.710 --> 03:34:15.450
<v Speaker 3>it floats over the road.</v>

7603
03:34:15.630 --> 03:34:17.370
<v Speaker 3>It has this feeling when he hit the brakes,</v>

7604
03:34:17.371 --> 03:34:20.700
<v Speaker 3>like it's just engineered to stop quickly for this big fucking tank.</v>

7605
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:21.930
<v Speaker 3>He was gigantic.</v>

7606
03:34:21.931 --> 03:34:23.430
<v Speaker 3>It handles good for big,</v>

7607
03:34:23.431 --> 03:34:24.211
<v Speaker 3>gigantic thing.</v>

7608
03:34:24.211 --> 03:34:25.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like comfortable to drive.</v>

7609
03:34:25.790 --> 03:34:30.060
<v Speaker 4>Yet it doesn't look that different than the cars from the 60s like if the cut</v>

7610
03:34:30.260 --> 03:34:30.780
<v Speaker 4>the shape,</v>

7611
03:34:30.780 --> 03:34:31.730
<v Speaker 4>they got tires.</v>

7612
03:34:31.940 --> 03:34:32.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

7613
03:34:32.490 --> 03:34:33.323
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

7614
03:34:33.940 --> 03:34:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Generally it the biggest thing a guy would trip on that's he got jumped on a</v>

7615
03:34:38.451 --> 03:34:42.680
<v Speaker 4>time machine from the sixties to now wouldn't be the car so much as I still</v>

7616
03:34:42.681 --> 03:34:43.520
<v Speaker 4>fucking tires.</v>

7617
03:34:43.521 --> 03:34:44.660
<v Speaker 4>You guys aren't flying yet.</v>

7618
03:34:45.780 --> 03:34:47.860
<v Speaker 4>It's still round that the four tires you go,</v>

7619
03:34:47.910 --> 03:34:48.743
<v Speaker 4>you still have four.</v>

7620
03:34:49.010 --> 03:34:51.140
<v Speaker 4>They would trip out on the phones more than the cars.</v>

7621
03:34:51.440 --> 03:34:51.921
<v Speaker 4>The phones.</v>

7622
03:34:51.921 --> 03:34:52.281
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like,</v>

7623
03:34:52.281 --> 03:34:53.420
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

7624
03:34:53.450 --> 03:34:55.280
<v Speaker 4>We're connected with the world.</v>

7625
03:34:55.460 --> 03:34:57.320
<v Speaker 4>This is our connection to everybody.</v>

7626
03:34:57.470 --> 03:34:57.960
<v Speaker 4>It's fine.</v>

7627
03:34:57.960 --> 03:35:00.000
<v Speaker 3>There's some shit that's just too risky.</v>

7628
03:35:00.210 --> 03:35:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Like air balloons.</v>

7629
03:35:01.590 --> 03:35:03.840
<v Speaker 3>They never fucking got that shit perfected.</v>

7630
03:35:04.050 --> 03:35:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Nobody to hill when he was ever going,</v>

7631
03:35:05.431 --> 03:35:05.791
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

7632
03:35:05.791 --> 03:35:06.301
<v Speaker 3>he here.</v>

7633
03:35:06.301 --> 03:35:07.290
<v Speaker 3>You know with air balloons,</v>

7634
03:35:07.291 --> 03:35:08.280
<v Speaker 3>there's no fresh shower.</v>

7635
03:35:08.281 --> 03:35:08.850
<v Speaker 3>Bob,</v>

7636
03:35:08.850 --> 03:35:09.900
<v Speaker 3>he just started the fire,</v>

7637
03:35:09.901 --> 03:35:10.740
<v Speaker 3>fill up the balloon,</v>

7638
03:35:10.741 --> 03:35:11.520
<v Speaker 3>fly home.</v>

7639
03:35:11.520 --> 03:35:12.353
<v Speaker 3>It's no big deal.</v>

7640
03:35:12.640 --> 03:35:13.110
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

7641
03:35:13.110 --> 03:35:13.351
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

7642
03:35:13.351 --> 03:35:14.760
<v Speaker 3>it's not that accurate today,</v>

7643
03:35:14.761 --> 03:35:15.211
<v Speaker 3>but hey,</v>

7644
03:35:15.211 --> 03:35:16.230
<v Speaker 3>you use the exercise,</v>

7645
03:35:16.231 --> 03:35:17.640
<v Speaker 3>you walk a few miles from your home,</v>

7646
03:35:17.840 --> 03:35:18.040
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

7647
03:35:18.040 --> 03:35:18.290
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

7648
03:35:18.290 --> 03:35:21.200
<v Speaker 3>you land your balloon as close as you can to your home and then you were hung</v>

7649
03:35:21.210 --> 03:35:23.160
<v Speaker 3>just floating through the sky and the air.</v>

7650
03:35:23.490 --> 03:35:24.323
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

7651
03:35:25.020 --> 03:35:25.561
<v Speaker 3>People like,</v>

7652
03:35:25.561 --> 03:35:26.394

<v Speaker 3>you got to get that down.</v>

7654
03:35:27.630 --> 03:35:30.360
<v Speaker 3>But there's no funding to get it down because nobody's buying any fucking hot</v>

7655
03:35:30.361 --> 03:35:31.020
<v Speaker 3>air balloons.</v>

7656
03:35:31.020 --> 03:35:31.771
<v Speaker 3>And every now and then,</v>

7657
03:35:31.771 --> 03:35:33.360
<v Speaker 3>like there's a big accident in Texas,</v>

7658
03:35:33.361 --> 03:35:37.080
<v Speaker 3>like really recently in Texas in an air balloon.</v>

7663
03:35:43.351 --> 03:35:44.490
<v Speaker 3>but I want to say it was something like,</v>

03:35:44.940 --> 03:35:46.860
<v Speaker 3>it might've been like seven people or something.</v>

03:36:30.770 --> 03:36:31.041
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

7698
03:36:31.041 --> 03:36:32.000
<v Speaker 4>it's so dangerous,</v>

7699
03:36:32.001 --> 03:36:35.980
<v Speaker 4>but is it cooler than those wingsuits I the wingsuits might be</v>

7700
03:36:35.980 --> 03:36:36.700
<v Speaker 1>doper.</v>

7701
03:36:36.700 --> 03:36:38.410
<v Speaker 1>I think you fly more when you're gliding.</v>

7702
03:36:38.411 --> 03:36:41.430
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're flying in the wind current.</v>

7703
03:36:41.570 --> 03:36:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7704
03:36:41.870 --> 03:36:42.490
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

7705
03:36:42.490 --> 03:36:43.241
<v Speaker 1>you're dipping down.</v>

7706
03:36:43.241 --> 03:36:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you're fine falling and you're falling,</v>

7707
03:36:46.601 --> 03:36:47.434
<v Speaker 1>but your la,</v>

7708
03:36:48.620 --> 03:36:52.530
<v Speaker 1>it takes a long time to fall as opposed to staying up and actually flying and</v>

7709
03:36:52.540 --> 03:36:53.321
<v Speaker 1>blessed mother fucker.</v>

7710
03:36:53.321 --> 03:36:53.831
<v Speaker 1>He's got a jet.</v>

7711
03:36:53.831 --> 03:36:54.160
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

7712
03:36:54.160 --> 03:36:54.993
<v Speaker 1>You're attached to one.</v>

7713
03:36:56.050 --> 03:37:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Let's see that shit pack flying wing suit available done by your bed.</v>

7714
03:37:00.160 --> 03:37:00.950
<v Speaker 1>By herself.</v>

7715
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7716
03:37:01.150 --> 03:37:01.983
<v Speaker 1>Jet Packs.</v>

7717
03:37:02.020 --> 03:37:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7718
03:37:02.470 --> 03:37:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Jet Pack will soon be available to buy one for yourself anytime you want jetpack</v>

7719
03:37:08.560 --> 03:37:09.370
<v Speaker 1>flying suit.</v>

7720
03:37:09.370 --> 03:37:11.960
<v Speaker 1>People are going to fucking suicide bomb right into airplane.</v>

7721
03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:14.460
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] girlfriend's going to be flying across the country.</v>

7722
03:37:14.480 --> 03:37:15.313
<v Speaker 1>Go flux</v>

7723
03:37:17.380 --> 03:37:20.870
<v Speaker 1>flight patterns right out of Burbank Police Shit.</v>

7724
03:37:21.520 --> 03:37:25.180
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna get dropped out of a plane and then just going to fly right into</v>

7725
03:37:25.210 --> 03:37:27.940
<v Speaker 1>13 c they've got to time it perfectly.</v>

7726
03:37:28.810 --> 03:37:29.643
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shit.</v>

7727
03:37:29.740 --> 03:37:31.210
<v Speaker 1>She's gonna get an aisle seat.</v>

7728
03:37:31.211 --> 03:37:32.044
<v Speaker 1>You Bitch,</v>

7729
03:37:32.200 --> 03:37:32.531
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

7730
03:37:32.531 --> 03:37:33.351
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be in his foot.</v>

7731
03:37:33.351 --> 03:37:35.710
<v Speaker 1>He's on a foam glider and next to her the plane.</v>

7732
03:37:36.320 --> 03:37:37.153
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

7733
03:37:37.210 --> 03:37:37.961
<v Speaker 1>I think they just flew.</v>

7734
03:37:37.961 --> 03:37:39.400
<v Speaker 1>A plane went real slow,</v>

7735
03:37:39.401 --> 03:37:41.560
<v Speaker 1>but I went all the way around the world on solar power.</v>

7736
03:37:41.561 --> 03:37:42.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like 12 miles an hour.</v>

7737
03:37:42.851 --> 03:37:43.360
<v Speaker 1>It was Whoa,</v>

7738
03:37:43.360 --> 03:37:43.691
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>

7739
03:37:43.691 --> 03:37:44.261
<v Speaker 1>super slow.</v>

7740
03:37:44.261 --> 03:37:44.951
<v Speaker 1>Took like a month,</v>

7741
03:37:44.951 --> 03:37:45.940
<v Speaker 1>but that must have sucked.</v>

7742
03:37:46.300 --> 03:37:47.133
<v Speaker 1>How'd they get food?</v>

7743
03:37:48.250 --> 03:37:50.500
<v Speaker 1>They just slowly stayed up there with food.</v>

7744
03:37:50.830 --> 03:37:52.540
<v Speaker 1>How much shit do you think you left up there?</v>

7745
03:37:53.190 --> 03:37:54.670
<v Speaker 1>How many times do you shit if you're,</v>

7746
03:37:54.671 --> 03:37:55.420
<v Speaker 1>if you're going,</v>

7747
03:37:55.420 --> 03:37:56.253
<v Speaker 1>it's being done.</v>

7748
03:37:56.500 --> 03:37:56.950
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

7749
03:37:56.950 --> 03:38:01.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're going all the way around the world like that and you don't have time</v>

7750
03:38:01.811 --> 03:38:02.950
<v Speaker 1>to land to take a shit,</v>

7751
03:38:03.130 --> 03:38:06.460
<v Speaker 1>how much shit do actually drop off in that airport?</v>

7752
03:38:06.470 --> 03:38:08.560
<v Speaker 1>This shit hole in your and your outfit.</v>

7753
03:38:08.860 --> 03:38:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

7754
03:38:09.670 --> 03:38:12.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about the plane getting heavier because it's not like</v>

7755
03:38:12.851 --> 03:38:14.350
<v Speaker 1>you're eating the food and then you're shedding.</v>

7756
03:38:14.350 --> 03:38:15.490
<v Speaker 1>The weight stays consistent.</v>

7757
03:38:15.940 --> 03:38:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Like Mass on an airplane is in a static state,</v>

7758
03:38:18.970 --> 03:38:22.930
<v Speaker 1>like mass on an airplane never decreases or increases unless they drop shit out</v>

7759
03:38:22.931 --> 03:38:23.764
<v Speaker 1>of the plane.</v>

7760
03:38:24.470 --> 03:38:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Solar mplus impulse to approaches.</v>

7761
03:38:27.341 --> 03:38:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Abu Dhabi.</v>

7762
03:38:28.570 --> 03:38:29.403
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

7763
03:38:30.130 --> 03:38:30.521
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

7764
03:38:30.521 --> 03:38:31.390
<v Speaker 1>So he really did.</v>

7765
03:38:31.391 --> 03:38:32.710
<v Speaker 1>So he had stages.</v>

7766
03:38:32.860 --> 03:38:33.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7767
03:38:33.191 --> 03:38:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Which makes sense.</v>

7768
03:38:34.660 --> 03:38:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Last stop.</v>

7769
03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:39.640
<v Speaker 1>So he's doing it like stop at a top domains had solar panels.</v>

7770
03:38:39.641 --> 03:38:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>

7771
03:38:40.871 --> 03:38:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Powered by solar power.</v>

7772
03:38:41.961 --> 03:38:43.480
<v Speaker 1>You're saying you're going to get solar panels now?</v>

7773
03:38:43.570 --> 03:38:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7774
03:38:44.260 --> 03:38:44.860
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

7775
03:38:44.860 --> 03:38:46.040
<v Speaker 1>when you do a,</v>

7776
03:38:46.330 --> 03:38:48.130
<v Speaker 1>when you put solar panels on your house,</v>

7777
03:38:48.340 --> 03:38:51.980
<v Speaker 1>do you get off the grid and now you can get off the grid can?</v>

7778
03:38:52.090 --> 03:38:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

7779
03:38:52.600 --> 03:38:53.500
<v Speaker 1>but most people,</v>

7780
03:38:53.560 --> 03:38:55.240
<v Speaker 1>most people don't know g to the city.</v>

7781
03:38:55.600 --> 03:38:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Most people the most,</v>

7782
03:38:57.820 --> 03:39:00.130
<v Speaker 1>the easiest way for you to do it is you don't,</v>

7783
03:39:00.131 --> 03:39:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you're not independent.</v>

7784
03:39:01.001 --> 03:39:02.200
<v Speaker 1>You're still connected to the grid.</v>

7785
03:39:02.200 --> 03:39:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Like you can develop your own power.</v>

7786
03:39:04.090 --> 03:39:04.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7787
03:39:04.361 --> 03:39:04.901
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

7788
03:39:04.901 --> 03:39:05.800
<v Speaker 1>you've got to talk to Brian,</v>

7789
03:39:05.801 --> 03:39:06.670
<v Speaker 1>count about this.</v>

7790
03:39:06.940 --> 03:39:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause Brian Cowen,</v>

7791
03:39:07.951 --> 03:39:12.940
<v Speaker 1>it was the first of us to do it and he experienced a lot of bullshit,</v>

7792
03:39:13.270 --> 03:39:14.290
<v Speaker 1>a lot of paperwork.</v>

7793
03:39:14.291 --> 03:39:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to go through a lot of red tape?</v>

7794
03:39:15.940 --> 03:39:18.130
<v Speaker 1>They make it very difficult for you to get off the grid.</v>

7795
03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:19.480
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

7796
03:39:19.490 --> 03:39:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Can just put solar panels.</v>

7797
03:39:21.020 --> 03:39:21.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7798
03:39:21.490 --> 03:39:21.791
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7799
03:39:21.791 --> 03:39:22.361
<v Speaker 1>And very,</v>

7800
03:39:22.361 --> 03:39:22.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7801
03:39:22.690 --> 03:39:23.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7802
03:39:23.050 --> 03:39:23.680
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

7803
03:39:23.680 --> 03:39:27.820
<v Speaker 1>he had to go through a long process before they let his equipment go live.</v>

7804
03:39:28.180 --> 03:39:29.320
<v Speaker 1>It's all really interesting man.</v>

7805
03:39:29.620 --> 03:39:30.700
<v Speaker 1>But in their defense,</v>

7806
03:39:30.730 --> 03:39:31.061
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

7807
03:39:31.061 --> 03:39:31.900
<v Speaker 1>here's like,</v>

7808
03:39:32.050 --> 03:39:32.801
<v Speaker 1>I gotta do this.</v>

7809
03:39:32.801 --> 03:39:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I hate do this people,</v>

7810
03:39:33.711 --> 03:39:34.010
<v Speaker 1>but I got</v>

7811
03:39:34.010 --> 03:39:34.430
<v Speaker 3>to do this.</v>

7812
03:39:34.430 --> 03:39:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

7813
03:39:35.140 --> 03:39:35.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

7814
03:39:35.510 --> 03:39:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who's installing this electrical stuff and we live in fucking</v>

7815
03:39:40.071 --> 03:39:43.040
<v Speaker 3>California where fires happen all the God damn time.</v>

7816
03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:46.910
<v Speaker 3>So I don't necessarily think it's totally reasonable that someone doesn't look</v>

7817
03:39:46.911 --> 03:39:47.744
<v Speaker 3>at the wiring.</v>

7818
03:39:47.990 --> 03:39:49.910
<v Speaker 3>And make sure if you're doing something completely radical,</v>

7819
03:39:49.911 --> 03:39:51.420
<v Speaker 3>like getting off the grid and starting a,</v>

7820
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:53.120
<v Speaker 3>an independent power source,</v>

7821
03:39:53.121 --> 03:39:54.440
<v Speaker 3>you've got to connect to this house.</v>

7822
03:39:54.860 --> 03:39:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Let's just make sure that you have your credentials in place.</v>

7823
03:39:57.080 --> 03:40:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Let's just make sure that everything was done according to Code says fucking</v>

7824
03:40:00.231 --> 03:40:02.750
<v Speaker 3>houses and blow up and you don't burn to death in your sleep.</v>

7825
03:40:03.260 --> 03:40:03.471
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

7826
03:40:03.471 --> 03:40:05.480
<v Speaker 3>cause like these fires that people are having,</v>

7827
03:40:05.720 --> 03:40:07.760
<v Speaker 3>they're not controlling these goddamn things too good.</v>

7828
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:08.870
<v Speaker 3>There's no water man.</v>

7829
03:40:09.060 --> 03:40:09.301
<v Speaker 3>Everyone,</v>

7830
03:40:09.301 --> 03:40:12.770
<v Speaker 3>we'll where we live when we look around and you look around at the hills,</v>

7831
03:40:12.771 --> 03:40:16.010
<v Speaker 3>like go drive up Topanga Canyon and look at all those hills.</v>

7832
03:40:16.130 --> 03:40:16.881
<v Speaker 3>Go drive,</v>

7833
03:40:16.881 --> 03:40:17.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7834
03:40:17.241 --> 03:40:17.511
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

7835
03:40:17.511 --> 03:40:19.680
<v Speaker 3>I'll pass the one 18 and stall.</v>

7836
03:40:19.810 --> 03:40:20.643
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

7837
03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:24.050
<v Speaker 3>so when that crazy shit like have like if you talk to Michael Jai White,</v>

7838
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:25.663
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

7839
03:40:25.790 --> 03:40:29.390
<v Speaker 3>You know he lives out there where a that bit last big fire hit.</v>

7840
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:30.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

7841
03:40:30.050 --> 03:40:30.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7842
03:40:30.261 --> 03:40:31.094
<v Speaker 3>That was uh,</v>

7843
03:40:31.190 --> 03:40:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I was concerned.</v>

7844
03:40:32.061 --> 03:40:33.130
<v Speaker 3>I need to get ahold of that dude.</v>

7845
03:40:33.490 --> 03:40:34.510
<v Speaker 3>He was at Bella tour.</v>

7846
03:40:34.910 --> 03:40:36.080
<v Speaker 3>Not Concerned that he's hurt,</v>

7847
03:40:36.110 --> 03:40:37.310
<v Speaker 3>but concerned that maybe he,</v>

7848
03:40:37.350 --> 03:40:39.350
<v Speaker 3>his house was one of the many houses.</v>

7849
03:40:39.440 --> 03:40:41.060
<v Speaker 3>I guess he'd probably would have heard about it in the news,</v>

7850
03:40:41.061 --> 03:40:43.400
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people lost houses up there,</v>

7851
03:40:43.401 --> 03:40:43.670
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

7852
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:45.050
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people lost houses.</v>

7853
03:40:45.230 --> 03:40:49.160
<v Speaker 3>And then San Bernardino out where a hobbyists and that area,</v>

7854
03:40:49.310 --> 03:40:51.170
<v Speaker 3>they had a gigantic fire up there.</v>

7855
03:40:51.200 --> 03:40:52.033
<v Speaker 3>Huge one.</v>

7856
03:40:52.220 --> 03:40:54.290
<v Speaker 3>They had one up near Lake Arrowhead,</v>

7857
03:40:54.291 --> 03:40:55.760
<v Speaker 3>like up away from Lake Arrowhead.</v>

7858
03:40:55.761 --> 03:40:56.594
<v Speaker 3>They had one,</v>

7859
03:40:56.600 --> 03:40:58.460
<v Speaker 3>they've had a few of these fucking things.</v>

7860
03:40:58.460 --> 03:41:00.140
<v Speaker 3>The giant one in,</v>

7861
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

7862
03:41:00.700 --> 03:41:01.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

7863
03:41:01.230 --> 03:41:01.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

7864
03:41:01.850 --> 03:41:03.950
<v Speaker 3>San Bernardino or not a Santa Barbara Rather.</v>

7865
03:41:03.951 --> 03:41:04.784
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that one?</v>

7866
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:07.370
<v Speaker 3>But why would you get solar panels when you give the,</v>

7867
03:41:08.090 --> 03:41:10.490
<v Speaker 3>why would you get solar panels to give the power to?</v>

7868
03:41:10.520 --> 03:41:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Because it's more because it's more expensive to set up an independent system.</v>

7869
03:41:14.450 --> 03:41:16.730
<v Speaker 3>So most people get to a point where they realize,</v>

7870
03:41:16.760 --> 03:41:16.881
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

7871
03:41:16.881 --> 03:41:17.451
<v Speaker 3>this is good,</v>

7872
03:41:17.451 --> 03:41:18.950
<v Speaker 3>so I don't have to pay for power anymore.</v>

7873
03:41:19.220 --> 03:41:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Eventually my solar power will pay for itself.</v>

7874
03:41:21.800 --> 03:41:22.670
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

7875
03:41:22.671 --> 03:41:23.840
<v Speaker 3>if you have excess power,</v>

7876
03:41:23.841 --> 03:41:25.460
<v Speaker 3>you could sell that power back to the city.</v>

7877
03:41:26.300 --> 03:41:27.620
<v Speaker 3>But this is the question.</v>

7878
03:41:27.850 --> 03:41:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Hmm,</v>

7879
03:41:28.580 --> 03:41:30.500
<v Speaker 3>why would the city give a fuck?</v>

7880
03:41:30.530 --> 03:41:31.251
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

7881
03:41:31.251 --> 03:41:32.840
<v Speaker 3>this guy has a house with solar panels.</v>

7882
03:41:33.230 --> 03:41:33.501
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

7883
03:41:33.501 --> 03:41:35.600
<v Speaker 3>let's try to get some of his power that he's collecting.</v>

7884
03:41:35.840 --> 03:41:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Don't get old.</v>

7885
03:41:36.560 --> 03:41:38.060
<v Speaker 3>He's that central power.</v>

7886
03:41:38.150 --> 03:41:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's that simple.</v>

7887
03:41:39.640 --> 03:41:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Why would that even come up?</v>

7888
03:41:40.881 --> 03:41:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Like because solar panels to give you the power,</v>

7889
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.940
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

7890
03:41:45.170 --> 03:41:45.981
<v Speaker 3>How would that come up?</v>

7891
03:41:45.981 --> 03:41:46.101
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

7892
03:41:46.101 --> 03:41:46.934
<v Speaker 3>let me explain.</v>

7893
03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:48.530
<v Speaker 3>As far as I think I know it,</v>

7894
03:41:49.220 --> 03:41:50.360
<v Speaker 3>the way the grid works,</v>

7895
03:41:50.361 --> 03:41:50.671
<v Speaker 3>you know the,</v>

7896
03:41:50.671 --> 03:41:51.820
<v Speaker 3>these power stations,</v>

7897
03:41:51.870 --> 03:41:53.030
<v Speaker 3>they contribute to the grid.</v>

7898
03:41:53.540 --> 03:41:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

7899
03:41:54.230 --> 03:41:54.740
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

7900
03:41:54.740 --> 03:41:57.560
<v Speaker 3>there are instances sometimes where there's not enough power,</v>

7901
03:41:57.590 --> 03:41:57.861
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

7902
03:41:57.861 --> 03:42:02.450
<v Speaker 3>Like in the summertime where everybody's fucking acs going on and things below.</v>

7903
03:42:02.480 --> 03:42:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Remember those brownouts that went out where they shut off the power for</v>

7904
03:42:05.721 --> 03:42:06.381
<v Speaker 3>different places.</v>

7905
03:42:06.381 --> 03:42:07.214
<v Speaker 3>You remember that?</v>

7906
03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I think what happens is the way the grid is set up,</v>

7907
03:42:09.771 --> 03:42:11.870
<v Speaker 3>and I'm fucking completely guessing here,</v>

7908
03:42:12.170 --> 03:42:15.680
<v Speaker 3>but I would guess that if all the power is connected,</v>

7909
03:42:15.710 --> 03:42:16.610
<v Speaker 3>if there is a grid,</v>

7910
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:19.190
<v Speaker 3>that there's more than one contributing factor,</v>

7911
03:42:19.220 --> 03:42:22.130
<v Speaker 3>there's more than one contributing factor in powering the grid.</v>

7912
03:42:22.400 --> 03:42:23.820
<v Speaker 3>There's probably a power plant.</v>

7913
03:42:23.820 --> 03:42:25.340
<v Speaker 3>It was probably more than one thing.</v>

7914
03:42:25.341 --> 03:42:25.701
<v Speaker 3>It's probably,</v>

7915
03:42:25.701 --> 03:42:30.530
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a system of different power plants that that power the grid and</v>

7916
03:42:30.531 --> 03:42:31.470
<v Speaker 3>it's possible.</v>

7917
03:42:31.740 --> 03:42:32.910
<v Speaker 3>This is total guessing,</v>

7918
03:42:33.210 --> 03:42:38.210
<v Speaker 3>but if you figure out how to make what's essentially a solar powered generator,</v>

7919
03:42:38.640 --> 03:42:39.001
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>

7920
03:42:39.001 --> 03:42:39.181
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

7921
03:42:39.181 --> 03:42:39.451
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

7922
03:42:39.451 --> 03:42:39.661
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

7923
03:42:39.661 --> 03:42:39.930
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

7924
03:42:39.930 --> 03:42:41.640
<v Speaker 3>someone's connecting a solar,</v>

7925
03:42:41.641 --> 03:42:46.500
<v Speaker 3>extracting a device that's generating electricity and you have an excess of it.</v>

7926
03:42:46.740 --> 03:42:47.820
<v Speaker 3>They could probably use it.</v>

7927
03:42:48.060 --> 03:42:48.481
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

7928
03:42:48.481 --> 03:42:48.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

7929
03:42:48.840 --> 03:42:50.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's that difficult.</v>

7930
03:42:50.280 --> 03:42:51.113
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

7931
03:42:51.120 --> 03:42:55.830
<v Speaker 3>How come they're not interested in any of the power produced by a gas generators</v>

7932
03:42:55.831 --> 03:42:56.760
<v Speaker 3>that people have in their house.</v>

7933
03:42:56.761 --> 03:42:57.810
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a shit about that.</v>

7934
03:42:58.320 --> 03:42:58.561
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

7935
03:42:58.561 --> 03:42:59.400
<v Speaker 3>gas generators,</v>

7936
03:42:59.401 --> 03:42:59.791
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

7937
03:42:59.791 --> 03:43:01.890
<v Speaker 3>they have to constantly be restocked with gas.</v>

7938
03:43:02.040 --> 03:43:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Solar is relying on constant power that's around all the time.</v>

7939
03:43:05.940 --> 03:43:09.480
<v Speaker 3>And gas generators are used are a lot of rural people for backups.</v>

7940
03:43:09.780 --> 03:43:14.240
<v Speaker 3>Like I know a lady who lives in the mountains and she's got a set up where if</v>

7941
03:43:14.241 --> 03:43:15.180
<v Speaker 3>our power goes out,</v>

7942
03:43:15.181 --> 03:43:18.060
<v Speaker 3>there's a little switch that goes off in instantaneously.</v>

7943
03:43:18.240 --> 03:43:19.590
<v Speaker 3>She has a propane tank,</v>

7944
03:43:19.591 --> 03:43:23.580
<v Speaker 3>a giant ass propane tank that's like as big as this fucking room and it kicks</v>

7945
03:43:23.581 --> 03:43:24.150
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

7946
03:43:24.150 --> 03:43:27.420
<v Speaker 3>And that starts powering the her heat cause she lives in the,</v>

7947
03:43:27.470 --> 03:43:27.870
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

7948
03:43:27.870 --> 03:43:28.620
<v Speaker 3>in the mountains.</v>

7949
03:43:28.620 --> 03:43:31.410
<v Speaker 3>I wonder why city cause this a conspiracy again.</v>

7950
03:43:31.440 --> 03:43:31.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

7951
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

7952
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:32.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

7953
03:43:32.670 --> 03:43:33.600
<v Speaker 3>I'd never heard of any,</v>

7954
03:43:34.050 --> 03:43:34.980
<v Speaker 3>well the solar,</v>

7955
03:43:35.220 --> 03:43:36.810
<v Speaker 3>is there a solar panel conspiracy?</v>

7956
03:43:36.811 --> 03:43:37.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

7957
03:43:37.470 --> 03:43:37.830
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

7958
03:43:37.830 --> 03:43:39.930
<v Speaker 3>it does vary work batteries.</v>

7959
03:43:39.960 --> 03:43:42.340
<v Speaker 3>It's just very strange that</v>

7960
03:43:44.400 --> 03:43:49.270
<v Speaker 3>that would even come up solar panels for your house to give the energy to only</v>

7961
03:43:49.320 --> 03:43:50.790
<v Speaker 3>give what you're not using.</v>

7962
03:43:51.150 --> 03:43:51.983
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

7963
03:43:52.120 --> 03:43:52.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

7964
03:43:52.920 --> 03:43:53.640
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

7965
03:43:53.640 --> 03:43:57.990
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not doing it like you're farming electricity specifically for the</v>

7966
03:43:57.991 --> 03:43:59.460
<v Speaker 3>city and your people attending.</v>

7967
03:43:59.520 --> 03:44:00.600
<v Speaker 3>I think that is the way it is.</v>

7968
03:44:00.630 --> 03:44:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Well you're using the power and some of it you sell back to the city,</v>

7969
03:44:05.490 --> 03:44:07.020
<v Speaker 3>but you're using the power.</v>

7970
03:44:07.110 --> 03:44:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

7971
03:44:07.440 --> 03:44:09.090
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be your source of power.</v>

7972
03:44:09.250 --> 03:44:09.661
<v Speaker 3>Positive.</v>

7973
03:44:09.661 --> 03:44:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Cause I,</v>

7974
03:44:10.040 --> 03:44:11.760
<v Speaker 3>I pretty sure wrong,</v>

7975
03:44:11.790 --> 03:44:12.571
<v Speaker 3>I could be wrong,</v>

7976
03:44:12.571 --> 03:44:16.530
<v Speaker 3>but it could be that somebody could make it as a follower.</v>

7977
03:44:16.690 --> 03:44:19.770
<v Speaker 3>They're going to give you the power of the all hooked up with w we're going to</v>

7978
03:44:19.771 --> 03:44:22.440
<v Speaker 3>give you the three electricity and then we're going to pay you a little extra,</v>

7979
03:44:22.680 --> 03:44:23.640
<v Speaker 3>collect us shit.</v>

7980
03:44:23.820 --> 03:44:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

7981
03:44:24.390 --> 03:44:27.920
<v Speaker 3>We want that solar shit and we'll give you whatever for this process.</v>

7982
03:44:27.930 --> 03:44:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think there's going to be solar farms if it's profitable for you?</v>

7983
03:44:31.921 --> 03:44:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Because then you could just keep your plugs.</v>

7984
03:44:33.331 --> 03:44:34.470
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to replug everything.</v>

7985
03:44:34.560 --> 03:44:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Just give us all that.</v>

7986
03:44:35.481 --> 03:44:36.660
<v Speaker 3>If you don't replug anything,</v>

7987
03:44:36.661 --> 03:44:37.500
<v Speaker 3>you don't change anything.</v>

7988
03:44:37.650 --> 03:44:38.101
<v Speaker 3>What does it say?</v>

7989
03:44:38.101 --> 03:44:41.070
<v Speaker 3>The Sun shines on solar panels generated by DC electricity.</v>

7990
03:44:41.071 --> 03:44:44.910
<v Speaker 3>The DC electricity is fed into a solar inverter converts at 240 volts.</v>

7991
03:44:44.911 --> 03:44:45.870
<v Speaker 3>50 Hertz,</v>

7992
03:44:46.250 --> 03:44:49.830
<v Speaker 3>a 240 volt ac electricity is used to power the appliances in your home.</v>

7993
03:44:49.831 --> 03:44:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Certain posts,</v>

7994
03:44:50.340 --> 03:44:53.070
<v Speaker 3>electricity is fed back into the main grid.</v>

7995
03:44:53.430 --> 03:44:54.263
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

7996
03:44:54.620 --> 03:44:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Trample because this is like,</v>

7997
03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:58.680
<v Speaker 3>it's like a renewable resource.</v>

7998
03:44:58.681 --> 03:44:59.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a constant resource.</v>

7999
03:44:59.791 --> 03:45:04.791
<v Speaker 3>So that house right there has a solar panel energy from the solar panels back to</v>

8000
03:45:04.831 --> 03:45:05.250
<v Speaker 3>the grid?</v>

8001
03:45:05.250 --> 03:45:05.950
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

8002
03:45:05.950 --> 03:45:06.783
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

8003
03:45:06.810 --> 03:45:09.060
<v Speaker 3>It's trends surplus.</v>

8004
03:45:09.090 --> 03:45:10.080
<v Speaker 3>See the bottom part,</v>

8005
03:45:10.530 --> 03:45:14.850
<v Speaker 3>the last.it says surplus electricity is fed into the back,</v>

8006
03:45:14.851 --> 03:45:15.684
<v Speaker 3>into the main grid.</v>

8007
03:45:15.780 --> 03:45:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Would that means is whatever they don't need.</v>

8008
03:45:18.270 --> 03:45:21.240
<v Speaker 3>So if they generate a ton of electricity and they don't need all the</v>

8009
03:45:21.241 --> 03:45:21.721
<v Speaker 3>electricity,</v>

8010
03:45:21.721 --> 03:45:25.110
<v Speaker 3>like say if they have a lot of solar panels but they only have a two bedroom</v>

8011
03:45:25.111 --> 03:45:27.660
<v Speaker 3>house or a one bedroom house and it's just,</v>

8012
03:45:27.661 --> 03:45:27.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

8013
03:45:27.871 --> 03:45:29.160
<v Speaker 3>a small comfortable place.</v>

8014
03:45:29.170 --> 03:45:30.190
<v Speaker 3>They don't need all</v>

8015
03:45:30.190 --> 03:45:30.791
<v Speaker 1>that power.</v>

8016
03:45:30.791 --> 03:45:33.250
<v Speaker 1>They have too much of it is choosing.</v>

8017
03:45:33.251 --> 03:45:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Man Did they want that power man,</v>

8018
03:45:37.140 --> 03:45:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you got that.</v>

8019
03:45:37.690 --> 03:45:38.590
<v Speaker 1>You got an extra power.</v>

8020
03:45:38.650 --> 03:45:39.490
<v Speaker 1>There's not what it is,</v>

8021
03:45:39.491 --> 03:45:40.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

8022
03:45:40.150 --> 03:45:41.050
<v Speaker 1>You got to get rid of it.</v>

8023
03:45:41.060 --> 03:45:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Sounds crazy.</v>

8024
03:45:41.620 --> 03:45:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like too much and solar panels have too much power.</v>

8025
03:45:45.310 --> 03:45:45.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8026
03:45:45.461 --> 03:45:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I think you can generate too much for what you could store.</v>

8027
03:45:48.630 --> 03:45:49.211
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

8028
03:45:49.211 --> 03:45:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Then if you could,</v>

8029
03:45:49.840 --> 03:45:50.860
<v Speaker 1>and it's a problem like shit,</v>

8030
03:45:50.861 --> 03:45:51.550
<v Speaker 1>we got to,</v>

8031
03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:54.700
<v Speaker 1>we can't do this because then we collect too much and then it becomes a hazard</v>

8032
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:55.661
<v Speaker 1>towing the city goes,</v>

8033
03:45:55.661 --> 03:45:56.380
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

8034
03:45:56.380 --> 03:45:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

8035
03:45:56.860 --> 03:45:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you could give us the extra,</v>

8036
03:45:58.450 --> 03:45:58.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8037
03:45:58.631 --> 03:46:01.960
<v Speaker 1>as long as we care about the people and we want to go solar,</v>

8038
03:46:02.110 --> 03:46:02.801
<v Speaker 1>we want to go solar.</v>

8039
03:46:02.801 --> 03:46:05.800
<v Speaker 1>So we'll take that extra shit you got and we'll give you a little bit.</v>

8040
03:46:05.820 --> 03:46:07.210
<v Speaker 1>We'll get a couple of dollars for it too.</v>

8041
03:46:07.420 --> 03:46:08.170
<v Speaker 1>But don't,</v>

8042
03:46:08.170 --> 03:46:09.003
<v Speaker 1>don't stop.</v>

8043
03:46:09.190 --> 03:46:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Don't stop the cause.</v>

8044
03:46:10.450 --> 03:46:11.283
<v Speaker 1>It's all about</v>

8045
03:46:12.460 --> 03:46:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's having a conspiracy conversation with some imaginary executive is like a</v>

8046
03:46:16.781 --> 03:46:18.400
<v Speaker 1>dude selling weed.</v>

8047
03:46:19.960 --> 03:46:20.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dude settle.</v>

8048
03:46:20.951 --> 03:46:21.910
<v Speaker 1>We'd Yo yo Yo Yo,</v>

8055

8059
03:46:37.120 --> 03:46:38.320

8060
03:46:38.321 --> 03:46:39.154

<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

8063
03:46:43.070 --> 03:46:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we in the weed game,</v>

8064
03:46:44.560 --> 03:46:47.080
<v Speaker 1>we should have our own want to stay out of jail.</v>

8065
03:46:47.350 --> 03:46:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Bravo.</v>

8066
03:46:48.120 --> 03:46:49.170
<v Speaker 1>We need to waste point.</v>

8067
03:46:49.180 --> 03:46:50.320
<v Speaker 1>We could have our own dispensary,</v>

8068
03:46:50.321 --> 03:46:50.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

8069
03:46:50.740 --> 03:46:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8070
03:46:51.190 --> 03:46:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I think honestly it's too much work,</v>

8071
03:46:53.290 --> 03:46:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Joe and Eddie's.</v>

8072
03:46:54.280 --> 03:46:55.420
<v Speaker 1>It's too much work they can't use.</v>

8073
03:46:55.450 --> 03:46:56.141
<v Speaker 1>Here's the other thing.</v>

8074
03:46:56.141 --> 03:46:59.290
<v Speaker 1>He can't use credit cards and a lot of these places still isn't not the case or</v>

8075
03:46:59.291 --> 03:47:04.291
<v Speaker 1>the transfer and large amounts of cash or hiring a ex military guys [inaudible]</v>

8076
03:47:04.420 --> 03:47:09.420
<v Speaker 1>guide to or or multimillionaire guy to use our face would beg for more than one</v>

8077
03:47:10.571 --> 03:47:11.230
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

8078
03:47:11.230 --> 03:47:14.440
<v Speaker 1>They want that one money shot tipped the hang in the front of me and you like</v>

8079
03:47:14.441 --> 03:47:15.550
<v Speaker 1>smoking a joint or something.</v>

8080
03:47:15.700 --> 03:47:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll do that.</v>

8081
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:18.040
<v Speaker 1>But that's a Cheech and Chong do,</v>

8082
03:47:18.041 --> 03:47:18.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8083
03:47:18.280 --> 03:47:22.350
<v Speaker 1>They'll do like some sell some fucking rolling stone here.</v>

8084
03:47:22.430 --> 03:47:23.263
<v Speaker 1>We need that.</v>

8085
03:47:23.830 --> 03:47:26.590
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to remember when Tommy Chong got put in the pokey.</v>

8086
03:47:26.830 --> 03:47:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8087
03:47:27.470 --> 03:47:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I think those things are gongs,</v>

8088
03:47:28.751 --> 03:47:29.584
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

8089
03:47:29.650 --> 03:47:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

8090
03:47:30.670 --> 03:47:31.031
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

8091
03:47:31.031 --> 03:47:31.781
<v Speaker 1>I was really worried,</v>

8092
03:47:31.781 --> 03:47:32.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

8093
03:47:32.080 --> 03:47:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I was really worried of Ted Cruz got in.</v>

8094
03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I was like the nuttiness could like rise to a whole new level.</v>

8095
03:47:37.720 --> 03:47:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Like if you give people a bar,</v>

8096
03:47:39.281 --> 03:47:41.290
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I've been saying that I like about Obama,</v>

8097
03:47:41.500 --> 03:47:43.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever he did that people don't like,</v>

8098
03:47:43.211 --> 03:47:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

8099
03:47:43.810 --> 03:47:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

8100
03:47:44.320 --> 03:47:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm with Ya.</v>

8101
03:47:44.980 --> 03:47:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even saying that.</v>

8102
03:47:46.060 --> 03:47:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about his performance as far as like what he's done,</v>

8103
03:47:48.551 --> 03:47:51.070
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy was talking about like what he represents.</v>

8104
03:47:51.340 --> 03:47:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Like when you seen him on television,</v>

8105
03:47:52.661 --> 03:47:53.381
<v Speaker 1>he's well spoken,</v>

8106
03:47:53.381 --> 03:47:54.101
<v Speaker 1>he's articulate,</v>

8107
03:47:54.101 --> 03:47:54.970
<v Speaker 1>he went to Harvard,</v>

8108
03:47:55.270 --> 03:47:56.320
<v Speaker 1>he's a bright guy.</v>

8109
03:47:56.470 --> 03:47:59.590
<v Speaker 1>He seems like a guy that you would think would be like one of the smartest</v>

8110
03:47:59.591 --> 03:48:01.330
<v Speaker 1>people that you're ever going to come across.</v>

8111
03:48:01.480 --> 03:48:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Makes sense that he's running shit.</v>

8112
03:48:03.160 --> 03:48:03.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8113
03:48:03.640 --> 03:48:07.090
<v Speaker 1>if a guy like Ted Cruz or a lot of these other people that wanted to be</v>

8114
03:48:07.091 --> 03:48:07.924
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

8115
03:48:07.930 --> 03:48:12.930
<v Speaker 1>especially people with Wacky fucking religious ideas that just don't jive with</v>

8116
03:48:13.031 --> 03:48:14.230
<v Speaker 1>anything that we know.</v>

8117
03:48:14.620 --> 03:48:15.311
<v Speaker 1>If it fills,</v>

8118
03:48:15.311 --> 03:48:18.250
<v Speaker 1>people get into a position where they have massive amounts of influence.</v>

8119
03:48:18.430 --> 03:48:20.080
<v Speaker 1>People start getting really confused.</v>

8120
03:48:20.410 --> 03:48:22.780
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't used to think that until the,</v>

8121
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:26.560
<v Speaker 1>obviously I've learned cause I'm older but I didn't think that that much until</v>

8122
03:48:26.561 --> 03:48:27.394
<v Speaker 1>the Bush,</v>

8123
03:48:27.890 --> 03:48:29.520
<v Speaker 1>the Bush administration and then the,</v>

8124
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:32.300
<v Speaker 1>the nine 11 attacks maybe go whoa.</v>

8125
03:48:32.301 --> 03:48:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Like our consciousness is so much more fragile than I thought it was because I</v>

8126
03:48:37.071 --> 03:48:41.930
<v Speaker 1>thought what we were like as Americans in the nineties before the a nine 11</v>

8127
03:48:41.931 --> 03:48:43.130
<v Speaker 1>attacks during the Clinton thing.</v>

8128
03:48:43.310 --> 03:48:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were ridiculous in some ways because of the whole Clinton Monica</v>

8129
03:48:47.570 --> 03:48:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Lewinsky thing and then there was definitely some fuckery going on in other</v>

8130
03:48:50.301 --> 03:48:53.540
<v Speaker 1>countries but it didn't seem like the world was unsafe.</v>

8131
03:48:54.170 --> 03:48:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Like it seemed like the world,</v>

8132
03:48:55.551 --> 03:48:59.540
<v Speaker 1>the world felt like we got over that Cold War shit with the Russians were going</v>

8133
03:48:59.541 --> 03:49:00.111
<v Speaker 1>to be okay.</v>

8134
03:49:00.111 --> 03:49:01.550
<v Speaker 1>The world felt safe.</v>

8135
03:49:01.880 --> 03:49:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you had this guy,</v>

8136
03:49:03.200 --> 03:49:05.240
<v Speaker 1>even if he's full of shit and he's getting his dick sucked,</v>

8137
03:49:05.420 --> 03:49:06.290
<v Speaker 1>listen to him talk.</v>

8138
03:49:06.380 --> 03:49:07.670
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously smart as fuck.</v>

8139
03:49:07.880 --> 03:49:08.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8140
03:49:08.300 --> 03:49:09.133
<v Speaker 1>like maybe some,</v>

8141
03:49:09.380 --> 03:49:09.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8142
03:49:09.621 --> 03:49:13.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe some people that are crazy get to the point where their president,</v>

8143
03:49:13.940 --> 03:49:15.770
<v Speaker 1>some whip your dick out type dudes.</v>

8144
03:49:15.890 --> 03:49:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe people get crazy and they still get to the point where the president,</v>

8145
03:49:19.010 --> 03:49:20.600
<v Speaker 1>but obviously a very,</v>

8146
03:49:20.601 --> 03:49:21.440
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy,</v>

8147
03:49:21.441 --> 03:49:22.340
<v Speaker 1>very well spoken.</v>

8148
03:49:22.730 --> 03:49:26.540
<v Speaker 1>And then the Bush presidency came along and it was so transparent.</v>

8149
03:49:26.960 --> 03:49:30.860
<v Speaker 1>All of it was so transparent and then the the chain have,</v>

8150
03:49:30.861 --> 03:49:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Cheney was essentially run the show and he was always in a bunker and everyone,</v>

8151
03:49:34.800 --> 03:49:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Cheney was always in the bunker.</v>

8152
03:49:36.860 --> 03:49:38.000
<v Speaker 1>He was always in a bunker.</v>

8153
03:49:38.210 --> 03:49:40.940
<v Speaker 1>There was always talking about Cheney's hidden away somewhere in a fucking</v>

8154
03:49:40.941 --> 03:49:41.540
<v Speaker 1>bunker.</v>

8155
03:49:41.540 --> 03:49:44.900
<v Speaker 1>And there was that Wolfowitz dude hanging around and all these other fucking</v>

8156
03:49:44.901 --> 03:49:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Donald Rumsfeld type characters,</v>

8157
03:49:47.120 --> 03:49:48.500
<v Speaker 1>all these merchants,</v>

8158
03:49:49.040 --> 03:49:53.210
<v Speaker 1>all these like war merchants there were all swarming around.</v>

8159
03:49:53.480 --> 03:49:58.070
<v Speaker 1>And then we're at war like all of a sudden were constantly at war for like this</v>

8160
03:49:58.071 --> 03:49:58.791
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>

8161
03:49:58.791 --> 03:50:03.380
<v Speaker 1>massive amount of time and it's still hasn't let up all these years later,</v>

8162
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.980
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

8163
03:50:03.980 --> 03:50:08.060
<v Speaker 1>nine 11 was 15 years ago.</v>

8164
03:50:09.320 --> 03:50:13.310
<v Speaker 1>People jumping off buildings and just smashing into the streets.</v>

8165
03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:14.530
<v Speaker 1>That just happened.</v>

8166
03:50:14.570 --> 03:50:16.000
<v Speaker 1>It was 2001 right?</v>

8167
03:50:16.130 --> 03:50:18.920
<v Speaker 1>2001 that's 15 years ago.</v>

8168
03:50:20.390 --> 03:50:21.530
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

8169
03:50:22.010 --> 03:50:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Like we've been in a perpetual state of war for a sophomore's entire life.</v>

8170
03:50:27.600 --> 03:50:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

8171
03:50:28.220 --> 03:50:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Sophomore in high school.</v>

8172
03:50:29.421 --> 03:50:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Some kid who's kids that are,</v>

8173
03:50:31.641 --> 03:50:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I think freshman this year are learning about it through history books.</v>

8174
03:50:35.091 --> 03:50:37.630
<v Speaker 1>They didn't experience it in one second of their life or so.</v>

8175
03:50:37.631 --> 03:50:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

8176
03:50:38.360 --> 03:50:39.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah for sure.</v>

8177
03:50:39.051 --> 03:50:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Well that most people that are even,</v>

8178
03:50:40.521 --> 03:50:40.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8179
03:50:40.821 --> 03:50:43.370
<v Speaker 1>10 and above their parents would probably going to shield them from it for the</v>

8180
03:50:43.371 --> 03:50:46.100
<v Speaker 1>most part when it's happening 16 years ago.</v>

8181
03:50:46.101 --> 03:50:51.101
<v Speaker 1>So anybody younger than 26 barely understands what happened.</v>

8182
03:50:51.440 --> 03:50:52.273
<v Speaker 1>Barely.</v>

8183
03:50:53.040 --> 03:50:54.860
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>

8184
03:50:54.890 --> 03:50:56.480
<v Speaker 1>What a change of the world.</v>

8185
03:50:56.600 --> 03:50:58.580
<v Speaker 1>So I get real nervous now.</v>

8186
03:50:59.030 --> 03:51:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I get real nervous cause I just don't think that the way we're doing it right</v>

8187
03:51:03.681 --> 03:51:07.520
<v Speaker 1>now is appealing to anybody that we really want to run us.</v>

8188
03:51:08.090 --> 03:51:11.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a few people like Gary Johnson makes sense.</v>

8189
03:51:11.181 --> 03:51:13.190
<v Speaker 1>That libertarian guy that we had in here,</v>

8190
03:51:13.640 --> 03:51:14.090
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

8191
03:51:14.090 --> 03:51:19.090
<v Speaker 1>he seems like a real person and he has real experience like running New Mexico.</v>

8192
03:51:19.880 --> 03:51:20.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough.</v>

8193
03:51:20.840 --> 03:51:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know enough about politics.</v>

8194
03:51:23.300 --> 03:51:25.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough to really mean.</v>

8195
03:51:25.321 --> 03:51:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to</v>

8196
03:51:26.010 --> 03:51:27.570
<v Speaker 3>know what the way you know Jujitsu.</v>

8197
03:51:27.900 --> 03:51:29.340
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to really know it.</v>

8198
03:51:29.370 --> 03:51:33.270
<v Speaker 3>Like if some dude who's like a blue belt in Japanese Jujitsu starts talking to</v>

8199
03:51:33.271 --> 03:51:34.980
<v Speaker 3>you about Russ locks human be like pitch,</v>

8200
03:51:35.460 --> 03:51:36.060
<v Speaker 3>you know that's,</v>

8201
03:51:36.060 --> 03:51:37.050
<v Speaker 3>that's what I am.</v>

8202
03:51:37.051 --> 03:51:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Really what I'm talking about politics.</v>

8203
03:51:38.731 --> 03:51:42.870
<v Speaker 3>I have like a skeletal understanding of the way the system works,</v>

8204
03:51:42.871 --> 03:51:44.340
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a for stripe white belt.</v>

8205
03:51:44.940 --> 03:51:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

8206
03:51:45.630 --> 03:51:46.500
<v Speaker 3>When to get my blue.</v>

8207
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:47.700
<v Speaker 3>I would have had it already,</v>

8208
03:51:47.701 --> 03:51:50.460
<v Speaker 3>but I might have a yell about if we're ignoring karate.</v>

8209
03:51:50.640 --> 03:51:53.940
<v Speaker 3>I might've just gotten my belt after I got my yellow stripe and I was super</v>

8210
03:51:53.941 --> 03:51:56.520
<v Speaker 3>pumped filing my belt wasn't just playing white,</v>

8211
03:51:56.640 --> 03:51:57.750
<v Speaker 3>but that's where it ends.</v>

8212
03:51:58.050 --> 03:52:00.840
<v Speaker 3>That's where it ends and so like if I'm talking to some yellow belt,</v>

8213
03:52:00.841 --> 03:52:03.000
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to talk to them about effective striking techniques.</v>

8214
03:52:03.010 --> 03:52:04.590
<v Speaker 3>I get real irritable.</v>

8215
03:52:04.940 --> 03:52:05.521
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

8216
03:52:05.521 --> 03:52:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

8217
03:52:05.850 --> 03:52:08.030
<v Speaker 3>when you ask someone's rank and Jujitsu and they go,</v>

8218
03:52:08.040 --> 03:52:09.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get my blue.</v>

8219
03:52:09.130 --> 03:52:09.341
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>

8220
03:52:09.341 --> 03:52:10.174
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to test</v>

8221
03:52:11.680 --> 03:52:12.513
<v Speaker 3>bastard.</v>

8222
03:52:12.810 --> 03:52:14.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to test for my purple blue it.</v>

8223
03:52:14.551 --> 03:52:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Jiu Jitsu might be one of the only things that you really cannot possibly</v>

8224
03:52:17.671 --> 03:52:19.380
<v Speaker 3>understand what's happening if you don't do it.</v>

8225
03:52:19.680 --> 03:52:20.640
<v Speaker 3>If you've never done it,</v>

8226
03:52:20.641 --> 03:52:22.350
<v Speaker 3>you just are not going to know what's going on.</v>

8227
03:52:22.710 --> 03:52:23.610
<v Speaker 3>You're just not going to know.</v>

8228
03:52:23.730 --> 03:52:26.700
<v Speaker 3>You could have like a little bit of an understanding like here's an Armbar.</v>

8229
03:52:26.910 --> 03:52:29.010
<v Speaker 3>I've seen this transition to triangle before.</v>

8230
03:52:29.220 --> 03:52:29.551
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

8231
03:52:29.551 --> 03:52:33.780
<v Speaker 3>I've heard it said that if you commit to hard on that Kamora and you don't have</v>

8232
03:52:33.781 --> 03:52:34.770
<v Speaker 3>control of the legs,</v>

8233
03:52:34.950 --> 03:52:36.870
<v Speaker 3>the guy can counter with the far side arm bar.</v>

8234
03:52:37.230 --> 03:52:39.810
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people like have these things in their head that they know to</v>

8235
03:52:39.811 --> 03:52:40.590
<v Speaker 3>be true,</v>

8236
03:52:40.590 --> 03:52:41.940
<v Speaker 3>but they don't know what the way you know it,</v>

8237
03:52:41.970 --> 03:52:43.770
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to know it the way you know it.</v>

8238
03:52:43.870 --> 03:52:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Just there's just no way.</v>

8239
03:52:45.120 --> 03:52:47.310
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to see things that you're seeing your,</v>

8240
03:52:47.311 --> 03:52:50.520
<v Speaker 3>when you watch and Damien Maia Choco choke out Carlos condit tonight.</v>

8241
03:52:50.760 --> 03:52:52.470
<v Speaker 3>You're going through the path with them,</v>

8242
03:52:52.680 --> 03:52:53.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

8243
03:52:53.130 --> 03:52:53.941
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're seeing it.</v>

8244
03:52:53.941 --> 03:52:54.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

8245
03:52:54.241 --> 03:52:55.074
<v Speaker 3>You know the path.</v>

8246
03:52:55.860 --> 03:52:58.080
<v Speaker 3>A lot of other people are watching it and they're like,</v>

8247
03:52:58.290 --> 03:52:59.130
<v Speaker 3>they're in the middle of it.</v>

8248
03:52:59.131 --> 03:52:59.700
<v Speaker 3>He's on top.</v>

8249
03:52:59.700 --> 03:52:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

8250
03:52:59.910 --> 03:53:00.743
<v Speaker 3>Smashed Him.</v>

8251
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:01.770
<v Speaker 3>He's getting all on him.</v>

8252
03:53:01.771 --> 03:53:02.221
<v Speaker 3>He's on.</v>

8253
03:53:02.221 --> 03:53:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

8254
03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:03.313
<v Speaker 3>so think about,</v>

8255
03:53:03.620 --> 03:53:07.890
<v Speaker 3>think about how few people can watch Damien Maia.</v>

8256
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Choke out Carlos condit and see the path,</v>

8257
03:53:10.500 --> 03:53:11.880
<v Speaker 3>see the path he's going to take.</v>

8258
03:53:12.150 --> 03:53:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Watch him executed flawlessly.</v>

8259
03:53:14.490 --> 03:53:15.900
<v Speaker 3>See this Jujitsu,</v>

8260
03:53:15.930 --> 03:53:16.800
<v Speaker 3>not just in like,</v>

8261
03:53:16.801 --> 03:53:17.281
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

8262
03:53:17.281 --> 03:53:18.000
<v Speaker 3>what is he doing?</v>

8263
03:53:18.000 --> 03:53:20.070
<v Speaker 3>But see every single step of the way.</v>

8264
03:53:20.520 --> 03:53:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

8265
03:53:21.090 --> 03:53:24.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's just like Jujitsu,</v>

8266
03:53:24.270 --> 03:53:28.170
<v Speaker 3>that's just the case with every fucking thing that exists in this goddamn world</v>

8267
03:53:28.440 --> 03:53:29.131
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

8268
03:53:29.131 --> 03:53:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Someone is probably studied all their life to try to figure out how microphones</v>

8269
03:53:33.001 --> 03:53:33.590
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

8270
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.961
<v Speaker 3>You were.</v>

8271
03:53:33.961 --> 03:53:36.750
<v Speaker 3>I have put virtually no thought into it whatsoever,</v>

8272
03:53:36.840 --> 03:53:38.250
<v Speaker 3>but luckily somebody did.</v>

8273
03:53:38.370 --> 03:53:39.540
<v Speaker 3>So we have this microphone.</v>

8274
03:53:39.780 --> 03:53:41.280
<v Speaker 3>That's how I feel about everything.</v>

8275
03:53:41.310 --> 03:53:43.350
<v Speaker 3>That's how I feel about astronomy.</v>

8276
03:53:43.410 --> 03:53:44.810
<v Speaker 3>That's how I feel about the,</v>

8277
03:53:44.811 --> 03:53:46.230
<v Speaker 3>the Lunar Rover on the moon.</v>

8278
03:53:46.350 --> 03:53:47.970
<v Speaker 3>That's how I feel about all these things.</v>

8279
03:53:48.210 --> 03:53:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Like there's gotta be somewhere out there that's gotta be mad as fuck that two</v>

8280
03:53:51.931 --> 03:53:52.321
<v Speaker 3>dumps.</v>

8281
03:53:52.321 --> 03:53:56.190
<v Speaker 3>Donors are talking about whether or not the rover is legit and these fucking</v>

8282
03:53:56.191 --> 03:53:57.660
<v Speaker 3>guys been working out of their whole life.</v>

8283
03:53:57.661 --> 03:53:59.040
<v Speaker 3>They get scientific papers.</v>

8284
03:53:59.220 --> 03:54:01.920
<v Speaker 3>They like pulling their hair out in the middle of the night doing an Adderall,</v>

8285
03:54:01.921 --> 03:54:04.170
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how to make the calculations perfectly.</v>

8286
03:54:04.290 --> 03:54:07.400
<v Speaker 3>So this giant inflatable ball encompass or,</v>

8287
03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:11.370
<v Speaker 3>and what'd they do with zinc and cover what happens?</v>

8288
03:54:11.610 --> 03:54:13.350
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a giant inflatable ball.</v>

8289
03:54:13.351 --> 03:54:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they did it this way,</v>

8290
03:54:14.700 --> 03:54:17.220
<v Speaker 3>that encases the entire machine.</v>

8291
03:54:17.250 --> 03:54:18.180
<v Speaker 3>I saw that cartoon.</v>

8292
03:54:18.240 --> 03:54:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was supposed to be?</v>

8293
03:54:19.101 --> 03:54:19.934
<v Speaker 3>It was a cartoon,</v>

8294
03:54:20.100 --> 03:54:21.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's not real.</v>

8295
03:54:21.270 --> 03:54:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Of course they should definitely send back some video.</v>

8296
03:54:23.200 --> 03:54:24.130
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any video</v>

8297
03:54:24.130 --> 03:54:24.921
<v Speaker 1>of that dude.</v>

8298
03:54:24.921 --> 03:54:25.810
<v Speaker 1>It's people listening right now,</v>

8299
03:54:25.820 --> 03:54:26.653
<v Speaker 1>mad at us.</v>

8300
03:54:26.830 --> 03:54:28.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just proving people.</v>

8301
03:54:28.161 --> 03:54:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Your wife,</v>

8302
03:54:28.780 --> 03:54:30.040
<v Speaker 1>too many lies that you're like,</v>

8303
03:54:30.041 --> 03:54:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Yo bro,</v>

8304
03:54:30.520 --> 03:54:31.450
<v Speaker 1>that UFC bro,</v>

8305
03:54:31.600 --> 03:54:31.841
<v Speaker 1>bro,</v>

8306
03:54:31.841 --> 03:54:33.190
<v Speaker 1>that shit's fake as fuck dude.</v>

8307
03:54:33.250 --> 03:54:34.750
<v Speaker 1>That's just like WWE.</v>

8308
03:54:34.840 --> 03:54:35.890
<v Speaker 1>It's WWE.</v>

8309
03:54:35.891 --> 03:54:38.440
<v Speaker 1>But they've got some other tricks up their sleeve and I mean occasionally they</v>

8310
03:54:38.441 --> 03:54:39.160
<v Speaker 1>hit each other,</v>

8311
03:54:39.160 --> 03:54:39.631
<v Speaker 1>but dude,</v>

8312
03:54:39.631 --> 03:54:40.270
<v Speaker 1>trust me,</v>

8313
03:54:40.270 --> 03:54:41.103
<v Speaker 1>it's all fake.</v>

8314
03:54:41.260 --> 03:54:42.130
<v Speaker 1>So this is what it was.</v>

8315
03:54:42.370 --> 03:54:43.181
<v Speaker 1>If someone said that,</v>

8316
03:54:43.181 --> 03:54:46.210
<v Speaker 1>so parachutes came down thin ass atmosphere,</v>

8317
03:54:46.211 --> 03:54:46.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8318
03:54:46.480 --> 03:54:47.560
<v Speaker 1>There's almost no atmosphere.</v>

8319
03:54:47.561 --> 03:54:49.060
<v Speaker 1>They're actual footage right here.</v>

8320
03:54:49.330 --> 03:54:54.330
<v Speaker 1>So it drops and then explodes into these big inflates into these big bouncing</v>

8321
03:54:55.151 --> 03:54:55.960
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>

8322
03:54:55.960 --> 03:54:57.040
<v Speaker 1>If that was in a movie,</v>

8323
03:54:57.041 --> 03:54:57.874
<v Speaker 1>you'd be pissed.</v>

8324
03:54:58.150 --> 03:55:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And then it has these things that try to slow it down.</v>

8325
03:55:01.661 --> 03:55:04.060
<v Speaker 1>These jets that shoot down and then it hits the ground.</v>

8326
03:55:04.061 --> 03:55:04.894
<v Speaker 1>It bounces.</v>

8327
03:55:06.010 --> 03:55:10.210
<v Speaker 1>This looks like the shittiest fucking place to move to of all time.</v>

8328
03:55:10.330 --> 03:55:11.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what Maurice looks like.</v>

8329
03:55:11.690 --> 03:55:12.700
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the desert.</v>

8330
03:55:13.120 --> 03:55:14.440
<v Speaker 1>It looks way worse than the desert.</v>

8331
03:55:14.441 --> 03:55:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can go to the desert,</v>

8332
03:55:15.270 --> 03:55:18.250
<v Speaker 1>get gas as a fucking highway going through it and he'd stop swearing,</v>

8333
03:55:18.320 --> 03:55:19.153
<v Speaker 1>taking shit.</v>

8334
03:55:19.270 --> 03:55:20.720
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

8335
03:55:22.170 --> 03:55:23.800
<v Speaker 1>humans and you know,</v>

8336
03:55:23.890 --> 03:55:24.970
<v Speaker 1>very few spots.</v>

8337
03:55:24.971 --> 03:55:25.930
<v Speaker 1>If you land on earth,</v>

8338
03:55:25.931 --> 03:55:28.240
<v Speaker 1>you'd land on this probably more than a city.</v>

8339
03:55:28.241 --> 03:55:28.890
<v Speaker 1>A city is.</v>

8340
03:55:28.890 --> 03:55:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

8341
03:55:29.200 --> 03:55:30.700
<v Speaker 1>there's hardly no cities on this planet,</v>

8342
03:55:30.820 --> 03:55:31.061
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

8343
03:55:31.061 --> 03:55:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I was camping in Nevada high country just a week ago.</v>

8344
03:55:34.570 --> 03:55:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Get on a plane and look down.</v>

8345
03:55:35.591 --> 03:55:37.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that many cities.</v>

8346
03:55:37.091 --> 03:55:37.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

8347
03:55:37.440 --> 03:55:39.610
<v Speaker 1>it was way more barren wasteland than anything.</v>

8348
03:55:39.910 --> 03:55:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Well when you're in the Nevada high country,</v>

8349
03:55:42.101 --> 03:55:44.800
<v Speaker 1>you realize there's a reason why nobody fucking build houses out of here.</v>

8350
03:55:45.130 --> 03:55:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a hard scrabble world.</v>

8351
03:55:47.170 --> 03:55:52.170
<v Speaker 1>We were there in August and it's like a hundred degrees during the day.</v>

8352
03:55:52.900 --> 03:55:53.950
<v Speaker 1>It gets hot as fuck.</v>

8353
03:55:53.980 --> 03:55:57.190
<v Speaker 1>You got to bring a lot of water with you and then at night it gets down to the</v>

8354
03:55:57.190 --> 03:55:58.570
<v Speaker 1>30s it was freezing,</v>

8355
03:55:58.840 --> 03:55:59.880
<v Speaker 1>freezing at night.</v>

8356
03:55:59.881 --> 03:56:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean you freeze your fucking Dick off and there ain't shit up there.</v>

8357
03:56:03.260 --> 03:56:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Just a bunch of deer and some rabbits,</v>

8358
03:56:05.740 --> 03:56:07.510
<v Speaker 1>some occasional streams.</v>

8359
03:56:08.080 --> 03:56:10.240
<v Speaker 1>The sage bushes terminator right there.</v>

8360
03:56:10.510 --> 03:56:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Are you looking at the video right now because people are listening.</v>

8361
03:56:12.791 --> 03:56:13.960
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what we're talking about.</v>

8362
03:56:14.200 --> 03:56:18.100
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at the Mars rover landing on when you bravo doesn't believe in it.</v>

8363
03:56:18.220 --> 03:56:18.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8364
03:56:18.401 --> 03:56:19.300
<v Speaker 1>this is not real.</v>

8365
03:56:19.301 --> 03:56:19.960
<v Speaker 1>This is a CGI.</v>

8366
03:56:19.960 --> 03:56:20.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8367
03:56:20.111 --> 03:56:20.944
<v Speaker 1>this is CGI.</v>

8368
03:56:20.950 --> 03:56:23.560
<v Speaker 1>It's they have to explain where they are spending all their money.</v>

8369
03:56:23.650 --> 03:56:24.483
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

8370
03:56:24.550 --> 03:56:26.410
<v Speaker 1>They're making this little robot arm come up.</v>

8371
03:56:26.490 --> 03:56:27.610
<v Speaker 1>This is a switch for sure.</v>

8372
03:56:27.760 --> 03:56:29.380
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to build a little robot arm,</v>

8373
03:56:29.410 --> 03:56:32.740
<v Speaker 1>I'd make it bounced all over the fucking surface of the desert.</v>

8374
03:56:33.580 --> 03:56:36.580
<v Speaker 1>That's how he imagined your iPhone was stuck in the middle of that ball and it</v>

8375
03:56:36.581 --> 03:56:38.500
<v Speaker 1>bounced for sure it wouldn't work.</v>

8376
03:56:39.490 --> 03:56:42.370
<v Speaker 1>This thing is robust strong wiring.</v>

8377
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Imagine somebody fucked up one little wire and they sh they landed on the moon.</v>

8378
03:56:46.991 --> 03:56:47.801
<v Speaker 1>That's happened before,</v>

8379
03:56:47.801 --> 03:56:48.634
<v Speaker 1>hasn't it?</v>

8380
03:56:48.700 --> 03:56:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Haven't they shot things all the way to the moon and forgot they turned them on</v>

8381
03:56:52.120 --> 03:56:54.550
<v Speaker 1>or a all the way to Mars and it didn't work.</v>

8382
03:56:55.240 --> 03:56:56.140
<v Speaker 1>They don't always work.</v>

8383
03:56:57.340 --> 03:56:58.173
<v Speaker 1>Where's the</v>

8384
03:57:00.250 --> 03:57:01.083
<v Speaker 1>pops back on?</v>

8385
03:57:01.260 --> 03:57:02.093
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

8386
03:57:02.200 --> 03:57:03.033
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

8387
03:57:04.090 --> 03:57:07.000
<v Speaker 1>well the youtube video is the most important piece of evidence.</v>

8388
03:57:07.510 --> 03:57:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Any kind of weekend we should cherish.</v>

8389
03:57:09.940 --> 03:57:11.850
<v Speaker 1>She could be on Vimeo as as well.</v>

8390
03:57:11.880 --> 03:57:12.430
<v Speaker 1>My space,</v>

8391
03:57:12.430 --> 03:57:12.770
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

8392
03:57:12.770 --> 03:57:13.630
<v Speaker 1>USTREAM is good.</v>

8393
03:57:14.080 --> 03:57:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I like a Geo cities websites.</v>

8394
03:57:16.001 --> 03:57:16.834
<v Speaker 1>This is my favorite.</v>

8395
03:57:16.840 --> 03:57:17.890
<v Speaker 1>They have the best info.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So Carolina,</v>

8542
04:00:34.591 --> 04:00:35.131
<v Speaker 2>Pete rose.</v>

8543
04:00:35.131 --> 04:00:35.964
<v Speaker 2>How does she beat her?</v>

8544
04:00:36.060 --> 04:00:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Just a decision.</v>

8545
04:00:37.770 --> 04:00:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Really good fight.</v>

8546
04:00:40.180 --> 04:00:41.660
<v Speaker 2>Was that a five round fight vision?</v>

8547
04:00:43.000 --> 04:00:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Why do I say,</v>

8548
04:00:43.630 --> 04:00:45.140
<v Speaker 2>why don't I think that was a five round fight.</v>

8549
04:00:45.220 --> 04:00:46.510
<v Speaker 2>You think Ron does coming back?</v>

8550
04:00:46.840 --> 04:00:47.673
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

8551
04:00:48.240 --> 04:00:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Much money she make.</v>

8552
04:00:50.680 --> 04:00:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how big it will be when Ronda comes back now?</v>

8553
04:00:53.471 --> 04:00:56.230
<v Speaker 2>It could just be Rhonda and Cyborg right off the bat.</v>

8554
04:00:56.380 --> 04:00:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Right off the bat and that would be the biggest fight ever.</v>

8555
04:00:59.010 --> 04:00:59.831
<v Speaker 2>Just even right now.</v>

8556
04:00:59.831 --> 04:01:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Even though she just lost.</v>

8557
04:01:00.970 --> 04:01:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Do you think she would do that?</v>

8558
04:01:02.110 --> 04:01:02.980
<v Speaker 2>What do you think she would do?</v>

8559
04:01:03.040 --> 04:01:04.930
<v Speaker 2>That would be the most gangster move right there.</v>

8560
04:01:04.931 --> 04:01:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Who just say fuck it.</v>

8561
04:01:05.830 --> 04:01:07.270
<v Speaker 2>That that would be the ultimate gangster.</v>

8562
04:01:07.300 --> 04:01:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda just said,</v>

8563
04:01:08.110 --> 04:01:10.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming back and it's me and Cyborg.</v>

8564
04:01:10.051 --> 04:01:14.260
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna do one 40 let's fucking do this shit for a super bowl fight of all</v>

8565
04:01:14.261 --> 04:01:14.720
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

8566
04:01:14.720 --> 04:01:15.553
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

8567
04:01:15.610 --> 04:01:16.750
<v Speaker 2>That would be the gangster shit.</v>

8568
04:01:16.751 --> 04:01:21.130
<v Speaker 2>There would be the gangster shit or you got to get home home right now.</v>

8569
04:01:21.131 --> 04:01:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Homes like on a down swing.</v>

8570
04:01:23.230 --> 04:01:26.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a perfect time for Rhonda to cause for sure.</v>

8571
04:01:26.171 --> 04:01:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Homing going to turn down.</v>

8572
04:01:27.150 --> 04:01:27.983
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda.</v>

8573
04:01:28.090 --> 04:01:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda is in control of that fight.</v>

8574
04:01:29.920 --> 04:01:31.690
<v Speaker 2>She can get redemption right off the bat.</v>

8575
04:01:31.780 --> 04:01:32.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you think she does that?</v>

8576
04:01:32.741 --> 04:01:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Are you think she goes straight to a title shot?</v>

8577
04:01:36.880 --> 04:01:40.890
<v Speaker 2>All three cyborg would be the biggest title shot would be big there.</v>

8578
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll be big.</v>

8579
04:01:41.690 --> 04:01:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I think cyber would be the biggest and people would understand that she's not</v>

8580
04:01:44.651 --> 04:01:47.140
<v Speaker 2>getting a title shot right away to the Amanda Nunes.</v>

8581
04:01:47.141 --> 04:01:47.561
<v Speaker 2>Genesis.</v>

8582
04:01:47.561 --> 04:01:48.910
<v Speaker 2>God Damn terrified.</v>

8583
04:01:49.330 --> 04:01:50.230
<v Speaker 2>She's terrified.</v>

8584
04:01:50.260 --> 04:01:51.730
<v Speaker 2>But her against sidewalk will be bigger.</v>

8585
04:01:52.570 --> 04:01:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

8586
04:01:53.230 --> 04:01:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Even even with that top percent will be bigger than her and home.</v>

8587
04:01:57.460 --> 04:01:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez is legit as fuck.</v>

8588
04:01:59.800 --> 04:02:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Obviously after she beat me she would take,</v>

8589
04:02:01.331 --> 04:02:04.270
<v Speaker 2>but she's going to have to have some more fights where people know about her</v>

8590
04:02:04.271 --> 04:02:06.100
<v Speaker 2>more to get the big money fights.</v>

8591
04:02:06.101 --> 04:02:06.491
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

8592
04:02:06.491 --> 04:02:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

8593
04:02:06.940 --> 04:02:09.420
<v Speaker 2>to get people like to get a Rhonda to want a fighter.</v>

8594
04:02:09.460 --> 04:02:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8595
04:02:09.950 --> 04:02:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to see the Cyborg fight home and Rhonda would be fucking Mega.</v>

8596
04:02:15.200 --> 04:02:16.600
<v Speaker 2>You just base it all on the revenge.</v>

8597
04:02:16.630 --> 04:02:18.940
<v Speaker 2>But home did lose her last two fights.</v>

8598
04:02:18.941 --> 04:02:19.691
<v Speaker 2>So that kind of could,</v>

8599
04:02:19.691 --> 04:02:20.260
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>

8600
04:02:20.260 --> 04:02:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>

8601
04:02:20.680 --> 04:02:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Busler Shirky roar Micky ward and um,</v>

8602
04:02:24.220 --> 04:02:27.700
<v Speaker 2>homeboy the fuck you to a Turo Gotti like that trilogy.</v>

8603
04:02:27.701 --> 04:02:28.241
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cared.</v>

8604
04:02:28.241 --> 04:02:29.230
<v Speaker 2>They weren't the best in the world.</v>

8605
04:02:29.260 --> 04:02:29.981
<v Speaker 2>No one gave a fuck.</v>

8606
04:02:29.981 --> 04:02:30.461
<v Speaker 2>No one can see.</v>

8607
04:02:30.461 --> 04:02:32.950
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think about this whole law and not that this isn't,</v>

8608
04:02:33.280 --> 04:02:35.770
<v Speaker 2>that is not one of the best in the world because he definitely is.</v>

8609
04:02:35.771 --> 04:02:36.604
<v Speaker 2>And so it was Nate.</v>

8610
04:02:36.880 --> 04:02:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

8611
04:02:37.330 --> 04:02:39.700
<v Speaker 2>but like they fight for the title at one 17.</v>

8612
04:02:39.701 --> 04:02:40.300
<v Speaker 2>They didn't matter.</v>

8613
04:02:40.300 --> 04:02:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Dana.</v>

8614
04:02:40.750 --> 04:02:41.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8615
04:02:41.021 --> 04:02:41.381
<v Speaker 2>Dana,</v>

8616
04:02:41.381 --> 04:02:44.080
<v Speaker 2>thanks for some reason that that fight doesn't make sense to do it again.</v>

8617
04:02:44.081 --> 04:02:44.321
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

8618
04:02:44.321 --> 04:02:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

8619
04:02:45.130 --> 04:02:45.963
<v Speaker 2>are you crazy?</v>

8620
04:02:46.270 --> 04:02:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Like please do it again,</v>

8621
04:02:47.620 --> 04:02:48.370
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

8622
04:02:48.370 --> 04:02:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Like if they want to do it or they both saying they want to do it,</v>

8623
04:02:50.800 --> 04:02:53.320
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck doesn't want to see that fight again?</v>

8624
04:02:53.650 --> 04:02:56.980
<v Speaker 2>And if he's got to give up the featherweight fight or the featherweight title to</v>

8625
04:02:56.981 --> 04:02:57.820
<v Speaker 2>have that fight again,</v>

8626
04:02:58.090 --> 04:02:59.410
<v Speaker 2>can you just give up the title?</v>

8627
04:02:59.710 --> 04:03:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Give up the title?</v>

8628
04:03:01.090 --> 04:03:01.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8629
04:03:01.481 --> 04:03:02.620
<v Speaker 2>put that fight on again.</v>

8630
04:03:02.710 --> 04:03:03.543
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

8631
04:03:03.580 --> 04:03:04.570
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to see that again.</v>

8632
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

8633
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:09.340
<v Speaker 2>But it'll happen regardless of Connor wins or loses his upcoming matches.</v>

8634
04:03:09.341 --> 04:03:10.510
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't even affect it.</v>

8635
04:03:10.720 --> 04:03:11.141
<v Speaker 2>Like if he,</v>

8636
04:03:11.141 --> 04:03:12.160
<v Speaker 2>if he decided to fight,</v>

8637
04:03:12.410 --> 04:03:13.243
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

8638
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

8639
04:03:14.320 --> 04:03:15.041
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

8640
04:03:15.041 --> 04:03:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Even if it loses,</v>

8641
04:03:15.730 --> 04:03:16.301
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

8642
04:03:16.301 --> 04:03:17.134
<v Speaker 2>That's tonight.</v>

8643
04:03:18.200 --> 04:03:21.580
<v Speaker 5>That third fight is always going to be there because if you put Connor against</v>

8644
04:03:21.910 --> 04:03:23.650
<v Speaker 5>anybody at 55 right now,</v>

8645
04:03:23.651 --> 04:03:25.030
<v Speaker 5>haven't relinquished that title.</v>

8646
04:03:25.210 --> 04:03:26.290
<v Speaker 5>Give it back to Aldo.</v>

8647
04:03:26.500 --> 04:03:28.050
<v Speaker 5>Do 55 to anybody.</v>

8648
04:03:28.090 --> 04:03:29.200
<v Speaker 5>Do Magnum met off?</v>

8649
04:03:29.260 --> 04:03:30.010
<v Speaker 5>That would be huge.</v>

8650
04:03:30.010 --> 04:03:31.420
<v Speaker 5>Or Tony Ferguson would be huge.</v>

8651
04:03:31.421 --> 04:03:32.650
<v Speaker 5>That'd be a lot of press on that.</v>

8652
04:03:32.920 --> 04:03:34.240
<v Speaker 5>Tony Ferguson deserves that.</v>

8653
04:03:34.600 --> 04:03:36.730
<v Speaker 5>And then also you could just finish that.</v>

8654
04:03:36.731 --> 04:03:38.620
<v Speaker 5>Rafael dos Anjos let's make that happen.</v>

8655
04:03:38.910 --> 04:03:39.740
<v Speaker 5>Those are fine.</v>

8656
04:03:39.740 --> 04:03:40.640
<v Speaker 1>It's at 55.</v>

8657
04:03:40.641 --> 04:03:41.540
<v Speaker 1>It's already been stated.</v>

8658
04:03:41.541 --> 04:03:42.860
<v Speaker 1>This is going to fight for the title.</v>

8659
04:03:42.980 --> 04:03:44.600
<v Speaker 1>So he would go right to Alvarez.</v>

8660
04:03:44.730 --> 04:03:45.890
<v Speaker 1>He would fight Eddie Alvarez</v>

8661
04:03:46.160 --> 04:03:46.993
<v Speaker 5>be beautiful too.</v>

8662
04:03:47.790 --> 04:03:48.450
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful.</v>

8663
04:03:48.450 --> 04:03:49.740
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit would be beautiful.</v>

8664
04:03:49.741 --> 04:03:50.341
<v Speaker 5>That would be crazy.</v>

8665
04:03:50.341 --> 04:03:51.300
<v Speaker 5>So many epic.</v>

8666
04:03:51.301 --> 04:03:52.081

8667
04:03:52.081 --> 04:03:52.621
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>

8670

8683
04:04:14.190 --> 04:04:16.230
<v Speaker 5>A corner and covered tank.</v>

8684
04:04:16.350 --> 04:04:19.080
<v Speaker 5>A tank in front of a castle with hyenas?</v>

8685
04:04:19.930 --> 04:04:20.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8687
04:04:22.110 --> 04:04:23.880
<v Speaker 5>all around us better in the private jet,</v>

8688
04:04:23.881 --> 04:04:24.870
<v Speaker 5>like Trump's private jet,</v>

8689
04:04:24.871 --> 04:04:27.600
<v Speaker 5>which is like a seven 57 just like a whole,</v>

8690
04:04:27.660 --> 04:04:28.800
<v Speaker 5>not just the little jet.</v>

8691
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:31.290
<v Speaker 5>A whole Goddamn jumbo jet for yourself.</v>

8692
04:04:31.350 --> 04:04:32.560
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how know there's something wrong?</v>

8693
04:04:32.690 --> 04:04:33.523
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>

8694
04:04:33.950 --> 04:04:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how I know something wrong with Trump?</v>

8695
04:04:36.080 --> 04:04:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Because he was eating Kentucky Fried Chicken on his airplane with a fork and a</v>

8696
04:04:38.941 --> 04:04:39.774
<v Speaker 1>knife.</v>

8697
04:04:40.100 --> 04:04:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Was it okay when I tell him,</v>

8698
04:04:42.051 --> 04:04:42.884

8704
04:04:50.540 --> 04:04:51.373
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

8705
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:52.940
<v Speaker 1>He got his class maybe.</v>

8706
04:04:53.090 --> 04:04:53.800

8710
04:04:55.370 --> 04:04:57.530
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about fork and knife conducted fried chicken.</v>

8711
04:04:57.531 --> 04:05:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's dudes who wear sneakers or don't have any socks on.</v>

8712
04:05:00.650 --> 04:05:00.951
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

8714
04:05:04.340 --> 04:05:05.173
<v Speaker 1>There's no proof.</v>

8715
04:05:05.310 --> 04:05:08.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't that seem like a very product placement type.</v>

8716
04:05:08.440 --> 04:05:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Little human right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

8718
04:05:11.330 --> 04:05:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he got paid by KFC?</v>

8719
04:05:13.460 --> 04:05:15.530
<v Speaker 1>How dare you all bucket to himself.</v>

8720
04:05:16.090 --> 04:05:16.520
<v Speaker 5>He might,</v>

8721
04:05:16.520 --> 04:05:17.840
<v Speaker 5>what happened on,</v>

8722

8725
04:05:22.400 --> 04:05:22.791
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

8726
04:05:22.791 --> 04:05:26.570
<v Speaker 5>He was on some talk show where they were calling them out on bringing out</v>

8727
04:05:26.571 --> 04:05:28.730
<v Speaker 5>clothes from companies that he owned.</v>

8728
04:05:28.731 --> 04:05:29.600
<v Speaker 5>Like where did you,</v>

8729
04:05:29.601 --> 04:05:32.540
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about the China trade or where'd you make this isn't shirt shirt</v>

8730
04:05:32.800 --> 04:05:33.680
<v Speaker 5>is a shirt company.</v>

8731
04:05:33.681 --> 04:05:34.730
<v Speaker 5>Didn't cause that talk.</v>

8732
04:05:34.740 --> 04:05:37.280
<v Speaker 5>Meyer show that Seth Meyers busted them out.</v>

8733
04:05:37.730 --> 04:05:40.730
<v Speaker 5>It must have been old cause I'm thinking it's David Letterman and that must have</v>

8734
04:05:40.731 --> 04:05:42.290
<v Speaker 5>been at least two years old or something.</v>

8735
04:05:43.740 --> 04:05:44.573
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

8736
04:05:44.600 --> 04:05:46.520
<v Speaker 5>But it gets called out on the show.</v>

8737
04:05:46.580 --> 04:05:49.940
<v Speaker 5>He's bringing out clothing the Donald Trump is owns.</v>

8738
04:05:50.920 --> 04:05:51.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8739
04:05:51.101 --> 04:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Make America great again by hiring Chinese people to make your shirt.</v>

8740
04:05:56.140 --> 04:05:57.090
<v Speaker 5>But you know what man,</v>

8741
04:05:57.091 --> 04:05:57.270
<v Speaker 5>ever,</v>

8742
04:05:57.270 --> 04:05:59.250
<v Speaker 5>he's saying whatever it takes to have a friend.</v>

8743
04:05:59.610 --> 04:06:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who has some sort of a marketing business,</v>

8744
04:06:03.040 --> 04:06:03.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8745
04:06:03.490 --> 04:06:06.150
<v Speaker 1>where a or a manufacturing business rather,</v>

8746
04:06:06.300 --> 04:06:07.081
<v Speaker 1>where they make,</v>

8747
04:06:07.081 --> 04:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8748
04:06:07.490 --> 04:06:08.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8749
04:06:08.070 --> 04:06:08.903
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

8750
04:06:09.150 --> 04:06:09.661
<v Speaker 1>They make,</v>

8751
04:06:09.661 --> 04:06:10.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8752
04:06:10.140 --> 04:06:11.250
<v Speaker 1>like outdoor clothes,</v>

8753
04:06:11.251 --> 04:06:13.740
<v Speaker 1>like hiking and mountaineering clothes and,</v>

8754
04:06:13.741 --> 04:06:14.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8755
04:06:14.130 --> 04:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>they say that they can't</v>

8756
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:21.070
<v Speaker 3>find a sew house in America that is up to the same standards as the Sohouse as</v>

8757
04:06:22.911 --> 04:06:25.820
<v Speaker 3>they find in China because they do so much manufacturing.</v>

8758
04:06:26.120 --> 04:06:26.511
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

8759
04:06:26.511 --> 04:06:26.691
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

8760
04:06:26.691 --> 04:06:28.280
<v Speaker 3>we would like to do this in America,</v>

8761
04:06:28.310 --> 04:06:31.970
<v Speaker 3>but in order to have the very best quality of clothing,</v>

8762
04:06:31.971 --> 04:06:36.971
<v Speaker 3>like you literally can't do what he's doing in America right now.</v>

8763
04:06:37.970 --> 04:06:39.350
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty fucking weird.</v>

8764
04:06:39.530 --> 04:06:42.230
<v Speaker 3>Like that's one of the scariest things that happened when they started shipping</v>

8765
04:06:42.740 --> 04:06:44.240
<v Speaker 3>manufacturing overseas.</v>

8766
04:06:44.390 --> 04:06:48.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like other places got way more manufacturing jobs.</v>

8767
04:06:48.171 --> 04:06:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

8768
04:06:48.680 --> 04:06:53.680
<v Speaker 3>But they also were working for insanely low wages and living in the factories.</v>

8769
04:06:54.440 --> 04:06:55.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

8770
04:06:55.030 --> 04:06:58.130
<v Speaker 3>like that's one of the weirder things about buying products.</v>

8771
04:06:58.220 --> 04:06:58.341
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

8772
04:06:58.341 --> 04:06:59.570
<v Speaker 3>if you buy something from China,</v>

8773
04:06:59.571 --> 04:07:00.680
<v Speaker 3>like if you buy an iPhone,</v>

8774
04:07:00.920 --> 04:07:05.300
<v Speaker 3>we all know it in our dirty little heart of hearts that there's nets all around</v>

8775
04:07:05.301 --> 04:07:08.720
<v Speaker 3>those buildings to keep those people from jumping to their death.</v>

8776
04:07:09.320 --> 04:07:12.230
<v Speaker 3>And they live there and have somebody actually like was arguing.</v>

8777
04:07:12.231 --> 04:07:12.501
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

8778
04:07:12.501 --> 04:07:12.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

8779
04:07:12.801 --> 04:07:16.070
<v Speaker 3>the statistic likelihood of someone committing suicide,</v>

8780
04:07:16.460 --> 04:07:16.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

8781
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:20.780
<v Speaker 3>at one of those factories is not that different than the statistical likelihood</v>

8782
04:07:20.781 --> 04:07:25.781
<v Speaker 3>of people in the area committing suicide and since they live and work in that</v>

8783
04:07:26.511 --> 04:07:30.890
<v Speaker 3>factory gives you a deceptive number of how many people who work in the factory</v>

8784
04:07:30.891 --> 04:07:32.510
<v Speaker 3>committing suicide nuts.</v>

8785
04:07:32.670 --> 04:07:32.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

8786
04:07:32.921 --> 04:07:33.590
<v Speaker 3>So what's the problem?</v>

8787
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:34.011
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

8788
04:07:34.011 --> 04:07:34.221
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

8789
04:07:34.221 --> 04:07:37.280
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is they're killing themselves where they work.</v>

8790
04:07:37.760 --> 04:07:40.070
<v Speaker 3>How many people kill themselves when they work like worldwide?</v>

8791
04:07:40.220 --> 04:07:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Like the numbers pretty fucking low.</v>

8792
04:07:41.691 --> 04:07:45.350
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's weird when people jump to their death rather than go to work</v>

8793
04:07:45.351 --> 04:07:46.100
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

8794
04:07:46.100 --> 04:07:47.690
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking weird,</v>

8795
04:07:47.691 --> 04:07:48.110
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

8796
04:07:48.110 --> 04:07:48.950
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

8797
04:07:49.620 --> 04:07:51.170
<v Speaker 3>Or were they smoking cigarettes when they jumped?</v>

8798
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

8799
04:07:52.370 --> 04:07:56.690
<v Speaker 3>Even weirder to work as slaves to buy cigarettes to jumped to their death while</v>

8800
04:07:56.691 --> 04:07:59.990
<v Speaker 3>they're making iPhones and people stare at them on by Agra.</v>

8801
04:08:00.260 --> 04:08:00.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

8802
04:08:00.591 --> 04:08:03.590
<v Speaker 3>they get Viagra and random boner pills.</v>

8803
04:08:04.230 --> 04:08:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Foxconn replaces 60,000 factory workers with robots.</v>

8804
04:08:07.370 --> 04:08:08.203
<v Speaker 3>Good News.</v>

8805
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Not really for those people that needed that money.</v>

8806
04:08:11.120 --> 04:08:11.751
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

8807
04:08:11.751 --> 04:08:12.321
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird,</v>

8808
04:08:12.321 --> 04:08:13.154
<v Speaker 3>slippery argument.</v>

8809
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:15.690
<v Speaker 3>I know these people that had a factory down and uh,</v>

8810
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:16.970
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in South America,</v>

8811
04:08:17.340 --> 04:08:19.340
<v Speaker 3>it makes some clothes for this big company.</v>

8812
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:20.750
<v Speaker 3>And they were talking about how,</v>

8813
04:08:20.780 --> 04:08:21.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

8814
04:08:21.350 --> 04:08:22.540
<v Speaker 3>how much money it saves him.</v>

8815
04:08:22.541 --> 04:08:22.801
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

8816
04:08:22.801 --> 04:08:22.971
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

8817
04:08:22.971 --> 04:08:26.300
<v Speaker 3>but does it didn't feel weird that these people are so poor and that they work</v>

8818
04:08:26.301 --> 04:08:27.740
<v Speaker 3>all day in the factory?</v>

8819
04:08:27.810 --> 04:08:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not trying to be mean or anything.</v>

8820
04:08:29.690 --> 04:08:30.081
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

8821
04:08:30.081 --> 04:08:31.250
<v Speaker 3>well then they didn't have that.</v>

8822
04:08:31.251 --> 04:08:32.300
<v Speaker 3>They would starve to death.</v>

8823
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.991
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

8824
04:08:32.991 --> 04:08:33.111
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

8825
04:08:33.111 --> 04:08:35.420
<v Speaker 3>would they really like how'd they get there in the first place?</v>

8826
04:08:35.660 --> 04:08:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Because this is the only option.</v>

8827
04:08:36.651 --> 04:08:40.940
<v Speaker 3>The only option is they have to work and sane hours for shit money so that they</v>

8828
04:08:40.941 --> 04:08:42.980
<v Speaker 3>can make clothes so they could barely get by.</v>

8829
04:08:43.010 --> 04:08:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the only option.</v>

8830
04:08:44.480 --> 04:08:46.760
<v Speaker 3>That sounds so close to slavery.</v>

8831
04:08:47.190 --> 04:08:51.740
<v Speaker 3>It sounds so close that it's just like an economic slaves that freelance st</v>

8832
04:08:51.741 --> 04:08:52.310
<v Speaker 3>slavery.</v>

8833
04:08:52.310 --> 04:08:52.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

8834
04:08:52.571 --> 04:08:53.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like they found that you don't have to,</v>

8835
04:08:53.910 --> 04:08:55.700
<v Speaker 3>a wild slavery evolved into,</v>

8836
04:08:55.701 --> 04:08:57.230
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't have the fucking house them.</v>

8837
04:08:57.590 --> 04:09:00.130
<v Speaker 3>We just paid them so they don't think their slaves and then let them,</v>

8838
04:09:00.131 --> 04:09:02.720
<v Speaker 3>how's themselves have barely going to be at afford anything.</v>

8839
04:09:02.721 --> 04:09:03.800
<v Speaker 3>So they got to work all day.</v>

8840
04:09:03.980 --> 04:09:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

8841
04:09:04.730 --> 04:09:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Now we came up with,</v>

8842
04:09:06.110 --> 04:09:07.400
<v Speaker 3>for our fucking animals,</v>

8843
04:09:07.460 --> 04:09:09.740
<v Speaker 3>if they came up with basic income here in America,</v>

8844
04:09:09.820 --> 04:09:10.201
<v Speaker 3>like if they,</v>

8845
04:09:10.201 --> 04:09:12.380
<v Speaker 3>they they instituted like a living wage,</v>

8846
04:09:12.680 --> 04:09:12.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

8847
04:09:12.861 --> 04:09:13.471
<v Speaker 3>like whatever the,</v>

8848
04:09:13.471 --> 04:09:14.520
<v Speaker 3>whatever it would be.</v>

8849
04:09:14.850 --> 04:09:15.700
<v Speaker 3>And then uh,</v>

8850
04:09:15.750 --> 04:09:19.830
<v Speaker 3>then we started not doing that and like not doing that to other parts of the</v>

8851
04:09:19.831 --> 04:09:20.280
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

8852
04:09:20.280 --> 04:09:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Like if America got to a point,</v>

8853
04:09:21.631 --> 04:09:23.490
<v Speaker 3>whatever the point is like 25 bucks an hour,</v>

8854
04:09:23.491 --> 04:09:24.211
<v Speaker 3>20 bucks an hour,</v>

8855
04:09:24.211 --> 04:09:25.050
<v Speaker 3>whatever it needs to be,</v>

8856
04:09:25.051 --> 04:09:27.220
<v Speaker 3>where you can totally survive off a war.</v>

8857
04:09:27.221 --> 04:09:29.760
<v Speaker 3>You can't pay anybody less than that because they can't survive.</v>

8858
04:09:29.761 --> 04:09:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Like it's been determined like this is like a reasonable amount you could pay</v>

8859
04:09:32.671 --> 04:09:33.510
<v Speaker 3>someone with their time.</v>

8860
04:09:33.960 --> 04:09:37.800
<v Speaker 3>The difference between that money and how much money you can spend in a third</v>

8861
04:09:37.801 --> 04:09:38.634
<v Speaker 3>world country,</v>

8862
04:09:38.940 --> 04:09:41.070
<v Speaker 3>hiring people to make your shit.</v>

8863
04:09:41.310 --> 04:09:42.900
<v Speaker 3>It's staggering.</v>

8864
04:09:43.350 --> 04:09:46.200
<v Speaker 3>The amount more money that you make is staggering.</v>

8865
04:09:47.790 --> 04:09:48.391
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

8866
04:09:48.391 --> 04:09:49.050
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

8867
04:09:49.050 --> 04:09:50.820
<v Speaker 3>it's just weird that we allow it.</v>

8868
04:09:51.690 --> 04:09:53.040
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that we think it's okay.</v>

8869
04:09:53.041 --> 04:09:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Like it's over there.</v>

8870
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:54.151
<v Speaker 2>It's over there.</v>

8871
04:09:54.151 --> 04:09:54.870
<v Speaker 2>It's over there.</v>

8872
04:09:54.870 --> 04:09:55.251
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

8873
04:09:55.251 --> 04:09:56.410
<v Speaker 2>if it was like,</v>

8874
04:09:57.230 --> 04:09:57.651
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

8875
04:09:57.651 --> 04:09:58.321
<v Speaker 2>this is my company.</v>

8876
04:09:58.321 --> 04:09:59.154
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit.</v>

8877
04:09:59.160 --> 04:09:59.321
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

8878
04:09:59.321 --> 04:10:00.154
<v Speaker 2>it's where we have like</v>

8879
04:10:00.190 --> 04:10:00.850
<v Speaker 3>boundaries.</v>

8880
04:10:00.850 --> 04:10:04.570
<v Speaker 3>Like we're okay if it's across the dirt or if it's across the water,</v>

8881
04:10:04.690 --> 04:10:05.500
<v Speaker 3>it's okay,</v>

8882
04:10:05.500 --> 04:10:06.580
<v Speaker 3>but if it's inside of us,</v>

8883
04:10:06.640 --> 04:10:07.630
<v Speaker 3>we would never allow it.</v>

8884
04:10:07.810 --> 04:10:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

8885
04:10:08.410 --> 04:10:09.910
<v Speaker 3>Like think of the United States of America.</v>

8886
04:10:09.911 --> 04:10:10.061
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

8887
04:10:10.061 --> 04:10:10.421
<v Speaker 3>It was nice.</v>

8888
04:10:10.421 --> 04:10:11.111
<v Speaker 3>He's from America,</v>

8889
04:10:11.111 --> 04:10:14.190
<v Speaker 3>from New York to Los Angeles has big open,</v>

8890
04:10:14.400 --> 04:10:15.880
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of crazy shit in there.</v>

8891
04:10:16.150 --> 04:10:18.310
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of places where there's no people living.</v>

8892
04:10:18.850 --> 04:10:22.690
<v Speaker 3>If somehow or another they establish some sort of manufacturing in the middle of</v>

8893
04:10:22.691 --> 04:10:26.890
<v Speaker 3>the country out there and paid people a dollar a day and had them working like</v>

8894
04:10:26.891 --> 04:10:29.710
<v Speaker 3>slaves and living in these buildings and jumping off the roof,</v>

8895
04:10:29.920 --> 04:10:33.880
<v Speaker 3>we would never tolerate it because it's inside of our dirt patch.</v>

8896
04:10:34.240 --> 04:10:37.060
<v Speaker 3>But if it goes across the water to the other dirt patch,</v>

8897
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:38.200
<v Speaker 3>like outrageous.</v>

8898
04:10:38.380 --> 04:10:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile for sure with us buying these things were directly responsible for</v>

8899
04:10:43.931 --> 04:10:46.270
<v Speaker 3>them being able to have such a factory in the first place.</v>

8900
04:10:46.271 --> 04:10:46.991
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's like,</v>

8901
04:10:46.991 --> 04:10:47.111
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

8902
04:10:47.111 --> 04:10:49.210
<v Speaker 3>everybody else is doing it and we just keep doing it.</v>

8903
04:10:50.370 --> 04:10:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Factories learned,</v>

8904
04:10:51.331 --> 04:10:51.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

04:10:53.251 --> 04:10:57.710
<v Speaker 2>they bombard everybody in the Jiu Jitsu world about geese and rash guards and</v>

8909
04:10:57.810 --> 04:10:59.190
<v Speaker 2>special call man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He told them my podcast and we're fucking nuts.</v>

8931
04:11:36.360 --> 04:11:36.931

<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

8934
04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:39.383
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

8935
04:11:39.420 --> 04:11:39.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8936
04:11:39.661 --> 04:11:39.921
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

8937
04:11:39.921 --> 04:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>there's parts of the world that you're just not safe.</v>

8938
04:11:41.911 --> 04:11:45.060
<v Speaker 2>And that's why when people come from those parts and they come back,</v>

8939
04:11:45.061 --> 04:11:45.450
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

8940
04:11:45.450 --> 04:11:46.283
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

8941
04:11:46.640 --> 04:11:48.870
<v Speaker 2>like we've got to keep this going.</v>

8942
04:11:49.440 --> 04:11:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Whatever we got going on here and we've got to keep this going.</v>

8943
04:11:51.631 --> 04:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>We can't let this thing or a road like,</v>

8944
04:11:54.300 --> 04:11:55.410
<v Speaker 2>it's not perfect.</v>

8945
04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:57.090
<v Speaker 2>The United States isn't perfect,</v>

8946
04:11:57.720 --> 04:12:01.650
<v Speaker 2>but the whole world is in a fucking turmoil right now.</v>

8947
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:02.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a sustainable,</v>

8948
04:12:02.971 --> 04:12:05.280
<v Speaker 2>currently sort of sustainable turmoil,</v>

8949
04:12:05.610 --> 04:12:06.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's in a turmoil,</v>

8950
04:12:07.080 --> 04:12:07.913
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

8951
04:12:08.160 --> 04:12:08.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

8952
04:12:08.760 --> 04:12:11.130
<v Speaker 2>this is a weird time to be a person.</v>

8953
04:12:11.140 --> 04:12:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody realizes</v>

8954
04:12:12.530 --> 04:12:17.530
<v Speaker 3>we're in some strange transitionary stage of being a human being or human beings</v>

8955
04:12:18.521 --> 04:12:23.230
<v Speaker 3>are aware of like infinitely more now than they were just a few decades ago.</v>

8956
04:12:23.530 --> 04:12:28.530
<v Speaker 3>And we're evaluating everything about everything and putting it through this</v>

8957
04:12:28.811 --> 04:12:30.520
<v Speaker 3>filter and trying to figure it out and going,</v>

8958
04:12:30.521 --> 04:12:31.354
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

8959
04:12:31.450 --> 04:12:35.140
<v Speaker 3>what kind of weird life where we live in this temporary existence,</v>

8960
04:12:35.620 --> 04:12:40.270
<v Speaker 3>trying to sort out this impossibly complicated,</v>

8961
04:12:40.271 --> 04:12:44.590
<v Speaker 3>fucked up world of political connections.</v>

8962
04:12:45.220 --> 04:12:50.220
<v Speaker 3>And one hand washing the other and the Clinton Foundation and all this word.</v>

8963
04:12:51.451 --> 04:12:52.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna fucking,</v>

8964

8967
04:12:55.240 --> 04:12:56.073
<v Speaker 3>but I'd love,</v>

8968
04:12:56.080 --> 04:12:57.580
<v Speaker 3>I'd love some conspiracy theories.</v>

8969
04:12:57.581 --> 04:13:01.420
<v Speaker 3>And one of them that I've been dabbling in is all these people that crossed</v>

8970
04:13:01.421 --> 04:13:01.781
<v Speaker 3>Hillary,</v>

04:13:09.951 --> 04:13:14.510
<v Speaker 3>you are statistically less likely to get bit by a shark than you are to get</v>

8977
04:13:14.511 --> 04:13:14.910
<v Speaker 3>killed by [inaudible]</v>

8978
04:13:14.910 --> 04:13:15.743
<v Speaker 4>Hillary.</v>

8979
04:13:17.010 --> 04:13:17.843
<v Speaker 4>She's a gangster.</v>

8980
04:13:17.940 --> 04:13:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Her and her husband,</v>

8981
04:13:18.900 --> 04:13:20.340

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

8987
04:13:29.560 --> 04:13:32.560
<v Speaker 3>he got fired just coincidentally after he said that about Hillary.</v>

8988
04:13:32.610 --> 04:13:33.121
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

8989
04:13:33.121 --> 04:13:33.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

8990

<v Speaker 4>I would like to thank that.</v>

8991
04:13:34.680 --> 04:13:37.800
<v Speaker 4>I think the corruption in politics,</v>

8992
04:13:38.090 --> 04:13:38.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

8993
04:13:38.390 --> 04:13:40.140
<v Speaker 4>borrows a lot from the mafia.</v>

8994
04:13:40.141 --> 04:13:42.540
<v Speaker 4>They work hand in hand most of the time and they bought,</v>

8995
04:13:42.541 --> 04:13:44.730
<v Speaker 4>they like to make statements cause there's show when you look into it,</v>

8996
04:13:44.731 --> 04:13:46.290
<v Speaker 4>he said people that are dying around Hillary,</v>

8997
04:13:46.620 --> 04:13:46.981
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

8998
04:13:46.981 --> 04:13:48.480
<v Speaker 4>there's people that are dying around,</v>

8999
04:13:48.680 --> 04:13:48.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

9000
04:13:48.960 --> 04:13:52.530
<v Speaker 4>Bill and Hillary from back in the day they get suicided.</v>

9001
04:13:52.620 --> 04:13:55.290
<v Speaker 4>If you got suicided of some guy who was about to do,</v>

9002
04:13:55.530 --> 04:13:57.450
<v Speaker 4>he was about to testify and then he gets suicide.</v>

9003
04:13:57.451 --> 04:13:58.740
<v Speaker 4>But it's obvious it's not suicide.</v>

9004
04:13:58.741 --> 04:13:59.574
<v Speaker 4>It's like he got,</v>

9005
04:13:59.670 --> 04:14:01.110
<v Speaker 4>he got shot in the back of his head.</v>

9006
04:14:01.370 --> 04:14:01.870
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

9007
04:14:01.870 --> 04:14:02.970
<v Speaker 4>it's a message.</v>

9008
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.541
<v Speaker 4>It's a mess.</v>

9009
04:14:03.541 --> 04:14:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Just like the Mafia.</v>

9010
04:14:04.740 --> 04:14:06.870
<v Speaker 4>They are not going to just kill someone and make someone disappear.</v>

9011
04:14:06.871 --> 04:14:07.860
<v Speaker 4>That's a waste.</v>

9012
04:14:08.040 --> 04:14:09.240
<v Speaker 4>Why make them disappear?</v>

9013
04:14:09.390 --> 04:14:10.410
<v Speaker 4>Put them out or open,</v>

9014
04:14:10.411 --> 04:14:11.250
<v Speaker 4>cut out his tongue,</v>

9015
04:14:11.340 --> 04:14:11.731
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

9016
04:14:11.731 --> 04:14:13.950
<v Speaker 4>his dick down his throat make,</v>

9017
04:14:13.960 --> 04:14:17.520
<v Speaker 4>give a message so that messages shut the fuck up.</v>

9018
04:14:17.550 --> 04:14:18.060
<v Speaker 4>We got to,</v>

9019
04:14:18.060 --> 04:14:20.350
<v Speaker 4>we obviously got the corner in our pocket,</v>

9020
04:14:20.351 --> 04:14:21.210
<v Speaker 4>so shut the fuck up.</v>

9021
04:14:21.420 --> 04:14:22.253
<v Speaker 4>They're all,</v>

9022
04:14:22.280 --> 04:14:22.710
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

9023
04:14:22.710 --> 04:14:24.030
<v Speaker 4>those kinds of murders are everywhere.</v>

9024
04:14:24.031 --> 04:14:24.540
<v Speaker 4>They're sewers.</v>

9025
04:14:24.540 --> 04:14:26.160
<v Speaker 4>They generally suicides.</v>

9026
04:14:26.700 --> 04:14:28.650
<v Speaker 3>That guy that got convicted a supreme,</v>

9027
04:14:28.830 --> 04:14:29.470

04:14:35.860 --> 04:14:37.900
<v Speaker 3>She was defending Dennis Hastert.</v>

9031
04:14:38.800 --> 04:14:39.161
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

9032
04:14:39.161 --> 04:14:39.940

04:14:43.450 --> 04:14:43.740
<v Speaker 10>okay.</v>

9036
04:14:43.740 --> 04:14:43.891
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

04:14:43.891 --> 04:14:45.540
<v Speaker 3>he's with some serious judge.</v>

9038
04:14:46.110 --> 04:14:48.480
<v Speaker 3>The got convicted of child molestation,</v>

9039
04:14:48.481 --> 04:14:49.530
<v Speaker 3>pedophilia,</v>

9040
04:14:49.560 --> 04:14:50.700
<v Speaker 3>child pornography.</v>

9041
04:14:51.440 --> 04:14:52.470
<v Speaker 3>He's a house speaker.</v>

9042
04:14:54.330 --> 04:14:55.800
<v Speaker 3>This is a crazy story.</v>

9043
04:14:56.100 --> 04:14:59.700
<v Speaker 3>I just tweeted a study about it that uh,</v>

9044
04:15:00.090 --> 04:15:02.150
<v Speaker 3>they were doing an investigation of it.</v>

9045
04:15:03.660 --> 04:15:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Really scary stuff.</v>

9046
04:15:06.500 --> 04:15:07.333
<v Speaker 10>First paragraph.</v>

9047
04:15:08.390 --> 04:15:08.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

9048
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Enormous amount of</v>

9049
04:15:10.100 --> 04:15:11.790
<v Speaker 8>tragedy surrounding revelations.</v>

9050
04:15:11.791 --> 04:15:13.040
<v Speaker 8>That former house speaker,</v>

9051
04:15:13.700 --> 04:15:18.700
<v Speaker 8>jade Dennis Hassard sexually abused a number of young men whom he coached during</v>

9052
04:15:19.071 --> 04:15:21.320
<v Speaker 8>his time as a high school teacher and wrestling instructor.</v>

9053
04:15:21.321 --> 04:15:25.270
<v Speaker 8>But there's also an enormous amount of hypocrisy as the public words of a Po.</v>

9054
04:15:25.320 --> 04:15:25.641
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

9055
04:15:25.641 --> 04:15:25.941
<v Speaker 8>This is,</v>

9056
04:15:25.941 --> 04:15:26.061
<v Speaker 8>so,</v>

9057
04:15:26.061 --> 04:15:30.140
<v Speaker 8>this is him talking shit about Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,</v>

9058
04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:31.161
<v Speaker 8>but he,</v>

9059
04:15:31.161 --> 04:15:35.090
<v Speaker 8>the thing is that he only went to jail for 15 months.</v>

9060
04:15:35.810 --> 04:15:36.441
<v Speaker 8>Like he,</v>

9061
04:15:36.441 --> 04:15:36.950
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

9062
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:38.150
<v Speaker 8>he got an ax,</v>

9063
04:15:38.450 --> 04:15:41.390
<v Speaker 8>extraordinarily low sentence,</v>

9064
04:15:42.290 --> 04:15:43.340
<v Speaker 8>short sentence.</v>

9065
04:15:43.820 --> 04:15:44.720
<v Speaker 8>They give back.</v>

9066
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:46.580
<v Speaker 8>We've just tried to find what the sentences,</v>

9067
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:47.930
<v Speaker 8>because there was a,</v>

9068
04:15:48.380 --> 04:15:51.680
<v Speaker 8>there's a bunch of criticism about it and there's a bunch of 'em really</v>

9069
04:15:51.681 --> 04:15:53.120
<v Speaker 8>revealing aspects to it.</v>

9070
04:15:53.330 --> 04:15:54.163
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

9071
04:15:55.580 --> 04:15:56.413
<v Speaker 8>It's scary.</v>

9072
04:15:57.380 --> 04:16:00.710
<v Speaker 8>It's scary to think that someone could do that and only get 15 months because of</v>

9073
04:16:00.711 --> 04:16:01.850
<v Speaker 8>political connections.</v>

9074
04:16:02.960 --> 04:16:03.700
<v Speaker 8>But it makes sense.</v>

9075
04:16:03.700 --> 04:16:04.533
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

9076
04:16:05.280 --> 04:16:05.730
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

9077
04:16:05.730 --> 04:16:07.210
<v Speaker 8>when I was looking up something,</v>

9078
04:16:08.040 --> 04:16:08.873
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

9079
04:16:09.500 --> 04:16:10.790
<v Speaker 8>I forget the exact name right now,</v>

9080
04:16:10.791 --> 04:16:12.500
<v Speaker 8>when I was looking through these a couple of weeks ago,</v>

9081
04:16:12.501 --> 04:16:15.680
<v Speaker 8>that the deaths and some of the people that were killed and some of the weird</v>

9082
04:16:15.681 --> 04:16:16.700
<v Speaker 8>things that were going on,</v>

9083
04:16:16.760 --> 04:16:17.593
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

9084
04:16:17.720 --> 04:16:18.980
<v Speaker 8>I'll try to find the guy's name,</v>

9085
04:16:18.981 --> 04:16:20.140
<v Speaker 8>but he was one of the,</v>

9086
04:16:20.141 --> 04:16:20.900
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

9087
04:16:20.900 --> 04:16:25.880
<v Speaker 8>pardons from Clinton before he got out of the office and he was indicted by</v>

9088
04:16:25.881 --> 04:16:30.440
<v Speaker 8>Giuliani for what was going to be the biggest us tax evasion.</v>

9089
04:16:31.110 --> 04:16:34.300
<v Speaker 8>And the history is something like 60 [inaudible] not showing 60,</v>

9090
04:16:34.310 --> 04:16:35.240
<v Speaker 8>$60 million.</v>

9091
04:16:35.241 --> 04:16:36.074
<v Speaker 8>He's a billionaire.</v>

9092
04:16:36.380 --> 04:16:40.010
<v Speaker 8>And he basically bought his way out of his conviction.</v>

9093
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.870
<v Speaker 8>He had,</v>

9094
04:16:40.870 --> 04:16:41.703
<v Speaker 8>he had been,</v>

9095
04:16:42.020 --> 04:16:44.180
<v Speaker 8>I think he even was turned up dead after that.</v>

9096
04:16:44.181 --> 04:16:45.110
<v Speaker 8>He wasn't dead at all.</v>

9097
04:16:45.111 --> 04:16:48.020
<v Speaker 8>This guy just bought his way out of getting going to jail.</v>

9098
04:16:48.940 --> 04:16:49.773
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

9099
04:16:51.100 --> 04:16:52.580
<v Speaker 8>you give money to this and that and then</v>

9100
04:16:53.430 --> 04:16:54.270
<v Speaker 3>you can do that.</v>

9101
04:16:55.020 --> 04:16:57.120
<v Speaker 3>No the right people and you got the right kind of cash.</v>

9102
04:16:57.610 --> 04:17:00.360
<v Speaker 3>You can't do it if you're Bob Wilson,</v>

9103
04:17:00.361 --> 04:17:01.320
<v Speaker 3>camera repairman,</v>

9104
04:17:01.890 --> 04:17:04.070
<v Speaker 3>you know you don't have the kind of cash to pay these fucking</v>

9105
04:17:04.130 --> 04:17:04.671
<v Speaker 8>people off.</v>

9106
04:17:04.671 --> 04:17:05.780
