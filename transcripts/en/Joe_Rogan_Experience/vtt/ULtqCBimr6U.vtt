<v Speaker 2>United States today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am from motown,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>born and raised,</v>

14
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 2>University of Michigan School of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Medicine,</v>

15
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 2>summa cum laude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>internal medicine training,</v>

16
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 2>cardiology training in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

17
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:42.021
<v Speaker 2>Very hard to be Vegan in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did it in the eighties because </v>

18
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing this 42 year Vegan 42 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and that's impressive.</v>

19
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Age Eighteen and then a Kansas City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Missouri and another tough town to eat </v>

20
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 2>plants and only the steakhouse kc </v>
<v Speaker 2>masterpiece.</v>

21
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Did a training and stenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was blasting open heart attacks from </v>

22
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 2>1990 on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back to Michigan.</v>

23
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 2>Very active cath lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart attack.</v>

24
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 2>You're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bring you back practice 24 hours a day</v>

25
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 2>with great partners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And about three to four years ago,</v>

26
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I used all these decades of plant based </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>

27
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I've been basically bringing my family </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with and teaching patients,</v>

28
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:19.401
<v Speaker 2>but it opened a completely preventive </v>
<v Speaker 2>cardiology practice and along the way </v>

29
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 2>with my wife and son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we now own three plant based restaurants</v>

30
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Detroit.</v>

31
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 2>One in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>

<v Speaker 2>teach,</v>

35
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:32.331
<v Speaker 2>and that can stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred 50 because there's a lot of </v>

36
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:32.331
<v Speaker 2>erectile dysfunction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stamp out.</v>

37

<v Speaker 2>That's my passion that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

38
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What better purpose in life?</v>

39
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we can,</v>

40
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:44.371
<v Speaker 1>we can get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heart disease is somewhere in that mix </v>

41
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

45
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.520
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of medical papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole lot of blogs.</v>

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Chris?</v>

47
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Kresser,</v>

48
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 2>demand</v>

49
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 3>or Grad at uc Berkeley and then got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>master's of science and I'm co director </v>

50
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 3>of the California Center for Functional </v>
<v Speaker 3>Medicine,</v>

51
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:17.031
<v Speaker 3>which is a functional medicine clinic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in here in California up in </v>

52
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

53
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came to this from my own experience </v>

54
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 3>with chronic illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I as,</v>

55
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe got really sick,</v>

56
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in my early twenties when I was </v>

57
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 3>traveling around the world and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

58
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 3>conventional medicine didn't have much </v>
<v Speaker 3>to offer for me.</v>

59
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:38.211
<v Speaker 3>And so that led me on a path of trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure out the best approach from a </v>

60
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:42.591
<v Speaker 3>diet and behavior and lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective to heal from my own chronic </v>

61
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:47.001
<v Speaker 3>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that evolved into me starting </v>

62
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:47.170
<v Speaker 3>to write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

63
00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 3>it started a blog and a website and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

64
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote a couple of books and now have a,</v>

65
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 3>an organization that trains </v>
<v Speaker 3>practitioners in functional medicine and</v>

66
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 3>also trains health.</v>

67
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 3>And you add one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're Vegan.</v>

68
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 3>I was a macrobiotic Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was apprenticing with a macrobiotic,</v>

69
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 3>a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the difference?</v>

70
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.941
<v Speaker 3>Eating macrobiotic Vegan for folks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>irregular Vegan and macrobiotic is a </v>

71
00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:19.921
<v Speaker 3>particular philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a particular approach that came </v>

72
00:03:19.921 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 3>from Japan and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Vegan,</v>

73
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

74
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's heavily influenced by Japanese </v>

75
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.110
<v Speaker 3>tradition and cuisine and it has some </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of different beliefs than us.</v>

76
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 3>A typical vegan approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was uh,</v>

77
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 3>when I was originally studying Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine,</v>

78
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I was working in an apprenticing with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>macrobiotic Vegan chef and we were going</v>

79
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 3>around cooking for people who are really</v>
<v Speaker 3>ill,</v>

80
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 3>often people with cancer who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>following a macrobiotic diet.</v>

81
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 3>And before that I had been a vegetarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>for quite a while as well.</v>

82
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:55.861
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was traveling around the world </v>

83
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:55.861
<v Speaker 3>and got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually I was,</v>

84
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:55.861
<v Speaker 3>I was vegetarian at that point too.</v>

85
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 3>And you discovered through your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal.</v>

86
00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 3>We do it over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy.</v>

87
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.270
<v Speaker 3>You discovered over there through your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own personal practice that you,</v>

88
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.990
<v Speaker 3>your body worked better and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>illnesses went away when you changed </v>

89
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 3>your diet away from macrobiotic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

90
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 3>For me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm vegetarian diet and particularly </v>

91
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Vegan diet was a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just one person.</v>

92
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:29.221
<v Speaker 3>I don't put a lot of stock into a single</v>
<v Speaker 3>person's experience one way or the </v>

93
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:33.061
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly that did lead me down the </v>

94
00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:35.791
<v Speaker 3>path of questioning some of my earlier </v>
<v Speaker 3>beliefs that I had about vegetarianism </v>

95
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:39.751
<v Speaker 3>and veganism and it led me to make some </v>
<v Speaker 3>different choices and that is important </v>

96
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 3>to discuss here that everybody's body </v>
<v Speaker 3>really is different,</v>

97
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.730
<v Speaker 3>different people's bodies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyles.</v>

98
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have different </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirements.</v>

99
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

100
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

101
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 3>just to start off this whole discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're trying to answer the question,</v>

102
00:04:55.511 --> 00:05:00.511
<v Speaker 3>what's the optimal diet for everyone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a terrible question and </v>

103
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:02.220
<v Speaker 3>it's an unanswerable question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

104
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 3>where we share a lot in common as human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings,</v>

105
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 3>but we have a lot of important </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences to.</v>

106
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 3>And from the beginning I've always </v>
<v Speaker 3>argued that there's no one size fits all</v>

107
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 3>approach when it comes to diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

108
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 3>but I think there are some common themes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we can.</v>

109
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure we'll get to those later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

110
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I think that's really important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

111
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:23.761
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really important to discuss that </v>

112
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:23.761
<v Speaker 3>people really do have different </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirements.</v>

113
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

114
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.850
<v Speaker 4>we'll get into the mud a little bit as </v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to,</v>

115
00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:28.100
<v Speaker 4>but we also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris and I share a lot in common.</v>

116
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:28.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

117
00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:33.551
<v Speaker 4>if we ate together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would probably be 90 percent the </v>

118
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:34.280
<v Speaker 4>same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We both are really respectful of what we</v>

119
00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 4>call functional medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>root cause medicine.</v>

120
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't write scripts without thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the patient.</v>

121
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 4>He certainly doesn't do that without </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about the entire patient is </v>

122
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.231
<v Speaker 4>pretty unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we are going to represent a very </v>

123
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:47.231
<v Speaker 4>small section.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

124
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:47.231
<v Speaker 4>I honor what he's doing with his new </v>
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>

125
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:47.970
<v Speaker 4>unconventional medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rest.</v>

126
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is what is happening throughout </v>

127
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.100
<v Speaker 4>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

128
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.790
<v Speaker 4>and it's necessary because it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just running out of dollars in and</v>

129
00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 4>health when we're just pushing and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>even</v>

130
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 2>asking the person what they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they sleep,</v>

131
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing,</v>

132
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're real people.</v>

133
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that.</v>

134
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.550
<v Speaker 2>We don't agree on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still rare jewel.</v>

135
00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.330
<v Speaker 2>this is pretty rare segment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that two percent of the </v>

137
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.881
<v Speaker 2>people in America will have a patient </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaves the office and actually ask what </v>

138
00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:15.881
<v Speaker 2>they</v>

139
00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:15.881
<v Speaker 5>today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

140
00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:15.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

141
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me say one more thing about this </v>

142
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.311
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I think you hit on a really </v>

143
00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:23.311
<v Speaker 5>important point and I'm glad you did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did it right off the bat.</v>

144
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.620
<v Speaker 5>The biggest problem with nutritional </v>
<v Speaker 5>research epidemiology is that it starts </v>

145
00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:31.780
<v Speaker 5>with the assumption that there is one </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet for everybody.</v>

146
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.530
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something that's rarely </v>

147
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.530
<v Speaker 5>discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

148
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.530
<v Speaker 5>it's this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

149
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.170
<v Speaker 5>should everyone be on a low carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should everyone be on a high carb,</v>

150
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>low fat or a low fat diet,</v>

151
00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:45.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should everyone do this?</v>

152
00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:47.680
<v Speaker 5>Should everyone do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the whole,</v>

153
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.880
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

154
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:53.881
<v Speaker 5>there's a guy in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>professor who calls calls this approach </v>

155
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:59.761
<v Speaker 5>nutritionism this idea that we can </v>
<v Speaker 5>reduce foods down into these individual </v>

156
00:06:59.761 --> 00:07:03.340
<v Speaker 5>components just like macronutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 5>protein,</v>

157
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:04.630
<v Speaker 5>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>carbohydrates,</v>

158
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.050
<v Speaker 5>and we can figure out what works best </v>
<v Speaker 5>for everyone just by looking at these </v>

159
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 5>isolated components without considering </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

160
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.140
<v Speaker 5>the whole context of the Diet.</v>

161
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.460
<v Speaker 5>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

162
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.490
<v Speaker 5>Joel would agree that if you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 5>a diet that's 50 percent calories and </v>

163
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.091
<v Speaker 5>fat and one diet is they're getting all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of those fat calories from pizza and </v>

164
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:26.800
<v Speaker 5>chips and candy bars and things like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

165
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:32.070
<v Speaker 5>and then another diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're getting 50 percent of fat from </v>

166
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.770
<v Speaker 5>Avocados and olive oil and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even,</v>

167
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eggs and animal foods,</v>

168
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.040
<v Speaker 5>those are two totally different diets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And yet in the scientific literature,</v>

169
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:41.410
<v Speaker 5>those are equated as the same because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

170
00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:43.510
<v Speaker 5>all they're looking at is the calories </v>
<v Speaker 5>from fat.</v>

171
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:45.880
<v Speaker 5>They're not considering the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Diet</v>

172
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.730
<v Speaker 2>and others add in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

173
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 2>we'd go anywhere with this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of the problem has been </v>

174
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.030
<v Speaker 2>imprecision of language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even the word low carb diet,</v>

175
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I had a low carb diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we talk low refined carbs,</v>

176
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat white flour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat sugar.</v>

177
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.810
<v Speaker 2>A very careful about all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>components.</v>

178
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.350
<v Speaker 2>I eat a very high complex carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

179
00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:09.351
<v Speaker 2>So we'll vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A giant study that's been released this </v>

180
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:11.020
<v Speaker 2>years appear study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks about carbs in the Diet.</v>

181
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 2>They didn't differentiate complex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>refined very hard to know what to do </v>

182
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.650
<v Speaker 2>with data that doesn't spread that </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

183
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.840
<v Speaker 2>And in your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean low fat,</v>

184
00:08:18.841 --> 00:08:20.520
<v Speaker 2>high fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we need to talk about,</v>

185
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.000
<v Speaker 2>is it soybean oil that's processed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rancid?</v>

186
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Are we talking about Avocados and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:30.240
<v Speaker 2>healthy whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the precision of language,</v>

188
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.620
<v Speaker 2>even protein protein.</v>

189
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.430
<v Speaker 2>The big divide is animal versus plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anytime that word comes up we need to</v>

190
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:40.431
<v Speaker 2>differentiate what w know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be precise and then will help more </v>

191
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:40.470
<v Speaker 2>people if we're precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

192
00:08:40.471 --> 00:08:42.780
<v Speaker 2>And if you can just to eliminate this </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people.</v>

193
00:08:42.781 --> 00:08:46.200
<v Speaker 2>What is the problem with epidemiology </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies?</v>

194
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.830
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go there real quick.</v>

196
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a problem,</v>

197
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.450
<v Speaker 2>but there are a part of the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not the whole solution.</v>

198
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 2>A lot scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give a shout out to Los Angeles,</v>

199
00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 2>brightest nutrition mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody that I know,</v>

200
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Chris Honors to Valter Longo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no label and that Vegan that Pailin that</v>

201
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's at USC,</v>

202
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 2>been honored by the Royal Academy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Swedish medicine,</v>

203
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:10.140
<v Speaker 2>which is a Nobel prize committee in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

204
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

205
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:16.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do basic science and then you do an </v>

206
00:09:16.611 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 2>epidemiology study to test the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>

207
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 2>You've seen something in a petri dish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see something in a mouse,</v>

208
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 2>you see something in a cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you asked the question,</v>

209
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 2>is animal protein prolongevity pro early</v>
<v Speaker 2>aging,</v>

210
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.190
<v Speaker 2>explaining epidemiologists study people.</v>

211
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.250
<v Speaker 2>So you would take that concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just run with that,</v>

212
00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

213
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at a,</v>

214
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:38.601
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an amino acid found in animal protein </v>

215
00:09:38.601 --> 00:09:41.330
<v Speaker 2>thrown out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matthias and Lucy in a petri dish looks </v>

216
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 2>like it might cause accelerated aging in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a single cell.</v>

217
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 2>That's about chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is something you honor,</v>

218
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's a long jump from there to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

219
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Then you look at a database.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's a crappy old database.</v>

220
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's Harvard has these </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic ongoing database.</v>

221
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 2>A Loma Linda an hour from here has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic database and there's others </v>

222
00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 2>that epic study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this pure study I mentioned,</v>

223
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 2>you can test a hypothesis of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens if our data may be crappy,</v>

224
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's still data and it allows you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go further with 100,000</v>

225
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,000</v>

226
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500,000</v>

227
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:10.100
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we,</v>

228
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.670
<v Speaker 2>do we have the data?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask the question,</v>

229
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.720
<v Speaker 2>does protein correlate with survival </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein correlate with early death,</v>

230
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 2>animal protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plant protein?</v>

231
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.190
<v Speaker 2>These studies had been coming out a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>lately and they let you parse it out.</v>

232
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Now it's what Chris talks about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know everything about the person </v>

233
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:30.021
<v Speaker 2>in the database?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know smoke or do you know </v>

234
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:30.021
<v Speaker 2>diabetes or they go to the gym to lift </v>
<v Speaker 2>weights.</v>

235
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Speaker 2>They smoke dope and smoke crack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you don't know everything.</v>

236
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of these things are going to ask,</v>

237
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 2>are your blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol,</v>

238
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.790
<v Speaker 2>all the basics to try and take those </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors away and isolate the question </v>

239
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:45.771
<v Speaker 2>you're asking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be imperfect and then you go to </v>

240
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:45.771
<v Speaker 2>the best study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it won't.</v>

241
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 2>It won't happen often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The randomized clinical trial,</v>

242
00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's never been a randomized clinical</v>

243
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:50.810
<v Speaker 2>trial smoking [inaudible] that'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>unethical.</v>

244
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.820
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was epidemiology that proved and </v>

245
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 2>association strong enough to recommend </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the public don't smoke.</v>

246
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 2>They'll never be a randomized trial and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything,</v>

247
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 2>parachutes don't need a randomized </v>
<v Speaker 2>trial,</v>

248
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

249
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:10.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking folic acid and a pregnant woman </v>

250
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 2>to not have spinal Bifida doesn't need a</v>
<v Speaker 2>randomized trial.</v>

251
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:12.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some things that are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressing.</v>

252
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>The public health can't allow that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's even more than that.</v>

253
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:17.860
<v Speaker 2>The last little section is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

254
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 2>you can study old people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris enjoys studying ancient societies.</v>

255
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy studying the elderly in current,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

256
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:30.921
<v Speaker 2>modern environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is called the blue zones and </v>

257
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:30.921
<v Speaker 2>there's others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

258
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:31.890
<v Speaker 2>what old people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old healthy people.</v>

259
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would like to be,</v>

260
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:37.791
<v Speaker 2>would you like to be 90 and have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains and have your joints and </v>

261
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 2>everything working well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have that database so that little for</v>

262
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 2>a pod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pedestal,</v>

263
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:47.271
<v Speaker 2>the sit on basic epidemiology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>randomized studies and centenarian </v>

264
00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 2>studies allows you to make reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions will be wrong.</v>

265
00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Some things we're not going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>

266
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's huge problems with </v>

267
00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:56.390
<v Speaker 2>epidemiology.</v>

268
00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 5>So obser,</v>
<v Speaker 5>epidemiology,</v>

269
00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:01.801
<v Speaker 5>observational studies are studies that </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at a certain group of people and </v>

270
00:12:01.801 --> 00:12:06.511
<v Speaker 5>then try to draw inferences from their </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior about associations with </v>

271
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 5>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's say we take a group and we look</v>

272
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:11.530
<v Speaker 5>and see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

273
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 5>how much saturated fat are they eating?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we separate them into,</v>

274
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>low consumption,</v>

275
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 5>medium consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 5>high consumption,</v>

276
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 5>and in a prospective study where we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching them over time,</v>

277
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:26.610
<v Speaker 5>we might then look 20 years later and </v>
<v Speaker 5>see how many people had heart attacks </v>

278
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:26.920
<v Speaker 5>and died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

279
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 5>And then we try to correlate that with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their amount of saturated fat intake.</v>

280
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 5>Now I actually just published two </v>
<v Speaker 5>articles with.</v>

281
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm going in detail on the problems with</v>
<v Speaker 5>observational nutritional research and </v>

282
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can find them at [inaudible] dot com</v>

283
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.540
<v Speaker 5>slash Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a whole bunch of information </v>

284
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:48.820
<v Speaker 5>that we're going to be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>today there so people can go and get the</v>

285
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:49.930
<v Speaker 5>details themselves.</v>

286
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.860
<v Speaker 5>But I'll just give you three of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the most,</v>

287
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 5>the worst problems with nutritional </v>
<v Speaker 5>epidemiology.</v>

288
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.680
<v Speaker 5>The first is data collection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a saying in science,</v>

289
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.710
<v Speaker 5>which is that data are only as good as </v>
<v Speaker 5>the as the tool used to collect them.</v>

290
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.950
<v Speaker 5>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in nutritional observational </v>

291
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.111
<v Speaker 5>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tool used to collect data is a </v>

292
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:13.111
<v Speaker 5>questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

293
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.630
<v Speaker 5>And so that relies completely on memory </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we know that memory is not a </v>

294
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:24.091
<v Speaker 5>precise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>accurate or literal representation of </v>

295
00:13:24.091 --> 00:13:26.851
<v Speaker 5>events.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's more like a highly edited anecdote </v>

296
00:13:26.851 --> 00:13:28.750
<v Speaker 5>of what happened in the past and back a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit like the cavenaugh thing.</v>

297
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:33.751
<v Speaker 5>Go now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>back in the bag in the 13th century you </v>

298
00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:34.030
<v Speaker 5>had Francis Bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

299
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.720
<v Speaker 5>for something to be scientific it has to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be independently observable,</v>

300
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.980
<v Speaker 5>measurable and falsifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then accurate and valid,</v>

301
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.100
<v Speaker 5>valid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so let's use an analogy.</v>

302
00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:48.760
<v Speaker 5>If you're sitting there eating an apple </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm watching you do that,</v>

303
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.830
<v Speaker 5>I can observe that you're eating the </v>
<v Speaker 5>apple.</v>

304
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.860
<v Speaker 5>I can measure how much of the apple you </v>
<v Speaker 5>eat and I can confirm or refute that </v>

305
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.001
<v Speaker 5>you're eating the apple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you tell me that you were eating an </v>

306
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:02.740
<v Speaker 5>apple 15 years ago or 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I obviously can observe that.</v>

307
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:06.970
<v Speaker 5>I obviously can't measure it and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously can't confirm or refute it and</v>

308
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:11.971
<v Speaker 5>yet our entire foundation of nutritional</v>
<v Speaker 5>epidemiology is based on that.</v>

309
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:17.320
<v Speaker 5>Basically people reporting on what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>ate at some time in the past,</v>

310
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 5>so you know how much of a problem is </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

311
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:25.170
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a guy named Edward Archer who's </v>

312
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.770
<v Speaker 5>done some really interesting studies and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he looked at the end Haynes data,</v>

313
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:31.771
<v Speaker 5>the nurses' health data,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the longest running </v>

314
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:32.500
<v Speaker 5>nutrition studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>39 years,</v>

315
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:38.010
<v Speaker 5>and he found that the self reported </v>
<v Speaker 5>calorie intake in those studies was </v>

316
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.310
<v Speaker 5>either physiologically implausible or </v>
<v Speaker 5>incompatible with life,</v>

317
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.260
<v Speaker 5>so the average person in those studies </v>
<v Speaker 5>reported a calorie intake that would not</v>

318
00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:51.160
<v Speaker 5>support an elderly bedridden frail </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman,</v>

319
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:53.960
<v Speaker 5>so they just.</v>

320
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:59.250
<v Speaker 5>It's just inaccurate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's completely inaccurate and the </v>

321
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.740
<v Speaker 5>people who are most likely to under </v>
<v Speaker 5>report or people who are overweight and </v>

322
00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.660
<v Speaker 5>obese,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if you if calories or that much under</v>

323
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 5>reported,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all nutrition comes through calories.</v>

324
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 5>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We get fat,</v>

325
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 5>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>carbohydrates,</v>

326
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.950
<v Speaker 5>micronutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all come through calories,</v>

327
00:15:12.951 --> 00:15:17.951
<v Speaker 5>so calories or that underreported,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that completely invalidates the Dataset.</v>

328
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.260
<v Speaker 5>This is an obesity study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the there are under reported because </v>

329
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 5>of Shannon on an obesity study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just every Americans are overweight</v>

330
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 5>and obese.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The majority of Americans are overweight</v>

331
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:32.711
<v Speaker 5>and obese,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so in any data set of Americans are </v>

332
00:15:32.711 --> 00:15:33.830
<v Speaker 5>going to have the majority of them </v>
<v Speaker 5>overweight or obese or are obese.</v>

333
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:38.831
<v Speaker 5>So that's the first problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The second problem is the healthy user </v>

334
00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:39.260
<v Speaker 5>bias,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I know we talked about before,</v>

335
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.650
<v Speaker 5>but it's basically the idea that because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know when someone engages in an </v>

336
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 5>unhealthy and a behavior that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>perceived as unhealthy,</v>

337
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:53.170
<v Speaker 5>they are more likely to engage in other </v>
<v Speaker 5>behaviors that are perceived as </v>

338
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:53.180
<v Speaker 5>unhealthy and vice versa.</v>

339
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 5>So let's say you do a study of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who ate eat more red meat.</v>

340
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 5>Red Meat has been perceived as unhealthy</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a long time,</v>

341
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 5>and so what we know is that in those </v>
<v Speaker 5>observational studies,</v>

342
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:07.610
<v Speaker 5>that people who eat more red meat are </v>
<v Speaker 5>also smoking more.</v>

343
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:10.070
<v Speaker 5>They have higher body mass index.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're eating less,</v>

344
00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:13.760
<v Speaker 5>fewer fruits and vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a lower level of education.</v>

345
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.790
<v Speaker 5>They're less physically active.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how do you know that it's the red </v>

346
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.001
<v Speaker 5>meat that's causing the problem and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>those other things you don't because </v>

347
00:16:22.001 --> 00:16:24.650
<v Speaker 5>they cannot control for all of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>potential confounding factors.</v>

348
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.440
<v Speaker 5>The third problem with observational </v>
<v Speaker 5>research,</v>

349
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.710
<v Speaker 5>and maybe the biggest is that the the </v>
<v Speaker 5>relative risks in nutrition are so low </v>

350
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.760
<v Speaker 5>that they're indistinguishable from </v>
<v Speaker 5>chance.</v>

351
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.910
<v Speaker 5>So in fields outside of nutrition and </v>
<v Speaker 5>epidemiology,</v>

352
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:46.660
<v Speaker 5>nobody would consider a relative risk an</v>
<v Speaker 5>increase in risk less than 100 percent.</v>

353
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.780
<v Speaker 5>A doubling to be really worth paying </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention to.</v>

354
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.140
<v Speaker 5>So to put this in perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the observational studies that Joel was </v>

355
00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.161
<v Speaker 5>referring to that confirmed that is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarette smoking led to lung cancer </v>

356
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:06.010
<v Speaker 5>that showed in between a 1000 and 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent increase in lung cancer in </v>

357
00:17:08.391 --> 00:17:09.980
<v Speaker 5>smokers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

358
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.300
<v Speaker 5>And the studies that have shown that </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating aflatoxin,</v>

359
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 5>which is a mycotoxin increased liver </v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer risk,</v>

360
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.180
<v Speaker 5>that's 600 percent increase.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

361
00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:22.820
<v Speaker 5>The AIA,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the I a arc,</v>

362
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:25.400
<v Speaker 5>the WHO report that suggested that </v>
<v Speaker 5>process,</v>

363
00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:29.270
<v Speaker 5>red meat was a carcinogen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was 18 percent increase.</v>

364
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.840
<v Speaker 5>Most epidemiologists you've talked to </v>
<v Speaker 5>will say that is so low that it's really</v>

365
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.430
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Indistinguishable from chance,</v>

366
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:42.431
<v Speaker 5>especially given the healthy user bias </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the problems with the data </v>

367
00:17:42.431 --> 00:17:44.300
<v Speaker 5>collection that I mentioned before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the studies that are cited,</v>

368
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 5>so when people are talking about red </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat causes cancer,</v>

369
00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:52.241
<v Speaker 5>they're literally talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that showed an 18 percent </v>

370
00:17:52.241 --> 00:17:52.241
<v Speaker 5>increase.</v>

371
00:17:52.241 --> 00:17:56.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is over a depot that are also </v>

372
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 5>consuming sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That translates into four and a half.</v>

373
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.380
<v Speaker 5>There were four and a half cases of </v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer out of 100 and people with no </v>

374
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.700
<v Speaker 5>lowest intake of processed meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that went up to five point three </v>

375
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.770
<v Speaker 5>cases out of 100 and people with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>highest intake of processed meat.</v>

376
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

377
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.530
<v Speaker 5>there are quotes like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look even 20 years ago,</v>

378
00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 5>like there's an article in science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

379
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.560
<v Speaker 5>the journal Science and Marsha Anjell </v>
<v Speaker 5>who was the former editor of New England</v>

380
00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:30.810
<v Speaker 5>Journal of Medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was quoted as saying we wouldn't even </v>

381
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.991
<v Speaker 5>accept a paper for publication if it </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't have at least a 200 percent </v>

382
00:18:32.991 --> 00:18:37.610
<v Speaker 5>increase,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if it was a new association </v>

383
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.610
<v Speaker 5>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

384
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.230
<v Speaker 5>the biological mechanism wasn't known.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And here we are today saying that you </v>

385
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.960
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this increase that by seven percent or </v>

386
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.671
<v Speaker 5>by 10 percent and when you consider that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the data is usually questionnaires of </v>

387
00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:54.321
<v Speaker 5>what people ate and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>confounding factors like exercise and </v>

388
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.020
<v Speaker 5>and fruit and vegetable consumption and </v>
<v Speaker 5>things like that are not accounted for.</v>

389
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.440
<v Speaker 5>Then we're really just playing games </v>
<v Speaker 5>with numbers as part of the problem as </v>

390
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.521
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's this clickbait culture now </v>

391
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:10.401
<v Speaker 5>in terms of journalism where they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to publish something that says </v>

392
00:19:10.401 --> 00:19:13.350
<v Speaker 5>eight study shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>18 percent of people eat red meat,</v>

393
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 5>get cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a huge problem.</v>

394
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:20.541
<v Speaker 5>And there is a study that was done that </v>
<v Speaker 5>showed that 43 percent of findings came </v>

395
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:26.850
<v Speaker 5>from observational studies were </v>
<v Speaker 5>portrayed in the media as being causal,</v>

396
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.610
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which any epidemiologists would tell you</v>

397
00:19:29.611 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 5>that that's a full pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that,</v>

398
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.270
<v Speaker 5>but nobody is going to click on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>headline that says,</v>

399
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:41.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>small association between these two </v>

400
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:42.870
<v Speaker 5>variables scene,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know what it means,</v>

401
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.960
<v Speaker 5>but please read the stories.</v>

402
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just grab a couple and again,</v>

403
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.870
<v Speaker 4>a lot of respect and agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if we throw a bid deem ecology away,</v>

404
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:56.871
<v Speaker 4>we thrown away about 80 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrition knowledge because that is the </v>

405
00:19:56.871 --> 00:19:58.890
<v Speaker 4>most common kind of study and that still</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaves us with basic science,</v>

406
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:03.891
<v Speaker 4>which is rockin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It leaves us with a randomized clinical </v>

407
00:20:03.891 --> 00:20:07.941
<v Speaker 4>trials which are very hard nutrition and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very expensive and there's less </v>

408
00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:10.881
<v Speaker 4>than we need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if finally leaves us with the </v>

409
00:20:10.881 --> 00:20:10.920
<v Speaker 4>studying old healthy people centenarian </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies,</v>

410
00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:15.921
<v Speaker 4>but does go to Loma Linda 10 times more </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in Loma Linda are over 100 than </v>

411
00:20:15.921 --> 00:20:17.790
<v Speaker 4>there are in Los Angeles 10 times more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's by definition.</v>

412
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:18.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called the blue zone.</v>

413
00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:23.751
<v Speaker 4>And we'll talk about blue zone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was discovered in the 19 </v>

414
00:20:23.751 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 4>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you lived in Loma Linda,</v>

415
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:26.640
<v Speaker 4>you were living 12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of those an hour east of here.</v>

416
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 4>It's what's going on with the center of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the seventh day adventist church,</v>

417
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:32.790
<v Speaker 4>which teaches people eat your veggies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't drink,</v>

418
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:36.480
<v Speaker 4>don't smoke and exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's an amazing lifestyle oriented,</v>

419
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aspect of the Christian church.</v>

420
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:42.240
<v Speaker 4>And they in 1958 got huge funding from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the government to explore.</v>

421
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Why the heck are they live in 12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight years,</v>

422
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:46.650
<v Speaker 4>10 years longer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they've parsed that out and probably</v>

423
00:20:46.651 --> 00:20:50.020
<v Speaker 4>a thousand publications there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a randomized study,</v>

424
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was an la versus Loma Linda will feed</v>

425
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:54.670
<v Speaker 4>you different diets and fought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Won't ever happen,</v>

426
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.540
<v Speaker 4>but it is a reliable longterm peer </v>
<v Speaker 4>review.</v>

427
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:03.541
<v Speaker 4>This stuff's published,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the finest of journals and it at least </v>

428
00:21:03.541 --> 00:21:06.541
<v Speaker 4>lets you ask questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean why is there a 104 year old </v>

429
00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:09.841
<v Speaker 4>cardiac surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Elliot wore sham walking around doing </v>

430
00:21:09.841 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 4>his gardening and he just finished </v>
<v Speaker 4>operating on a heart patients.</v>

431
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's insane for a award.</v>

432
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 4>Show him love you buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let me go back for a minute.</v>

433
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.270
<v Speaker 4>If we throw epidemiology out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are left with basically.</v>

434
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

435
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:26.670
<v Speaker 4>but so food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is all technical stuff and but </v>

436
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.420
<v Speaker 4>you've got a sophisticated audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Food frequency questionnaires with Chris</v>

437
00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:33.421
<v Speaker 4>said is the source of a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>epidemiologists states you fill out a </v>

438
00:21:33.421 --> 00:21:36.811
<v Speaker 4>four page,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a 40 page at in Loma Linda to 58 page </v>

439
00:21:36.811 --> 00:21:38.110
<v Speaker 4>survey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you do it once.</v>

440
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.210
<v Speaker 4>That's called the pure study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The headlines.</v>

441
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:41.770
<v Speaker 4>You've seen them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheese,</v>

442
00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:42.520
<v Speaker 4>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meat,</v>

443
00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:47.521
<v Speaker 4>or good for your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been the news the last two weeks </v>

444
00:21:47.521 --> 00:21:47.521
<v Speaker 4>that comes from a giant international </v>
<v Speaker 4>study.</v>

445
00:21:47.521 --> 00:21:49.180
<v Speaker 4>They did one food frequency </v>
<v Speaker 4>questionnaire at the beginning.</v>

446
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.160
<v Speaker 4>Twelve years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reporting that data,</v>

447
00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:53.080
<v Speaker 4>it's all click bait headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you say,</v>

448
00:21:53.081 --> 00:21:56.740
<v Speaker 4>people love to see this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if we throw out some studies,</v>

449
00:21:56.741 --> 00:22:01.741
<v Speaker 4>we have to throw out the largest </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutritional study that's been reported </v>

450
00:22:01.741 --> 00:22:02.290
<v Speaker 4>and the most recent one that's getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the headlines.</v>

451
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.230
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be played fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you go to Loma Linda.</v>

452
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:10.231
<v Speaker 4>It's every four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're asking you go to Harvard school </v>

453
00:22:10.231 --> 00:22:10.231
<v Speaker 4>public health every four years they </v>
<v Speaker 4>update the data,</v>

454
00:22:10.231 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 4>so if you change your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the weakness.</v>

455
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:17.070
<v Speaker 4>You fill out the survey and then you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy or you get sick and you make </v>

456
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.480
<v Speaker 4>changes and then they're counting of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your debt or lie.</v>

457
00:22:17.481 --> 00:22:18.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be what you did.</v>

458
00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:20.500
<v Speaker 4>Your six now what you filled out year </v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

459
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:23.380
<v Speaker 4>so there are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are better and worse forms.</v>

460
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 4>The second I'd say healthy user bias is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that people pick a certain diet</v>

461
00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.970
<v Speaker 4>might have other lifestyles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be as or more important.</v>

462
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.560
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be true of the Paleo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Group.</v>

463
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys are gonna.</v>

464
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:35.710
<v Speaker 4>Look at Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looks wonderful.</v>

465
00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:38.010
<v Speaker 4>He Se thin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not the obese American,</v>

466
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 4>the 75 percent that are overweight and </v>
<v Speaker 4>obese.</v>

467
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:43.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's true in the plant </v>
<v Speaker 4>community to some extent.</v>

468
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:48.631
<v Speaker 4>We have Chubby vegans like there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>observational studies with significant </v>

469
00:22:48.631 --> 00:22:49.960
<v Speaker 4>number of Paleo dieters too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

470
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.290
<v Speaker 4>I know that a healthy user bias is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>an issue for Leo,</v>

471
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:58.530
<v Speaker 4>but if you don't have data doesn't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you don't have data because it's </v>

472
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.561
<v Speaker 4>a new movement that hasn't had the data,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not the cast stones that plant </v>

473
00:23:01.561 --> 00:23:03.310
<v Speaker 4>based Cedars go to the gym more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably true.</v>

474
00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.210
<v Speaker 4>We don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

475
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.380
<v Speaker 4>And that's a third thing to stop you for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a second.</v>

476
00:23:06.381 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

477
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Mediators do get lumped in with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paleo group.</v>

478
00:23:10.241 --> 00:23:13.150
<v Speaker 1>They consider Paleo group part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat eater group.</v>

479
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Like when people talk about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>epidemiologic.</v>

480
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Epidemiology studies where they show </v>

481
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.240
<v Speaker 1>that people that consume red meat more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to get sick on my leg to cancer.</v>

482
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 1>They're not referring to Paleo diet or </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider eating avocado and grass fed.</v>

483
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:27.550
<v Speaker 4>You gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember,</v>

484
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.030
<v Speaker 4>most of the Paleo movement is the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>dozen,</v>

485
00:23:30.031 --> 00:23:31.140
<v Speaker 4>15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

486
00:23:31.141 --> 00:23:35.340
<v Speaker 4>we can talk about that in 1985,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2000 to Loren cordain publishers book in</v>

487
00:23:35.341 --> 00:23:36.900
<v Speaker 4>2002.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The book didn't sell,</v>

488
00:23:36.901 --> 00:23:38.790
<v Speaker 4>republished 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took off.</v>

489
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.820
<v Speaker 4>This is a relatively new moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you filled out the study and Loma </v>

490
00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:44.790
<v Speaker 4>Linda in 1958,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to worry.</v>

491
00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 4>There weren't too many people following </v>
<v Speaker 4>a classic Paleo Diet.</v>

492
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.640
<v Speaker 4>This also true at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these initiatives,</v>

493
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.570
<v Speaker 4>the last is just a relative risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we call it.</v>

494
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 4>These are pure statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

495
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a statistician,</v>

496
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.340
<v Speaker 4>but there are some exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean anybody,</v>

497
00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:02.240
<v Speaker 4>and I'll just say I've got a red button </v>
<v Speaker 4>on my website that says Rogan references</v>

498
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:04.400
<v Speaker 4>because I thought it would be good to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have people a place to go,</v>

499
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:07.340
<v Speaker 4>just like Chris mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not massaging the data.</v>

500
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.770
<v Speaker 4>It's scientific peer reviewed data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

501
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.140
<v Speaker 4>there was a study in October,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2016,</v>

502
00:24:12.141 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 4>October one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2016 songs from Harvard,</v>

503
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.450
<v Speaker 4>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people observational data,</v>

504
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.460
<v Speaker 4>animal protein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plant protein.</v>

505
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:21.920
<v Speaker 4>They actually let me go to 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Morgan Levine,</v>

506
00:24:21.921 --> 00:24:24.380
<v Speaker 4>this is an amazing Harvard researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful woman,</v>

507
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.540
<v Speaker 4>Morgan Levine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She looked at 6,000</v>

508
00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:28.250
<v Speaker 4>people prospectively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>observation,</v>

509
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:33.251
<v Speaker 4>fill out all these data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were an animal protein eater </v>

510
00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:37.661
<v Speaker 4>that's called meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had a three to 400 percent increase </v>

511
00:24:37.661 --> 00:24:38.060
<v Speaker 4>in cancer risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three to 400 percent.</v>

512
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:40.400
<v Speaker 4>That's three to four times isn't one </v>
<v Speaker 4>point one,</v>

513
00:24:40.401 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 4>one point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

514
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:42.020
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>18 percent.</v>

515
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.820
<v Speaker 4>The data's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is peer reviewed data.</v>

516
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 4>If you ate plant based proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>risk of cancer goes down.</v>

517
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.060
<v Speaker 4>This is in the highest pause for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>

518
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.100
<v Speaker 4>I just want to say there are nutritional</v>
<v Speaker 4>data that are powerful,</v>

519
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.210
<v Speaker 4>but this is also an epidemiology study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where 18 in a,</v>

520
00:25:00.211 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 4>nobody's going to do a randomized study </v>
<v Speaker 4>of 6,000</v>

521
00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:03.590
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You eat beans,</v>

522
00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:03.930
<v Speaker 4>you eat</v>

523
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.450
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think I have a,</v>

524
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.890
<v Speaker 5>a good example that can clear some of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

525
00:25:07.891 --> 00:25:09.120
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

526
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.840
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you mentioned the Loma Linda and the </v>

527
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:14.840
<v Speaker 5>seventh day adventist studies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

528
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.630
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

529
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.130
<v Speaker 5>let me just make a comment about </v>
<v Speaker 5>observational nutritional research.</v>

530
00:25:20.131 --> 00:25:25.131
<v Speaker 5>It can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are good observational studies in </v>

531
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:25.131
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad ones you can design an observational</v>

532
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:30.051
<v Speaker 5>study in a way that controls for some of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these potentially confounding factors </v>

533
00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:30.960
<v Speaker 5>like the healthy user bias,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

534
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.840
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is a story that will,</v>

535
00:25:33.841 --> 00:25:37.890
<v Speaker 5>I think clear some of this up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there are about eight studies,</v>

536
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.570
<v Speaker 5>major studies that have compared </v>
<v Speaker 5>lifespan and in a vegetarians and vegans</v>

537
00:25:42.571 --> 00:25:46.920
<v Speaker 5>and omnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the earlier studies are three studies</v>

538
00:25:46.921 --> 00:25:51.921
<v Speaker 5>that were seventh day adventist studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they were done in the seventh day </v>

539
00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:53.160
<v Speaker 5>adventist community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which Joel mentioned.</v>

540
00:25:53.161 --> 00:25:56.010
<v Speaker 5>Is it religious group that has as part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of its credo,</v>

541
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a healthy lifestyle diet and lifestyle.</v>

542
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.550
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

543
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.770
<v Speaker 5>by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 million people,</v>

544
00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:07.790
<v Speaker 5>let's not talk over each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's just make sure we catch a </v>

545
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:07.890
<v Speaker 5>vegetarian vegetarian diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also,</v>

546
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eat a live healthy fruits and </v>

547
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.170
<v Speaker 5>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't smoke,</v>

548
00:26:13.171 --> 00:26:15.380
<v Speaker 5>don't drink excessively,</v>
<v Speaker 5>etc.</v>

549
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:19.700
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>health conscious group of people and the</v>

550
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.610
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

551
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.910
<v Speaker 5>the first one on the seventh day </v>
<v Speaker 5>adventist study in the Netherlands,</v>

552
00:26:23.911 --> 00:26:26.130
<v Speaker 5>compared them with the general </v>
<v Speaker 5>population,</v>

553
00:26:26.131 --> 00:26:31.131
<v Speaker 5>which is just garbage because of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy user bias so we can just cross </v>

554
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:34.881
<v Speaker 5>that one off the list.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The two Seventh day adventist studies </v>

555
00:26:34.881 --> 00:26:38.181
<v Speaker 5>that were done in loma linda and the us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did a better job because they </v>

556
00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:42.140
<v Speaker 5>compared people who do eat meat amongst </v>
<v Speaker 5>the seventh day adventist population </v>

557
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.251
<v Speaker 5>with people who don't and was a slight </v>
<v Speaker 5>advantage in lifespan and in the </v>

558
00:26:46.951 --> 00:26:51.951
<v Speaker 5>vegetarians versus the mediators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But one of those studies didn't control </v>

559
00:26:51.951 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 5>for smoking and body mass index.</v>

560
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:57.350
<v Speaker 5>So that data is highly suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the other study did and there was a </v>

561
00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:02.241
<v Speaker 5>slight advantage since then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There have been four studies that I </v>

562
00:27:02.241 --> 00:27:07.191
<v Speaker 5>think did a much better job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is kind of an interesting </v>

563
00:27:07.191 --> 00:27:09.591
<v Speaker 5>design.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they said let's try to find a group </v>

564
00:27:09.591 --> 00:27:10.440
<v Speaker 5>of more health conscious omnivores to </v>
<v Speaker 5>compare these vegetarians against.</v>

565
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.910
<v Speaker 5>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first one was called the health food</v>

566
00:27:12.911 --> 00:27:17.911
<v Speaker 5>shopper study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they looked at people who shopped at </v>

567
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:20.901
<v Speaker 5>health food stores.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the idea is people who shopped at </v>

568
00:27:20.901 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 5>health food stores are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>generally more health conscious and they</v>

569
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Speaker 5>found health food store,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you mean like a whole foods or I.</v>

570
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 5>There was no whole foods at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was the idea.</v>

571
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:32.070
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that study found that both </v>

572
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.820
<v Speaker 5>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarians and omnivores who shopped at</v>

573
00:27:32.821 --> 00:27:37.821
<v Speaker 5>health food stores had us hugely reduced</v>
<v Speaker 5>risk of death compared to the general </v>

574
00:27:37.821 --> 00:27:42.261
<v Speaker 5>population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there was no difference between </v>

575
00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:42.261
<v Speaker 5>vegetarians and omnivores.</v>

576
00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:43.890
<v Speaker 5>Second study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oxford vegetarian study in the uk,</v>

577
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.280
<v Speaker 5>they recruited people buy first they </v>
<v Speaker 5>recruited vegetarians and then they </v>

578
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.151
<v Speaker 5>asked the vegetarians to ask their </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends who also ate meat so that the </v>

579
00:27:53.151 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 5>idea was the people that are vegetarians</v>
<v Speaker 5>were hanging out with,</v>

580
00:27:56.251 --> 00:27:58.800
<v Speaker 5>might be more health conscious than the </v>
<v Speaker 5>general population.</v>

581
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 5>Same result,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big difference in the,</v>

582
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in life span between those two groups in</v>

583
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:08.721
<v Speaker 5>the general population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no difference between vegetarians </v>

584
00:28:08.721 --> 00:28:09.000
<v Speaker 5>and omnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Epic oxford cohort.</v>

585
00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:11.370
<v Speaker 5>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>same way of recruiting people.</v>

586
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.440
<v Speaker 5>Same result,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big difference,</v>

587
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>between the two groups in the omnivores,</v>

588
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:18.360
<v Speaker 5>but no difference between vegetarians </v>
<v Speaker 5>and omnivores.</v>

589
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.720
<v Speaker 5>And then the heidelberg study was in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Germany and in a similar way,</v>

590
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:27.960
<v Speaker 5>I think they recruited people who read </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarian magazines and then they asked</v>

591
00:28:27.961 --> 00:28:30.390
<v Speaker 5>them to bring their friends or family </v>
<v Speaker 5>members who ate meat.</v>

592
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.590
<v Speaker 5>Big difference in lifespan between the </v>
<v Speaker 5>two groups and general population,</v>

593
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 5>no difference between vegetarians and </v>
<v Speaker 5>omnivores.</v>

594
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.920
<v Speaker 5>And then you had the 45 and up study </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was recently done in Australia.</v>

595
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 5>This was a little different because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't set out to find,</v>

596
00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more health conscious people.</v>

597
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.470
<v Speaker 5>Instead they looked at 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

598
00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:53.880
<v Speaker 5>big sample size and they did a much </v>
<v Speaker 5>better job of controlling for all of the</v>

599
00:28:53.881 --> 00:28:57.390
<v Speaker 5>various factors that might affect the </v>
<v Speaker 5>results.</v>

600
00:28:57.391 --> 00:28:59.430
<v Speaker 5>So exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>physical activity,</v>

601
00:28:59.431 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 5>fruit and vegetable consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarette smoking,</v>

602
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.520
<v Speaker 5>alcohol education level because we know </v>
<v Speaker 5>that has a big impact on lifespan and </v>

603
00:29:07.681 --> 00:29:12.681
<v Speaker 5>they found that there was no difference </v>
<v Speaker 5>in lifespan between omnivores and </v>

604
00:29:12.681 --> 00:29:16.290
<v Speaker 5>vegetarians in that study as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there've been two meta analysis</v>

605
00:29:16.291 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 5>of all of the studies that have looked </v>
<v Speaker 5>at this.</v>

606
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.630
<v Speaker 5>Both meta analysis found no difference </v>
<v Speaker 5>between vegetarians and omnivores in </v>

607
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.330
<v Speaker 5>total in lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think this is a really good example</v>

608
00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:29.850
<v Speaker 5>of what we're talkiNg about here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's all observational data,</v>

609
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.910
<v Speaker 5>so we're not throwing it out or saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>we should throw it out,</v>

610
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:38.180
<v Speaker 5>but all of those studies did a better </v>
<v Speaker 5>job at dealing with the potential </v>

611
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 5>pitfalls of observational studies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when they did that they found no</v>

612
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

613
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.680
<v Speaker 4>and I want to point out that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those ways of picking more health </v>

614
00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.591
<v Speaker 4>conscious omnivores were they still </v>
<v Speaker 4>weren't comparing like someone on a </v>

615
00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:55.540
<v Speaker 4>paleo type of diet with a vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just guessing that someone who</v>

616
00:29:55.541 --> 00:30:00.541
<v Speaker 4>shopped at a health food store was at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least a little more conscious about </v>

617
00:30:00.541 --> 00:30:01.890
<v Speaker 4>health in the general population.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So quick little cleanup.</v>

618
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 4>Quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick,</v>

619
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:07.501
<v Speaker 4>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Luckily I just want to go back for a </v>

620
00:30:07.501 --> 00:30:07.501
<v Speaker 4>minute to meet in cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>World health organization is not a vegan</v>

621
00:30:07.501 --> 00:30:09.450
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not enough in group now.</v>

622
00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:13.000
<v Speaker 4>It's a fairly well respected </v>
<v Speaker 4>international organization that puts out</v>

623
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:18.190
<v Speaker 4>health claims.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So although I absolutely chris had the </v>

624
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.781
<v Speaker 4>data right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>18 percent increase in cancer risk with </v>

625
00:30:21.781 --> 00:30:21.781
<v Speaker 4>process red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to make that clear.</v>

626
00:30:21.781 --> 00:30:23.530
<v Speaker 4>I hope you don't eat too many hot dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lie me,</v>

627
00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:25.030
<v Speaker 4>bologna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pepperoni.</v>

628
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 4>That's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

629
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:30.220
<v Speaker 4>it may be more than nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just a hallway.</v>

630
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.740
<v Speaker 4>It's assault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a preservatives.</v>

631
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.020
<v Speaker 4>It's junky pieces of the animal that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're putting into a hot dog.</v>

632
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.420
<v Speaker 4>That was a group that's an 18 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>increase.</v>

633
00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 4>You can go forward and a half percent of</v>
<v Speaker 4>five and a half percent.</v>

634
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.890
<v Speaker 4>That's still 50 to 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people a year.</v>

635
00:30:41.891 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 4>They get colon cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that data's right,</v>

636
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.930
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't get colon cancer if they </v>
<v Speaker 4>just would stop eating hot hotdogs at a </v>

637
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:48.930
<v Speaker 4>minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know chris will agree.</v>

638
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:53.730
<v Speaker 4>Frigging hospitals are serving hot dogs </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the data's out there that it </v>

639
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.970
<v Speaker 4>promotes cancer to people getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemotherapy with the ivy pool.</v>

640
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.250
<v Speaker 4>It's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So 50,000</v>

641
00:30:57.251 --> 00:31:02.251
<v Speaker 4>people avoid colorectal cancer with </v>
<v Speaker 4>small differences that the world health </v>

642
00:31:02.251 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 4>organization suggests it was 800 papers </v>
<v Speaker 4>in 22 world experts.</v>

643
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.570
<v Speaker 4>There is no perfect study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when they announced it,</v>

644
00:31:07.571 --> 00:31:09.310
<v Speaker 4>October 25th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2015,</v>

645
00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:14.311
<v Speaker 4>the world was shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just said that process red meat </v>

646
00:31:14.311 --> 00:31:14.311
<v Speaker 4>causes cancer.</v>

647
00:31:14.311 --> 00:31:18.420
<v Speaker 4>They didn't say related.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were strong enough data to say </v>

648
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:18.420
<v Speaker 4>cause they've been beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They publish more data.</v>

649
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 4>They haven't backed down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to put that out.</v>

650
00:31:19.751 --> 00:31:24.751
<v Speaker 4>The healthy user bias will exist in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>paleo community when the study's done </v>

651
00:31:24.751 --> 00:31:25.590
<v Speaker 4>because they may look at paleo effects </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

652
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:30.810
<v Speaker 4>It's everything and I honored that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we should promote healthy </v>

653
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:30.810
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only one part of this.</v>

654
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean we will all at this table live </v>
<v Speaker 4>longer than the average american.</v>

655
00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:37.570
<v Speaker 4>We're not smoking two packs a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have 38 inch waist lines.</v>

656
00:31:37.571 --> 00:31:39.130
<v Speaker 4>The whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're doing the whole thing.</v>

657
00:31:39.131 --> 00:31:43.210
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully you guys are enjoying a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>cabernet now and then or a that's always</v>

658
00:31:43.211 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 4>on the list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just don't overdo it,</v>

659
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.740
<v Speaker 4>but the healthy user bias,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that particular that health food study </v>

660
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.180
<v Speaker 4>paper with 1996,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty old paper in the paper in </v>

661
00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:53.180
<v Speaker 4>the limitations.</v>

662
00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.150
<v Speaker 4>They beat themselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were missing this or that.</v>

663
00:31:55.151 --> 00:32:00.151
<v Speaker 4>Anybody just read the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that it doesn't bring up an </v>

664
00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:02.821
<v Speaker 4>interesting point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to say that we again throw away all </v>

665
00:32:02.821 --> 00:32:03.910
<v Speaker 4>these papers cause they are biased it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lastly,</v>

666
00:32:03.911 --> 00:32:08.911
<v Speaker 4>and I'm done multivariate analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris was just talking about better </v>

667
00:32:08.911 --> 00:32:12.301
<v Speaker 4>studies that factor all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's not bore your audience was </v>

668
00:32:12.301 --> 00:32:13.480
<v Speaker 4>statistics statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's certainly the ability now to</v>

669
00:32:13.481 --> 00:32:18.481
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does animal protein associated with an </v>

670
00:32:18.481 --> 00:32:21.841
<v Speaker 4>increased risk of cancer and put in </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking and weight and diabetes and </v>

671
00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:23.860
<v Speaker 4>blood pressure and vegetable intake and </v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol intake and family history,</v>

672
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.250
<v Speaker 4>and then you just isolate the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>is their foibles.</v>

673
00:32:27.251 --> 00:32:28.540
<v Speaker 4>Are There downsides?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

674
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:33.310
<v Speaker 4>but all modern epidemiology does </v>
<v Speaker 4>multivariate analysis to try and isolate</v>

675
00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:33.700
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

676
00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:37.520
<v Speaker 4>you can cast stones everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know there are the,</v>

677
00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world health organization mean </v>

678
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 4>there's 21.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Organizations</v>

679
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.570
<v Speaker 5>say limit your saturated fat in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet and none that are international </v>

680
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.580
<v Speaker 5>society say increase at soap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you put it.</v>

681
00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:50.870
<v Speaker 5>Nutrition science needs incorporate as </v>
<v Speaker 5>much as you can with as much reliability</v>

682
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.380
<v Speaker 5>and at the end of the day you can see </v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll still have questions,</v>

683
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:59.320
<v Speaker 5>but I can't threaten us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Used to say don't eat much cholesterol.</v>

684
00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.340
<v Speaker 5>Now they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to say limit your total fat </v>

685
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.851
<v Speaker 5>and now they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's wrong because they've gone out is </v>

686
00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:06.851
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>

687
00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:10.400
<v Speaker 5>the usta says in the guideline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eat as little cholesterol is not a </v>

688
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.501
<v Speaker 5>nutrient of concern because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't identify the exact milligrams </v>

689
00:33:14.501 --> 00:33:14.770
<v Speaker 5>to recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Used to be 300.</v>

690
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:19.070
<v Speaker 5>The science doesn't support it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>emitting dietary cholesterol anymore.</v>

691
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:23.270
<v Speaker 5>Let me go back to the the limit </v>
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol.</v>

692
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.340
<v Speaker 5>Limit cholesterol to as little as </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>

693
00:33:25.341 --> 00:33:27.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's this thing?</v>

694
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Who is the usda?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Usda,</v>

695
00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:31.040
<v Speaker 5>usda.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guidelines come out every five years</v>

696
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 5>and they are in used for school menus </v>
<v Speaker 5>and hospital menus.</v>

697
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:40.450
<v Speaker 5>it was a big buzz in 2016 was announced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They no Longer were giving a so many </v>

698
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 5>miLligrams of cholesterol day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd never exceed.</v>

699
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:44.150
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't pick the number.</v>

700
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:49.210
<v Speaker 5>Usd a behind the cUrve in termS of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit influential.</v>

701
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:54.820
<v Speaker 5>Total mortality is the most important </v>
<v Speaker 5>end point we should be talking about </v>

702
00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That means deaths from any cause.</v>

703
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.510
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if,</v>

704
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.640
<v Speaker 5>because that's what we care about most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

705
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.370
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I die of a,</v>

706
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

707
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.580
<v Speaker 5>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if an intervention reduces the risk of a</v>

708
00:34:04.581 --> 00:34:06.890
<v Speaker 5>heart attack but increases the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer,</v>

709
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm not happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

710
00:34:09.711 --> 00:34:11.720
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather go out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a heart attack,</v>

711
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.900
<v Speaker 5>and so you need to consider a total </v>
<v Speaker 5>mortality and if something,</v>

712
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if meat increases the risk of cancer and</v>

713
00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:26.501
<v Speaker 5>cancer mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then why aren't we seeing that in the </v>

714
00:34:26.501 --> 00:34:26.720
<v Speaker 5>studies that compared lifespan with </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarians and omnivores?</v>

715
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.400
<v Speaker 5>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>

716
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:33.080
<v Speaker 5>we have a five studies that did a better</v>
<v Speaker 5>job of controlling for that healthy user</v>

717
00:34:33.081 --> 00:34:35.240
<v Speaker 5>bias and there was no difference in any </v>
<v Speaker 5>of those studies.</v>

718
00:34:35.241 --> 00:34:40.241
<v Speaker 5>There is not a single study that showed </v>
<v Speaker 5>that compared relatively equivalent </v>

719
00:34:40.241 --> 00:34:45.191
<v Speaker 5>groups of people that shows that </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarians or vegans have a lifespan </v>

720
00:34:45.191 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 5>advantage period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is not.</v>

721
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 5>And so if you know red meat isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we're saying red meat,</v>

722
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:52.160
<v Speaker 5>processed meat increases the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer by 18 percent,</v>

723
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.650
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe not,</v>

724
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.080
<v Speaker 5>but that's not showing up in any of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>total.</v>

725
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.870
<v Speaker 5>The total mortality data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The second thing,</v>

726
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:01.900
<v Speaker 5>and this is a really good example of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what we talked about,</v>

727
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.000
<v Speaker 5>the very beginning of the show context </v>
<v Speaker 5>is everything.</v>

728
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.580
<v Speaker 5>Quality is more important than quantity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's talk.</v>

729
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:12.610
<v Speaker 5>Let's think about processed meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's several proposed mechanisms </v>

730
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.640
<v Speaker 5>for how processed meat causes cancer.</v>

731
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.560
<v Speaker 5>One is that it increases and nitros,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so compounds or [inaudible],</v>

732
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.460
<v Speaker 5>which damage damage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the gut lining,</v>

733
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:20.920
<v Speaker 5>and others that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

734
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.960
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you cook meat at a high </v>

735
00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:25.960
<v Speaker 5>temperatures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at forums,</v>

736
00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 5>heterocyclic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any means or hcas which damaged the gut.</v>

737
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.680
<v Speaker 5>Another is that the heme iron content in</v>
<v Speaker 5>meat causes oxidative stress and </v>

738
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:39.190
<v Speaker 5>increases the risk of cancer that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's and new five gc.</v>

739
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 5>But let me just give you a few examples </v>
<v Speaker 5>of why context is important.</v>

740
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.560
<v Speaker 5>So there's evidence that chlorophyll </v>
<v Speaker 5>rich green vegetables prevent myoglobin </v>

741
00:35:49.351 --> 00:35:51.960
<v Speaker 5>from being turned into end nitros.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So compound.</v>

742
00:35:51.961 --> 00:35:56.730
<v Speaker 5>So if you're eating processed meat but </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're also eating kale and broccoli,</v>

743
00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:01.760
<v Speaker 5>then it's not going to have the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>effect on the body as if you're just </v>

744
00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.241
<v Speaker 5>eating a hot dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm cruciferous vegetables and spices </v>

745
00:36:05.241 --> 00:36:09.321
<v Speaker 5>and marinades have been shown to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 5>the formation of heterocyclic amines or </v>

746
00:36:09.321 --> 00:36:09.321
<v Speaker 5>hta.</v>

747
00:36:09.321 --> 00:36:14.060
<v Speaker 5>So same thing if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're marinating meat or if you're </v>

748
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.870
<v Speaker 5>eating broccoli and cruciferous </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetables with meat,</v>

749
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:20.930
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to have the same impact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are several studies have shown </v>

750
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.501
<v Speaker 5>that eating fruits and vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 5>attenuates the oxidative capacity of </v>

751
00:36:24.501 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 5>heme iron and even reduces the </v>
<v Speaker 5>absorption of heme iron in the gut.</v>

752
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.090
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

753
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:33.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dietary antioxidants have been shown to </v>

754
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 5>reduce the risk of gastric cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So heme iron intake,</v>

755
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:38.400
<v Speaker 5>really you can think of it as a proxy </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a crappy diet.</v>

756
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:43.430
<v Speaker 5>In these observational studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a quote from a study that did </v>

757
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:48.081
<v Speaker 5>find a relationship with heme iron and </v>
<v Speaker 5>cardiovascular disease and the but the </v>

758
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.810
<v Speaker 5>study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the study author himself said,</v>

759
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:56.990
<v Speaker 5>with respect to heme iron intake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we found a significant association only </v>

760
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:59.040
<v Speaker 5>in the studies that were based on </v>
<v Speaker 5>american cohorts.</v>

761
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.560
<v Speaker 5>They didn't find an association than the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Netherlands,</v>

762
00:37:01.561 --> 00:37:02.550
<v Speaker 5>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 5>France,</v>

763
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 5>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan,</v>

764
00:37:03.571 --> 00:37:08.571
<v Speaker 5>and Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which suggests that it's because of the </v>

765
00:37:08.571 --> 00:37:08.571
<v Speaker 5>standard crappy american diet.</v>

766
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:13.580
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people are eating processed meat </v>

767
00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.560
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the us are eating it in the form of </v>

768
00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 5>hot dogs and all kinds of other </v>
<v Speaker 5>unhealthy foods.</v>

769
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:22.011
<v Speaker 5>Sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's another example of how that </v>

770
00:37:22.011 --> 00:37:24.030
<v Speaker 5>user.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm not saying I'm open to the </v>

771
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.390
<v Speaker 5>possibility that too much processed meat</v>
<v Speaker 5>can be problematic,</v>

772
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:29.690
<v Speaker 5>but you have to consider the context.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to have the same effect </v>

773
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:33.381
<v Speaker 5>if someone's eating a ton of fruits and </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetables versus someone who's on a </v>

774
00:37:33.381 --> 00:37:36.450
<v Speaker 5>standard american diet and we have no </v>
<v Speaker 5>studies that separate that out.</v>

775
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:41.530
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we have a gong moment because I </v>

776
00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.820
<v Speaker 5>really want your listeners to come away </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a few tips from chris and I that </v>

777
00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.391
<v Speaker 5>make a difference because I know your </v>
<v Speaker 5>listeners aren't going to stop eating </v>

778
00:37:47.391 --> 00:37:47.391
<v Speaker 5>meat at the end of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They might.</v>

779
00:37:47.391 --> 00:37:51.500
<v Speaker 5>Chris just said meat with vegetables is </v>
<v Speaker 5>safer.</v>

780
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.770
<v Speaker 5>The meat without vegetables.</v>

781
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.110
<v Speaker 5>Meat with chlorophyll is safe for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat without.</v>

782
00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:56.290
<v Speaker 5>I can give you a cardiac study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Said,</v>

783
00:37:56.291 --> 00:37:56.780
<v Speaker 5>agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

784
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.240
<v Speaker 5>I teach process me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

785
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:02.490
<v Speaker 5>it's all made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I teach the same.</v>

786
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.180
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

787
00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:04.770
<v Speaker 5>we agree here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want people to hear this,</v>

788
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.270
<v Speaker 5>but doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you grill,</v>

789
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:08.610
<v Speaker 5>how many people in the audience grill </v>
<v Speaker 5>barbecue?</v>

790
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.380
<v Speaker 5>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you grill meat,</v>

791
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:13.980
<v Speaker 5>another chemical group that's formed are</v>
<v Speaker 5>called advanced glycation end products.</v>

792
00:38:13.981 --> 00:38:18.981
<v Speaker 5>Age to go along with the list,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you grill meat that's marinated </v>

793
00:38:18.981 --> 00:38:21.900
<v Speaker 5>and this was the tip in dark beer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is science randomized science.</v>

794
00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:24.620
<v Speaker 5>You put a piece of beef in dark beer and</v>
<v Speaker 5>your grill it.</v>

795
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.990
<v Speaker 5>You don't create as many of these toxic </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemicals as a dry piece of beef.</v>

796
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:33.200
<v Speaker 5>So let's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's like right now everybody </v>

797
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:33.200
<v Speaker 5>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>next time you eat meat,</v>

798
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.350
<v Speaker 5>get a salad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Next time we meet order broccoli.</v>

799
00:38:34.351 --> 00:38:35.900
<v Speaker 5>Next time you have get a</v>

800
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.590
<v Speaker 4>get a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

801
00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.490
<v Speaker 4>slice tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will actually improve your health.</v>

802
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 4>There's this classic announced shift </v>
<v Speaker 4>into cardiology that they took a healthy</v>

803
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:46.120
<v Speaker 4>volunteers and they took them down to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hospital cafeteria and they fed them</v>

804
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:51.330
<v Speaker 4>a hospital burger and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>measuring on their arm how there are </v>

805
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:51.700
<v Speaker 4>arteries function,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cardiology topic,</v>

806
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.710
<v Speaker 4>artery function goes down in three </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

807
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:58.711
<v Speaker 4>We needed a hospital Burger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It x like you just had a toxin in your </v>

808
00:38:58.711 --> 00:38:58.711
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You did.</v>

809
00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:00.160
<v Speaker 4>They took the same group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A week later they had them meet the same</v>

810
00:39:00.161 --> 00:39:03.010
<v Speaker 4>burger with a big salad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't see that finding.</v>

811
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want this to be an important point and</v>

812
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:10.650
<v Speaker 4>every body should be jamming fruits and </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables or at least the vegetables </v>

813
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 4>with some fruits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can go low glycaemic berries.</v>

814
00:39:13.181 --> 00:39:15.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine with papayas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cantaloupe,</v>

815
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:20.101
<v Speaker 4>and apples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know up your veggies listeners </v>

816
00:39:20.101 --> 00:39:23.730
<v Speaker 4>and you'll counteract lot of the crap </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's out there in the world and it's </v>

817
00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:23.730
<v Speaker 4>an important message.</v>

818
00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:23.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

819
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.150
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to.</v>

820
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.610
<v Speaker 4>We'd glossed over this very quickly in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of this,</v>

821
00:39:27.611 --> 00:39:32.611
<v Speaker 4>but there was a dispute about </v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol and a dispute about </v>

822
00:39:32.611 --> 00:39:32.611
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

823
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.040
<v Speaker 4>sears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were saying that saturated fat,</v>

824
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:40.810
<v Speaker 4>that there's recommendations to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat and reduced cholesterol.</v>

825
00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:45.811
<v Speaker 4>So let,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me go real quick overview and I'm </v>

826
00:39:45.811 --> 00:39:45.811
<v Speaker 4>going to talk fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just normal.</v>

827
00:39:45.811 --> 00:39:46.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was plenty of time.</v>

828
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:51.870
<v Speaker 4>It was felt so until the forties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was not common to have a heart </v>

829
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.350
<v Speaker 4>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heart attacks were described in 1916.</v>

830
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:58.530
<v Speaker 4>Not to say that didn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the first medical article that used </v>

831
00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.020
<v Speaker 4>the word myocardial infarction 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>16,</v>

832
00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:04.260
<v Speaker 4>1940.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were not many heart attacks seen </v>

833
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 4>in a modern american city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After world war two,</v>

834
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:07.840
<v Speaker 4>we are economy went up in the city of </v>
<v Speaker 4>minneapolis.</v>

835
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.330
<v Speaker 4>Executives started suffering heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacks.</v>

836
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.630
<v Speaker 4>It was also franklin delano roosevelt </v>
<v Speaker 4>died of high blood pressure.</v>

837
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 4>A few years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eisenhower had a massive heart attack.</v>

838
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:21.060
<v Speaker 4>That's when our government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>national institutes of health started </v>

839
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.911
<v Speaker 4>funneling major money into studies like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the framingham study or from newton </v>

840
00:40:23.911 --> 00:40:25.420
<v Speaker 4>framingham's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the city outside of boston,</v>

841
00:40:25.421 --> 00:40:28.270
<v Speaker 4>and they basically invaded this town in </v>
<v Speaker 4>1958.</v>

842
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.510
<v Speaker 4>Today is that we're spending money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to figure this crap out.</v>

843
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.540
<v Speaker 4>The idea had come up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heart disease wasn't just aging.</v>

844
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:37.540
<v Speaker 4>Heart disease could be explained by </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's called risk factors.</v>

845
00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.090
<v Speaker 4>Smoking might not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can smoke and live to a hundred,</v>

846
00:40:40.091 --> 00:40:45.091
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to increase your risk and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the gun to blood pressure and </v>

847
00:40:45.091 --> 00:40:47.791
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol and a family history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They identified what we call risk </v>

848
00:40:47.791 --> 00:40:49.660
<v Speaker 4>factors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so until that point,</v>

849
00:40:49.661 --> 00:40:51.940
<v Speaker 4>diet was not considered a factor in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>development.</v>

850
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:54.220
<v Speaker 4>The number one killer of men and women I</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to point out,</v>

851
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:56.230
<v Speaker 4>and chris puts this on his website.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>

852
00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:01.440
<v Speaker 4>During this interview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every 39 seconds and american dies of </v>

853
00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 4>heart disease every 39 second most </v>
<v Speaker 4>frequent cause of death,</v>

854
00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:09.571
<v Speaker 4>so there will be about 200 people </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps that will die during this </v>

855
00:41:09.571 --> 00:41:09.571
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

856
00:41:09.571 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 4>The number one killer and 80 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's preventable.</v>

857
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:16.560
<v Speaker 4>Chris is going to prevent some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to prevent some because the </v>

858
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:16.560
<v Speaker 4>biggest enemy out there smoking and </v>
<v Speaker 4>crap,</v>

859
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 4>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>calorie rich and processed foods,</v>

860
00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:20.020
<v Speaker 4>crap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sad diet,</v>

861
00:41:20.021 --> 00:41:25.021
<v Speaker 4>standard american diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becAme apparent in the early 19 </v>

862
00:41:25.021 --> 00:41:28.150
<v Speaker 4>fifties diet might play a role and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>notorious scientists and many others.</v>

863
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:30.220
<v Speaker 4>His name dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ancil keys,</v>

864
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 4>phd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>phd at two of them suggested dietary fat</v>

865
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:36.050
<v Speaker 4>might be a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a hypothesis.</v>

866
00:41:36.051 --> 00:41:39.560
<v Speaker 4>It says early stage epidemiology doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>prove anything.</v>

867
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.920
<v Speaker 4>He went out and did studies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other people went out and did studies </v>

868
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.910
<v Speaker 4>and the idea of transitioned actually he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was criticized for saying dietary fat.</v>

869
00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:51.911
<v Speaker 4>That is the conversation transition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some good fats like omega three </v>

870
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.560
<v Speaker 4>fatty acids are essential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have them,</v>

871
00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe polyunsaturated fats from</v>
<v Speaker 4>plants are more helpful,</v>

872
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:02.270
<v Speaker 4>but the focus went on saturated fat in </v>
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>

873
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:03.350
<v Speaker 4>which is bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chicken,</v>

874
00:42:03.351 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 4>red meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pizza.</v>

875
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 4>Those are the highest sources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

876
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>subsequently enough data accumulated.</v>

877
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:14.231
<v Speaker 4>That guideline started to suggest we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>got this huge problem with heart </v>

878
00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:17.441
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should limit saturated fat in the </v>

879
00:42:17.441 --> 00:42:19.181
<v Speaker 4>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was never limit off that 35 percent </v>

880
00:42:19.181 --> 00:42:19.310
<v Speaker 4>of calories that's not in anybody's </v>
<v Speaker 4>word,</v>

881
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 4>a low fat diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

882
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 4>and that has now promulgated in 21 </v>
<v Speaker 4>international statements,</v>

883
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:29.510
<v Speaker 4>there is no opposite whether it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>world health organization,</v>

884
00:42:29.511 --> 00:42:31.760
<v Speaker 4>the american heart association,</v>
<v Speaker 4>american college of cardiology,</v>

885
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:34.310
<v Speaker 4>whether it's an institute of institute </v>
<v Speaker 4>of medicine,</v>

886
00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:37.070
<v Speaker 4>says eat as little saturated fat as </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

887
00:42:37.071 --> 00:42:38.750
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't be more clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these are high brow.</v>

888
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:44.020
<v Speaker 4>These are not associated with vegan </v>
<v Speaker 4>movements or paleo movements or </v>

889
00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:44.810
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are medical authorities.</v>

890
00:42:44.811 --> 00:42:47.180
<v Speaker 4>If there was half and half,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd say controversy,</v>

891
00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:52.181
<v Speaker 4>21 to 21 say the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might pick a different cutoff </v>

892
00:42:52.181 --> 00:42:55.451
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we will enhance the health and cut </v>

893
00:42:55.451 --> 00:42:55.451
<v Speaker 4>down the number one killer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's in asia,</v>

894
00:42:55.451 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 4>whether the job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's Australia,</v>

895
00:42:55.851 --> 00:43:00.851
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's unanimity in why did they come </v>

896
00:43:00.851 --> 00:43:03.530
<v Speaker 4>to the basic science?</v>

897
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.740
<v Speaker 4>Because there is basic science and let </v>
<v Speaker 4>me tell you that when you eat foods rich</v>

898
00:43:06.741 --> 00:43:08.480
<v Speaker 4>and saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is called meat,</v>

899
00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 4>cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eggs,</v>

900
00:43:09.411 --> 00:43:12.740
<v Speaker 4>and such receptors on your liver for </v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol,</v>

901
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:14.420
<v Speaker 4>I've got cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my blood,</v>

902
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:17.450
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to get some of it out into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>liver to be metabolized.</v>

903
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 4>I need a receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You eat saturated fats.</v>

904
00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Receptors go down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cholesterol has no place to go.</v>

905
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:24.470
<v Speaker 4>Cholesterol stays In the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bumps into your artery wall.</v>

906
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:27.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm putting a stent in yardi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the basic biochemistry.</v>

907
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:30.230
<v Speaker 4>Then they had epidemiology studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flawed.</v>

908
00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:31.580
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

909
00:43:31.581 --> 00:43:33.390
<v Speaker 4>There was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

910
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.980
<v Speaker 4>chris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chris,</v>

911
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:36.600
<v Speaker 4>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they did controlled trials.</v>

912
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.960
<v Speaker 4>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody just go read clark.</v>

913
00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:43.100
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen 97 slash 395.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called metabolic studies,</v>

914
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.140
<v Speaker 4>changed the diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what happens.</v>

915
00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.260
<v Speaker 4>You add saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol skyrockets on average,</v>

916
00:43:48.261 --> 00:43:53.261
<v Speaker 4>not in a single person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I give you a state christmas taken </v>

917
00:43:53.261 --> 00:43:53.480
<v Speaker 4>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our cluster would rise differently.</v>

918
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.710
<v Speaker 4>It would rise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would rise differently.</v>

919
00:43:54.711 --> 00:43:57.350
<v Speaker 4>It's our microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's our genetics.</v>

920
00:43:57.351 --> 00:43:58.940
<v Speaker 4>It would rise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it.</v>

921
00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 4>That's a problem in the studies when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>average everything together.</v>

922
00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:06.701
<v Speaker 4>So they had that and then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>finally they looked at populations that </v>

923
00:44:06.701 --> 00:44:10.091
<v Speaker 4>live over 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are called the pillars of </v>

924
00:44:10.091 --> 00:44:11.981
<v Speaker 4>longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't eat foods rich in saturated </v>

925
00:44:11.981 --> 00:44:11.981
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a little,</v>

926
00:44:11.981 --> 00:44:13.280
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They eat a lot of olive oil in Italy and</v>

927
00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:18.281
<v Speaker 4>Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They eat almost no dietary fat in </v>

928
00:44:18.281 --> 00:44:18.281
<v Speaker 4>okinawa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan and they live.</v>

929
00:44:18.281 --> 00:44:19.340
<v Speaker 4>They have the greatest longevity in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

930
00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:21.890
<v Speaker 4>In 1970,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they almost no dietary fat.</v>

931
00:44:21.891 --> 00:44:23.000
<v Speaker 4>About six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven percent.</v>

932
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:23.600
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

933
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'S actually.</v>

934
00:44:26.721 --> 00:44:31.721
<v Speaker 4>That is the basis for a major push to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say cut back on animal products</v>

935
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 5>because that's largely with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>exception of coconut and palm.</v>

936
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:40.590
<v Speaker 5>We're saturated fat comes from so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>to tiffany gate,</v>

937
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:44.370
<v Speaker 5>that is to throw out every major health </v>
<v Speaker 5>agency in the world.</v>

938
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:46.170
<v Speaker 5>And I don't believe chris kresser can do</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

939
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:51.200
<v Speaker 5>No disrespect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think chris can throw out a </v>

940
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.290
<v Speaker 5>hundred years of cluster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's back up a little bit here.</v>

941
00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

942
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:54.510
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

943
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.960
<v Speaker 5>every food that we consume has all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fats in it,</v>

944
00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:01.290
<v Speaker 5>polyunsaturated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>monounsaturated and saturated fat.</v>

945
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.860
<v Speaker 5>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two tablespoons of olive oil has more </v>

946
00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:06.900
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat than a seven ounce pork </v>
<v Speaker 5>chop.</v>

947
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:11.250
<v Speaker 5>That's a little known fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The oily fish macro,</v>

948
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:16.460
<v Speaker 5>which all of these health agencies that </v>
<v Speaker 5>joel was talking about advises us to </v>

949
00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:20.091
<v Speaker 5>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has twice the total fat in one and a </v>

950
00:45:20.091 --> 00:45:21.690
<v Speaker 5>half times the saturated fat that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the meat that we're told to avoid.</v>

951
00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:27.180
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does it make sense that nature would </v>

952
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.571
<v Speaker 5>include the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you could eat a macro and the </v>

953
00:45:29.571 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 5>polyunsaturated fats in it are good for </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

954
00:45:30.601 --> 00:45:32.970
<v Speaker 5>but the saturated fat in it is bad for </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

955
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.150
<v Speaker 5>That'S kind of nonsensical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

956
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.880
<v Speaker 5>let's talk a little bit more about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>research.</v>

957
00:45:38.881 --> 00:45:43.881
<v Speaker 5>So there never really was good evidence </v>
<v Speaker 5>to suggest that dietary cholesterol and </v>

958
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:48.060
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat are connected to heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>disease.</v>

959
00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:50.410
<v Speaker 5>And zoe heart comb,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's a,</v>

960
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.120
<v Speaker 5>has a phd in nutritional researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she wrote her thesis,</v>

961
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:59.121
<v Speaker 5>her phd thesis on the evidence back in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the seventies that led to the </v>

962
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:04.020
<v Speaker 5>restrictions on a saturated fat and </v>
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol.</v>

963
00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:09.380
<v Speaker 5>And then she also reviewed the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're all the way up until the 2016.</v>

964
00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:11.380
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if,</v>

965
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have this information on my website,</v>

966
00:46:14.491 --> 00:46:16.530
<v Speaker 5>if you go to [inaudible] dot com slash </v>
<v Speaker 5>rogan,</v>

967
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:21.860
<v Speaker 5>you can find it and what you'll find is </v>
<v Speaker 5>there never was in really good evidence </v>

968
00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.440
<v Speaker 5>to support the limitations on die on </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat and cholesterol.</v>

969
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 5>And people have started to look at this </v>
<v Speaker 5>more recently.</v>

970
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.050
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

971
00:46:31.051 --> 00:46:36.051
<v Speaker 5>you have a meta analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 5>observational studies including about </v>

972
00:46:36.051 --> 00:46:40.611
<v Speaker 5>350,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>participants recently that found no </v>

973
00:46:40.611 --> 00:46:43.290
<v Speaker 5>relationship between saturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 5>intake and cardiovascular disease.</v>

974
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:47.700
<v Speaker 5>You have an exhaustive review of </v>
<v Speaker 5>studies,</v>

975
00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:50.850
<v Speaker 5>something like 25 randomized controlled </v>
<v Speaker 5>trials,</v>

976
00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:55.230
<v Speaker 5>gold standard of clinical evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's almost 40 observational studies</v>

977
00:46:55.231 --> 00:46:57.990
<v Speaker 5>involving 650,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>participants.</v>

978
00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.240
<v Speaker 5>And I'll read you a quote from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conclusion,</v>

979
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:05.810
<v Speaker 5>current evidence does not clearly </v>
<v Speaker 5>support cardiovascular guidelines that </v>

980
00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:09.621
<v Speaker 5>encourage high consumption of </v>
<v Speaker 5>polyunsaturated fatty acids and low </v>

981
00:47:09.621 --> 00:47:11.190
<v Speaker 5>consumption of saturated fatty acids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

982
00:47:11.191 --> 00:47:16.191
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of my favorite quotes is the </v>

983
00:47:16.191 --> 00:47:18.530
<v Speaker 5>philosopher anatoly France,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even a $50 million people say a foolish </v>

984
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:18.750
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still a foolish thing.</v>

985
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:24.650
<v Speaker 5>And the other thing to consider is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the history of science is really the </v>

986
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:28.470
<v Speaker 5>history of most scientists being wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>about most things most of the time.</v>

987
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:29.910
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

988
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:34.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in science we have to continually </v>

989
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:35.860
<v Speaker 5>challenge our hypotheses and try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>falsify them.</v>

990
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 5>And that'S how the scientific process </v>
<v Speaker 5>moves forward.</v>

991
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.480
<v Speaker 5>And that's why in 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 5>theu ,</v>

992
00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:44.560
<v Speaker 5>s federal government removed </v>
<v Speaker 5>restrictions on total fat.</v>

993
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.940
<v Speaker 5>Whereas before There was a restriction </v>
<v Speaker 5>on total fat because they,</v>

994
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:52.660
<v Speaker 5>they acknowledged that the research was </v>
<v Speaker 5>showing that not all fat is the same and</v>

995
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:54.040
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

996
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 5>we don't need to be restricting fat from</v>
<v Speaker 5>avocados and things like that.</v>

997
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.480
<v Speaker 5>And in 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they removed the restriction on dietary </v>

998
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.300
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they did that fairly quietly because</v>

999
00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:09.301
<v Speaker 5>how do you think it looks when people </v>
<v Speaker 5>have been told to limit their fat and </v>

1000
00:48:09.301 --> 00:48:13.210
<v Speaker 5>limit their cholesterol and then the </v>
<v Speaker 5>federal agency goes back on that,</v>

1001
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:17.290
<v Speaker 5>that recommendation after so many years </v>
<v Speaker 5>of telling people to do that,</v>

1002
00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:19.960
<v Speaker 5>people lose faith in the agencies that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>

1003
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.260
<v Speaker 5>that are issuing these guidelines and </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't take it for me.</v>

1004
00:48:23.261 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1005
00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not expecting anyone to believe me,</v>

1006
00:48:26.801 --> 00:48:31.801
<v Speaker 5>and that's why I put all of the studies </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the research supporting this at </v>

1007
00:48:31.801 --> 00:48:34.930
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] dot com slash rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how about johnny enedis,</v>

1008
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:38.560
<v Speaker 5>who's one of the most renowned </v>
<v Speaker 5>epidemiologists in the world?</v>

1009
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.790
<v Speaker 5>He's a professor of medicine at stanford</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he has wrote some written,</v>

1010
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:47.791
<v Speaker 5>some scathing critiques of nutritional </v>
<v Speaker 5>research recently that had been </v>

1011
00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:48.880
<v Speaker 5>published in jama and british medical </v>
<v Speaker 5>journal.</v>

1012
00:48:48.881 --> 00:48:52.540
<v Speaker 5>So here's a quote from one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some nutrition scientist and much of the</v>

1013
00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:57.541
<v Speaker 5>public often consider epidemiological </v>
<v Speaker 5>associations of nutritional factors to </v>

1014
00:48:57.541 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 5>represent causal effects that can inform</v>
<v Speaker 5>public health policy and guidelines.</v>

1015
00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:06.120
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the emerging picture of nutritional </v>

1016
00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 5>epidemiology is difficult to reconcile </v>
<v Speaker 5>with good scientific principles.</v>

1017
00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:13.020
<v Speaker 5>The field needs radical reform and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes on to point out that med analyses </v>

1018
00:49:13.931 --> 00:49:18.931
<v Speaker 5>of observational studies have found that</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost all foods are associated with a </v>

1019
00:49:18.931 --> 00:49:21.070
<v Speaker 5>higher risk of death if you crunch the </v>
<v Speaker 5>data in certain ways.</v>

1020
00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:22.690
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1021
00:49:22.691 --> 00:49:24.760
<v Speaker 5>it's not enough to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1022
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:30.090
<v Speaker 5>governments are recommending this or </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we have to look at the science and </v>

1023
00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:30.880
<v Speaker 5>what the science is saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as I said,</v>

1024
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:36.250
<v Speaker 5>you two recent med analysis covering </v>
<v Speaker 5>over a million people are not showing a </v>

1025
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:41.011
<v Speaker 5>relationship between saturated fat and </v>
<v Speaker 5>heart disease and they're not showing </v>

1026
00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:44.110
<v Speaker 5>any benefit from replacing saturated fat</v>
<v Speaker 5>with polyunsaturated fats.</v>

1027
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.400
<v Speaker 2>So these organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joel,</v>

1028
00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:49.940
<v Speaker 2>you were describing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think that they recommend,</v>

1029
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:54.970
<v Speaker 2>based on what chris has just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think that they recommend </v>

1030
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:55.370
<v Speaker 2>reducing your saturated fat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reducing your cholesterol?</v>

1031
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1032
00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:58.610
<v Speaker 2>and thank you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the important here,</v>

1033
00:49:58.611 --> 00:50:02.170
<v Speaker 2>which we are technical in the weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to bring it back.</v>

1034
00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:04.280
<v Speaker 2>This discussion is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have a stroke,</v>

1035
00:50:04.281 --> 00:50:05.840
<v Speaker 2>heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>erectile dysfunction,</v>

1036
00:50:05.841 --> 00:50:07.850
<v Speaker 2>lose a leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or do you not?</v>

1037
00:50:07.851 --> 00:50:12.851
<v Speaker 2>Because at least one factor in </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of these horrible medical </v>

1038
00:50:12.851 --> 00:50:13.220
<v Speaker 2>problems that are 80 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>preventable,</v>

1039
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.830
<v Speaker 2>at least one of it is nutrition and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuity.</v>

1040
00:50:15.831 --> 00:50:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1041
00:50:16.371 --> 00:50:18.620
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt it's the single most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important factor.</v>

1042
00:50:18.621 --> 00:50:22.820
<v Speaker 2>It's never been the only fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations are saying this.</v>

1043
00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.120
<v Speaker 2>He's saying social studies don't support</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1044
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1045
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The science and</v>

1046
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.470
<v Speaker 4>I want to be very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about cholesterol.</v>

1047
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So stay with saturated fat because there</v>

1048
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:35.760
<v Speaker 4>is differences there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're both,</v>

1049
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:36.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1050
00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:39.140
<v Speaker 4>contents of food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fatty contents of food,</v>

1051
00:50:39.141 --> 00:50:40.790
<v Speaker 4>but they're chemically different in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>volume.</v>

1052
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:41.990
<v Speaker 4>Weight is very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very different.</v>

1053
00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:47.920
<v Speaker 4>Cholesterol only comes from animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat as animals and plants </v>

1054
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.520
<v Speaker 4>depending on the food source.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when this rise in heart attacks </v>

1055
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.160
<v Speaker 4>developed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>research began 19,</v>

1056
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 4>48 and 1950,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1958.</v>

1057
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:58.880
<v Speaker 4>There were observations made that </v>
<v Speaker 4>carefully done dietary logs,</v>

1058
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.900
<v Speaker 4>suggested these were hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There might be a connection between what</v>

1059
00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:05.000
<v Speaker 4>you eat and heart attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it's centered on,</v>

1060
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:05.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1061
00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.330
<v Speaker 4>is it foods high in protein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>foods,</v>

1062
00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:09.200
<v Speaker 4>high sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>foods,</v>

1063
00:51:09.201 --> 00:51:14.201
<v Speaker 4>high in fatty sources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately they get sophisticated foods </v>

1064
00:51:14.201 --> 00:51:16.190
<v Speaker 4>high in plant fat sources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>foods high in animal fat sources,</v>

1065
00:51:16.191 --> 00:51:21.191
<v Speaker 4>so by the late 19 fifties there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very strong consensus already that foods</v>

1066
00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:24.890
<v Speaker 4>high in animal products with saturated </v>
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>

1067
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.110
<v Speaker 4>They go together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking to meat,</v>

1068
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:28.400
<v Speaker 4>egg and cheese may be a role.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1069
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.470
<v Speaker 4>Let me give you a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>in 1959,</v>

1070
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:34.040
<v Speaker 4>you grew up in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a cholesterol of 120.</v>

1071
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:39.070
<v Speaker 4>You almost never see a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You moved to Hawaii because there's </v>

1072
00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:40.400
<v Speaker 4>migration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your cholesterol rises to a hundred 80.</v>

1073
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.500
<v Speaker 4>Welcome to America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your heart attack,</v>

1074
00:51:42.501 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 4>risk triples.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You move to this great city,</v>

1075
00:51:44.751 --> 00:51:47.030
<v Speaker 4>los angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was published in 1959.</v>

1076
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:52.210
<v Speaker 4>Your cholesterol is now 2:10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have 10 times the heart attack risk </v>

1077
00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.570
<v Speaker 4>that you had when you lived in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Genetics don't change that quick.</v>

1078
00:51:53.571 --> 00:51:56.230
<v Speaker 4>This was within one generation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're called nisei.</v>

1079
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:58.340
<v Speaker 4>People that leave Japan to move to </v>
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>

1080
00:51:58.341 --> 00:52:00.090
<v Speaker 4>the nisei,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's the knee say,</v>

1081
00:52:00.091 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 4>hon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>study that.</v>

1082
00:52:00.921 --> 00:52:02.120
<v Speaker 4>Track these people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

1083
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:07.360
<v Speaker 4>is that the air?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it that they adopted other bad </v>

1084
00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:07.360
<v Speaker 4>habits?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shirt could be,</v>

1085
00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 4>but within a very short time that 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>times the risk of heart attack,</v>

1086
00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:15.071
<v Speaker 4>so public research and dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff is correlated with animal </v>

1087
00:52:15.141 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 4>fats and proteins.</v>

1088
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:21.370
<v Speaker 4>Why isn't correlated with sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 4>refined carbohydrates so carefully done </v>

1089
00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:25.781
<v Speaker 4>studies say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think we all agree more so now </v>

1090
00:52:25.781 --> 00:52:29.381
<v Speaker 4>because we're overweight and now we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>more insulin resistant and added sugars </v>

1091
00:52:29.381 --> 00:52:33.671
<v Speaker 4>in the diet are more important in 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 4>than they were when in the country was </v>

1092
00:52:33.671 --> 00:52:34.850
<v Speaker 4>thin in 1960.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't good then.</v>

1093
00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:36.590
<v Speaker 4>They aren't good now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you parse it out,</v>

1094
00:52:36.591 --> 00:52:41.591
<v Speaker 4>multivariate analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a stronger relationship between </v>

1095
00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:44.920
<v Speaker 4>the number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>food in studies like this is usually </v>

1096
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:44.960
<v Speaker 4>butter more than red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually butter.</v>

1097
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.480
<v Speaker 4>That's just at our value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called statistic.</v>

1098
00:52:47.481 --> 00:52:49.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to go so deep into </v>
<v Speaker 4>statistics.</v>

1099
00:52:49.131 --> 00:52:52.490
<v Speaker 4>It is somewhere there is sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you a classic study.</v>

1100
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:55.840
<v Speaker 4>If you could hold sugar the same and </v>
<v Speaker 4>increased dietary saturated fat,</v>

1101
00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 4>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rockets.</v>

1102
00:52:56.841 --> 00:52:58.460
<v Speaker 4>If you could hold saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same.</v>

1103
00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.910
<v Speaker 4>Increased sugar in these manipulations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coronary heart disease doesn't increase.</v>

1104
00:53:01.911 --> 00:53:04.490
<v Speaker 4>Let's point something out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been inside of hearts 15,000</v>

1105
00:53:04.491 --> 00:53:09.491
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never scooped sugar out of a </v>

1106
00:53:09.491 --> 00:53:09.491
<v Speaker 4>blocked artery as scooped cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of blocked arteries.</v>

1107
00:53:09.491 --> 00:53:11.870
<v Speaker 4>Twenty percent of every blockage in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart is cholesterol.</v>

1108
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:15.620
<v Speaker 4>So fact that was discovered in 1910.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's never varied.</v>

1109
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:19.040
<v Speaker 4>Then we fed animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's pause for a second,</v>

1110
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:20.390
<v Speaker 4>chris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have something to say about that?</v>

1111
00:53:20.391 --> 00:53:25.391
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that doesn't mean that the </v>

1112
00:53:25.391 --> 00:53:25.391
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol is there because people were</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating it.</v>

1113
00:53:25.391 --> 00:53:26.120
<v Speaker 4>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know That could be though</v>

1114
00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 5>that let.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say,</v>

1115
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 5>let's look at what the research says </v>
<v Speaker 5>again here.</v>

1116
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:35.571
<v Speaker 5>So they've done controlled feeding </v>
<v Speaker 5>studies where they fed people two to </v>

1117
00:53:35.571 --> 00:53:38.571
<v Speaker 5>four eggs a day and those show that in </v>
<v Speaker 5>75 percent of cases that has zero impact</v>

1118
00:53:39.331 --> 00:53:42.900
<v Speaker 5>on blood cholesterol levels for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other 25 percent of people,</v>

1119
00:53:42.901 --> 00:53:47.901
<v Speaker 5>they're termed hyper responders and in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that group dietary cholesterol or does </v>

1120
00:53:47.971 --> 00:53:52.971
<v Speaker 5>modestly increase ldl cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also increases hdl cholesterol </v>

1121
00:53:52.971 --> 00:53:54.000
<v Speaker 5>and it does not increase the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 5>heart disease.</v>

1122
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:59.510
<v Speaker 5>This is why the guidelines were changed </v>
<v Speaker 5>on dietary cholesterol is there is no </v>

1123
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:04.850
<v Speaker 5>evidence that they're consuming dietary </v>
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol increases the risk of blood </v>

1124
00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:07.080
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol and most people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and even when it does,</v>

1125
00:54:07.081 --> 00:54:09.660
<v Speaker 5>there's no evidence that it increases </v>
<v Speaker 5>the risk of a heart attack,</v>

1126
00:54:09.661 --> 00:54:14.190
<v Speaker 5>which is again why the dietary </v>
<v Speaker 5>guidelines change for saturated fat.</v>

1127
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:19.520
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it most of the studies that showed harm </v>

1128
00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:19.520
<v Speaker 5>work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>short term studies,</v>

1129
00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.870
<v Speaker 5>these longer term studies have shown </v>
<v Speaker 5>that on average eating saturated fat </v>

1130
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:28.671
<v Speaker 5>does not increase saturated fat levels </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the blood and have all of the long </v>

1131
00:54:28.671 --> 00:54:31.560
<v Speaker 5>term studies that looked at this.</v>

1132
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:36.560
<v Speaker 5>Only one showed any association between </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat intake and cholesterol </v>

1133
00:54:37.651 --> 00:54:40.680
<v Speaker 5>levels in the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then we have a med analysis,</v>

1134
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:45.740
<v Speaker 5>lots of meta analyses actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but one of the best known met analysis </v>

1135
00:54:46.141 --> 00:54:51.141
<v Speaker 5>was of 17 randomized controlled trials </v>
<v Speaker 5>of low carb diets that were high in </v>

1136
00:54:51.141 --> 00:54:54.960
<v Speaker 5>saturated fats in published in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>journal of obesity reviews,</v>

1137
00:54:55.530 --> 00:55:00.530
<v Speaker 5>and they found that low carb diets </v>
<v Speaker 5>neither increase nor decrease ldl </v>

1138
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:01.530
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what they did find was that low carb</v>

1139
00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:06.531
<v Speaker 5>diets are associated with decrease in </v>
<v Speaker 5>body weight improvements in several </v>

1140
00:55:06.531 --> 00:55:08.490
<v Speaker 5>cardiovascular risks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Risk factors including triglycerides,</v>

1141
00:55:08.491 --> 00:55:10.260
<v Speaker 5>fasting glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blood pressure,</v>

1142
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.600
<v Speaker 5>body mass index,</v>
<v Speaker 5>abdominal circumference,</v>

1143
00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:13.440
<v Speaker 5>plasma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>insulin,</v>

1144
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:18.480
<v Speaker 5>c reactive protein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as well as an increase in hdl </v>

1145
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:18.480
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1146
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.211
<v Speaker 5>there hAve now been 10 meta analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 5>randomized controlled trials looking at </v>

1147
00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:29.301
<v Speaker 5>low carb diets for weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>all 10 showed that the low carb diet </v>

1148
00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:35.930
<v Speaker 5>either outperformed in most cases or was</v>
<v Speaker 5>was on this at the same level as low fat</v>

1149
00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:36.870
<v Speaker 5>diets.</v>

1150
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:42.290
<v Speaker 5>There have been several metta analyses </v>
<v Speaker 5>now you can see them all at [inaudible] </v>

1151
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:45.711
<v Speaker 5>dot com slash rogan that have looked at </v>
<v Speaker 5>a low carb diets for diabetes and </v>

1152
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:52.280
<v Speaker 5>cardiovascular risk markers and all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these meta analyses have found that low </v>

1153
00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.020
<v Speaker 5>carb diets are superior for glycaemic </v>
<v Speaker 5>control,</v>

1154
00:55:55.021 --> 00:55:57.600
<v Speaker 5>for reducing insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for reducing triglycerides,</v>

1155
00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:02.900
<v Speaker 5>and have beneficial effects across the </v>
<v Speaker 5>board without increasing cardiovascular </v>

1156
00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:07.731
<v Speaker 5>risk markers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're now we're talking about </v>

1157
00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:09.801
<v Speaker 5>randomized control trials,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the best form of evidence that </v>

1158
00:56:09.801 --> 00:56:11.440
<v Speaker 5>we have and we're not seeing any harm </v>
<v Speaker 5>from ink,</v>

1159
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>increased consumption of saturated fat.</v>

1160
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:18.030
<v Speaker 5>So it was the problem that you're citing</v>
<v Speaker 5>epidemiology studies from the 19 forties</v>

1161
00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:23.050
<v Speaker 5>in the 19 fifties was that definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we need to to to prefer</v>

1162
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:27.340
<v Speaker 4>randomized controlled trials over that </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of evidence for sure.</v>

1163
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Why do you continue to go back to these </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies from the 1940 and 19 fifties was</v>

1164
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:37.170
<v Speaker 4>beginning though the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but chris just took 14 topics and put </v>

1165
00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:39.580
<v Speaker 4>them into one for meta analysis during </v>
<v Speaker 4>them as controls.</v>

1166
00:56:39.581 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 4>The low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>low fat.</v>

1167
00:56:40.691 --> 00:56:45.691
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're all different topics and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you put that all </v>

1168
00:56:45.691 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need clarity and laser focused.</v>

1169
00:56:46.811 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 4>So we were talking saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1170
00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 4>so hypothesis has generated saturated </v>
<v Speaker 4>fat in the diet.</v>

1171
00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:57.721
<v Speaker 4>Butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eggs and cheese may be bad for heart </v>

1172
00:56:57.721 --> 00:56:59.401
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something killing americans left to </v>

1173
00:56:59.401 --> 00:57:01.351
<v Speaker 4>right in 1949 slash 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go into countries with widely </v>

1174
00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:01.351
<v Speaker 4>different diets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see what they're eating.</v>

1175
00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:04.030
<v Speaker 4>Let's actually take their frigging diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>back to minneapolis.</v>

1176
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:09.090
<v Speaker 4>Let's analyze it so it's not guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not food frequency questionnaires were </v>

1177
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:09.090
<v Speaker 4>taking their meals back.</v>

1178
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:11.050
<v Speaker 4>The United States analyze them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but boom,</v>

1179
00:57:11.051 --> 00:57:14.710
<v Speaker 4>there's a relationship between dietary </v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat and your risk.</v>

1180
00:57:14.711 --> 00:57:17.100
<v Speaker 4>Fifty year followup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no short term followup.</v>

1181
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:22.130
<v Speaker 4>The study I'm referring to as 50 year </v>
<v Speaker 4>1958 to now and um,</v>

1182
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:27.570
<v Speaker 4>that strongly suggested that dietary </v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat and heart disease that </v>

1183
00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:31.741
<v Speaker 4>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not what's called the ultimate </v>

1184
00:57:31.741 --> 00:57:33.900
<v Speaker 4>randomized clinical study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of high quality second </v>

1185
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.070
<v Speaker 4>study done in China at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 4>with years of followup.</v>

1186
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:40.080
<v Speaker 4>So these are right up to date.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's publications right now from </v>

1187
00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:40.390
<v Speaker 4>studies starting at then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the publications are now,</v>

1188
00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:43.420
<v Speaker 4>but then you get the best kind of study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1189
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:46.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm still unsaturated saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking any other topic.</v>

1190
00:57:46.001 --> 00:57:49.810
<v Speaker 4>You put people in a metabolic ward at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the national institute of health,</v>

1191
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:54.730
<v Speaker 4>395 of these studies published in 1979.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You change their diet.</v>

1192
00:57:54.731 --> 00:57:58.720
<v Speaker 4>This is the ultimate careful experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be for four weeks or six weeks,</v>

1193
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:00.340
<v Speaker 4>you up their saturated fat.</v>

1194
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 4>Their cholesterol rises assures can be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all different.</v>

1195
00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:06.580
<v Speaker 4>The change in cholesterol is consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to go up 20 percent,</v>

1196
00:58:06.581 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 4>20 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 percent.</v>

1197
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:12.511
<v Speaker 4>We start at different points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to track the change in </v>

1198
00:58:12.511 --> 00:58:13.030
<v Speaker 4>clusteral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris referred tO.</v>

1199
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:16.660
<v Speaker 4>Can I go off on a tangent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting,</v>

1200
00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:19.150
<v Speaker 4>this will fascinate your listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's right on the topic.</v>

1201
00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:22.300
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand and eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is published data.</v>

1202
00:58:22.301 --> 00:58:25.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't bullshit on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand eight Mexico city,</v>

1203
00:58:25.391 --> 00:58:28.480
<v Speaker 4>the national,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the international dairy council meet and</v>

1204
00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:33.481
<v Speaker 4>they published their notes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why we know this and they said </v>

1205
00:58:33.481 --> 00:58:36.331
<v Speaker 4>we are losing the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are eating less dairy around the </v>

1206
00:58:36.331 --> 00:58:36.610
<v Speaker 4>world and we are losing sales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1207
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:39.520
<v Speaker 4>we can do is influence researchers </v>
<v Speaker 4>influence expeditions,</v>

1208
00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:41.320
<v Speaker 4>insistent speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1209
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:46.410
<v Speaker 4>it's every.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every dairy council in the world just </v>

1210
00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:46.450
<v Speaker 4>happens to meet in Mexico city that </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

1211
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.770
<v Speaker 4>Then they go meet and Portugal.</v>

1212
00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:49.210
<v Speaker 4>Then they go meet in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1213
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:52.660
<v Speaker 4>2008.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to put dollars into changing</v>

1214
00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:55.780
<v Speaker 4>research and influencing people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean it's all bad.</v>

1215
00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:59.200
<v Speaker 4>They publish those notes that are global</v>
<v Speaker 4>initiative for the next year.</v>

1216
00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:04.410
<v Speaker 4>They looked for sympathetic researchers </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would change public opinion and </v>

1217
00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:06.130
<v Speaker 4>that was right before the milk mustache </v>
<v Speaker 4>campaign.</v>

1218
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:09.580
<v Speaker 4>They find a gUy I actually reSpect now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to beat them up a little.</v>

1219
00:59:09.581 --> 00:59:10.630
<v Speaker 4>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ronald krauss,</v>

1220
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:11.920
<v Speaker 4>md in berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>

1221
00:59:11.921 --> 00:59:16.750
<v Speaker 4>right by him runs it a liquid center.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's had beef funding for 10 years.</v>

1222
00:59:16.751 --> 00:59:21.751
<v Speaker 4>He said dairy funding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden he's speaking to dairy </v>

1223
00:59:21.751 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 4>industries all over in 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two years later,</v>

1224
00:59:22.221 --> 00:59:24.560
<v Speaker 4>he publishes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we call it a meta analysis.</v>

1225
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:29.210
<v Speaker 4>That's not new research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's statistical playing with previous</v>

1226
00:59:29.211 --> 00:59:31.040
<v Speaker 4>studies that can be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be unfair,</v>

1227
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:32.270
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is,</v>

1228
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:37.271
<v Speaker 4>their conclusion is they could not find </v>
<v Speaker 4>and verify that saturated fat in the </v>

1229
00:59:37.271 --> 00:59:37.310
<v Speaker 4>diet.</v>

1230
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eggs and cheese raises the risk of heart</v>

1231
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:41.270
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they never said eat butter,</v>

1232
00:59:41.271 --> 00:59:46.271
<v Speaker 4>eggs and cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just couldn't verify what's </v>

1233
00:59:46.271 --> 00:59:48.761
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an american journal of clinical </v>

1234
00:59:48.761 --> 00:59:48.761
<v Speaker 4>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That same journal is a,</v>

1235
00:59:48.761 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 4>is a editorial that destroys the study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is 15 reasons.</v>

1236
00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:57.161
<v Speaker 4>This is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Epidemiology by guy named jeremiah </v>

1237
00:59:57.161 --> 00:59:59.921
<v Speaker 4>stamler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen a medical journal </v>

1238
00:59:59.921 --> 01:00:00.110
<v Speaker 4>destroy a piece that they accepted for </v>
<v Speaker 4>publication.</v>

1239
01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.560
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so everything's like stirred up and </v>

1240
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.590
<v Speaker 4>2014,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy named chowdry publishes a similar </v>

1241
01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.801
<v Speaker 4>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the reason that time magazine </v>

1242
01:00:11.801 --> 01:00:13.390
<v Speaker 4>put on the cover butter is back because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was not new research.</v>

1243
01:00:13.391 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a meta analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all following this Mexico city,</v>

1244
01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:21.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>effort to a fund dairy positive </v>

1245
01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:26.291
<v Speaker 4>publications,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a study so bad that both the journal </v>

1246
01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:28.460
<v Speaker 4>required them to adjust and republish </v>
<v Speaker 4>the data because of mistakes.</v>

1247
01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.080
<v Speaker 4>The harvard school of public health </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1248
01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.160
<v Speaker 4>take this thing away.</v>

1249
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 4>statistically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is nonsense.</v>

1250
01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:35.840
<v Speaker 4>Since those two times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's just the bottom line,</v>

1251
01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:41.010
<v Speaker 4>we have had confusion in the public.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got experts like chris experts </v>

1252
01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:42.080
<v Speaker 4>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>experts like dr mark hyman,</v>

1253
01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.480
<v Speaker 4>experts like Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Walter willett audit on.</v>

1254
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:48.890
<v Speaker 4>There is a quote from the tobacco </v>
<v Speaker 4>industry that our product is confusion.</v>

1255
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.830
<v Speaker 4>They didn't care about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1256
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:55.870
<v Speaker 4>winning the battle when the is confused </v>
<v Speaker 4>or just going to keep on doing habits </v>

1257
01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:58.961
<v Speaker 4>they haVe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that has got to stop because now </v>

1258
01:00:58.961 --> 01:01:00.821
<v Speaker 4>we're in the weeds with conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 4>theories to saturate so that when the </v>

1259
01:01:01.311 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 4>pendulum of 1950,</v>
<v Speaker 4>19,</v>

1260
01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:04.280
<v Speaker 4>69,</v>
<v Speaker 4>19,</v>

1261
01:01:04.281 --> 01:01:09.281
<v Speaker 4>97,</v>
<v Speaker 4>395 of the best done studies in the </v>

1262
01:01:09.281 --> 01:01:09.281
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say you eat more saturated fat,</v>

1263
01:01:09.281 --> 01:01:11.180
<v Speaker 4>your cholesterol goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more saturated fat,</v>

1264
01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:13.330
<v Speaker 4>coronary heart disease goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was clear,</v>

1265
01:01:13.331 --> 01:01:16.100
<v Speaker 4>crystal clear in the guidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>set the guidelines.</v>

1266
01:01:16.101 --> 01:01:19.520
<v Speaker 4>Still say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guidelines still say limits what the</v>

1267
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:24.440
<v Speaker 4>same science from the 19 fifties in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>19 forties is applicable today.</v>

1268
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.000
<v Speaker 4>If it's in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>valid there.</v>

1269
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.890
<v Speaker 4>Let's point out one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two.</v>

1270
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:30.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1271
01:01:30.201 --> 01:01:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1272
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:35.150
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because just bringing this up,</v>

1273
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:36.050
<v Speaker 4>we're</v>

1274
01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:38.570
<v Speaker 5>going back to observational studies done</v>
<v Speaker 5>50,</v>

1275
01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:43.571
<v Speaker 5>60 years ago that suffer from all of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>problems that I mentioned to begin with </v>

1276
01:01:43.571 --> 01:01:45.140
<v Speaker 5>and several more that we didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>time to go into.</v>

1277
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:48.560
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have randomized controlled trialS now</v>

1278
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:53.650
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>observational studies were never meant </v>

1279
01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:57.310
<v Speaker 5>to prove a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're meant to generate a hypothesis </v>

1280
01:01:57.310 --> 01:02:00.791
<v Speaker 5>and it's true that in some cases it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not possible to do a randomized </v>

1281
01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:02.180
<v Speaker 5>controlled trial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like with cigarette smoking,</v>

1282
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:07.400
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to have the trial lasts for </v>
<v Speaker 5>so long and you'd have to isolate people</v>

1283
01:02:07.401 --> 01:02:12.401
<v Speaker 5>and award so they weren't exposed to air</v>
<v Speaker 5>pollution and other factors that can </v>

1284
01:02:12.401 --> 01:02:12.401
<v Speaker 5>affect the result.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that.</v>

1285
01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.310
<v Speaker 5>But in that case the risk was a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 5>to 3000 percent higher.</v>

1286
01:02:16.311 --> 01:02:19.350
<v Speaker 5>So there are criteria called the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bradford hill criteria,</v>

1287
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:24.351
<v Speaker 5>which yOu can use and apply to </v>
<v Speaker 5>observational studies to assess the </v>

1288
01:02:24.351 --> 01:02:25.860
<v Speaker 5>chance that there's a causal </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship,</v>

1289
01:02:25.861 --> 01:02:30.861
<v Speaker 5>and in the case of smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which actually was when the bradford </v>

1290
01:02:30.861 --> 01:02:34.070
<v Speaker 5>bradford hill criteria were created,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that really that meets many of those </v>

1291
01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:35.730
<v Speaker 5>criteria in the case of nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 5>research,</v>

1292
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:40.470
<v Speaker 5>very seldom did they meet more than a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of the bradford hill criteria.</v>

1293
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.570
<v Speaker 5>Now observational research in order to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be valuable and needs to be confirmed,</v>

1294
01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:50.660
<v Speaker 5>you know the results need to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>replicated in a randomized controlled </v>

1295
01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.240
<v Speaker 5>trial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how science is supposed to work.</v>

1296
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.720
<v Speaker 5>But there was one analysis that found </v>
<v Speaker 5>that zero of 52 claims that were made in</v>

1297
01:02:57.691 --> 01:03:02.691
<v Speaker 5>observational nutrition studies were </v>
<v Speaker 5>replicated when they were tested later </v>

1298
01:03:02.691 --> 01:03:07.250
<v Speaker 5>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five were replicated in the opposite </v>

1299
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:07.250
<v Speaker 5>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

1300
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:11.541
<v Speaker 5>they did an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They found the opposite results of what </v>

1301
01:03:11.541 --> 01:03:14.601
<v Speaker 5>the observational studies suggested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a good examples of this are </v>

1302
01:03:14.601 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 5>obserVational studies originally </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggested that beta carotene,</v>

1303
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:21.390
<v Speaker 5>an antioxidant that people with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>highest intake of beta carotene,</v>

1304
01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:24.030
<v Speaker 5>that's something like a 30 percent </v>
<v Speaker 5>reduced risk of death,</v>

1305
01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:29.031
<v Speaker 5>which is not really plausible anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then when they started doing trials </v>

1306
01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:30.660
<v Speaker 5>where they were giving people beta </v>
<v Speaker 5>carotene,</v>

1307
01:03:30.661 --> 01:03:35.661
<v Speaker 5>sUpplements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only did it not improve their </v>

1308
01:03:35.661 --> 01:03:35.661
<v Speaker 5>lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got more cancer,</v>

1309
01:03:35.661 --> 01:03:36.360
<v Speaker 5>it increased the risK of cancer.</v>

1310
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:41.690
<v Speaker 5>So this is why it's so important not to </v>
<v Speaker 5>rely just on observational data and to </v>

1311
01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 5>do these experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now going back to saturated fat,</v>

1312
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:49.220
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got a 2013 meta analysis of </v>

1313
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.910
<v Speaker 5>randomized controlled trials that found </v>
<v Speaker 5>that low carb,</v>

1314
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:55.911
<v Speaker 5>high protein diets lead to greater </v>
<v Speaker 5>improvements in glycaemic control </v>

1315
01:03:55.911 --> 01:03:56.880
<v Speaker 5>compared to low fat american heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>association,</v>

1316
01:03:56.881 --> 01:04:01.881
<v Speaker 5>american diabetic association diets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got a 2014 meta analysis of </v>

1317
01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:07.730
<v Speaker 5>randomized controlled trials that showed</v>
<v Speaker 5>that low carb diets are more effective </v>

1318
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:09.090
<v Speaker 5>than high carb diets for patients with </v>
<v Speaker 5>type two diabetes.</v>

1319
01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:14.450
<v Speaker 5>And we've got another meta analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 5>25 randomized controlled trials just </v>

1320
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.830
<v Speaker 5>published in 2018 that found the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1321
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.680
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>science marches on,</v>

1322
01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.330
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1323
01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.360
<v Speaker 5>we learn more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we change and now we've got randomized </v>

1324
01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.981
<v Speaker 5>controlled trials that are replacing </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the observational evidence from </v>

1325
01:04:27.981 --> 01:04:28.860
<v Speaker 5>the fifties and sixties and seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

1326
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:32.160
<v Speaker 5>which by the way in and dr hark homes </v>
<v Speaker 5>paper,</v>

1327
01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:36.330
<v Speaker 5>you see that that evidence was never </v>
<v Speaker 5>strong to begin with and this is what we</v>

1328
01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:37.200
<v Speaker 5>should be looking at.</v>

1329
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:40.810
<v Speaker 2>So why are you consistently bringing up </v>
<v Speaker 2>these studies for fifties?</v>

1330
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Because chris has mixing everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking low carb data.</v>

1331
01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:49.141
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk low carb diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kito diet low carb you,</v>

1332
01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:52.600
<v Speaker 2>you consistently bring up these studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the 19 fifties.</v>

1333
01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:55.240
<v Speaker 2>The 19 sixties diets are high in </v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat.</v>

1334
01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 50,</v>

1335
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:59.950
<v Speaker 2>96 was the initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 97.</v>

1336
01:04:59.951 --> 01:05:04.951
<v Speaker 2>Clark 395 randomized clinical trials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What chris looking for in metabolic </v>

1337
01:05:04.951 --> 01:05:09.391
<v Speaker 2>ward?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say you jack up the saturated fat in </v>

1338
01:05:09.391 --> 01:05:09.391
<v Speaker 2>your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You jack up your cholesterol.</v>

1339
01:05:09.391 --> 01:05:09.850
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about cholesterol in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>

1340
01:05:09.851 --> 01:05:12.260
<v Speaker 2>but cholesterol matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ldl cholesterol matters in higher ed.</v>

1341
01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Ask asking a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say 395 randomized controlled trials</v>

1342
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>in 1997.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clark 1,907,</v>

1343
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.200
<v Speaker 4>$395.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Met him off.</v>

1344
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:21.790
<v Speaker 4>I'd love to see that different metabolic</v>
<v Speaker 4>wards day.</v>

1345
01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I can show you here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right here.</v>

1346
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:25.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you the rest of americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ninety five.</v>

1347
01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:30.210
<v Speaker 4>He viewed 395,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a randomized controlled trials in a meta</v>

1348
01:05:30.971 --> 01:05:35.230
<v Speaker 4>analysis in metabolic ward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tightest dietary exchange studies,</v>

1349
01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:37.150
<v Speaker 4>the best sandwich would a metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it is,</v>

1350
01:05:37.151 --> 01:05:40.480
<v Speaker 4>but I don't understand the three 95.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how many were there.</v>

1351
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.230
<v Speaker 4>Five people now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three hundred 95 individual studies that</v>

1352
01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:49.231
<v Speaker 4>played with fat content had died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked at markers of cardiovascular </v>

1353
01:05:49.231 --> 01:05:52.750
<v Speaker 4>risks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>395 metabolic ward studies that were </v>

1354
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:56.911
<v Speaker 4>randomized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>randomized controlled trials in </v>

1355
01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:56.911
<v Speaker 4>metabolic wards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1356
01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:57.250
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be short term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

1357
01:05:57.790 --> 01:05:59.170
<v Speaker 4>You've got to read the literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's there.</v>

1358
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.200
<v Speaker 4>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read the literature while you </v>

1359
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:04.200
<v Speaker 4>missed that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty important.</v>

1360
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:04.200
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's go back,</v>

1361
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.830
<v Speaker 4>but hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a dispute here,</v>

1362
01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:07.230
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what is your issue with.</v>

1363
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:09.110
<v Speaker 4>I'll just give you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's no big deal.</v>

1364
01:06:09.111 --> 01:06:12.070
<v Speaker 4>I'll give chris what is your issue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not aware of 300.</v>

1365
01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:17.110
<v Speaker 4>90 five randomized controlled trials </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have been done in a metabolic ward </v>

1366
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:21.511
<v Speaker 4>on this question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'd love to learn more about that if </v>

1367
01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:21.511
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One second.</v>

1368
01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:25.471
<v Speaker 4>It's clark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so I mean I'm not stuck in the 19 </v>

1369
01:06:25.471 --> 01:06:25.471
<v Speaker 4>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1370
01:06:25.471 --> 01:06:26.110
<v Speaker 4>if you don't agree,</v>

1371
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.780
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that science has moved far past that and</v>

1372
01:06:28.781 --> 01:06:33.781
<v Speaker 1>our understanding of nutrition and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the mechanisms of the </v>

1373
01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:36.640
<v Speaker 1>effect of the food and the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that has changed radically</v>

1374
01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:41.460
<v Speaker 4>are we have not changed our flipcharts </v>
<v Speaker 4>exchange,</v>

1375
01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:47.110
<v Speaker 4>but that's not what I asked you as our </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of the science change as </v>

1376
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:52.620
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually I would say that the </v>

1377
01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:52.620
<v Speaker 4>observations made in the fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sixties if I held up,</v>

1378
01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:57.300
<v Speaker 4>which is why 21 international societies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll say you will have held up that </v>

1379
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.030
<v Speaker 4>low saturated fat in the diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chicken,</v>

1380
01:07:01.031 --> 01:07:01.780
<v Speaker 4>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheese,</v>

1381
01:07:01.781 --> 01:07:04.960
<v Speaker 4>beef is related to raising your </v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol is related to your increased</v>

1382
01:07:04.961 --> 01:07:06.430
<v Speaker 4>risk of heart attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strokes,</v>

1383
01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:07.650
<v Speaker 1>19 fifties,</v>

1384
01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:12.700
<v Speaker 4>initial initial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we got randomized clinical trials.</v>

1385
01:07:12.701 --> 01:07:15.310
<v Speaker 4>Those are called metabolic ward studies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and such.</v>

1386
01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:18.520
<v Speaker 4>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first chink in the,</v>

1387
01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.570
<v Speaker 4>in the armor was a 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave you the background to it,</v>

1388
01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.120
<v Speaker 4>the siri torino study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the [inaudible] study,</v>

1389
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:30.300
<v Speaker 4>but they have been resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've decided to throw out 50 years of </v>

1390
01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.820
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just mentioned several other med </v>

1391
01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.761
<v Speaker 4>analyses of I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably a 50 randomized controlled </v>

1392
01:07:35.761 --> 01:07:37.440
<v Speaker 4>trials collectively here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and these are</v>

1393
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:39.450
<v Speaker 1>modern studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So joel,</v>

1394
01:07:39.451 --> 01:07:41.400
<v Speaker 1>what is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

1395
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:46.430
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think that these old studies </v>

1396
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:47.760
<v Speaker 1>are applicable and why you dismissing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this new evidence?</v>

1397
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.080
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I just,</v>

1398
01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.990
<v Speaker 4>just so chris and I can resolve this </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>

1399
01:07:51.991 --> 01:07:56.030
<v Speaker 4>British medical journal in 1997,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dietary lipids and blood cholesterol.</v>

1400
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:59.760
<v Speaker 4>Three hundred 95 individual dietary </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

1401
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:02.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put together in a med analysis.</v>

1402
01:08:02.221 --> 01:08:07.221
<v Speaker 4>It's a classic study that people know </v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually estimated if we could </v>

1403
01:08:07.221 --> 01:08:10.821
<v Speaker 4>lower the saturated fat content of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>british population by 60 percent and we </v>

1404
01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:12.660
<v Speaker 4>would save x number of heart attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What year?</v>

1405
01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.910
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen 97.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen 97.</v>

1406
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:19.100
<v Speaker 4>So to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do I think old studies are relevant?</v>

1407
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:22.160
<v Speaker 4>You have to keep probing and questioning</v>
<v Speaker 4>and probing and questioning.</v>

1408
01:08:22.161 --> 01:08:25.760
<v Speaker 4>But until this date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every major medical society,</v>

1409
01:08:25.761 --> 01:08:27.860
<v Speaker 4>not one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there'S one you'd question at 21,</v>

1410
01:08:27.861 --> 01:08:31.580
<v Speaker 4>international sizes say you will further</v>
<v Speaker 4>the populace health.</v>

1411
01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.640
<v Speaker 4>If you lower saturated fat in the diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we can't pinpoint the amount of </v>

1412
01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol you should lower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is only from animal sources,</v>

1413
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:40.640
<v Speaker 4>but you should lower it to as low as </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

1414
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.860
<v Speaker 4>According to the usda epidemiology </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies,</v>

1415
01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.460
<v Speaker 4>this was randomized data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's random.</v>

1416
01:08:46.461 --> 01:08:49.130
<v Speaker 4>It's based on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the guidelines have changed,</v>

1417
01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:49.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

1418
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:55.030
<v Speaker 4>as we said in 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the new evidence,</v>

1419
01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:00.280
<v Speaker 4>there's new evidence is the new science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whatever they've studied today,</v>

1420
01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.710
<v Speaker 4>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the better methods of detection,</v>

1421
01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.950
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more understanding,</v>

1422
01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:10.970
<v Speaker 4>more data to go from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't you agree that we should look </v>

1423
01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:11.780
<v Speaker 4>at new studies?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should,</v>

1424
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:14.540
<v Speaker 4>let me tell you say so wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me tell you,</v>

1425
01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:18.440
<v Speaker 4>when I published a study in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when quoted 100,000</v>

1426
01:09:18.441 --> 01:09:23.441
<v Speaker 4>times for a major medical journal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It uses something called men delian </v>

1427
01:09:23.441 --> 01:09:27.071
<v Speaker 4>randomization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't need to do randomized clinical </v>

1428
01:09:27.071 --> 01:09:29.681
<v Speaker 4>trials all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are these gigantic databases now </v>

1429
01:09:29.681 --> 01:09:30.440
<v Speaker 4>about genetic abnormalities and certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>other parameters.</v>

1430
01:09:30.441 --> 01:09:32.810
<v Speaker 4>So there is a database with 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1431
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.150
<v Speaker 4>We know what's called their snips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've probably heard of snips,</v>

1432
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:38.210
<v Speaker 4>you know chris is biology and jeans </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't the same as mine,</v>

1433
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:43.211
<v Speaker 4>and there's variability if you're born </v>
<v Speaker 4>with one of nine snips that keeps your </v>

1434
01:09:43.371 --> 01:09:45.170
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol low your entire life.</v>

1435
01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:50.170
<v Speaker 4>This is a genetic gift to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The observation in this major study </v>

1436
01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:52.430
<v Speaker 4>quarter all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first author is brian ferentz,</v>

1437
01:09:52.431 --> 01:09:53.540
<v Speaker 4>but I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number five,</v>

1438
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:58.870
<v Speaker 4>ldl randomization is new data that it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>an advantage for your survival and </v>

1439
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:59.670
<v Speaker 4>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your risk of heart attack,</v>

1440
01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.790
<v Speaker 4>stroke to have a low ldl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your whole life.</v>

1441
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:06.970
<v Speaker 4>New data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it consistent with 60 years of </v>

1442
01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:06.970
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but boom,</v>

1443
01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:10.600
<v Speaker 4>it sure was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We actually have learned stuff that has </v>

1444
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.890
<v Speaker 4>changed our mind when you do that same </v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting edge science on hdl,</v>

1445
01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:14.330
<v Speaker 4>the happy one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the high one.</v>

1446
01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.730
<v Speaker 4>You cannot show the same association </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1447
01:10:16.731 --> 01:10:21.731
<v Speaker 4>We're totally confused by the hdl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Particle ldl is the focus of </v>

1448
01:10:21.731 --> 01:10:25.700
<v Speaker 4>atherosclerosis low ldl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll just finish dr loren cordain.</v>

1449
01:10:25.701 --> 01:10:27.500
<v Speaker 4>I'd love to talk about the history of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the paleo movement.</v>

1450
01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.900
<v Speaker 4>Dr loren cordain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who at the first popular book,</v>

1451
01:10:29.901 --> 01:10:34.160
<v Speaker 4>a phd in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has written an article in 2004.</v>

1452
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.160
<v Speaker 4>It says the ideal ldl cholesterol is 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>to 70.</v>

1453
01:10:37.161 --> 01:10:42.161
<v Speaker 4>Well man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he should be a cardiologist because I'm </v>

1454
01:10:42.161 --> 01:10:44.141
<v Speaker 4>going to hug them for that because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought that saturated fat raises your </v>

1455
01:10:44.141 --> 01:10:47.651
<v Speaker 4>blood cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>increases your risk of heart attack and </v>

1456
01:10:47.651 --> 01:10:47.651
<v Speaker 4>stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the founding pillars.</v>

1457
01:10:47.651 --> 01:10:49.820
<v Speaker 4>This 2004 and a big isn't a medical </v>
<v Speaker 4>journal.</v>

1458
01:10:49.821 --> 01:10:52.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is peer reviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an editorial,</v>

1459
01:10:52.401 --> 01:10:57.401
<v Speaker 4>but it's peer review of 50 to 70 ldl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really cool there with loren cordain</v>

1460
01:10:57.501 --> 01:11:02.501
<v Speaker 4>and 50 to 78,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but our understanding of nutrition is </v>

1461
01:11:02.501 --> 01:11:04.350
<v Speaker 4>advanced pretty radically since I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1462
01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.640
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not here to represent paleo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1463
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.310
<v Speaker 4>I never been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1464
01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideological about paleo.</v>

1465
01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 4>Even if you read my first book,</v>

1466
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm recommending dairy products,</v>

1467
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:19.020
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to get lost in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you pause for a second.</v>

1468
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:23.800
<v Speaker 1>So what is your response though to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these studies that he was citing?</v>

1469
01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:28.020
<v Speaker 1>You're citing these old studies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to contradict what he saying,</v>

1470
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 1>but these new studies that he showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could,</v>

1471
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:33.840
<v Speaker 1>we can go over them again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't address.</v>

1472
01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 1>You did</v>

1473
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.820
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't say saying them by name.</v>

1474
01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:46.530
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are the results so different than </v>

1475
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:46.530
<v Speaker 1>the new studies?</v>

1476
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:48.070
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well people better at statistics than me</v>

1477
01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.750
<v Speaker 5>with say manipulation of what's called </v>
<v Speaker 5>meta analysis.</v>

1478
01:11:50.751 --> 01:11:55.751
<v Speaker 5>These aren't new studies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean these are old studies lumped </v>

1479
01:11:55.751 --> 01:11:57.700
<v Speaker 5>together with different analyses that </v>
<v Speaker 5>led to a conclusion that was accurate.</v>

1480
01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:03.140
<v Speaker 5>These are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are randomized controlled trials </v>

1481
01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.520
<v Speaker 5>that are long term.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's 20 years,</v>

1482
01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:05.780
<v Speaker 5>30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>40 years.</v>

1483
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:11.070
<v Speaker 5>There is no such show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course they're not doing 20 or 30 or </v>

1484
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.780
<v Speaker 5>40 year randomized controlled trial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have fish.</v>

1485
01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:16.640
<v Speaker 5>We have 50 year data on seven I'll study</v>
<v Speaker 5>of 50 years.</v>

1486
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.310
<v Speaker 5>Problem</v>

1487
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.960
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again we've already outlined is a big </v>

1488
01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.060
<v Speaker 1>difference between epidemiology studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and randomized trial.</v>

1489
01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:29.680
<v Speaker 5>Randomized controlled trials are not </v>
<v Speaker 5>short term.</v>

1490
01:12:29.681 --> 01:12:32.590
<v Speaker 5>Many of them are go up to two years in </v>
<v Speaker 5>length.</v>

1491
01:12:32.591 --> 01:12:37.591
<v Speaker 5>If we're going to see changes in lipids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to see them within a few </v>

1492
01:12:37.591 --> 01:12:41.520
<v Speaker 5>weeks and certainly within a few months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if we're not seeing them in a few </v>

1493
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.100
<v Speaker 5>months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to see them later.</v>

1494
01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:45.280
<v Speaker 5>And you know the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at dr.</v>

1495
01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:49.630
<v Speaker 5>Hark homes paper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she reviews all of the the meta analyses</v>

1496
01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:53.740
<v Speaker 5>and looking at saturated fat and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection with heart disease.</v>

1497
01:12:53.741 --> 01:12:58.741
<v Speaker 5>There are 39 med analyses of rcts or </v>
<v Speaker 5>prospective cohort studies that looked </v>

1498
01:12:59.411 --> 01:13:04.411
<v Speaker 5>at saturated fat and health outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thirty five of 39 did not show </v>

1499
01:13:04.411 --> 01:13:06.310
<v Speaker 5>significant correlations between </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat and any outcome.</v>

1500
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:11.470
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thirty five of 39 of the four that did </v>

1501
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.990
<v Speaker 5>one was more related to trans fats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not saturated fats.</v>

1502
01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:18.220
<v Speaker 5>OnE showed a benefit of replacing </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat,</v>

1503
01:13:18.221 --> 01:13:21.280
<v Speaker 5>but it excluded twO studies that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>have totally changed the result.</v>

1504
01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:26.340
<v Speaker 5>And as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the med analysis of 25 rcts and </v>

1505
01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:30.421
<v Speaker 5>40 observational studies that showed no </v>
<v Speaker 5>benefit of replacing saturated fat with </v>

1506
01:13:30.421 --> 01:13:34.261
<v Speaker 5>polyunsaturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the last two were cochrane </v>

1507
01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:34.261
<v Speaker 5>reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in those two,</v>

1508
01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.300
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat and cardiovascular disease</v>
<v Speaker 5>were correlated,</v>

1509
01:13:37.301 --> 01:13:40.270
<v Speaker 5>but saturated fat was not correlated </v>
<v Speaker 5>with total mortality,</v>

1510
01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:43.900
<v Speaker 5>cardiovascular disease mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a fatal heart attack,</v>

1511
01:13:43.901 --> 01:13:48.901
<v Speaker 5>nonfatal heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stroke or a heart death from heart </v>

1512
01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:52.060
<v Speaker 5>disease or death from any diagnoses of </v>
<v Speaker 5>diabetes.</v>

1513
01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:57.090
<v Speaker 5>So joel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to let you get you had out of </v>

1514
01:13:57.090 --> 01:14:00.541
<v Speaker 5>those 39 trials,</v>
<v Speaker 5>virtually none showed that eating </v>

1515
01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:04.351
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat will increase your risk of</v>
<v Speaker 5>heart disease and none showed that it </v>

1516
01:14:04.351 --> 01:14:06.250
<v Speaker 5>will increase your risk of death from </v>
<v Speaker 5>any cause.</v>

1517
01:14:06.251 --> 01:14:08.050
<v Speaker 5>So that is pretty damning evidence.</v>

1518
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could summarize for you or get you </v>

1519
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:15.561
<v Speaker 1>to summarize your position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that his reciting of these older </v>

1520
01:14:15.561 --> 01:14:18.780
<v Speaker 1>studies that they are not relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are epidemiologists,</v>

1521
01:14:18.781 --> 01:14:23.781
<v Speaker 1>study that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not as rigorous and that this </v>

1522
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:29.431
<v Speaker 1>new evidence is based on a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding and new science and that </v>

1523
01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:29.431
<v Speaker 1>he's ignoring this.</v>

1524
01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:34.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the early studies showed some </v>

1525
01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:34.050
<v Speaker 5>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were short,</v>

1526
01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:36.850
<v Speaker 5>very short term between eating saturated</v>
<v Speaker 5>fat and then and then cholesterol.</v>

1527
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 5>The other problem is they were using </v>
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol as a proxy marker.</v>

1528
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.410
<v Speaker 5>They weren't looking at did people eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat and die more?</v>

1529
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.470
<v Speaker 5>They'd looked at did saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inCreased cholesterol.</v>

1530
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:49.920
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so when they,</v>

1531
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:54.990
<v Speaker 5>when they did longer term studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no increase in cholesterol on </v>

1532
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:55.930
<v Speaker 5>average.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doeSn't mean no one will experience</v>

1533
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:57.310
<v Speaker 5>an increase.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not true.</v>

1534
01:14:57.311 --> 01:15:01.030
<v Speaker 5>Some people will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on average there was no increase in.</v>

1535
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:04.750
<v Speaker 5>And then when they looked at they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>took cholesterol out of the equation.</v>

1536
01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:09.751
<v Speaker 5>Let's just look at is there an increase </v>
<v Speaker 5>in heart attacks or death from eating </v>

1537
01:15:09.751 --> 01:15:12.240
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat when they did that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no increase in [inaudible].</v>

1538
01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:17.260
<v Speaker 5>These are that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are observational studies and we </v>

1539
01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:18.150
<v Speaker 5>have all these randomized controlled </v>
<v Speaker 5>trials that are showing no,</v>

1540
01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:23.180
<v Speaker 5>no increase in cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no increase in insulin levels and </v>

1541
01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.600
<v Speaker 5>actually a decrease in all of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>markers.</v>

1542
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:26.470
<v Speaker 5>Joel,</v>

1543
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:29.480
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>important stuff.</v>

1544
01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.930
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of stuff was said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I doubt it,</v>

1545
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:34.130
<v Speaker 4>unless you're really high level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you understood.</v>

1546
01:15:34.131 --> 01:15:35.900
<v Speaker 4>I just want to pick out one thing chris </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1547
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:38.450
<v Speaker 4>does anybody know what the cochrane </v>
<v Speaker 4>database?</v>

1548
01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:40.740
<v Speaker 4>So where'd the flow of his mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cochran coc,</v>

1549
01:15:40.741 --> 01:15:43.910
<v Speaker 4>h r n e is a group of scientists to try </v>
<v Speaker 4>and be very objective,</v>

1550
01:15:43.911 --> 01:15:46.310
<v Speaker 4>very independent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have any emotional,</v>

1551
01:15:46.311 --> 01:15:47.840
<v Speaker 4>any books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any supplements,</v>

1552
01:15:47.841 --> 01:15:49.010
<v Speaker 4>any food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and nothing,</v>

1553
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:51.350
<v Speaker 4>and we all love supplements around this </v>
<v Speaker 4>table,</v>

1554
01:15:51.351 --> 01:15:53.960
<v Speaker 4>but let's get out of that cochrane </v>
<v Speaker 4>database.</v>

1555
01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:59.020
<v Speaker 4>Every five years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes out with a statement that </v>

1556
01:15:59.020 --> 01:15:59.020
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat relate to the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart disease.</v>

1557
01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:03.911
<v Speaker 4>In 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most recent hooper look up hooper </v>

1558
01:16:03.911 --> 01:16:04.160
<v Speaker 4>lookup cochrane database.</v>
<v Speaker 4>YeS it does.</v>

1559
01:16:04.161 --> 01:16:05.900
<v Speaker 4>Chris said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he flew by it.</v>

1560
01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:11.140
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't powerful enough that your </v>

1561
01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:11.140
<v Speaker 4>choice of butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eggs,</v>

1562
01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:15.161
<v Speaker 4>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and cheese necessarily predicted your </v>

1563
01:16:15.161 --> 01:16:15.560
<v Speaker 4>total lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it absolutely predicted your risk of</v>

1564
01:16:15.561 --> 01:16:17.970
<v Speaker 4>developing a heart attack and stroke </v>
<v Speaker 4>according to this independent david.</v>

1565
01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:20.960
<v Speaker 4>How 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1566
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:24.830
<v Speaker 4>how does it do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturated fat in the diet lowers the ldl</v>

1567
01:16:24.831 --> 01:16:25.850
<v Speaker 4>receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gene liver.</v>

1568
01:16:25.851 --> 01:16:27.620
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk some real science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your liver,</v>

1569
01:16:27.621 --> 01:16:28.820
<v Speaker 4>my liver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris's liver.</v>

1570
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:33.970
<v Speaker 4>When you don't have ldl receptors or </v>
<v Speaker 4>less than you should on the surface of </v>

1571
01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:34.970
<v Speaker 4>your liver cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ldl stays in your blood.</v>

1572
01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:37.730
<v Speaker 4>it gets into your arterial wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my field.</v>

1573
01:16:37.731 --> 01:16:39.410
<v Speaker 4>Don't jack with manner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tara walls.</v>

1574
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:44.590
<v Speaker 4>It gets picked up by monocytes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>macrophages become foamy cells and you </v>

1575
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:45.680
<v Speaker 4>fucking dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's how it starts.</v>

1576
01:16:45.681 --> 01:16:50.681
<v Speaker 4>When you eat saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a chain of events that </v>

1577
01:16:50.681 --> 01:16:50.690
<v Speaker 4>biologists and chemists and scientists </v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

1578

<v Speaker 4>There's no question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen 85 nobel prize in medicine.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Nobody would not go to the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again.</v>

1580
01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:00.200
<v Speaker 4>When you go to these studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just want you to refute,</v>

1581
01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:03.500
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2012,</v>

1582
01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:06.890
<v Speaker 4>I published a study which one of us is </v>
<v Speaker 4>as scientists around the table.</v>

1583
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.390
<v Speaker 4>I've got it open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a journal,</v>

01:17:08.391 --> 01:17:11.000
<v Speaker 4>american kind of high energy may please </v>
<v Speaker 4>read the conclusion,</v>

1585
01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:14.150
<v Speaker 4>the lower your ldl level beginning in </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

1586
01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:19.151
<v Speaker 4>the greater issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reduction in your risk of developing a </v>

1587
01:17:19.151 --> 01:17:21.551
<v Speaker 4>heart attack and stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll give you an interesting </v>

1588
01:17:21.551 --> 01:17:24.131
<v Speaker 4>statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you take lipitor and you drop your </v>

1589
01:17:24.131 --> 01:17:27.341
<v Speaker 4>ldl cholesterol 30 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will typically drop your risk of a </v>

1590
01:17:27.341 --> 01:17:31.211
<v Speaker 4>heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're in the coronary range by 30 </v>

1592
01:17:33.761 --> 01:17:36.971
<v Speaker 4>because you're born with a genetic gift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's just a lower than the average </v>

1593
01:17:36.971 --> 01:17:38.030
<v Speaker 4>american,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you drop your risk of heart attack by 90</v>

1594

<v Speaker 4>stroke risk.</v>

1598
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.930
<v Speaker 4>The problem was they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We pick up people at age 50,</v>

1599
01:17:47.931 --> 01:17:52.931
<v Speaker 4>60 and we start jaclyn with her diet and</v>
<v Speaker 4>jacket with their drugs and that's </v>

1600
01:17:52.931 --> 01:17:52.931
<v Speaker 4>wonderful.</v>

1601
01:17:52.931 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 4>They've had 50,</v>
<v Speaker 4>60 years of deteriorating their arteries</v>

1602
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:59.201
<v Speaker 4>and we help them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't help them like teaching </v>

1603
01:17:59.201 --> 01:17:59.570
<v Speaker 4>children eat fruits and vegetables and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stay away from hot dogs.</v>

1604
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.600
<v Speaker 4>That's where we got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the second gong to get kids </v>

1605
01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:04.790
<v Speaker 4>healthy because they got their whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1606
01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.880
<v Speaker 4>Please,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is wrong with what he said?</v>

1607
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's.</v>

1608
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.420
<v Speaker 4>There's illusions to what's the number </v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1609
01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.710
<v Speaker 4>two things wrong and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1610
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm really not trying to nitpick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't like epidemiology,</v>

1611
01:18:15.981 --> 01:18:18.800
<v Speaker 4>but he totally uses epidemiology to </v>
<v Speaker 4>support his case.</v>

1612
01:18:18.801 --> 01:18:21.620
<v Speaker 4>You can't have it both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love basic biochemistry.</v>

1613
01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:24.020
<v Speaker 4>I love epidemiologists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love randomized studies,</v>

1614
01:18:24.021 --> 01:18:29.021
<v Speaker 4>I love sitting there and in studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my foundation is broad and it's what's </v>

1615
01:18:29.021 --> 01:18:30.560
<v Speaker 4>called the scientific method that's used</v>
<v Speaker 4>by scientists and los angeles,</v>

1616
01:18:30.561 --> 01:18:33.340
<v Speaker 4>and that's taught me a number two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1617
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:34.300
<v Speaker 4>besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1618
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:39.350
<v Speaker 4>there's illusions to significant </v>
<v Speaker 4>randomized clinical trials in meta </v>

1619
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:43.811
<v Speaker 4>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to keep the science clean as can </v>

1620
01:18:43.811 --> 01:18:46.571
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A breakthrough has been the meta </v>

1621
01:18:46.571 --> 01:18:47.900
<v Speaker 4>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Siri torino chowdry 2010,</v>

1622
01:18:47.901 --> 01:18:50.150
<v Speaker 4>2014 d'souza,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand 15.</v>

1623
01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.940
<v Speaker 4>They haVe severe flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not new research.</v>

1624
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:56.540
<v Speaker 4>They're rehashing old data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There has not been a randomized clinical</v>

1625
01:18:56.541 --> 01:19:01.541
<v Speaker 4>trial that really challenges the </v>
<v Speaker 4>coronary heart disease risk or meaning </v>

1626
01:19:01.541 --> 01:19:02.630
<v Speaker 4>and increased saturated fat that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>three right now.</v>

1627
01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 4>So long are they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

1628
01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:07.390
<v Speaker 5>There is american journal of clinical </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrition,</v>

1629
01:19:07.391 --> 01:19:10.870

<v Speaker 5>I'm a judge or holla.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure how to pronounce the name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are all on my website.</v>

1631

<v Speaker 5>If you go to [inaudible] dot com slash </v>
<v Speaker 5>research,</v>

1632
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:21.610
<v Speaker 5>you can see them or crestor.com/rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you scroll down to the saturated fat</v>

1633
01:19:21.611 --> 01:19:22.690
<v Speaker 5>section.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can see them.</v>

1634
01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.720
<v Speaker 5>This is a total of 20 randomized </v>
<v Speaker 5>controlled trials and the results low </v>

1635
01:19:27.911 --> 01:19:29.350
<v Speaker 5>carb load,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gi,</v>

1636
01:19:29.351 --> 01:19:34.351
<v Speaker 5>mediterranean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and high protein diets are effective in </v>

1637
01:19:34.351 --> 01:19:37.081
<v Speaker 5>improving various markers of </v>
<v Speaker 5>cardiovascular risk and people with </v>

1638
01:19:37.081 --> 01:19:39.310
<v Speaker 5>diabetes should be considered the </v>
<v Speaker 5>overall strategy of diabetes management.</v>

1639
01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:44.050
<v Speaker 5>And then we've got a one from a snore </v>
<v Speaker 5>guard,</v>

1640
01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:49.580
<v Speaker 5>systematic review and meta analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 5>dietary carbohydrate restriction in </v>

1641
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:53.761
<v Speaker 5>patients witH type two diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this was a review of 10 rcts and </v>

1642
01:19:54.101 --> 01:19:59.101
<v Speaker 5>they found not only was the low carb </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet more effective for diabetes than </v>

1643
01:19:59.101 --> 01:20:03.910
<v Speaker 5>the low fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the greater the carbohydrate </v>

1644
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.910
<v Speaker 5>restriction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the greater the effect.</v>

1645
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:08.730
<v Speaker 5>And then we have one from 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is sainsbury at all and this is </v>

1646
01:20:09.661 --> 01:20:14.661
<v Speaker 5>effective dietary carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 5>restriction on glycemic control in </v>

1647
01:20:14.661 --> 01:20:17.811
<v Speaker 5>adults with diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they found that the low carb,</v>

1648
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:19.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the conclusion,</v>

1649
01:20:19.951 --> 01:20:24.951
<v Speaker 5>this review suggests that low carb </v>
<v Speaker 5>restricted or carbohydrate restricted </v>

1650
01:20:24.951 --> 01:20:28.251
<v Speaker 5>diets could be offered to people livinG </v>
<v Speaker 5>with diabetes as part of an </v>

1651
01:20:28.251 --> 01:20:30.170
<v Speaker 5>individualized management plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these are finding that these,</v>

1652
01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:31.640
<v Speaker 5>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1653
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:36.680
<v Speaker 5>reviews of several randomized controlled</v>
<v Speaker 5>trials that are finding that there's no </v>

1654
01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:40.941
<v Speaker 5>increase in cardiovascular risk markers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's actually an improvement in </v>

1655
01:20:40.941 --> 01:20:44.841
<v Speaker 5>cardio vascular risk markers and there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>an improvement in diabetes markers like </v>

1656
01:20:44.841 --> 01:20:46.920
<v Speaker 5>blood sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>insulin weight,</v>

1657
01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:48.900
<v Speaker 5>visceral fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

1658
01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:50.930
<v Speaker 5>So I mean this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1659
01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:56.040
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the gold standard of evidence that we </v>

1660
01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.360
<v Speaker 5>have is randomized controlled trials and</v>
<v Speaker 5>meta analyses.</v>

1661
01:20:57.361 --> 01:20:58.750
<v Speaker 5>Of course they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're,</v>

1662
01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.320
<v Speaker 5>there are problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can be done poorly.</v>

1663
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:06.320
<v Speaker 5>They can be done well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true of any kInd of scientific </v>

1664
01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.541
<v Speaker 5>research,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we can't throw out really the </v>

1665
01:21:08.541 --> 01:21:10.410
<v Speaker 5>highest standard of evidence is a meta </v>
<v Speaker 5>analysis of randomized controlled trials</v>

1666
01:21:10.411 --> 01:21:15.411
<v Speaker 5>because you can just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyone can pick one randomized </v>

1667
01:21:15.411 --> 01:21:18.201
<v Speaker 5>controlled trial to support their view.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The met analysis does is it looks at all</v>

1668
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:23.010
<v Speaker 5>of the evidence and it looks at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>quality of evidence and then it comes up</v>

1669
01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.570
<v Speaker 5>with a result from looking at all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these trials and that's,</v>

1670
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:31.590
<v Speaker 5>that's where science is today and these </v>
<v Speaker 5>low carb diets are high in saturated </v>

1671
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.890
<v Speaker 5>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are high in saturated fat.</v>

1672
01:21:32.010 --> 01:21:37.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless they're explicitly doing a trial </v>

1673
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:39.621
<v Speaker 5>where they're doing a low carb diet </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the tire and mono unsaturated </v>

1674
01:21:39.621 --> 01:21:39.621
<v Speaker 5>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but those are rare.</v>

1675
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.970
<v Speaker 5>Generally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are reading low carb diets or</v>

1676
01:21:41.971 --> 01:21:44.100
<v Speaker 5>eating a lot more saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joel,</v>

1677
01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:45.810
<v Speaker 4>just three quick bullet points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number one,</v>

1678
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:48.760
<v Speaker 4>it is low carb literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking saturated fat and coronary</v>

1679
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.130
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a mixture.</v>

1680
01:21:50.131 --> 01:21:52.080
<v Speaker 4>It's not the topic we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number two,</v>

1681
01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:54.540
<v Speaker 4>these are buying at the top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about low carbs,</v>

1682
01:21:54.541 --> 01:21:58.760
<v Speaker 4>a whole different nutritional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's that.</v>

1683
01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.170
<v Speaker 4>We haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what he said.</v>

1684
01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:01.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1685
01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:05.130
<v Speaker 4>you can do low carbon jack up protein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most of the experts say,</v>

1686
01:22:05.131 --> 01:22:06.360
<v Speaker 4>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's called meat.</v>

1687
01:22:06.361 --> 01:22:11.361
<v Speaker 4>You can do low carbon jack up fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't necessarily mean you're </v>

1688
01:22:11.361 --> 01:22:12.780
<v Speaker 4>jacking up your saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do low carb plant based.</v>

1689
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:16.080
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole different topic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is not the number one.</v>

1690
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:17.820
<v Speaker 4>These are one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's low carb.</v>

1691
01:22:17.821 --> 01:22:22.230
<v Speaker 4>It's not the main topic that's dominated</v>
<v Speaker 4>cardiovascular research for 60 years,</v>

1692
01:22:22.231 --> 01:22:24.720
<v Speaker 4>which is consistent to this day in every</v>
<v Speaker 4>guideline.</v>

1693
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.240
<v Speaker 4>Limit saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She don't die of a heart attack.</v>

1694
01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.610
<v Speaker 4>Stroke number two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>

1695
01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:30.810
<v Speaker 4>These are words your listeners may not </v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

1696
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:35.990
<v Speaker 4>These seats that our biomarker studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about dying of heart </v>

1697
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:35.990
<v Speaker 4>attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having heart attacks,</v>

1698
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:39.180
<v Speaker 4>having stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I care if your blood sugar marker called</v>

1699
01:22:39.181 --> 01:22:40.620
<v Speaker 4>hemoglobin a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one c goes down.</v>

1700
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:45.830
<v Speaker 4>I care if your ldl and your high </v>
<v Speaker 4>sensitivity c reactive protein goes </v>

1701
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:46.170
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not life and death.</v>

1702
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:51.200
<v Speaker 4>Those are biomarkers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so usually correlated with better </v>

1703
01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:51.380
<v Speaker 4>health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're not tracking in artery,</v>

1704
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:54.720
<v Speaker 4>you're not in my scientific field </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I track arteries in clinic,</v>

1705
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:57.360
<v Speaker 4>we track arteries in our research </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies.</v>

1706
01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:00.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the second thing I wanted</v>

1707
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:01.290
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1708
01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:06.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here to actually negate the data</v>
<v Speaker 4>that compared the crappy calorie rich </v>

1709
01:23:07.361 --> 01:23:10.980
<v Speaker 4>and process died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most americans are eating what chris</v>

1710
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 4>is presenting as alternative diet won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>improve numbers in the lab.</v>

1711
01:23:14.201 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a better choice.</v>

1712
01:23:15.971 --> 01:23:17.380
<v Speaker 4>I like your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

1713
01:23:17.381 --> 01:23:18.640
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like your diet,</v>

1714
01:23:18.641 --> 01:23:20.460
<v Speaker 4>chris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm looking at people walking in</v>

1715
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:25.240
<v Speaker 4>wendy's and hardee's and mcdonald's and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hospital cafeterias and gas stations.</v>

1716
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:30.510
<v Speaker 4>That's what we need to shut down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll make a main difference at all </v>

1717
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:32.140
<v Speaker 4>we're left with is chris's diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joe's diet and joel's diet.</v>

1718
01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.230
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have an amazing country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you can decide what you want.</v>

1719
01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I think we all agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still need to bring you back to </v>

1720
01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:44.671
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's talking about in terms of </v>

1721
01:23:44.671 --> 01:23:47.251
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat and not being a risk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not increasing your cholesterol.</v>

1722
01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.170
<v Speaker 1>You seem to disagree with that.</v>

1723
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:52.990
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the science says it does.</v>

1724
01:23:52.991 --> 01:23:53.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just said,</v>

1725
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:57.860
<v Speaker 5>I would say that it doesn't show me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me clarify something too.</v>

1726
01:23:57.861 --> 01:24:00.230
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not just talking about biomarkers.</v>

1727
01:24:00.231 --> 01:24:02.930
<v Speaker 5>Biomarkers are important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was the one who argued for looking</v>

1728
01:24:02.931 --> 01:24:07.760
<v Speaker 5>at total mortality is the most important</v>
<v Speaker 5>endpoint and mortality for many of these</v>

1729
01:24:07.761 --> 01:24:10.670
<v Speaker 5>other diseases and for the conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 5>from Dr.</v>

1730
01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:15.670
<v Speaker 5>Hart comes paper where she reviewed all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the evidence on saturated fat that I </v>

1731
01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:20.231
<v Speaker 5>talked about before and I just mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 5>35 of 39 studies didn't show any </v>

1732
01:24:20.231 --> 01:24:21.860
<v Speaker 5>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the conclusion.</v>

1733
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:27.310
<v Speaker 5>No meta analysis of randomized </v>
<v Speaker 5>controlled trials and slash or </v>

1734
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:29.090
<v Speaker 5>prospective cohort studies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are observational studies,</v>

1735
01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:34.360
<v Speaker 5>has found any significant difference for</v>
<v Speaker 5>dietary fat interventions and all cause </v>

1736
01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.921
<v Speaker 5>mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's deaths from any cause or death </v>

1737
01:24:38.921 --> 01:24:42.080
<v Speaker 5>from heart disease or associated with </v>
<v Speaker 5>dietary fat and heart disease mortality.</v>

1738
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:47.110
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no med analysis of randomized </v>

1739
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:50.201
<v Speaker 5>controlled trials that shows that eating</v>
<v Speaker 5>more saturated fat will will increase </v>

1740
01:24:50.201 --> 01:24:50.360
<v Speaker 5>your risk of death</v>

1741
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:55.460
<v Speaker 1>and your take on this is that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the latest science and that would he </v>

1742
01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.000
<v Speaker 1>siting in terms of these studies from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 fifties,</v>

1743
01:24:57.001 --> 01:24:58.710
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties aren't really relevant?</v>

1744
01:24:58.870 --> 01:25:00.940
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it that that,</v>

1745
01:25:01.170 --> 01:25:03.760
<v Speaker 5>but even even if we look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>epidemiology,</v>

1746
01:25:03.761 --> 01:25:06.490
<v Speaker 5>like I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there are.</v>

1747
01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.000
<v Speaker 5>There's a meta analysis of studies </v>
<v Speaker 5>including 350,000</v>

1748
01:25:10.001 --> 01:25:15.001
<v Speaker 5>participants that found no relationship </v>
<v Speaker 5>between saturated fat intake and </v>

1749
01:25:15.001 --> 01:25:18.631
<v Speaker 5>cardiovascular disease and then a more </v>
<v Speaker 5>recent review that included both </v>

1750
01:25:18.631 --> 01:25:23.251
<v Speaker 5>randomized controlled trials,</v>
<v Speaker 5>25 of them and 40 observational studies </v>

1751
01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:26.770
<v Speaker 5>with 650,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>participants that that concluded.</v>

1752
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:31.180
<v Speaker 5>Current evidence doesn't clearly support</v>
<v Speaker 5>cardiovascular guidelines that encourage</v>

1753
01:25:31.181 --> 01:25:36.181
<v Speaker 5>high consumption of polyunsaturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and low consumption of pto of saturated </v>

1754
01:25:36.181 --> 01:25:40.531
<v Speaker 5>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So whether you look at the epidemiology </v>

1755
01:25:40.531 --> 01:25:43.080
<v Speaker 5>or whether you look at the randomized </v>
<v Speaker 5>controlled trials are the meta analysis </v>

1756
01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.020
<v Speaker 5>of randomized controlled trials.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ended up in the same place,</v>

1757
01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:44.890
<v Speaker 1>joel,</v>

1758
01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:48.070
<v Speaker 4>most modern data,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we already talked this,</v>

1759
01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:51.820
<v Speaker 4>everyBody please google cochrane </v>
<v Speaker 4>database saturated fat.</v>

1760
01:25:51.821 --> 01:25:56.821
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand 15 hooper is the author.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He the introduction is reducing </v>

1761
01:25:57.761 --> 01:26:00.850
<v Speaker 4>saturateD fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reduces serum cholesterol,</v>

1762
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000
<v Speaker 4>but we're not sure of the importance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we took 15 randomized studies with </v>

1763
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:06.560
<v Speaker 4>59,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>participants.</v>

1764
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:11.590
<v Speaker 4>The conclusion there is a potentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>important reduction in heart disease </v>

1765
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 4>risk by reducing saturated fat in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>diet.</v>

1766
01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:18.220
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand 15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why 21 international societies </v>

1767
01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.970
<v Speaker 4>are solid that we will help the public.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will help the listeners have your </v>

1768
01:26:21.970 --> 01:26:23.180
<v Speaker 4>piece of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it four ounces,</v>

1769
01:26:23.181 --> 01:26:25.940
<v Speaker 4>not 14 ounces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have your bake and make a one strip,</v>

1770
01:26:25.941 --> 01:26:27.890
<v Speaker 4>not for strips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have your cheese,</v>

1771
01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:30.230
<v Speaker 4>just don't eat it every day and don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat large amounts.</v>

1772
01:26:30.231 --> 01:26:35.231
<v Speaker 4>The amount of cheesy United States has </v>
<v Speaker 4>gone insane because the usta funds </v>

1773
01:26:35.231 --> 01:26:35.420
<v Speaker 4>cheese manufacturers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1774
01:26:35.421 --> 01:26:37.850
<v Speaker 4>so 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't get you a better one though.</v>

1775
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:40.190
<v Speaker 4>They'll update cochrane database in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 4>slash 20.</v>

1776
01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:43.110
<v Speaker 4>It'll be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your take on when you said so?</v>

1777
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:44.780
<v Speaker 4>Here's johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

1778
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.840
<v Speaker 4>Honestly what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to go with the best science in </v>

1779
01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.960
<v Speaker 4>the world because I deal with patients </v>
<v Speaker 4>who have serious disease.</v>

1780
01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:56.020
<v Speaker 4>I can tell my patients the most updated </v>
<v Speaker 4>data analysis of randomized clinical </v>

1781
01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:58.100
<v Speaker 4>studies say saturated fat in your diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>raises your cholesterol,</v>

1782
01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.010
<v Speaker 4>lowering saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like eating less animal products,</v>

1783
01:27:01.011 --> 01:27:02.210
<v Speaker 4>not the most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Up to date.</v>

1784
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:07.240
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand 15 database mentioned to </v>
<v Speaker 4>several med analyses from 2008.</v>

1785
01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:10.160
<v Speaker 4>This is not been announced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is random as clinical studies.</v>

1786
01:27:10.161 --> 01:27:15.161
<v Speaker 4>Fifty 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>participants out there reviewing </v>

1787
01:27:15.161 --> 01:27:15.730
<v Speaker 4>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a that's and that's w.</v>

1788
01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.660
<v Speaker 4>We have to look at the weight of </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence.</v>

1789
01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:21.500
<v Speaker 4>There are lots of studies published all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time and that's again why looking at</v>

1790
01:27:21.501 --> 01:27:23.780
<v Speaker 4>med analyses of randomized controlled </v>
<v Speaker 4>trials,</v>

1791
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:29.110
<v Speaker 4>looking at very large reviews of </v>
<v Speaker 4>observational studies with over a </v>

1792
01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:31.940
<v Speaker 4>million participants and you end up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same place.</v>

1793
01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:34.460
<v Speaker 4>Of course we can go and find one study </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1794
01:27:34.461 --> 01:27:38.450
<v Speaker 4>one study there that that is different </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a different result,</v>

1795
01:27:38.451 --> 01:27:43.451
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The scientific method is to look at the </v>

1796
01:27:43.451 --> 01:27:46.781
<v Speaker 4>weight of the evidence and to continue </v>
<v Speaker 4>to evaluate that over time as the </v>

1797
01:27:46.781 --> 01:27:48.110
<v Speaker 4>evidence changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1798
01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.070
<v Speaker 4>this is a great quote from johnny and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dennis,</v>

1799
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 4>the stanford epidemiologists that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentioned,</v>

1800
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:53.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1801
01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:58.920
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that reminds us that we can't just rely </v>

1802
01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.930
<v Speaker 4>on the past to inform the present.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said claimed research findings may </v>

1803
01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:07.040
<v Speaker 4>often be simply accurate measures of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>prevailing bias.</v>

1804
01:28:07.730 --> 01:28:11.180
<v Speaker 4>And that what that means is that let's </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1805
01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you haVe a paper that,</v>

1806
01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:14.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1807
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:15.360
<v Speaker 4>30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>40,</v>

1808
01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.710
<v Speaker 4>50 years ago that says saturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>increases the risk of cholesterol.</v>

1809
01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:23.330
<v Speaker 4>Then later somebody makes that claim and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a paper just like that initial sentence,</v>

1810
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:25.040
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat raises cholesterol.</v>

1811
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.680
<v Speaker 4>You see a little number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're referencing that one paper.</v>

1812
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:31.310
<v Speaker 4>Then a couple of years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody else makes that same claim.</v>

1813
01:28:31.311 --> 01:28:36.311
<v Speaker 4>They referenced the second paper which </v>
<v Speaker 4>was referencing the first paper and on </v>

1814
01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.780
<v Speaker 4>and on it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the whole thing is a house of cards.</v>

1815
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.880
<v Speaker 4>That's what most people don't realize </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that is bad science.</v>

1816
01:28:43.881 --> 01:28:46.910
<v Speaker 4>This was good side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bad side is what you're saying.</v>

1817
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:50.760
<v Speaker 4>You're saying you see what he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>is because we know not.</v>

1818
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:56.890
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's making comments that have no </v>

1819
01:28:56.890 --> 01:28:57.500
<v Speaker 4>reference shortly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's misquoted the references.</v>

1820
01:28:57.501 --> 01:29:00.980
<v Speaker 4>CAn I give an example?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does he have no references?</v>

1821
01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:06.860
<v Speaker 4>A scientific peer reviewed paper that </v>
<v Speaker 4>quoted or referenced in everybody's </v>

1822
01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:08.970
<v Speaker 4>simply passively keeps requesting their </v>
<v Speaker 4>reference.</v>

1823
01:29:08.971 --> 01:29:13.971
<v Speaker 4>It was wrong in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can give you a real life internet </v>

1824
01:29:13.971 --> 01:29:14.550
<v Speaker 4>example wigs because gary dobbs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my new friend,</v>

1825
01:29:14.551 --> 01:29:19.551
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes my adverse adversary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can't give you a literature </v>

1826
01:29:19.551 --> 01:29:19.710
<v Speaker 4>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be one,</v>

1827
01:29:19.711 --> 01:29:21.710
<v Speaker 4>but these are very general statements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to.</v>

1828
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:22.560
<v Speaker 4>I think we should</v>

1829
01:29:22.570 --> 01:29:23.650
<v Speaker 3>move on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

1830
01:29:23.651 --> 01:29:26.830
<v Speaker 3>I definitely shouldn't because we're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>really clearing this up.</v>

1831
01:29:26.831 --> 01:29:28.520
<v Speaker 3>What is he saying that's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1832
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:34.830
<v Speaker 4>The best scientific analysis of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>global topic to saturated fat.</v>

1833
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:39.950
<v Speaker 4>Rich containing foods which are animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>sourced foods at high amount in your </v>

1834
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:44.091
<v Speaker 4>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>increase your risk of dying of a heart </v>

1835
01:29:44.091 --> 01:29:44.100
<v Speaker 4>attack or stroke or have a heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stroke goes to the biochemistry,</v>

1836
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:45.540
<v Speaker 4>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Offend your diet,</v>

1837
01:29:45.541 --> 01:29:48.840
<v Speaker 4>will lower the number of ldl receptors </v>
<v Speaker 4>on your liver and your blood close to it</v>

1838
01:29:48.841 --> 01:29:53.841
<v Speaker 4>goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's backed by 395 metabolic ward </v>

1839
01:29:53.841 --> 01:29:53.841
<v Speaker 4>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that is biochemistry.</v>

1840
01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Then you get to epidemiology countries </v>
<v Speaker 4>that eat more saturated fat.</v>

1841
01:29:57.930 --> 01:29:59.370
<v Speaker 4>Finland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great story,</v>

1842
01:29:59.371 --> 01:30:01.440
<v Speaker 4>and I got to tell it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1970.</v>

1843
01:30:01.441 --> 01:30:03.900
<v Speaker 4>The highest heart attack rate in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world was Finland.</v>

1844
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:06.510
<v Speaker 4>Guys were dying your age and my age at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the highest rate,</v>

1845
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:09.330
<v Speaker 4>the lowest heart attack rate in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mediterrAnean was crete.</v>

1846
01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Forty percent of calories from fat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Finland.</v>

1847
01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:14.310
<v Speaker 4>Forty percent of calories from fat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>crete.</v>

1848
01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can that happen?</v>

1849
01:30:15.391 --> 01:30:20.391
<v Speaker 4>Because I'm not an advocate for low fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>diet except for very selected clinical </v>

1850
01:30:20.391 --> 01:30:20.790
<v Speaker 4>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>IT was olive oil and crete.</v>

1851
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:23.430
<v Speaker 4>That's very low,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not zero low in saturated fat.</v>

1852
01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.140
<v Speaker 4>It was cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was meat,</v>

1853
01:30:25.141 --> 01:30:27.120
<v Speaker 4>it was beef,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was butter in Finland.</v>

1854
01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.870
<v Speaker 4>They instituted a national program to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lower the content,</v>

1855
01:30:30.871 --> 01:30:32.340
<v Speaker 4>has saturated fat in the diet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Finland.</v>

1856
01:30:32.341 --> 01:30:34.740
<v Speaker 4>five years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard tech dropped 80 percent.</v>

1857
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you understand that?</v>

1858
01:30:35.991 --> 01:30:38.540
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's saying something totally different.</v>

1859
01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:43.360
<v Speaker 3>You're citing epidemiologist chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I went to epic.</v>

1860
01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:48.850
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's not being broad with the </v>

1861
01:30:48.850 --> 01:30:48.850
<v Speaker 3>scientist</v>

1862
01:30:48.850 --> 01:30:49.060
<v Speaker 4>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's getting mired in the woods.</v>

1863
01:30:49.061 --> 01:30:52.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the broadest view from 50,000</v>

1864
01:30:52.241 --> 01:30:54.310
<v Speaker 4>feet up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>biochemistry supports it.</v>

1865
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:58.330
<v Speaker 4>Epidemiology supports at 395 metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 4>ward studies,</v>

1866
01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.510
<v Speaker 4>my randomized mendelian randomization so</v>
<v Speaker 4>said though,</v>

1867
01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:06.570
<v Speaker 4>because he's not looking at the entirety</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the data and I'm telling you the </v>

1868
01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:06.940
<v Speaker 4>entire data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you'd go to loma linda,</v>

1869
01:31:06.970 --> 01:31:08.210
<v Speaker 4>okinawa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to [inaudible],</v>

1870
01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.960
<v Speaker 4>you'd go to Costa Rica and you go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sardinia.</v>

1871
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:16.350
<v Speaker 4>If you are live to 100 and you're still </v>
<v Speaker 4>operating on somebody's heart is you're </v>

1872
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:17.560
<v Speaker 4>likely high in animal saturated fat or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

1873
01:31:17.561 --> 01:31:20.920
<v Speaker 4>The answer is it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's as low as three percent of the diet</v>

1874
01:31:20.921 --> 01:31:21.160
<v Speaker 4>and okay,</v>

1875
01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:24.280
<v Speaker 3>what could it possibly be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>other faculty user bias that.</v>

1876
01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:29.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a great stat recently that came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out that showed that just following the </v>

1877
01:31:29.461 --> 01:31:32.190
<v Speaker 3>top five health behaviors which are </v>
<v Speaker 3>basic,</v>

1878
01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.710
<v Speaker 3>so we're talking about not smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not drinking,</v>

1879
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:39.950
<v Speaker 3>maintaining a healthy body weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting some physical activity and </v>

1880
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:40.850
<v Speaker 3>eating healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1881
01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:43.620
<v Speaker 3>relatively healthy diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like not junk all the time.</v>

1882
01:31:43.621 --> 01:31:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Increases your lifespan by 13 years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where you cannot.</v>

1883
01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:52.490
<v Speaker 3>You can't look at these at these </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations and make inferences about </v>

1884
01:31:52.490 --> 01:31:56.601
<v Speaker 3>animal products being the driving factor</v>
<v Speaker 3>one way or the other because there's </v>

1885
01:31:56.601 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 3>just too many other factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to control for all of</v>

1886
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:05.010
<v Speaker 5>those factors in a study and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to come back to the scientific </v>

1887
01:32:05.141 --> 01:32:10.141
<v Speaker 5>method.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We use observational studies to come up </v>

1888
01:32:10.141 --> 01:32:13.321
<v Speaker 5>with hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then we do randomized controlled trials </v>

1889
01:32:13.321 --> 01:32:14.110
<v Speaker 5>to either confirm or refute those </v>
<v Speaker 5>hypotheses.</v>

1890
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:16.450
<v Speaker 5>As I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in many cases,</v>

1891
01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:21.440
<v Speaker 5>what is apparent and observational </v>
<v Speaker 5>studies or what seems apparent to is not</v>

1892
01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.860
<v Speaker 5>later confirmed in randomized controlled</v>
<v Speaker 5>trials.</v>

1893
01:32:23.861 --> 01:32:27.520
<v Speaker 5>And that's where we're at now wIth </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat and dietary cholesterol.</v>

1894
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:32.620
<v Speaker 5>I just mentioned three very large meta </v>
<v Speaker 5>analysis of randomized controlled trials</v>

1895
01:32:32.621 --> 01:32:37.621
<v Speaker 5>that failed to confirm any association </v>
<v Speaker 5>of saturated fat and heart disease and,</v>

1896
01:32:37.950 --> 01:32:41.620
<v Speaker 5>or saturated fat and increase in these </v>
<v Speaker 5>risk markers.</v>

1897
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:46.650
<v Speaker 5>And I mentioned to reviews of very large</v>
<v Speaker 5>observational study data including </v>

1898
01:32:47.710 --> 01:32:52.710
<v Speaker 5>350,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>in one study in 650 in another showing </v>

1899
01:32:52.710 --> 01:32:57.571
<v Speaker 5>no relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the mechanistic arguments about </v>

1900
01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:57.571
<v Speaker 5>liver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1901
01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:59.550
<v Speaker 5>the saturated fat does this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1902
01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:02.740
<v Speaker 5>that's not convincing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's not showing up in the data,</v>

1903
01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:07.780
<v Speaker 5>if it did that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then we would see it in the </v>

1904
01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:08.160
<v Speaker 5>observational studies in the randomized </v>
<v Speaker 5>studies.</v>

1905
01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:09.690
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically joel,</v>

1906
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.880
<v Speaker 4>what is your take on what he just said?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1907
01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:15.960
<v Speaker 4>we just had another gang moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so chris just quoted and it's actually a</v>

1908
01:33:15.961 --> 01:33:20.961
<v Speaker 4>little bit comical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a harvard school of public health study </v>

1909
01:33:20.961 --> 01:33:22.380
<v Speaker 4>on how do you live 14 years longer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's epidemiology,</v>

1910
01:33:22.381 --> 01:33:25.050
<v Speaker 4>but he's using it until the senior </v>
<v Speaker 4>author is Dr.</v>

1911
01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:27.450
<v Speaker 4>Walter willett.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A guy he calls a vegan pro,</v>

1912
01:33:27.451 --> 01:33:29.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>advocate who's not at all vegan.</v>

1913
01:33:29.461 --> 01:33:34.461
<v Speaker 4>He's written a book about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mediterranean diet with all kinds of </v>

1914
01:33:34.461 --> 01:33:34.461
<v Speaker 4>animal recipes in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fine with me.</v>

1915
01:33:34.461 --> 01:33:35.730
<v Speaker 4>He's a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant,</v>

1916
01:33:35.731 --> 01:33:40.731
<v Speaker 4>brilliant senior harvard researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's using data that he says is </v>

1917
01:33:40.731 --> 01:33:41.220
<v Speaker 4>weakened such,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet the teaching point is there.</v>

1918
01:33:41.221 --> 01:33:46.221
<v Speaker 4>How do you live 14 years longer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't smoke exercise 30 minutes a </v>

1919
01:33:46.221 --> 01:33:46.350
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He eat better than average.</v>

1920
01:33:46.351 --> 01:33:48.570
<v Speaker 4>That's very broad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you'd better than average.</v>

1921
01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:49.470
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1922
01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:54.620
<v Speaker 4>keep your waist under 25,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bmi under 25 and you have a few </v>

1923
01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:57.840
<v Speaker 4>alcoholic beverages a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want your listeners to write that down</v>

1924
01:33:57.841 --> 01:34:02.841
<v Speaker 4>because that is solid epidemiologic data</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fairly consistent across across </v>

1925
01:34:02.841 --> 01:34:06.270
<v Speaker 4>the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's all use something to teach your</v>

1926
01:34:06.271 --> 01:34:07.920
<v Speaker 4>listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's my point.</v>

1927
01:34:07.921 --> 01:34:12.921
<v Speaker 4>So you can't look at cultures that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>a completely different lifestyle than</v>

1928
01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:17.580
<v Speaker 5>standard american lifestyle and draw any</v>
<v Speaker 5>inferences about animal products.</v>

1929
01:34:17.581 --> 01:34:20.480
<v Speaker 5>So a really good example of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1930
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:22.750
<v Speaker 5>the seventh day adventists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1931
01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:23.600
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1932
01:34:23.601 --> 01:34:28.601
<v Speaker 5>the claim is that it's the vegetarian </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet that makes them live longer than </v>

1933
01:34:28.601 --> 01:34:29.880
<v Speaker 5>the general population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>

1934
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:32.730
<v Speaker 5>as I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as part of their belief system,</v>

1935
01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.950
<v Speaker 5>they don't smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't drink,</v>

1936
01:34:34.951 --> 01:34:36.900
<v Speaker 5>they have a healthy lifestyle in </v>
<v Speaker 5>general.</v>

1937
01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:42.230
<v Speaker 5>What if there was another population </v>
<v Speaker 5>that also had those kinds of belief </v>

1938
01:34:42.230 --> 01:34:45.150
<v Speaker 5>systems about not smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not drinking and healthy lifestyle,</v>

1939
01:34:45.151 --> 01:34:46.940
<v Speaker 5>but they also ate meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1940
01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:51.960
<v Speaker 5>turns out there is the mormons and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there've been three studies on mormons </v>

1941
01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:54.900
<v Speaker 5>and each of the mormon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the studies had been done on mormons,</v>

1942
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:59.990
<v Speaker 5>found that they're mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you the exact numbers here in </v>

1943
01:35:02.171 --> 01:35:05.320
<v Speaker 5>just a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1944
01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.620
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason that's not coming up</v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

1945
01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:14.621
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their risk of death compared to the </v>

1946
01:35:14.621 --> 01:35:18.341
<v Speaker 5>general population was something like 50</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent lower than the general </v>

1947
01:35:18.341 --> 01:35:19.790
<v Speaker 5>population on average and yet they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating animal foods.</v>

1948
01:35:19.791 --> 01:35:22.140
<v Speaker 5>They're not vegetarian like the seventh </v>
<v Speaker 5>day adventist.</v>

1949
01:35:22.141 --> 01:35:22.390
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1950
01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.260
<v Speaker 1>point and bringing that epidemiologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>study in the first place,</v>

1951
01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:30.261
<v Speaker 1>bringing up healthy lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing your lifespan by 14 years is </v>

1952
01:35:30.261 --> 01:35:33.861
<v Speaker 1>to show that any positive move is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show whether it's just exercise and </v>

1953
01:35:35.131 --> 01:35:38.990
<v Speaker 1>not eating sugar or whatever is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show an increase in,</v>

1954
01:35:38.991 --> 01:35:39.870
<v Speaker 1>in your lifespan.</v>

1955
01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:44.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just to show how hard it is to </v>

1956
01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.940
<v Speaker 5>isolate single variables and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>influence of those single variables in </v>

1957
01:35:47.190 --> 01:35:50.340
<v Speaker 5>an observational study on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on those effects,</v>

1958
01:35:50.850 --> 01:35:55.850
<v Speaker 5>and this is something that you noticed </v>
<v Speaker 5>johnny geneticists said over and over </v>

1959
01:35:55.850 --> 01:36:00.201
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that it's almost impossible if not </v>

1960
01:36:00.201 --> 01:36:02.961
<v Speaker 5>impossible to disentangle the influences</v>
<v Speaker 5>of all of these single variables in </v>

1961
01:36:03.481 --> 01:36:05.340
<v Speaker 5>observational research.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

1962
01:36:05.370 --> 01:36:08.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying we shouldn't use </v>
<v Speaker 5>observational research.</v>

1963
01:36:08.461 --> 01:36:13.461
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying we should be circumspect </v>
<v Speaker 5>about how you use it and we should be </v>

1964
01:36:13.461 --> 01:36:16.461
<v Speaker 5>aware of the limitations and the flaws </v>
<v Speaker 5>and keep those in mind when we're </v>

1965
01:36:16.461 --> 01:36:20.340
<v Speaker 5>designing observational studies and when</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're interpreting their results.</v>

1966
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:23.610
<v Speaker 1>So joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your opinion on what he's saying</v>

1967
01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:27.300
<v Speaker 1>about saturated fat and cholesterol and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality risk?</v>

1968
01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.330
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1969
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:30.010
<v Speaker 4>I think I've said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll repeat it.</v>

1970
01:36:30.011 --> 01:36:33.310
<v Speaker 4>I just want to point out we just shared </v>
<v Speaker 4>another common moment.</v>

1971
01:36:33.311 --> 01:36:37.000
<v Speaker 4>We're both lifestyle medicine doctors of</v>
<v Speaker 4>which nutrition is just one part.</v>

1972
01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:39.490
<v Speaker 4>We just went through a list of lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 4>factors.</v>

1973
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:42.070
<v Speaker 4>We now add sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had social support,</v>

1974
01:36:42.071 --> 01:36:45.010
<v Speaker 4>we had stress management skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not all smoking diet,</v>

1975
01:36:45.011 --> 01:36:50.011
<v Speaker 4>exercise and and the size of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we are aligned and in know and we </v>

1976
01:36:50.011 --> 01:36:54.520
<v Speaker 4>will go at patient's side by side and do</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the exactly the same thing.</v>

1977
01:36:54.521 --> 01:36:59.521
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the only thing they're squabble </v>

1978
01:36:59.521 --> 01:37:01.210
<v Speaker 4>about and lifestyle medicine is optimal </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrition to prevent chronic disease and</v>

1979
01:37:01.211 --> 01:37:06.211
<v Speaker 4>there's probably more than one path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but god knows the plant based medicine </v>

1980
01:37:06.211 --> 01:37:09.721
<v Speaker 4>group has a tremendous body of science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll conclude one more time and I don't </v>

1981
01:37:09.721 --> 01:37:13.921
<v Speaker 4>know how many times I can say at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highest level of science to integrate </v>

1982
01:37:13.921 --> 01:37:15.490
<v Speaker 4>all that's available biochemistry's on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the side.</v>

1983
01:37:15.610 --> 01:37:18.280
<v Speaker 4>Saturated fat raises your risk of </v>
<v Speaker 4>coronary heart disease.</v>

1984
01:37:18.490 --> 01:37:21.130
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean nobody eats a no </v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat diet,</v>

1985
01:37:21.131 --> 01:37:26.131
<v Speaker 4>but you can lower it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A observational studies where their </v>

1986
01:37:26.131 --> 01:37:27.280
<v Speaker 4>epidemiology studies were to test that </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypothesis.</v>

1987
01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:29.890
<v Speaker 4>They confirm Finland and crete I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about.</v>

1988
01:37:29.891 --> 01:37:30.820
<v Speaker 4>I won't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again.</v>

1989
01:37:30.970 --> 01:37:33.100
<v Speaker 4>Randomized clinical trials have </v>
<v Speaker 4>confirmed it.</v>

1990
01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:37.510
<v Speaker 4>Hooper cochrane database 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My study 2012,</v>

1991
01:37:37.511 --> 01:37:42.511
<v Speaker 4>widely cited worldwide has confirmed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get your ldl cholesterol down </v>

1992
01:37:42.511 --> 01:37:44.110
<v Speaker 4>genetically or by diet as long as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>

1993
01:37:44.111 --> 01:37:49.111
<v Speaker 4>as early as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and finally in the last is what a old </v>

1994
01:37:49.111 --> 01:37:49.111
<v Speaker 4>healthy people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

1995
01:37:49.111 --> 01:37:53.550
<v Speaker 4>chris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think there's a good concept to </v>

1996
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.950
<v Speaker 4>let your listeners know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't all about lifespan.</v>

1997
01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:54.700
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lifespan,</v>

1998
01:37:54.701 --> 01:37:57.360
<v Speaker 4>the united is dropping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is very scary for all the frigging</v>

1999
01:37:57.361 --> 01:38:00.210
<v Speaker 4>money we spend on health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something called health span,</v>

2000
01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:03.660
<v Speaker 4>which is to avoid chronic disease and </v>
<v Speaker 4>die dancing or die,</v>

2001
01:38:03.661 --> 01:38:08.661
<v Speaker 4>swimming or die sky diving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't die in a frigging hospital </v>

2002
01:38:08.661 --> 01:38:10.130
<v Speaker 4>with a peg tube and a trake and a and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>foley up your,</v>

2003
01:38:10.131 --> 01:38:10.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

2004
01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:11.760
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

2005
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:15.030
<v Speaker 4>many of these studies that show you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>reduce your risk of heart disease,</v>

2006
01:38:15.031 --> 01:38:17.880
<v Speaker 4>stroke and diabetes are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>better quality of life.</v>

2007
01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.880
<v Speaker 4>So when you put all that together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these centenarian studies that have low </v>

2008
01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.721
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat diets are just one more </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece I just mentioned for incredibly </v>

2009
01:38:26.721 --> 01:38:27.870
<v Speaker 4>solid piece of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not one,</v>

2010
01:38:28.230 --> 01:38:29.850
<v Speaker 4>it's for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all that's out there.</v>

2011
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:33.270
<v Speaker 4>It's what nobel prize winners use when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they describe the cholesterol hypothesis</v>

2012
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:36.210
<v Speaker 4>is what is this correct?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He may not know it.</v>

2013
01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:38.970
<v Speaker 4>In this city of los angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our shared friend,</v>

2014
01:38:38.971 --> 01:38:43.971
<v Speaker 4>dr valter longo often considered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you should have on the show perhaps </v>

2015
01:38:43.971 --> 01:38:45.420
<v Speaker 4>the world's leading expert in nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>longevity and such.</v>

2016
01:38:45.421 --> 01:38:50.421
<v Speaker 4>We'll say you incorporate all the bases </v>
<v Speaker 4>for nutritional evaluation.</v>

2017
01:38:50.641 --> 01:38:55.641
<v Speaker 4>You keep it big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't that he calls it pixel </v>

2018
01:38:55.641 --> 01:38:55.950
<v Speaker 4>mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get hung up on one study.</v>

2019
01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:59.010
<v Speaker 4>You get the whole picture biochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>epidemiology,</v>

2020
01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.100
<v Speaker 4>randomized clinical trials.</v>
<v Speaker 4>finally centenarian studies.</v>

2021
01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:05.670
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will enhance your health by lowering</v>

2022
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:06.900
<v Speaker 4>animal based products.</v>

2023
01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.900
<v Speaker 4>Now we can argue is that 70 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 percent,</v>

2024
01:39:09.901 --> 01:39:12.980
<v Speaker 4>90 percent plant based loren cordain and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2025
01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:15.010
<v Speaker 4>the founder of the paleo movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2026
01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.360
<v Speaker 4>boyd eaton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about 70 percent plants </v>

2027
01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:20.360
<v Speaker 4>on your plate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

2028
01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:24.590
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not telling people quit eating meat </v>

2029
01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:24.590
<v Speaker 4>today or thy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a reactionary,</v>

2030
01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:28.140
<v Speaker 4>but to say that plant based medicine </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have a strong basis that I can't</v>

2031
01:39:28.141 --> 01:39:30.240
<v Speaker 4>reverse plaque which just plant based </v>
<v Speaker 4>medicine.</v>

2032
01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.970
<v Speaker 4>We haven't even talked about the ability</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do that,</v>

2033
01:39:32.971 --> 01:39:37.220
<v Speaker 4>but iS his absolute heresy because it in</v>
<v Speaker 4>fact is one of the most powerful piece</v>

2034
01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:38.700
<v Speaker 3>attrition we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2035
01:39:38.701 --> 01:39:43.701
<v Speaker 3>but what's wrong with these studies that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about their pixel </v>

2036
01:39:43.701 --> 01:39:43.701
<v Speaker 3>mentalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>picking one,</v>

2037
01:39:43.701 --> 01:39:48.690
<v Speaker 3>know how observational data of over a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million people and three different meta </v>

2038
01:39:51.231 --> 01:39:56.231
<v Speaker 3>analyses of 20 to 25 randomized </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled trials each pixel mentality.</v>

2039
01:39:57.511 --> 01:40:02.511
<v Speaker 3>This is the gold standard for assessing </v>
<v Speaker 3>a question like this in medicine.</v>

2040
01:40:02.581 --> 01:40:07.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not mechanistic data or mechanistic</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments don't make,</v>

2041
01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:12.320
<v Speaker 3>are not persuasive if they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>translate into real outcomes that you </v>

2042
01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:15.501
<v Speaker 3>can measure in randomized controlled </v>
<v Speaker 3>trials or observational studies like </v>

2043
01:40:15.501 --> 01:40:17.490
<v Speaker 3>trying to boil this down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is your take on that without any</v>

2044
01:40:17.491 --> 01:40:20.940
<v Speaker 3>references to the past and people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>lived in Angola that live longer.</v>

2045
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:26.110
<v Speaker 4>These are the three disruptive </v>
<v Speaker 4>randomized trials from 2010 on that </v>

2046
01:40:26.110 --> 01:40:26.180
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The relationship.</v>

2047
01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Those are different trials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joel.</v>

2048
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Well then these are three different </v>
<v Speaker 3>trials.</v>

2049
01:40:30.890 --> 01:40:34.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the crosses researcher or </v>
<v Speaker 3>chowder worries you.</v>

2050
01:40:34.771 --> 01:40:36.610
<v Speaker 3>You need to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to throw them out there and let</v>

2051
01:40:36.611 --> 01:40:39.790
<v Speaker 3>us know the reference I did before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want me to do it again?</v>

2052
01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:42.430
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we will get my yard.</v>

2053
01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is wrong with what he's saying?</v>

2054
01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:49.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm just look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously the non expert here and I'm </v>

2055
01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:50.680
<v Speaker 3>baffled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm trying to boil this down with his</v>

2056
01:40:50.681 --> 01:40:52.350
<v Speaker 3>little rhetoric as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2057
01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:53.200
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

2058
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:59.370
<v Speaker 4>a heretical conspiracy attitude to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's got it wrong for 60 years.</v>

2059
01:41:00.911 --> 01:41:02.940
<v Speaker 4>Twenty one international societies have </v>
<v Speaker 4>rung.</v>

2060
01:41:02.970 --> 01:41:07.970
<v Speaker 4>They could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a controversy theory to say </v>

2061
01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:07.970
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2062
01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:09.100
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hooper cochrane database,</v>

2063
01:41:09.101 --> 01:41:11.110
<v Speaker 4>2015,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got it wrong,</v>

2064
01:41:11.410 --> 01:41:13.630
<v Speaker 4>that metabolic ward studies got it </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

2065
01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:17.830
<v Speaker 4>This is one or two or three pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 4>data and their observational,</v>

2066
01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:23.340
<v Speaker 4>you don't throw out the babies with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit randomized controlled trials </v>

2067
01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:25.180
<v Speaker 4>saying they're observational if they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

2068
01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:29.470
<v Speaker 4>What men analysis by nature is implying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a new study.</v>

2069
01:41:29.471 --> 01:41:31.300
<v Speaker 4>it's taking previous studies in doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

2070
01:41:31.570 --> 01:41:36.570
<v Speaker 4>Let me give you one quick example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the chowdry meta analysis created </v>

2071
01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:42.180
<v Speaker 4>butter is back on the cover of time </v>
<v Speaker 4>magazine created a whole fervor out </v>

2072
01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:45.631
<v Speaker 4>there that we can go back to and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these great foods that atkins wants us </v>

2073
01:41:45.631 --> 01:41:48.331
<v Speaker 4>to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They correlated your blood cholesterol </v>

2074
01:41:48.331 --> 01:41:48.331
<v Speaker 4>with your risk of having heart disease.</v>

2075
01:41:48.331 --> 01:41:49.810
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't confirm it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2076
01:41:49.811 --> 01:41:52.900
<v Speaker 4>they allowed people in that men analysis</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are on lipitor,</v>

2077
01:41:53.170 --> 01:41:55.390
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course you're on a medicine,</v>

2078
01:41:55.391 --> 01:41:57.550
<v Speaker 4>lowers your cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't exclude those people.</v>

2079
01:41:57.551 --> 01:42:00.100
<v Speaker 4>That has been resoundingly criticized </v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

2080
01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:01.300
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks good.</v>

2081
01:42:01.301 --> 01:42:06.301
<v Speaker 4>It's in a journal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a meta analysis that is fraudulent </v>

2082
01:42:06.301 --> 01:42:06.970
<v Speaker 4>or at least relatively inappropriate </v>
<v Speaker 4>statistics.</v>

2083
01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:07.660
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2084
01:42:07.661 --> 01:42:09.190
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so technical,</v>

2085
01:42:09.191 --> 01:42:09.940
<v Speaker 4>it's beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2086
01:42:09.941 --> 01:42:14.650
<v Speaker 4>the importance of this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just say 50,000</v>

2087
01:42:14.651 --> 01:42:19.480
<v Speaker 4>feet elevation view of the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrition is again,</v>

2088
01:42:19.481 --> 01:42:24.481
<v Speaker 4>four pillars that I keep talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>indicates you'd be very wise to limit </v>

2089
01:42:24.481 --> 01:42:29.100
<v Speaker 4>the amount of saturated fat and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>endorsed by every major medical society </v>

2090
01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:29.770
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not controversial.</v>

2091
01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:31.730
<v Speaker 4>It's not controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

2092
01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:36.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just the natural </v>

2093
01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:39.481
<v Speaker 4>progression of science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we used to think the world was </v>

2094
01:42:39.481 --> 01:42:40.030
<v Speaker 4>flat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's theirs were caused by stress,</v>

2095
01:42:40.031 --> 01:42:40.920
<v Speaker 4>but that's down there.</v>

2096
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:45.970
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of things that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed over time as the evidence </v>

2097
01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:50.340
<v Speaker 4>evolves and is we'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We become more educated and aware of </v>

2098
01:42:53.110 --> 01:42:55.700
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a belief in a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2099
01:42:56.860 --> 01:43:00.340
<v Speaker 4>chris is suggesting we got it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means the american heart,</v>

2100
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:03.250
<v Speaker 4>american college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world health institute of medicine,</v>

2101
01:43:03.251 --> 01:43:07.150
<v Speaker 4>the european society of atherosclerosis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the australian society of health,</v>

2102
01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:08.510
<v Speaker 4>all of these bleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bolded,</v>

2103
01:43:08.650 --> 01:43:11.170
<v Speaker 4>tell you 10 percent or less saturated </v>
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>

2104
01:43:11.171 --> 01:43:16.171
<v Speaker 4>Some say as little as you could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>get in your diet have got it wrong and </v>

2105
01:43:16.171 --> 01:43:18.360
<v Speaker 4>that suggests there's been a total </v>
<v Speaker 4>misrepresentation of all the sciences.</v>

2106
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:22.330
<v Speaker 4>I paused for a second there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are their recommendations based on?</v>

2107
01:43:22.331 --> 01:43:24.190
<v Speaker 4>Is it based on old science?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2108
01:43:24.191 --> 01:43:29.191
<v Speaker 4>I mean these are long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have they been saying this and what is </v>

2109
01:43:29.191 --> 01:43:32.341
<v Speaker 4>it based on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And have they adjusted to this new </v>

2110
01:43:32.341 --> 01:43:32.341
<v Speaker 4>science?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's discussing [inaudible],</v>

2111
01:43:32.341 --> 01:43:32.700
<v Speaker 4>republican,</v>
<v Speaker 4>republican,</v>

2112
01:43:32.701 --> 01:43:35.650
<v Speaker 4>republican for the usta republishes </v>
<v Speaker 4>every five years.</v>

2113
01:43:35.651 --> 01:43:37.430
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand and 16.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not long ago.</v>

2114
01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Five years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand 16 was the last usd a </v>

2115
01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:42.640
<v Speaker 4>publication there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll do it again in 20 slash 20.</v>

2116
01:43:42.670 --> 01:43:45.670
<v Speaker 4>But doesn't this science change?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that fast.</v>

2117
01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:50.700
<v Speaker 4>Not that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing new since 2000 took </v>

2118
01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 4>theme that rocks the idea that 21 </v>
<v Speaker 4>international got</v>

2119
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.910
<v Speaker 5>it wrong there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>

2120
01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:58.310
<v Speaker 5>There isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The 2015 report did not use.</v>

2121
01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:00.240
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a,</v>

2122
01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:05.260
<v Speaker 5>the usta setup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the nutrition evidence library to help </v>

2123
01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.340
<v Speaker 5>conduct systemic reviews to answer some </v>
<v Speaker 5>of these questions.</v>

2124
01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:12.341
<v Speaker 5>And in the 2015 report,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the committee stated that it didn't use </v>

2125
01:44:12.341 --> 01:44:15.500
<v Speaker 5>that database for 70 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>topics.</v>

2126
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:18.170
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2127
01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:23.440
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the guidelines hadn't used any </v>

2128
01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.890
<v Speaker 5>newer science from since 2010 and there </v>
<v Speaker 5>had been large reviews as I just </v>

2129
01:44:27.201 --> 01:44:28.020
<v Speaker 5>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

2130
01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.940
<v Speaker 5>these three reviews that I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one was in 2000,</v>

2131
01:44:31.941 --> 01:44:36.941
<v Speaker 5>13,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one was in 2017 and one was in 2018.</v>

2132
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:42.910
<v Speaker 5>These are the reviews of the randomized </v>
<v Speaker 5>controlled trials that didn't show </v>

2133
01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:45.260
<v Speaker 5>increase in cardiovascular risk markers </v>
<v Speaker 5>from saturated fat consumption.</v>

2134
01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:50.620
<v Speaker 5>and then we had those observation </v>
<v Speaker 5>reviews of observational studies of </v>

2135
01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:51.560
<v Speaker 5>300,000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>650,000</v>

2136
01:44:51.561 --> 01:44:56.561
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the same thing will happen with </v>

2137
01:44:56.561 --> 01:44:56.561
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I said in 2010,</v>

2138
01:44:56.561 --> 01:44:58.250
<v Speaker 5>they changed their recommendations on </v>
<v Speaker 5>total fat.</v>

2139
01:44:58.550 --> 01:45:02.210
<v Speaker 5>They used to limit total fat and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>they changed those in 2010,</v>

2140
01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:07.630
<v Speaker 5>2015,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they changed their recommendation on </v>

2141
01:45:07.630 --> 01:45:08.660
<v Speaker 5>dietary cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think probably the next time,</v>

2142
01:45:08.690 --> 01:45:13.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's the next time or maybe it's </v>

2143
01:45:13.690 --> 01:45:14.210
<v Speaker 5>the time after that you'll see a change </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the saturated fat guidelines.</v>

2144
01:45:14.211 --> 01:45:17.060
<v Speaker 5>And it's not a big conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying,</v>

2145
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:18.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a conspiracy,</v>

2146
01:45:18.351 --> 01:45:22.520
<v Speaker 5>it's the advancement of science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So your take is that these organizations</v>

2147
01:45:22.521 --> 01:45:24.380
<v Speaker 5>are behind the curve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2148
01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.660
<v Speaker 5>And if we want to talk about conflicts </v>
<v Speaker 5>of interest,</v>

2149
01:45:26.690 --> 01:45:29.300
<v Speaker 5>there are huge conflicts of interest in </v>
<v Speaker 5>these organizations.</v>

2150
01:45:29.301 --> 01:45:32.480
<v Speaker 5>Something like 40 percent of the funding</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the uh,</v>

2151
01:45:33.010 --> 01:45:33.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2152
01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to get this number wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot.</v>

2153
01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.660
<v Speaker 5>The american heart association,</v>
<v Speaker 5>american diabetic association,</v>

2154
01:45:38.690 --> 01:45:41.690
<v Speaker 5>a lot of these organizations have </v>
<v Speaker 5>funding from big food.</v>

2155
01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:43.130
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2156
01:45:43.131 --> 01:45:46.400
<v Speaker 5>coca cola,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you talked to a nutritionist who goes to</v>

2157
01:45:46.401 --> 01:45:48.230
<v Speaker 5>these conferences and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2158
01:45:48.231 --> 01:45:52.460
<v Speaker 5>there's like nestle bars and coca cola </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the nutrition conferences.</v>

2159
01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.380
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2160
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:54.680
<v Speaker 5>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This terrible,</v>

2161
01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:56.460
<v Speaker 5>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2162
01:45:56.461 --> 01:46:01.461
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's actually funny and sad at the same </v>

2163
01:46:01.461 --> 01:46:03.611
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm not saying there's a big </v>

2164
01:46:03.611 --> 01:46:05.801
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I am saying there's a problem in </v>

2165
01:46:05.801 --> 01:46:07.760
<v Speaker 5>terms of scientific integrity when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have these organizations,</v>

2166
01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:12.761
<v Speaker 5>they're tasked with creating the </v>
<v Speaker 5>guidelines that have these financial </v>

2167
01:46:12.761 --> 01:46:13.520
<v Speaker 5>conflicts of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not really how it should be,</v>

2168
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:18.790
<v Speaker 5>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even want to go too far down </v>

2169
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:20.681
<v Speaker 5>that road because we don't need to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>there in order to show that the </v>

2170
01:46:20.681 --> 01:46:20.681
<v Speaker 5>sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the,</v>

2171
01:46:20.681 --> 01:46:23.360
<v Speaker 5>what the science is showing and peer </v>
<v Speaker 5>review journals.</v>

2172
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:25.880
<v Speaker 5>So joel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is wrong with what he just said?</v>

2173
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:33.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll say this until 2020 usda guidelines</v>

2174
01:46:33.711 --> 01:46:38.711
<v Speaker 5>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually think he's factually wrong </v>

2175
01:46:38.711 --> 01:46:38.900
<v Speaker 5>because he goes to a guideline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say keep the percentage of calories from</v>

2176
01:46:38.901 --> 01:46:42.590
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat to 35 percent or less.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could be wrong on that.</v>

2177
01:46:42.591 --> 01:46:44.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm not an encyclopedia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know they say,</v>

2178
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:45.770
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with that.</v>

2179
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

2180
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 5>I said they changed their total,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their</v>

2181
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.450
<v Speaker 2>limitation on total fat in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2182
01:46:53.451 --> 01:46:58.451
<v Speaker 2>I'm speculating that eventually changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>their guidelines on saturated fat </v>

2183
01:46:58.801 --> 01:47:03.801
<v Speaker 2>because the science has evolved and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>will buy you guys are all paid trip to </v>

2184
01:47:03.801 --> 01:47:07.521
<v Speaker 2>bali.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you see in the 2020 guidelines that </v>

2185
01:47:07.521 --> 01:47:08.140
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat is still not to be limited</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

2186
01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's wrong with what he said?</v>

2187
01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2188
01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know it just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's about.</v>

2189
01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I agree there are conflicts of funding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not unique to any particular</v>

2190
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:19.420
<v Speaker 2>sector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2191
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:22.680
<v Speaker 2>we just had one of the most famous food </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist in Connecticut.</v>

2192
01:47:22.681 --> 01:47:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Brian wants it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hero of mine,</v>

2193
01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:26.690
<v Speaker 2>said eden small plates because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>

2194
01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:28.740
<v Speaker 2>SmAll plates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're mindful and you don't get obese.</v>

2195
01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.200
<v Speaker 2>had to have six papers rejected and had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to resign.</v>

2196
01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:33.030
<v Speaker 2>It's pervasive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem.</v>

2197
01:47:33.031 --> 01:47:38.031
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean there's not been any good </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists and I think most of the </v>

2198
01:47:38.031 --> 01:47:41.481
<v Speaker 2>people we've been talking about are </v>
<v Speaker 2>largely good scientists that their </v>

2199
01:47:41.481 --> 01:47:41.481
<v Speaker 2>reputation hasn't been tainted.</v>

2200
01:47:41.481 --> 01:47:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get too Mired in this,</v>

2201
01:47:43.081 --> 01:47:46.070
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the egg industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>prior to 1990,</v>

2202
01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:50.370
<v Speaker 2>about 30 percent of egg studies on </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition,</v>

2203
01:47:50.371 --> 01:47:52.350
<v Speaker 2>we're funded by the egg board since </v>
<v Speaker 2>1990.</v>

2204
01:47:52.351 --> 01:47:54.480
<v Speaker 2>It's 92 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a conflict.</v>

2205
01:47:54.481 --> 01:47:59.481
<v Speaker 2>Who's got the money to study nutrition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the broccoli grower stop you </v>

2206
01:47:59.481 --> 01:47:59.610
<v Speaker 2>because we're getting in the weeds </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2207
01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:03.450
<v Speaker 2>What is wrong with what he said?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2208
01:48:03.451 --> 01:48:05.950
<v Speaker 2>he's predicting that there'll be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>change in the record.</v>

2209
01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:12.080
<v Speaker 2>I think there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no substantial new data on </v>

2210
01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.180
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat since 2015 hooper in 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 2>usta.</v>

2211
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:20.130
<v Speaker 2>That changes anybody to question that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they should not recognize and follow the</v>

2212
01:48:20.131 --> 01:48:25.131
<v Speaker 2>leadership of 21 international societies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are out there to try and improve </v>

2213
01:48:25.131 --> 01:48:28.950
<v Speaker 2>the copy there because those 21 </v>
<v Speaker 2>international societies and all these </v>

2214
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:31.230
<v Speaker 2>different organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they rely on current science to make the</v>

2215
01:48:31.231 --> 01:48:32.600
<v Speaker 2>recommendations correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

2216
01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:32.950
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2217
01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And are they often behind the curve?</v>

2218
01:48:35.490 --> 01:48:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The usda,</v>

2219
01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:41.440
<v Speaker 2>it goes through this whole presence now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't published anything new </v>

2220
01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:42.030
<v Speaker 2>since 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an expensive process,</v>

2221
01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:44.430
<v Speaker 2>but they did change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he said,</v>

2222
01:48:44.431 --> 01:48:49.431
<v Speaker 2>they're total fat requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did change what they believe to be </v>

2223
01:48:49.431 --> 01:48:50.430
<v Speaker 2>healthy and not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2224
01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:52.650
<v Speaker 2>well said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They changed it in 2010.</v>

2225
01:48:52.651 --> 01:48:57.651
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changed the limitation on total fat </v>

2226
01:48:57.651 --> 01:49:00.831
<v Speaker 2>in 2010 and then they changed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitation on dietary cholesterol in </v>

2227
01:49:00.831 --> 01:49:02.790
<v Speaker 2>2015.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they admit that the sciences advanced</v>

2228
01:49:02.791 --> 01:49:05.640
<v Speaker 2>and changed their perceptions of what is</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and is not healthy.</v>

2229
01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:08.340
<v Speaker 2>So what's wrong with what he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>aBout saturated fat?</v>

2230
01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:09.940
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2231
01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:13.280
<v Speaker 2>they didn't chain saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if we stick just,</v>

2232
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.950
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2233
01:49:15.230 --> 01:49:17.820
<v Speaker 2>they rely on the current science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2234
01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:23.090
<v Speaker 2>So he's saying that the current science </v>
<v Speaker 2>is showing that there is no negative </v>

2235
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.670
<v Speaker 2>consequences of saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bs,</v>

2236
01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:26.490
<v Speaker 2>that's bs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is wrong with these studies that</v>

2237
01:49:26.491 --> 01:49:27.000
<v Speaker 2>he's citing?</v>

2238
01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:27.550
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2239
01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:34.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not read every article in the </v>

2240
01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:34.580
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor has chris.</v>

2241
01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:37.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are three faMous studies that I've</v>

2242
01:49:37.681 --> 01:49:38.310
<v Speaker 2>read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Siri,</v>

2243
01:49:38.311 --> 01:49:40.170
<v Speaker 2>torino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chowdry and d'souza.</v>

2244
01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Those have been dissected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are event generally,</v>

2245
01:49:43.290 --> 01:49:44.990
<v Speaker 2>but you don't believe the ones that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>cited?</v>

2246
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2247
01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know actually he would probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>those to support</v>

2248
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:53.100
<v Speaker 4>his case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they've been so resoundingly </v>

2249
01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:53.800
<v Speaker 4>criticized that and they created fervor </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll,</v>

2250
01:49:53.801 --> 01:49:56.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't know this sounding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>said it criticized.</v>

2251
01:49:57.770 --> 01:50:02.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm aware that there has been criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you could say the same thing about </v>

2252
01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:04.470
<v Speaker 5>the vegetarian lifespan studies to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2253
01:50:04.490 --> 01:50:09.490
<v Speaker 5>a arc report on processing </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientifically been debunked by any </v>

2254
01:50:09.991 --> 01:50:13.260
<v Speaker 5>stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are the papers stand.</v>

2255
01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:16.320
<v Speaker 5>The authors have defended against those </v>
<v Speaker 5>criticisms.</v>

2256
01:50:16.410 --> 01:50:21.410
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's nothing like what joel was talking </v>

2257
01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:23.800
<v Speaker 5>about with brian wansink who had to re,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2258
01:50:23.890 --> 01:50:26.920
<v Speaker 5>all the papers were proven to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>fraudulent and he had to retract them.</v>

2259
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:30.030
<v Speaker 5>It's nothing like that that has happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>with those papers and those were not the</v>

2260
01:50:30.031 --> 01:50:31.240
<v Speaker 5>ones that I cited anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2261
01:50:31.490 --> 01:50:36.490
<v Speaker 4>I just want to say the usd in 2015 said </v>
<v Speaker 4>total fat intake should be 20 to 30 fiVe</v>

2262
01:50:36.831 --> 01:50:39.890
<v Speaker 4>percent of all your calories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't eliminate anything in 2010.</v>

2263
01:50:39.891 --> 01:50:42.530
<v Speaker 4>that's 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a factual error,</v>

2264
01:50:42.531 --> 01:50:47.531
<v Speaker 4>chris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They clearly change a cholesterol </v>

2265
01:50:47.531 --> 01:50:47.531
<v Speaker 4>recommendation to say as little as </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

2266
01:50:47.531 --> 01:50:51.580
<v Speaker 4>They just didn't put a number on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all know that my cardiology group </v>

2267
01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:54.821
<v Speaker 4>went bananas and got them to add that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sentence as keep cholesterol as low as </v>

2268
01:50:54.821 --> 01:50:54.821
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris,</v>

2269
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:58.370
<v Speaker 4>it says cholesterol is no longer a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrient of concern,</v>

2270
01:50:58.490 --> 01:51:00.980
<v Speaker 4>but you were talking that they removed </v>
<v Speaker 4>the total fat intake.</v>

2271
01:51:00.981 --> 01:51:02.480
<v Speaker 4>That's actually inaccurate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right here.</v>

2272
01:51:02.481 --> 01:51:03.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get the guideline open,</v>

2273
01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:05.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

2274
01:51:05.181 --> 01:51:05.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2275
01:51:05.590 --> 01:51:06.050
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2276
01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:11.060
<v Speaker 4>we're allowed to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to incorporate the whole </v>

2277
01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:11.060
<v Speaker 4>world literature and we're just two </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

2278
01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:11.270
<v Speaker 4>Was that a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chris?</v>

2279
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:13.070
<v Speaker 4>Right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2280
01:51:14.150 --> 01:51:17.570
<v Speaker 4>it's a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This mistake.</v>

2281
01:51:17.571 --> 01:51:19.670
<v Speaker 4>What did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That we said that in 2010,</v>

2282
01:51:19.671 --> 01:51:24.671
<v Speaker 4>the usda guidelines which are supposed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be followed by schools and colleges </v>

2283
01:51:24.671 --> 01:51:26.270
<v Speaker 4>and the rest removed the total fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>percentage recommendation.</v>

2284
01:51:26.271 --> 01:51:30.620
<v Speaker 4>It remainS at 20 to thIrty five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fairly modest fat intake.</v>

2285
01:51:30.650 --> 01:51:32.260
<v Speaker 4>I have to look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the specific</v>

2286
01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:35.580
<v Speaker 5>language to see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My recollection is that the,</v>

2287
01:51:35.890 --> 01:51:40.890
<v Speaker 5>in the same way that there is some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a contradiction with the cholesterol.</v>

2288
01:51:42.461 --> 01:51:46.390
<v Speaker 5>There's a sentence that says cholesterol</v>
<v Speaker 5>is no longer a nutrient of concern.</v>

2289
01:51:46.450 --> 01:51:51.450
<v Speaker 5>And then joel mentioned that he and his </v>
<v Speaker 5>cardiologist friends got them to add </v>

2290
01:51:51.450 --> 01:51:52.750
<v Speaker 5>something back that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2291
01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:55.010
<v Speaker 5>kind of seem to step back from that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2292
01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:58.930
<v Speaker 5>and I think the same thing happened with</v>
<v Speaker 5>total fat.</v>

2293
01:51:58.931 --> 01:52:00.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I can't,</v>

2294
01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:03.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't have it to look at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we?</v>

2295
01:52:03.310 --> 01:52:08.310
<v Speaker 5>This is so because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like it's a major point of </v>

2296
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:11.011
<v Speaker 5>dispute and joel says it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It isn't because the the still the </v>

2297
01:52:11.011 --> 01:52:15.700
<v Speaker 5>question at hand is what do the meta </v>
<v Speaker 5>analysis of randomized controlled trials</v>

2298
01:52:15.701 --> 01:52:20.701
<v Speaker 5>and what do the reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 5>large reviews of observational studies,</v>

2299
01:52:20.771 --> 01:52:25.771
<v Speaker 5>including over a million participants </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggest about the influence of saturated</v>

2300
01:52:26.681 --> 01:52:31.681
<v Speaker 5>fat on important markers like heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>disease and total mortality.</v>

2301
01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:36.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm still waiting to hear about a study </v>
<v Speaker 5>that shows that eating more saturated,</v>

2302
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:43.070
<v Speaker 5>a convincing review of meta analyses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a meta analysis of randomized control </v>

2303
01:52:44.081 --> 01:52:49.081
<v Speaker 5>trials or even large observational data </v>
<v Speaker 5>that lasted for more than a short period</v>

2304
01:52:49.101 --> 01:52:54.101
<v Speaker 5>of time that shows that eating saturated</v>
<v Speaker 5>fat and I'm not even talking about in </v>

2305
01:52:54.141 --> 01:52:57.500
<v Speaker 5>the context of a healthy diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a whole other discussion,</v>

2306
01:52:57.890 --> 01:53:01.400
<v Speaker 5>but just in any diet increases the risk </v>
<v Speaker 5>of heart disease.</v>

2307
01:53:02.130 --> 01:53:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Can I stop you please?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we were discussing this on the </v>

2308
01:53:07.130 --> 01:53:10.191
<v Speaker 1>assumption that the usta had changed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>requirements for fat joel saying that's </v>

2309
01:53:10.351 --> 01:53:12.360
<v Speaker 1>a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think we should clarify that.</v>

2310
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:13.050
<v Speaker 1>we should find out.</v>

2311
01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Choose my plate.gov.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right here.</v>

2312
01:53:15.931 --> 01:53:20.931
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand 15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2020 questions about the usda </v>

2313
01:53:20.931 --> 01:53:24.150
<v Speaker 4>guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It said healthy diets can include up to </v>

2314
01:53:24.150 --> 01:53:24.600
<v Speaker 4>35 percent of calories from fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put a clearcut limit on it.</v>

2315
01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:25.390
<v Speaker 4>It's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2316
01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:27.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm reading it and not making it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

2317
01:53:27.461 --> 01:53:28.890
<v Speaker 4>So usda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a government.</v>

2318
01:53:29.010 --> 01:53:32.520
<v Speaker 5>So what was it that you remembered from </v>
<v Speaker 5>2010 and did you remember it?</v>

2319
01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:37.440
<v Speaker 5>Erroneously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's see here.</v>

2320
01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:41.510
<v Speaker 4>So fucking complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2321
01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:43.110
<v Speaker 4>it's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:53:43.111 --> 01:53:48.111
<v Speaker 4>Each vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything else follows and have some </v>

2323
01:53:48.111 --> 01:53:48.990
<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love your fellow man.</v>

2324
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:54.750
<v Speaker 5>I have an anecdote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I.</v>

2325
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:59.620
<v Speaker 5>This came from a paper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was talking about the um,</v>

2326
01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:02.150
<v Speaker 5>the shift and the guidelines and I need </v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2327
01:54:02.970 --> 01:54:04.790
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2328
01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:05.550
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2329
01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.410
<v Speaker 5>why don't you tell us,</v>

2330

<v Speaker 1>and we'll,</v>

2331
01:54:08.031 --> 01:54:09.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get into this.</v>

2332
01:54:09.330 --> 01:54:11.810
<v Speaker 4>So I goTta tell ya,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love chris kresser.</v>

2333
01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:15.230
<v Speaker 4>I want everybody to know that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very famous food doc in santa rosa named</v>

2334
01:54:15.231 --> 01:54:20.231
<v Speaker 4>john mcdougal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been treated people with crazy </v>

2335
01:54:20.231 --> 01:54:21.800
<v Speaker 4>plant based,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high complex carb diets.</v>

2336
01:54:21.801 --> 01:54:26.801
<v Speaker 4>He reverses diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that his newsletter came out just </v>

2337
01:54:26.801 --> 01:54:27.080
<v Speaker 4>as I'm pulling up here and bumped into </v>
<v Speaker 4>chris.</v>

2338
01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:29.000
<v Speaker 4>We actually walked in exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2339
01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:34.060
<v Speaker 4>He quotes the new testament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to read this because as a </v>

2340
01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:34.060
<v Speaker 4>jewish boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got to read it.</v>

2341
01:54:34.130 --> 01:54:37.040
<v Speaker 4>One man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Faith allows indeed everything.</v>

2342
01:54:37.041 --> 01:54:38.810
<v Speaker 4>There's some people around the table </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they would do that.</v>

2343
01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.200
<v Speaker 4>Another man's faith allows him to eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>only vegetables.</v>

2344
01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:45.040
<v Speaker 4>The man who eats everything must not </v>
<v Speaker 4>look down on him.</v>

2345
01:54:45.070 --> 01:54:50.070
<v Speaker 4>He eats only vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That man who does not eat everything </v>

2346
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:50.070
<v Speaker 4>must not condemn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The man who does.</v>

2347
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:54.340
<v Speaker 4>There should be peace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that is such a freaking </v>

2348
01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:56.621
<v Speaker 4>beautiful cats because we do need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>leave here as promoters of healthy </v>

2349
01:54:56.621 --> 01:55:00.761
<v Speaker 4>lifestyles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether we call it the harvard school </v>

2350
01:55:00.761 --> 01:55:00.761
<v Speaker 4>public health,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to live 14 years longer,</v>

2351
01:55:00.761 --> 01:55:02.510
<v Speaker 4>the blue zones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to live like loma linda,</v>

2352
01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:05.050
<v Speaker 4>whether you want to eat game that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt,</v>

2353
01:55:05.051 --> 01:55:09.110
<v Speaker 4>that is probably eight times less </v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat than what you're buying at</v>

2354
01:55:09.111 --> 01:55:10.250
<v Speaker 4>the damn grocery store.</v>

2355
01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:15.520
<v Speaker 4>You know people eat your vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People be really quality over quantity </v>

2356
01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:20.020
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to tell you at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about eating less and taking </v>

2357
01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:21.080
<v Speaker 4>some breaks for meetings so you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>activate anti aging pathways,</v>

2358
01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:22.630
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

2359
01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:24.350
<v Speaker 4>it isn't all food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sometimes too much.</v>

2360
01:55:24.351 --> 01:55:26.470
<v Speaker 4>Food is probably one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem for sure.</v>

2361
01:55:26.471 --> 01:55:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2362
01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:28.390
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we all agree about that.</v>

2363
01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I think the real question is for someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>like me who really doesn't know.</v>

2364
01:55:32.590 --> 01:55:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

2365
01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm baffled by the saturated fat dispute</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems to be there's one of </v>

2366
01:55:39.671 --> 01:55:42.850
<v Speaker 1>you has got to be wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The evidence has got a point.</v>

2367
01:55:42.851 --> 01:55:47.851
<v Speaker 1>One or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris is saying the evidence points to </v>

2368
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:50.860
<v Speaker 1>be not an issue at all and you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>your points to being a major issue </v>

2369
01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:55.590
<v Speaker 1>worldwide consensus worldwide consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these groups that rely on current</v>

2370
01:55:55.591 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 1>science that may or may not be behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the times.</v>

2371
01:55:58.250 --> 01:56:00.410
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I want to step back and just clarify</v>

2372
01:56:00.411 --> 01:56:02.850
<v Speaker 5>my position here because I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2373
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:05.630
<v Speaker 5>we started by saying there's no one size</v>
<v Speaker 5>fits all approach.</v>

2374
01:56:05.690 --> 01:56:10.690
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these studies just tell us about </v>

2375
01:56:10.690 --> 01:56:13.661
<v Speaker 5>averages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They tell us what happens on average </v>

2376
01:56:13.661 --> 01:56:14.870
<v Speaker 5>when a group of people do something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't tell us actually what happens</v>

2377
01:56:14.871 --> 01:56:16.730
<v Speaker 5>for person a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>person b,</v>

2378
01:56:16.731 --> 01:56:19.010
<v Speaker 5>person c,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that can be different.</v>

2379
01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:20.030
<v Speaker 5>So if you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2380
01:56:20.031 --> 01:56:25.031
<v Speaker 5>some people may experience a slight </v>
<v Speaker 5>increase in their cholesterol from </v>

2381
01:56:25.031 --> 01:56:28.831
<v Speaker 5>eating saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people might actually experience a </v>

2382
01:56:28.831 --> 01:56:29.630
<v Speaker 5>slight decrease and on a net basis that </v>
<v Speaker 5>averages out,</v>

2383
01:56:29.770 --> 01:56:30.960
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2384
01:56:31.130 --> 01:56:36.130
<v Speaker 5>I think the next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next generation of science is going </v>

2385
01:56:36.171 --> 01:56:41.171
<v Speaker 5>to be more of an understanding of how </v>
<v Speaker 5>various dietary components and various </v>

2386
01:56:42.801 --> 01:56:47.801
<v Speaker 5>foods affect people on an individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>level because let's say there's someone </v>

2387
01:56:47.801 --> 01:56:51.140
<v Speaker 5>who's got genetic polymorphisms that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that mean that for that person,</v>

2388
01:56:51.141 --> 01:56:53.810
<v Speaker 5>if they eat a diet that's very high in </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat,</v>

2389
01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:58.220
<v Speaker 5>their ldl particle number,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a risk factor for heart disease</v>

2390
01:56:58.221 --> 01:56:58.950
<v Speaker 5>is going to go up.</v>

2391
01:56:59.110 --> 01:57:01.520
<v Speaker 5>I've seen that in my clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2392
01:57:01.521 --> 01:57:06.521
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that saturated fat will </v>
<v Speaker 5>never increased cholesterol or ldl </v>

2393
01:57:06.521 --> 01:57:09.590
<v Speaker 5>particle number in people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just not true.</v>

2394
01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:12.190
<v Speaker 5>And it will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will,</v>

2395
01:57:12.250 --> 01:57:14.730
<v Speaker 5>it will happen in some cases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2396
01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:17.360
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm reporting on the science,</v>

2397
01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:18.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

2398
01:57:18.111 --> 01:57:23.111
<v Speaker 5>in terms of the general question of is </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat going to increase the risk</v>

2399
01:57:24.111 --> 01:57:29.111
<v Speaker 5>of heart disease and is it going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>increase the risk of death on average </v>

2400
01:57:29.301 --> 01:57:33.080
<v Speaker 5>according to the available research?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer to that is no.</v>

2401
01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:35.330
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the next question is,</v>

2402
01:57:35.690 --> 01:57:40.690
<v Speaker 5>should you joe eat a very diet high in </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat or should I or should </v>

2403
01:57:41.451 --> 01:57:43.190
<v Speaker 5>jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a different question.</v>

2404
01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:48.220
<v Speaker 5>And unfortunately science is not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've been so focused on these </v>

2405
01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:53.130
<v Speaker 5>population level recommendations and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea that there's one diet that works </v>

2406
01:57:53.130 --> 01:57:56.650
<v Speaker 5>for everyone and we don't have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>research that answers that question.</v>

2407
01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:59.570
<v Speaker 5>That's a big gap in current science.</v>

2408
01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2409
01:58:01.291 --> 01:58:06.291
<v Speaker 1>did you find out if you made an error on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this 2010 requirement from the usta?</v>

2410
01:58:06.690 --> 01:58:07.320
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2411
01:58:07.650 --> 01:58:11.490
<v Speaker 5>this came from a study that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that reference said,</v>

2412
01:58:11.491 --> 01:58:15.000
<v Speaker 5>despite a lack of evidence supporting </v>
<v Speaker 5>low fat diets only in 2010,</v>

2413
01:58:15.001 --> 01:58:18.660
<v Speaker 5>did the dietary guidelines committee </v>
<v Speaker 5>stop recommending limits on total fat?</v>

2414
01:58:19.090 --> 01:58:24.090
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't have the full guidelines in </v>

2415
01:58:24.090 --> 01:58:24.090
<v Speaker 5>front of me and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

2416
01:58:24.150 --> 01:58:27.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure what the language says so I</v>
<v Speaker 5>could have made an error.</v>

2417
01:58:27.931 --> 01:58:28.380
<v Speaker 5>It's possible.</v>

2418
01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you made it based on that,</v>

2419
01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:36.390
<v Speaker 1>what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was what assumption in another </v>

2420
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:38.911
<v Speaker 1>study now in terms of saturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there are an increased risk when </v>

2421
01:58:40.511 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 1>you consume fat</v>

2422
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:45.130
<v Speaker 5>with refined sugars?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There absolutely is.</v>

2423
01:58:45.131 --> 01:58:47.190
<v Speaker 5>This is another example of where it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>at.</v>

2424
01:58:47.191 --> 01:58:49.540
<v Speaker 5>Mcallen is context matters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2425
01:58:49.541 --> 01:58:54.541
<v Speaker 5>let me just even step back a second and </v>
<v Speaker 5>say that the primary sources of </v>

2426
01:58:55.630 --> 01:58:58.810
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is important to understand when</v>

2427
01:58:58.811 --> 01:59:03.811
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at epidemiological data,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the sources of saturated fat in the </v>

2428
01:59:04.391 --> 01:59:07.540
<v Speaker 5>american diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>33 percent comes from pizza,</v>

2429
01:59:07.541 --> 01:59:08.770
<v Speaker 5>desserts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>candy,</v>

2430
01:59:08.771 --> 01:59:10.900
<v Speaker 5>potato chips,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pasta tortillas,</v>

2431
01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:12.460
<v Speaker 5>burritos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and tacos.</v>

2432
01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:16.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm 24 And a half percent is unaccounted</v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

2433
01:59:16.751 --> 01:59:19.840
<v Speaker 5>but most likely processed foods </v>
<v Speaker 5>according to the authors.</v>

2434
01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:25.090
<v Speaker 5>And then 10 percent is almost 10 percent</v>
<v Speaker 5>sausages,</v>

2435
01:59:25.091 --> 01:59:26.290
<v Speaker 5>hot dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bacon,</v>

2436
01:59:26.890 --> 01:59:30.070
<v Speaker 5>ribs and burgers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the vast majority of saturated,</v>

2437
01:59:30.250 --> 01:59:35.250
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a 13 percent is chicken and mixed </v>

2438
01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:37.921
<v Speaker 5>chicken dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think kfc or chicken nuggets and eggs </v>

2439
01:59:39.731 --> 01:59:44.731
<v Speaker 5>and mixed egg dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the vast majority of saturated fat </v>

2440
01:59:44.731 --> 01:59:46.420
<v Speaker 5>that americans are eating is coming from</v>
<v Speaker 5>junk,</v>

2441
01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:48.990
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So even in an observational,</v>

2442
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:54.030
<v Speaker 5>even if we did see an increase in harm </v>
<v Speaker 5>from saturated fat and observational </v>

2443
01:59:54.071 --> 01:59:57.010
<v Speaker 5>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we still couldn't say that that would be</v>

2444
01:59:57.011 --> 02:00:00.760
<v Speaker 5>true for someone who's eating what I </v>
<v Speaker 5>would call like a neutral board diet,</v>

2445
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:02.230
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2446
02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:04.420
<v Speaker 5>whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fruits and vegetables,</v>

2447
02:00:04.421 --> 02:00:09.421
<v Speaker 5>nuts and seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and some starchy plants like sweet </v>

2448
02:00:09.421 --> 02:00:11.620
<v Speaker 5>potatoes and animal products including </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat.</v>

2449
02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:16.620
<v Speaker 5>We have no research that suggests that </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat in that context is </v>

2450
02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:21.181
<v Speaker 5>harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the mechanism that makes </v>

2451
02:00:21.181 --> 02:00:21.400
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat more harmful when it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>consumed with sugar?</v>

2452
02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:24.140
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a,</v>

2453
02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:26.410
<v Speaker 5>there is an interesting study that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>done,</v>

2454
02:00:26.610 --> 02:00:27.730
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by,</v>

2455
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:31.450
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that showed that in the context of a key</v>

2456
02:00:31.451 --> 02:00:36.160
<v Speaker 5>to genic diet where there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no sugar essentially or very low amounts</v>

2457
02:00:36.161 --> 02:00:39.280
<v Speaker 5>of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that dietary saturated fat will actually</v>

2458
02:00:39.281 --> 02:00:43.090
<v Speaker 5>decrease blood levels of saturated fatty</v>
<v Speaker 5>acids.</v>

2459
02:00:43.150 --> 02:00:46.390
<v Speaker 5>And that if you're eating refined </v>
<v Speaker 5>carbohydrates,</v>

2460
02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:48.270
<v Speaker 5>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2461
02:00:48.850 --> 02:00:53.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see an increase in saturated fatty </v>

2462
02:00:53.850 --> 02:00:54.250
<v Speaker 5>acids that comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2463
02:00:54.970 --> 02:00:58.310
<v Speaker 5>the effects of insulin essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2464
02:00:58.330 --> 02:01:03.330
<v Speaker 5>let me find you the specific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're eating a high carbohydrate </v>

2465
02:01:03.330 --> 02:01:04.240
<v Speaker 5>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will,</v>

2466
02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:10.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>increase insulin which inhibits the </v>

2467
02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:13.021
<v Speaker 5>oxidation of saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And So then when insulin levels are </v>

2468
02:01:13.021 --> 02:01:16.291
<v Speaker 5>high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat tends to be stored rather </v>

2469
02:01:16.291 --> 02:01:17.810
<v Speaker 5>than beIng burned as fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then high carb diet can put an,</v>

2470
02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:19.500
<v Speaker 5>and I'm mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>refined carbs here,</v>

2471
02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:20.190
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2472
02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:24.490
<v Speaker 5>fruits and vegetables can promote the </v>
<v Speaker 5>synthesis of saturated fat in the liver.</v>

2473
02:01:24.491 --> 02:01:29.491
<v Speaker 5>So it actually causes the liver to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>more saturated fatty acids in the serum.</v>

2474
02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:35.280
<v Speaker 5>But this study here is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this showed that a controlled feeding </v>

2475
02:01:37.121 --> 02:01:40.400
<v Speaker 5>studies have shown that refined </v>
<v Speaker 5>carbohydrates,</v>

2476
02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:45.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will actually increase levels of </v>

2477
02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:47.840
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat in the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas eating saturated fat in the diet</v>

2478
02:01:47.841 --> 02:01:48.880
<v Speaker 4>does not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they're,</v>

2479
02:01:49.130 --> 02:01:51.860
<v Speaker 4>if the diet is not high in those </v>
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrates.</v>

2480
02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:53.270
<v Speaker 4>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your take on that?</v>

2481
02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:54.140
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2482
02:01:54.141 --> 02:01:56.550
<v Speaker 4>the only key point I make to answer your</v>
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>

2483
02:01:56.890 --> 02:02:01.890
<v Speaker 4>chris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is why does high sugar diets combined </v>

2484
02:02:01.890 --> 02:02:01.890
<v Speaker 4>with high saturated fat diet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because,</v>

2485
02:02:01.890 --> 02:02:03.100
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back to biochemistry.</v>

2486
02:02:03.110 --> 02:02:05.630
<v Speaker 4>This is serious science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're saturated fat.</v>

2487
02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:09.650
<v Speaker 4>It's usually found in meat and other </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal based products.</v>

2488
02:02:09.651 --> 02:02:13.170
<v Speaker 4>It does exist in plants like a seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>avocado,</v>

2489
02:02:13.171 --> 02:02:14.750
<v Speaker 4>salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the olives and olive oil.</v>

2490
02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:16.840
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a pathway,</v>

2491
02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:18.260
<v Speaker 4>get insights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's real stuff.</v>

2492
02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:23.560
<v Speaker 4>The pro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amino acids found in red meat out </v>

2493
02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:26.491
<v Speaker 4>combined with their saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's content triggers a pathway that </v>

2494
02:02:26.491 --> 02:02:27.410
<v Speaker 4>accelerates aging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to age fast.</v>

2495
02:02:27.590 --> 02:02:30.170
<v Speaker 4>That's called mtor pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the igf one pathway.</v>

2496
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:32.210
<v Speaker 4>Then you eat a diet rich in sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2497
02:02:32.211 --> 02:02:34.730
<v Speaker 4>we know about chemistry right here in </v>
<v Speaker 4>los angeles,</v>

2498
02:02:34.731 --> 02:02:37.550
<v Speaker 4>university of southern California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bow gerontology institute.</v>

2499
02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:42.740
<v Speaker 4>Eat a lot of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You activate another aging pathway </v>

2500
02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:43.670
<v Speaker 4>called a pk ras,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and these two pathways,</v>

2501
02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:44.600
<v Speaker 4>mtor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>igf one,</v>

2502
02:02:44.601 --> 02:02:47.270
<v Speaker 4>pk rest will make you an old man or an </v>
<v Speaker 4>old woman quicker.</v>

2503
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:52.450
<v Speaker 4>So when you're eating pastries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is high saturated fat and high </v>

2504
02:02:52.450 --> 02:02:54.350
<v Speaker 4>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you're eating a meal with a coke,</v>

2505
02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:55.820
<v Speaker 4>how common is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2506
02:02:55.821 --> 02:02:57.230
<v Speaker 4>my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hamburger and a coke,</v>

2507
02:02:57.410 --> 02:03:02.410
<v Speaker 4>you're activating everything we know </v>
<v Speaker 4>about science that will make you age </v>

2508
02:03:02.410 --> 02:03:02.410
<v Speaker 4>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sucks.</v>

2509
02:03:02.410 --> 02:03:07.390
<v Speaker 4>So is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That eating meat and the amino acids </v>

2510
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:11.321
<v Speaker 4>accelerate the aging process?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no studies that show that eating</v>

2511
02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:16.490
<v Speaker 4>meat in the context of a healthy diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>shortens your lifespan.</v>

2512
02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:17.930
<v Speaker 4>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if so,</v>

2513
02:03:17.931 --> 02:03:21.380
<v Speaker 4>if that were true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we would see that in the data.</v>

2514
02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:26.740
<v Speaker 4>But joel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about an actual physical </v>

2515
02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:27.380
<v Speaker 4>mechanism that accelerates the aging </v>
<v Speaker 4>processes as well known that,</v>

2516
02:03:27.381 --> 02:03:28.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it called again?</v>

2517
02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:30.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's empty.</v>

2518
02:03:30.091 --> 02:03:33.740
<v Speaker 4>Your igf one is one pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And pk rest the chemistry is not.</v>

2519
02:03:33.741 --> 02:03:35.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like high level science.</v>

2520
02:03:35.481 --> 02:03:36.560
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

2521
02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:39.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm not stretching on the limb here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2522
02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:43.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>protein is really amino acids.</v>

2523
02:03:43.101 --> 02:03:44.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get this question,</v>

2524
02:03:44.271 --> 02:03:45.860
<v Speaker 4>you're a vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where'd you get your protein?</v>

2525
02:03:45.861 --> 02:03:47.840
<v Speaker 4>My answers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do you get your amino acids?</v>

2526
02:03:47.841 --> 02:03:52.841
<v Speaker 4>Because my body breaks protein down into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the building blocks and then I build a </v>

2527
02:03:52.841 --> 02:03:53.210
<v Speaker 4>backup to wherever the hell I needed for</v>
<v Speaker 4>its,</v>

2528
02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:54.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>acids in meat.</v>

2529
02:03:54.621 --> 02:03:56.360
<v Speaker 4>There's amino acids in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a mommy,</v>

2530
02:03:56.361 --> 02:04:00.410
<v Speaker 4>wherever I want to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The the split of those 20 amino acids is</v>

2531
02:04:00.411 --> 02:04:02.240
<v Speaker 4>different and meat than it isn't at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mommy.</v>

2532
02:04:02.370 --> 02:04:05.390
<v Speaker 4>There's more methodically and in a more </v>
<v Speaker 4>loose and very technical stuff.</v>

2533
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:10.430
<v Speaker 4>Leucine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there were some mixes that branch </v>

2534
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:10.790
<v Speaker 4>chain amino acids of lucy and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know what the hell that does your aging,</v>

2535
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.520
<v Speaker 4>but we do know that meet rich in </v>
<v Speaker 4>matthias.</v>

2536
02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:18.540
<v Speaker 4>Then we'll activate mtor and igf one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it is a very strong factor in aging.</v>

2537
02:04:19.281 --> 02:04:22.430
<v Speaker 4>You want a low mathiasson and diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so another reason,</v>

2538
02:04:22.610 --> 02:04:27.610
<v Speaker 4>plant based eaters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to take be 12 to keep their </v>

2539
02:04:27.610 --> 02:04:27.610
<v Speaker 4>homocysteine to methionine and down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a separate topic,</v>

2540
02:04:27.610 --> 02:04:32.230
<v Speaker 4>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amino acid mixed found in animal </v>

2541
02:04:32.230 --> 02:04:33.860
<v Speaker 4>protein is different than the amino acid</v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed found in vegetable protein,</v>

2542
02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:36.650
<v Speaker 4>which is why when morgan levine looks at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question,</v>

2543
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:39.720
<v Speaker 4>what is your survival?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your cancer risks?</v>

2544
02:04:39.721 --> 02:04:42.450
<v Speaker 4>Which are heart risk on animal protein </v>
<v Speaker 4>and plant protein?</v>

2545
02:04:42.451 --> 02:04:45.210
<v Speaker 4>Plant protein beats the crap out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal Protein.</v>

2546
02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:50.420
<v Speaker 4>This is high level cell metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try and publish a paper in cell </v>

2547
02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:54.141
<v Speaker 4>metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beat the crap out of animal protein </v>

2548
02:04:54.141 --> 02:04:56.960
<v Speaker 4>because there's a 300 to 400 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>increase in cancer of those diets </v>

2549
02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:01.850
<v Speaker 4>concentrating on protein of animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>source and there's a 25 percent </v>

2550
02:05:01.850 --> 02:05:04.971
<v Speaker 4>reduction in cardiovascular disease cell</v>
<v Speaker 4>metasys in 2014 morgan levine of </v>

2551
02:05:04.971 --> 02:05:09.591
<v Speaker 4>harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's questioning or work october </v>

2552
02:05:09.591 --> 02:05:12.171
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2016 song at harvard animal protein </v>

2553
02:05:12.171 --> 02:05:15.360
<v Speaker 4>plant protein lead to very different </v>
<v Speaker 4>outcomes in large database observational</v>

2554
02:05:15.361 --> 02:05:18.060
<v Speaker 4>studies at the highest level because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't take 6,000</v>

2555
02:05:18.061 --> 02:05:19.770
<v Speaker 4>people in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>randomize them in that way.</v>

2556
02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:22.140
<v Speaker 4>So if you're waiTing for that to resolve</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question,</v>

2557
02:05:22.650 --> 02:05:23.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>

2558
02:05:23.650 --> 02:05:28.650
<v Speaker 5>Actually not the case cd I irc panel </v>
<v Speaker 5>that confirm that concluded that that </v>

2559
02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:33.200
<v Speaker 5>processed meat led to an 18 percent </v>
<v Speaker 5>increase in cancer risk,</v>

2560
02:05:33.201 --> 02:05:37.610
<v Speaker 5>which again is like indistinguishable </v>
<v Speaker 5>from chance using that low of a relative</v>

2561
02:05:37.611 --> 02:05:38.760
<v Speaker 5>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They.</v>

2562
02:05:38.780 --> 02:05:43.780
<v Speaker 5>Their conclusion was that the fresh red </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat lead was a point zero to one point </v>

2563
02:05:45.770 --> 02:05:50.770
<v Speaker 5>zero two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a two percent increase in many </v>

2564
02:05:50.770 --> 02:05:53.261
<v Speaker 5>other studies have shown that </v>
<v Speaker 5>unprocessed red meat is not associated </v>

2565
02:05:53.261 --> 02:05:58.241
<v Speaker 5>with increase in cancer risk and is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with increase in heart </v>

2566
02:05:58.241 --> 02:05:59.390
<v Speaker 5>disease risk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So again,</v>

2567
02:05:59.391 --> 02:06:02.240
<v Speaker 5>you can talk about these proposed </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanisms all day long,</v>

2568
02:06:02.630 --> 02:06:07.460
<v Speaker 5>but if it's not showing up in actual </v>
<v Speaker 5>events that are meaningful to people,</v>

2569
02:06:07.461 --> 02:06:12.461
<v Speaker 5>then you might be missing something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe red meat does act in certain way </v>

2570
02:06:13.551 --> 02:06:16.190
<v Speaker 5>that you might think would increase the </v>
<v Speaker 5>risk of death,</v>

2571
02:06:16.191 --> 02:06:19.010
<v Speaker 5>but maybe it does other things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>reduce the risk of death.</v>

2572
02:06:19.011 --> 02:06:22.220
<v Speaker 5>And that's why we can't just focus on </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanistic studies.</v>

2573
02:06:22.221 --> 02:06:25.340
<v Speaker 5>We have to look at actual endpoints that</v>
<v Speaker 5>matter to people</v>

2574
02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:28.910
<v Speaker 4>in terms of the quality of animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>testing cancer matter.</v>

2575
02:06:28.911 --> 02:06:29.910
<v Speaker 4>Chris and I know you know,</v>

2576
02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:35.300
<v Speaker 5>said they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The studies don't show that fresh meat </v>

2577
02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:38.430
<v Speaker 5>increases the risk of fresh red meat </v>
<v Speaker 5>increased the risk of death and cancer </v>

2578
02:06:38.430 --> 02:06:38.560
<v Speaker 5>and heart disease.</v>

2579
02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:43.800
<v Speaker 4>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the number that you were </v>

2580
02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:43.800
<v Speaker 4>saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>300 percent.</v>

2581
02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:43.800
<v Speaker 4>It's ready to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2582
02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:44.640
<v Speaker 4>March 4th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2014 cell metabolism.</v>

2583
02:06:44.690 --> 02:06:46.100
<v Speaker 4>Morgan levine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right here.</v>

2584
02:06:46.110 --> 02:06:48.930
<v Speaker 4>Animal protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seventy five percent increase in death.</v>

2585
02:06:48.931 --> 02:06:52.690
<v Speaker 4>Four hundred percent increase in cancer </v>
<v Speaker 4>over 18 year followup.</v>

2586
02:06:52.890 --> 02:06:56.700
<v Speaker 4>These findings were not found with plant</v>
<v Speaker 4>based protein.</v>

2587
02:06:56.820 --> 02:07:00.050
<v Speaker 4>So let's talk about reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna reveal giants.</v>

2588
02:07:00.430 --> 02:07:05.430
<v Speaker 4>This is reviews our science tool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that reviews of </v>

2589
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:09.831
<v Speaker 4>observational studies and reviews of med</v>
<v Speaker 4>analyses are not science if you would </v>

2590
02:07:09.831 --> 02:07:12.090
<v Speaker 4>prefer to draw conclusions based on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>single study?</v>

2591
02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:17.180
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that I wouldn't want to a single </v>

2592
02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:19.341
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is very consistent with the </v>

2593
02:07:19.341 --> 02:07:19.341
<v Speaker 4>overall high level of igf one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>pk,</v>

2594
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:19.710
<v Speaker 4>I was</v>

2595
02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:24.710
<v Speaker 5>just referring to research that several </v>
<v Speaker 5>large reviews that have not found a </v>

2596
02:07:24.710 --> 02:07:26.910
<v Speaker 5>relationship between red,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fresh,</v>

2597
02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:30.480
<v Speaker 5>red meat and cancer and fresh red meat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and heart disease,</v>

2598
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:35.510
<v Speaker 5>so professor to look at reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That can include lots of studies and </v>

2599
02:07:35.861 --> 02:07:39.640
<v Speaker 5>just a single study that supports a </v>
<v Speaker 5>particular viewpoint.</v>

2600
02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

2601
02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2602
02:07:41.940 --> 02:07:44.010
<v Speaker 2>but we need more than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2603
02:07:44.070 --> 02:07:45.640
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 300 percent,</v>

2604
02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:47.330
<v Speaker 2>what does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me let.</v>

2605
02:07:47.590 --> 02:07:50.050
<v Speaker 2>It's it's human study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are real lives.</v>

2606
02:07:50.051 --> 02:07:52.150
<v Speaker 2>These are real desks and these are real </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer cases.</v>

2607
02:07:52.151 --> 02:07:57.151
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the original science and in one </v>

2608
02:07:57.151 --> 02:07:59.911
<v Speaker 2>of the highest level of epidemiology </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they don't take into account all </v>

2609
02:07:59.911 --> 02:08:01.000
<v Speaker 2>the other risk factors and then the rest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their diet,</v>

2610
02:08:01.001 --> 02:08:03.250
<v Speaker 2>smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sedentary lifestyle,</v>

2611
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:05.030
<v Speaker 2>obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the burial.</v>

2612
02:08:05.710 --> 02:08:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll answer in a second to download the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole paper,</v>

2613
02:08:07.721 --> 02:08:08.610
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do that.</v>

2614
02:08:09.010 --> 02:08:09.820
<v Speaker 2>They do multivariate</v>

2615
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:15.750
<v Speaker 5>noting that there is a 2011 meta </v>
<v Speaker 5>analysis of 34 prospective studies on </v>

2616
02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:19.540
<v Speaker 5>red meat and colorectal cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which said the event that's 34 studies,</v>

2617
02:08:19.570 --> 02:08:24.490
<v Speaker 5>the available epidemiologic data are not</v>
<v Speaker 5>sufficient to support an independent and</v>

2618
02:08:24.491 --> 02:08:28.840
<v Speaker 5>unequivocal positive association between</v>
<v Speaker 5>red meat intake and colorectal cancer.</v>

2619
02:08:29.250 --> 02:08:32.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>2015 meta analysis,</v>

2620
02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:37.400
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did find a relationship with processed </v>

2621
02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:38.260
<v Speaker 5>meat but did not find a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2622
02:08:38.350 --> 02:08:43.330
<v Speaker 5>with fresh red meat is also an issue of </v>
<v Speaker 5>dose response.</v>

2623
02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:46.090
<v Speaker 5>If we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if red meat did cause cancer,</v>

2624
02:08:46.091 --> 02:08:51.091
<v Speaker 5>then you'd expect to see a continuous </v>
<v Speaker 5>increase in cancer rates as the intake </v>

2625
02:08:51.091 --> 02:08:55.051
<v Speaker 5>of red meat increased.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in many cases you actually see the </v>

2626
02:08:55.051 --> 02:08:58.531
<v Speaker 5>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can see a decrease in cancer rates </v>

2627
02:08:58.531 --> 02:08:58.531
<v Speaker 5>and the people who ate the most red </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat,</v>

2628
02:08:58.531 --> 02:09:00.070
<v Speaker 5>which cast some doubt on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>association.</v>

2629
02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:02.470
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

2630
02:09:02.710 --> 02:09:05.740
<v Speaker 5>we come back to the relative risks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It like,</v>

2631
02:09:05.810 --> 02:09:06.640
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2632
02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:08.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even with processed meat,</v>

2633
02:09:08.741 --> 02:09:13.741
<v Speaker 5>it's only 18 percent and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>consider the healthy user bias that we </v>

2634
02:09:13.741 --> 02:09:15.010
<v Speaker 5>talked about before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And with fresh red meat,</v>

2635
02:09:15.011 --> 02:09:18.700
<v Speaker 5>it's either nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero or maybe like two percent.</v>

2636
02:09:19.090 --> 02:09:24.090
<v Speaker 5>And that's just like that level in </v>
<v Speaker 5>observational research is not </v>

2637
02:09:24.090 --> 02:09:28.471
<v Speaker 5>distinguishable from chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You cannot draw any concluSions on that </v>

2638
02:09:28.471 --> 02:09:32.100
<v Speaker 5>and you cannot assume that someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating a nutrient or diet with fresh </v>

2639
02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:35.530
<v Speaker 5>whole foods and is including some red </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat in that diet.</v>

2640
02:09:35.531 --> 02:09:39.550
<v Speaker 5>It's going to have the same response as </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who's eating pizza,</v>

2641
02:09:39.551 --> 02:09:42.640
<v Speaker 5>candy hot dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all kinds of other,</v>

2642
02:09:42.730 --> 02:09:44.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>junk food that's just not,</v>

2643
02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:45.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>common sense will tell you.</v>

2644
02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Hence the problem with these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2645
02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joel,</v>

2646
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:52.580
<v Speaker 2>chris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want a low igf one are.</v>

2647
02:09:52.581 --> 02:09:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Hi jeff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One you want to low igf one?</v>

2648
02:09:55.461 --> 02:09:57.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just say I want to live a long,</v>

2649
02:09:57.531 --> 02:09:58.220
<v Speaker 2>healthy life.</v>

2650
02:09:58.420 --> 02:09:59.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be,</v>

2651
02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:03.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm obsessing over individual markers.</v>

2652
02:10:03.911 --> 02:10:04.650
<v Speaker 5>I want to live.</v>

2653
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a lot of markers when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to low carb steady,</v>

2654
02:10:08.041 --> 02:10:10.890
<v Speaker 2>she wanted a low igf one for survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scientists strong.</v>

2655
02:10:10.891 --> 02:10:15.891
<v Speaker 2>This is la science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're not making this stuff up </v>

2656
02:10:15.891 --> 02:10:18.510
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thigh and into leucine and meat </v>

2657
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.630
<v Speaker 2>raises igf one and at least periodically</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a break.</v>

2658
02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raises insulin growth factor,</v>

2659
02:10:22.590 --> 02:10:25.020
<v Speaker 2>which will take your press prostate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your breast tissue,</v>

2660
02:10:25.021 --> 02:10:27.480
<v Speaker 2>makes it start growing at age 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the.</v>

2661
02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's our males are for women,</v>

2662
02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:30.050
<v Speaker 2>for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2663
02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:31.980
<v Speaker 2>just because the frequency of breast </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer women,</v>

2664
02:10:31.981 --> 02:10:32.980
<v Speaker 2>it's women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2665
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>there is a relationship</v>

2666
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.040
<v Speaker 4>between animal products.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In breast cancer,</v>

2667
02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:38.630
<v Speaker 4>there's a opposite relations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are relationships.</v>

2668
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:41.260
<v Speaker 4>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are his petri dish.</v>

2669
02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:42.800
<v Speaker 4>Let me just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back about chemistry.</v>

2670
02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:44.730
<v Speaker 4>You take breast cancer cells in a petri </v>
<v Speaker 4>dish,</v>

2671
02:10:44.731 --> 02:10:46.280
<v Speaker 4>you put plant proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they stopped growing.</v>

2672
02:10:46.281 --> 02:10:47.900
<v Speaker 4>You put animal proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they start growing.</v>

2673
02:10:47.901 --> 02:10:51.320
<v Speaker 4>That's as pretty good science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you say that's a petri dish.</v>

2674
02:10:51.321 --> 02:10:53.150
<v Speaker 4>They happen to be human breast cancer </v>
<v Speaker 4>cells,</v>

2675
02:10:53.151 --> 02:10:57.170
<v Speaker 4>but until you do a randomized controlled</v>
<v Speaker 4>study of animal versus vegetable,</v>

2676
02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:02.200
<v Speaker 4>they won't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should a breast cancer patient eat more </v>

2677
02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:02.200
<v Speaker 4>broccoli?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2678
02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:03.950
<v Speaker 4>Let's dong the bell there again for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2679
02:11:03.951 --> 02:11:06.950
<v Speaker 4>And I can tell you how to book cook the </v>
<v Speaker 4>broccoli so they get the best benefit.</v>

2680
02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:09.120
<v Speaker 4>Eat broccoli sprouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She kept 50 times more than</v>

2681
02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:11.450
<v Speaker 5>benefit that broccoli.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were going to respond to that.</v>

2682
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:13.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

2683
02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:18.131
<v Speaker 5>Come back to important endpoints,</v>
<v Speaker 5>total mortality or death from any </v>

2684
02:11:18.131 --> 02:11:18.450
<v Speaker 5>causes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2685
02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:23.620
<v Speaker 5>and diseases I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not persuaded by mechanisms unless </v>

2686
02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:27.740
<v Speaker 5>they're tied to outcomes that we care </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

2687
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:30.830
<v Speaker 5>I think mechanisms are interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as I said,</v>

2688
02:11:30.831 --> 02:11:31.840
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

2689
02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:36.230
<v Speaker 5>you have to be aware that if foods have </v>
<v Speaker 5>multiple effects,</v>

2690
02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:41.260
<v Speaker 5>they might have one impact that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>might think would lead to harm,</v>

2691
02:11:41.271 --> 02:11:46.271
<v Speaker 5>but then they could have several other </v>
<v Speaker 5>impacts that would be beneficial and </v>

2692
02:11:46.271 --> 02:11:49.721
<v Speaker 5>that's why you need to look at the real </v>
<v Speaker 5>outcomes because there've been so many </v>

2693
02:11:49.721 --> 02:11:51.030
<v Speaker 5>examples in the past of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2694
02:11:51.110 --> 02:11:56.110
<v Speaker 5>of ideas where the mechanism that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>originally proposed for the harm doesn't</v>

2695
02:11:56.421 --> 02:12:01.421
<v Speaker 5>turn out to be what we thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so a total mortality is the most </v>

2696
02:12:01.421 --> 02:12:03.290
<v Speaker 5>important endpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Deaths from all causes,</v>

2697
02:12:03.291 --> 02:12:07.370
<v Speaker 5>but then also deaths from from specific </v>
<v Speaker 5>conditions are important too.</v>

2698
02:12:07.371 --> 02:12:12.371
<v Speaker 5>And you and I would put that higher in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the hierarchy of evidence and </v>

2699
02:12:12.371 --> 02:12:13.040
<v Speaker 5>mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2700
02:12:13.250 --> 02:12:13.670
<v Speaker 5>Joel,</v>

2701
02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:18.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you abandoned the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable dedication and explosion of</v>

2702
02:12:18.491 --> 02:12:23.491
<v Speaker 4>scientists around the country and around</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world to come up with mechanisms of </v>

2703
02:12:23.491 --> 02:12:25.690
<v Speaker 4>disease because we're on the verge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this unbelievable breakthrough to change</v>

2704
02:12:25.691 --> 02:12:28.400
<v Speaker 4>your genetics and alter your mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't understand them,</v>

2705
02:12:28.401 --> 02:12:33.401
<v Speaker 4>you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think chris has it backwards more </v>

2706
02:12:33.401 --> 02:12:34.360
<v Speaker 4>commonly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basic science drives Questioning a human</v>

2707
02:12:34.361 --> 02:12:39.361
<v Speaker 4>population and epidemiologic study and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then maybe a randomized clinical trial </v>

2708
02:12:39.361 --> 02:12:40.000
<v Speaker 4>that's usual progression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2709
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:43.660
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have not even talked cholesterol.</v>

2710
02:12:43.661 --> 02:12:45.640
<v Speaker 4>This literally has been all saturated </v>
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>

2711
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:48.850
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen 75.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mentors in dallas,</v>

2712
02:12:48.851 --> 02:12:51.280
<v Speaker 4>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is relevant in 2018.</v>

2713
02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:56.520
<v Speaker 4>Brown and goldstein basic science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Identify your liver cell has a receptor </v>

2714
02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:57.790
<v Speaker 4>called the ldl receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knew it.</v>

2715
02:12:57.940 --> 02:13:01.030
<v Speaker 4>It completely controls the metabolism of</v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol in the body.</v>

2716
02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:06.240
<v Speaker 4>They then find that there's a disease </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you don't have that receptor in </v>

2717
02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:06.940
<v Speaker 4>your clusters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A thousand and you die before you're 15.</v>

2718
02:13:06.941 --> 02:13:08.920
<v Speaker 4>And I took care of those children in </v>
<v Speaker 4>dallas,</v>

2719
02:13:08.921 --> 02:13:10.750
<v Speaker 4>Texas in 1986,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1989.</v>

2720
02:13:10.930 --> 02:13:15.040
<v Speaker 4>From that came the development of a drug</v>
<v Speaker 4>called mevacor and lipitor and lovis.</v>

2721
02:13:15.041 --> 02:13:18.160
<v Speaker 4>Dad and all the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we were able to test in humans.</v>

2722
02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:20.710
<v Speaker 4>Does that basic science make a </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference?</v>

2723
02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:23.800
<v Speaker 4>Kaboom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The forest study says you live longer.</v>

2724
02:13:23.801 --> 02:13:25.420
<v Speaker 4>If you have heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to take a step.</v>

2725
02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:26.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's side effects.</v>

2726
02:13:26.591 --> 02:13:27.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this and that.</v>

2727
02:13:27.970 --> 02:13:30.490
<v Speaker 4>Go down to the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want your ldl cholesterol.</v>

2728
02:13:30.491 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 4>Like loren,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the founder</v>

2729
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:37.130
<v Speaker 2>of the modern paleo movement said 50 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>70 and it's all consistent across </v>

2730
02:13:37.130 --> 02:13:38.730
<v Speaker 2>epidemiology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basic biochemistry,</v>

2731
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:43.880
<v Speaker 2>randomized clinical studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's the average ldl cholesterol </v>

2732
02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:48.141
<v Speaker 2>and 100 gather in okinawa in loma linda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ldls are 70 or 80.</v>

2733
02:13:48.211 --> 02:13:53.211
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are the only free living animal </v>

2734
02:13:53.211 --> 02:13:53.420
<v Speaker 2>on the planet with an ldl cluster over </v>
<v Speaker 2>80 [inaudible].</v>

2735
02:13:53.421 --> 02:13:58.200
<v Speaker 2>We eat and we gorge and we have jacked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up saturated fat that drives our cluster</v>

2736
02:13:58.201 --> 02:14:03.201
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the only animal on the planet and </v>

2737
02:14:03.201 --> 02:14:04.270
<v Speaker 2>we're suffering terribly from policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>there does saturated fat raises.</v>

2738
02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:09.800
<v Speaker 5>That's the hope we need to keep coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>back to dietary cholesterol and dietary </v>

2739
02:14:09.861 --> 02:14:14.861
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The evidence is showing that on average </v>

2740
02:14:14.861 --> 02:14:17.840
<v Speaker 5>they do not raise cholesterol in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>blood and even when they do that,</v>

2741
02:14:17.841 --> 02:14:21.200
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't translate into an increased</v>
<v Speaker 5>risk of heart disease.</v>

2742
02:14:21.201 --> 02:14:23.330
<v Speaker 5>That's what the data show we've talked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2743
02:14:23.331 --> 02:14:25.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what more I can say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well actually we haven't.</v>

2744
02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:28.070
<v Speaker 5>We have a nutritionist I call bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 5>on that.</v>

2745
02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:30.680
<v Speaker 5>It's called the heck aesthetic equation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the keys equation.</v>

2746
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:33.790
<v Speaker 5>I shared the data on controlled feeding </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2747
02:14:33.791 --> 02:14:38.791
<v Speaker 5>You mentioned metabolic ward studies is </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a high standard of evidence </v>

2748
02:14:38.791 --> 02:14:42.521
<v Speaker 5>controlled feeding studies where 75 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent of people experience no change </v>

2749
02:14:42.521 --> 02:14:47.231
<v Speaker 5>in their blood cholesterol from eating </v>
<v Speaker 5>to four eggs a day and not exit an </v>

2750
02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:50.570
<v Speaker 5>isolated topic because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol topic.</v>

2751
02:14:50.571 --> 02:14:53.940
<v Speaker 5>We have not talked cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've been talking saturated fat.</v>

2752
02:14:53.980 --> 02:14:55.940
<v Speaker 5>We talk to them about it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2753
02:14:55.941 --> 02:14:58.370
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you just asked saturated fat and I'm</v>

2754
02:14:58.820 --> 02:14:59.110
<v Speaker 5>nervous.</v>

2755
02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2756
02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:05.450
<v Speaker 2>just saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raised blood cholesterol to deny that is</v>

2757
02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:08.990
<v Speaker 2>is whack and I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's called the aesthetic equation.</v>

2758
02:15:09.110 --> 02:15:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look it up on wikipedia.</v>

2759
02:15:11.260 --> 02:15:16.260
<v Speaker 2>It's called the keys equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That change and that change in saturated</v>

2760
02:15:16.671 --> 02:15:19.380
<v Speaker 2>fat raises choLesterol in the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2761
02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:21.380
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's known.</v>

2762
02:15:21.390 --> 02:15:23.650
<v Speaker 2>It's what chris is saying that it</v>

2763
02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:24.180
<v Speaker 5>does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2764
02:15:24.181 --> 02:15:26.880
<v Speaker 5>I'd say I say it does some times to some</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2765
02:15:26.881 --> 02:15:31.770
<v Speaker 5>but on average the studies are saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it doesn't have a significant mr.</v>

2766
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:32.030
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2767
02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Get a large enough group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have some aberrations and some </v>

2768
02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:40.340
<v Speaker 2>people will find a significant raise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A rising of their cholesterol.</v>

2769
02:15:40.510 --> 02:15:42.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that again,</v>

2770
02:15:42.011 --> 02:15:47.011
<v Speaker 5>more importantly people that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>presumption here is that serum </v>

2771
02:15:47.011 --> 02:15:51.121
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol where we care about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it will increase your risk of a </v>

2772
02:15:51.121 --> 02:15:52.120
<v Speaker 5>heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I said before,</v>

2773
02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:55.490
<v Speaker 5>large studies that have been forgotten </v>
<v Speaker 5>about cholesterol.</v>

2774
02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:00.520
<v Speaker 5>Just analyze the relatIonship between </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat intake and heart attacks,</v>

2775
02:16:01.150 --> 02:16:02.950
<v Speaker 5>which is what everyone cares about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2776
02:16:02.951 --> 02:16:06.020
<v Speaker 5>If they're thinking about cholesterol is</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the middle is,</v>

2777
02:16:06.050 --> 02:16:07.120
<v Speaker 5>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2778
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:10.750
<v Speaker 5>a mediator in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they removed that and they just say,</v>

2779
02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:14.290
<v Speaker 5>does eating saturated fat increase your </v>
<v Speaker 5>risk of heart disease?</v>

2780
02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:18.940
<v Speaker 5>Not large review of 350,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>participants did not show a relationship</v>

2781
02:16:18.970 --> 02:16:19.690
<v Speaker 5>on average.</v>

2782
02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:24.720
<v Speaker 2>So is the concept that cholesterol is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just one factor and that perhaps we've </v>

2783
02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:26.620
<v Speaker 2>isolated it as more significant</v>

2784
02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:29.740
<v Speaker 5>and then it really is in our typical </v>
<v Speaker 5>reductionist paradigm.</v>

2785
02:16:29.890 --> 02:16:30.700
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2786
02:16:30.730 --> 02:16:34.120
<v Speaker 3>There are many factors that contribute </v>
<v Speaker 3>to heart disease and that's one of them.</v>

2787
02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's why again,</v>

2788
02:16:37.031 --> 02:16:42.031
<v Speaker 3>it's important to look at the studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that directly examine the relationship </v>

2789
02:16:42.031 --> 02:16:44.380
<v Speaker 3>between saturated fat intake and heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>

2790
02:16:44.381 --> 02:16:46.840
<v Speaker 3>Rather than doing this dance where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

2791
02:16:46.841 --> 02:16:51.841
<v Speaker 3>does it increase cholesterol?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then assuming that high cholesterol </v>

2792
02:16:51.841 --> 02:16:52.390
<v Speaker 3>will lead to heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joel,</v>

2793
02:16:52.391 --> 02:16:54.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you can understand why this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so confusing for me.</v>

2794
02:16:54.510 --> 02:16:59.510
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually feel really badly for your </v>

2795
02:16:59.510 --> 02:16:59.510
<v Speaker 3>viewers and listeners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2796
02:16:59.510 --> 02:16:59.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be able to go over this</v>

2797
02:16:59.831 --> 02:17:01.360
<v Speaker 3>with a fine tooth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is so important.</v>

2798
02:17:01.361 --> 02:17:06.361
<v Speaker 3>I thank you both for doing this because </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the kind of conversation that </v>

2799
02:17:06.361 --> 02:17:09.811
<v Speaker 3>you just don't get to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get to experts with opposing views </v>

2800
02:17:09.811 --> 02:17:14.460
<v Speaker 3>and you have a decent conversation where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go over all the actual details of it</v>

2801
02:17:14.801 --> 02:17:18.220
<v Speaker 3>and you get to see how each one of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinks about these things and how you've</v>

2802
02:17:18.221 --> 02:17:19.250
<v Speaker 3>drawn this conclusion.</v>

2803
02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:22.590
<v Speaker 4>I agree With that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's great and all,</v>

2804
02:17:22.591 --> 02:17:27.591
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've had a couple moments of clarity </v>

2805
02:17:27.591 --> 02:17:30.630
<v Speaker 4>and advice and I just want people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have as many as possible because it does</v>

2806
02:17:30.631 --> 02:17:33.510
<v Speaker 4>matter wHy a friend of mine says heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease is not theoretical.</v>

2807
02:17:33.511 --> 02:17:36.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean we've had many 39 secOnd desk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've been doing this.</v>

2808
02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:38.250
<v Speaker 4>So just to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2809
02:17:39.510 --> 02:17:42.090
<v Speaker 4>does saturated fat rich diets race </v>
<v Speaker 4>class?</v>

2810
02:17:42.100 --> 02:17:42.810
<v Speaker 4>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2811
02:17:42.811 --> 02:17:47.811
<v Speaker 4>It's such a tight relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a line with a correlation that </v>

2812
02:17:47.811 --> 02:17:47.820
<v Speaker 4>just straight up now.</v>

2813
02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:49.030
<v Speaker 3>Can I pause you for a second?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2814
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is wrong with these studies that </v>

2815
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:56.151
<v Speaker 3>he's showing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that show that it doesn't in most </v>

2816
02:17:56.151 --> 02:17:56.151
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

2817
02:17:56.151 --> 02:17:56.710
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

2818
02:17:56.711 --> 02:18:01.711
<v Speaker 4>and again there are studies that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>being referenced but we're not looking </v>

2819
02:18:01.711 --> 02:18:04.921
<v Speaker 4>at and that's a limitation we can live </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that since 2010 the question has </v>

2820
02:18:04.921 --> 02:18:08.821
<v Speaker 4>come up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does an increase saturated fat causes </v>

2821
02:18:08.821 --> 02:18:11.460
<v Speaker 4>coronary heart disease?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that has been questioned in some </v>

2822
02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:14.251
<v Speaker 4>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that it doesn't raise blood </v>

2823
02:18:14.251 --> 02:18:16.411
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol is a to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the reason all the guidelines up </v>

2824
02:18:16.411 --> 02:18:16.810
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2015,</v>

2825
02:18:16.811 --> 02:18:21.100
<v Speaker 4>2016 still say limit saturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that science hasn't changed.</v>

2826
02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:24.490
<v Speaker 4>There's such a tight correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The line is straight up.</v>

2827
02:18:24.670 --> 02:18:28.180
<v Speaker 4>Percentage of dietary fats presented </v>
<v Speaker 4>dietary saturated fat,</v>

2828
02:18:28.510 --> 02:18:29.620
<v Speaker 4>blood cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blood cholesterol,</v>

2829
02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:32.680
<v Speaker 4>the challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much yours is going to raise and how</v>

2830
02:18:32.681 --> 02:18:37.681
<v Speaker 4>much mine is going to raise going </v>
<v Speaker 4>depending on your genetics and your </v>

2831
02:18:37.681 --> 02:18:38.320
<v Speaker 4>microbiome and where you're starting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I ate a steak,</v>

2832
02:18:38.321 --> 02:18:40.390
<v Speaker 4>my cholesterol goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I ate an egg,</v>

2833
02:18:40.391 --> 02:18:45.391
<v Speaker 4>this has been shown because I don't eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>any dietary cholesterol is a plant </v>

2834
02:18:45.391 --> 02:18:45.391
<v Speaker 4>eater.</v>

2835
02:18:45.391 --> 02:18:47.170
<v Speaker 4>My cholesterol skyrockets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You become habituated eating two,</v>

2836
02:18:47.171 --> 02:18:50.590
<v Speaker 4>three eggs a day in the curve flattens </v>
<v Speaker 4>out after two,</v>

2837
02:18:50.591 --> 02:18:55.591
<v Speaker 4>three eggs a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is four or 500 milligrams of </v>

2838
02:18:55.591 --> 02:18:55.810
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you smoke 20 cigarettes and</v>

2839
02:18:55.811 --> 02:18:57.910
<v Speaker 4>you go to 24,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be pretty hard to show.</v>

2840
02:18:57.911 --> 02:19:02.911
<v Speaker 4>Much of a difference to three eggs a day</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a chronic dieter is tough to </v>

2841
02:19:02.911 --> 02:19:07.381
<v Speaker 4>challenge your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just creates a tolerance for it is </v>

2842
02:19:07.381 --> 02:19:09.370
<v Speaker 4>there's a level of absorption that </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts to level off,</v>

2843
02:19:09.430 --> 02:19:13.540
<v Speaker 4>but I'm an interesting statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A toothpick is 100 milligrams.</v>

2844
02:19:13.541 --> 02:19:18.541
<v Speaker 4>Most of us eat three to 400 milligrams </v>
<v Speaker 4>of cholesterol day three to four </v>

2845
02:19:18.541 --> 02:19:18.541
<v Speaker 4>toothpicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking,</v>

2846
02:19:18.690 --> 02:19:21.020
<v Speaker 4>we're talking fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking 150 grams.</v>

2847
02:19:21.021 --> 02:19:25.390
<v Speaker 4>So that's why the saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like overwhelmingly more of a topic</v>

2848
02:19:25.690 --> 02:19:29.210
<v Speaker 4>than three to put three to four </v>
<v Speaker 4>toothpicks of cluster holiday.</v>

2849
02:19:29.310 --> 02:19:30.080
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hold on a sec.</v>

2850
02:19:30.081 --> 02:19:33.030
<v Speaker 5>Because he'd just come back to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>studies.</v>

2851
02:19:33.090 --> 02:19:38.090
<v Speaker 5>Two to four eggs a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Controlled metabolic word feeding </v>

2852
02:19:38.090 --> 02:19:40.830
<v Speaker 5>studies do not have any impact on blood </v>
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol in 75 percent of people.</v>

2853
02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:46.760
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's about as conclusive as the </v>

2854
02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:47.070
<v Speaker 5>evidence can get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well and reverends.</v>

2855
02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:48.840
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll give one to you.</v>

2856
02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:55.200
<v Speaker 5>I always have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in they're always there at </v>

2857
02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:55.200
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] dot com slash rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2858
02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:59.010
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and here it is.</v>

2859
02:20:02.010 --> 02:20:06.090
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you google kresser saturated fat,</v>

2860
02:20:06.940 --> 02:20:08.850
<v Speaker 5>you'll that the first article that comes</v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

2861
02:20:08.851 --> 02:20:11.110
<v Speaker 5>So this is [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2862
02:20:11.370 --> 02:20:16.370
<v Speaker 5>from 2009 dietary cholesterol and </v>
<v Speaker 5>coronary artery disease.</v>

2863
02:20:16.501 --> 02:20:17.610
<v Speaker 5>A systemic review.</v>

2864
02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:22.130
<v Speaker 4>I'll just show I know your viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe your viewers can see it.</v>

2865
02:20:22.131 --> 02:20:25.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's called saturated fat in the diet.</v>

2866
02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:31.030
<v Speaker 4>That's called changing your ldl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's called the line going up like a </v>

2867
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:31.030
<v Speaker 4>straight rocket</v>

2868
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:34.900
<v Speaker 5>and that will have jamie pull it up on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the big screen.</v>

2869
02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:39.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody that googles it's called </v>

2870
02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:39.940
<v Speaker 4>heggstad equation egg</v>

2871
02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:44.200
<v Speaker 5>t e d dot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's from the late 19 seventies.</v>

2872
02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:46.450
<v Speaker 5>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

2873
02:20:46.451 --> 02:20:50.530
<v Speaker 5>but the heggstad equation comes from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>heg said,</v>

2874
02:20:50.531 --> 02:20:55.531
<v Speaker 5>who was one of the doctors who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved with the mcgovern report in </v>

2875
02:20:55.531 --> 02:20:58.771
<v Speaker 5>1977,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was the original report that led </v>

2876
02:20:58.771 --> 02:21:00.880
<v Speaker 5>to the limitation on dietary cholesterol</v>
<v Speaker 5>and saturated fat.</v>

2877
02:21:00.881 --> 02:21:02.300
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2878
02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:05.050
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a little bit outdated </v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps.</v>

2879
02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:11.880
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what joel just said though,</v>

2880
02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:15.990
<v Speaker 5>if metta now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>

2881
02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:17.460
<v Speaker 5>one study doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2882
02:21:17.470 --> 02:21:22.470
<v Speaker 5>the exception doesn't make the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have a med analysis of observational </v>

2883
02:21:22.470 --> 02:21:25.921
<v Speaker 5>studies including 350,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>participants that found no relationship </v>

2884
02:21:26.621 --> 02:21:29.560
<v Speaker 5>between saturated fat intake and </v>
<v Speaker 5>cardiovascular disease.</v>

2885
02:21:30.170 --> 02:21:33.870
<v Speaker 5>The review of 25 rcts and 40 </v>
<v Speaker 5>observational studies,</v>

2886
02:21:33.871 --> 02:21:38.871
<v Speaker 5>650,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that concluded that replacing </v>

2887
02:21:38.871 --> 02:21:42.220
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't lower the risk of cardiovascular</v>

2888
02:21:42.221 --> 02:21:47.221
<v Speaker 5>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to look at the weight of the </v>

2889
02:21:47.221 --> 02:21:47.221
<v Speaker 5>evidence.</v>

2890
02:21:47.221 --> 02:21:49.980
<v Speaker 5>We can't just choose one study or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanistic argument to support our </v>

2891
02:21:49.980 --> 02:21:50.060
<v Speaker 5>view.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2892
02:21:50.110 --> 02:21:52.690
<v Speaker 5>what's your take that this study is </v>
<v Speaker 5>flawed and out.</v>

2893
02:21:52.770 --> 02:21:54.280
<v Speaker 5>It's not a study that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2894
02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:55.170
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2895
02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:57.300
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2896
02:21:58.090 --> 02:22:03.090
<v Speaker 5>an equation that was meant to represent </v>
<v Speaker 5>the relationship between saturated fat </v>

2897
02:22:03.090 --> 02:22:07.681
<v Speaker 5>intake and a blood cholesterol that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>created created by a in,</v>

2898
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:11.610
<v Speaker 5>in the late seventies that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>originally involved in,</v>

2899
02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:16.680
<v Speaker 5>in this diet heart hypothesis and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mcgovern report which led to the </v>

2900
02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:18.820
<v Speaker 5>restrictions on cholesterol and </v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat in the first place.</v>

2901
02:22:18.821 --> 02:22:20.740
<v Speaker 5>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am saying that we should be looking at</v>

2902
02:22:20.741 --> 02:22:22.840
<v Speaker 5>more recent evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>large reviews of meta,</v>

2903
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:26.400
<v Speaker 5>of observational studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then meta analyses</v>

2904
02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:28.190
<v Speaker 3>of randomized controlled trials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2905
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:32.250
<v Speaker 3>that's the much more persuasive source </v>
<v Speaker 3>of evidence for me,</v>

2906
02:22:32.370 --> 02:22:36.240
<v Speaker 4>joel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was based on metabolic ward,</v>

2907
02:22:36.241 --> 02:22:41.241
<v Speaker 4>carefully done studies at harVard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the equation derived from human </v>

2908
02:22:41.241 --> 02:22:42.690
<v Speaker 4>data and where you put people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>changing their diet,</v>

2909
02:22:42.691 --> 02:22:45.840
<v Speaker 4>dietary change studies drives up ldl </v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol ads,</v>

2910
02:22:45.880 --> 02:22:47.490
<v Speaker 4>plotted out complaints,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very clear.</v>

2911
02:22:47.610 --> 02:22:50.220
<v Speaker 4>It's changing cholesterol to dietary </v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat.</v>

2912
02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:55.370
<v Speaker 4>It's well accepted in the medical </v>
<v Speaker 4>community and it's incorporated in the </v>

2913
02:22:55.370 --> 02:22:55.410
<v Speaker 4>guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll never change.</v>

2914
02:22:55.470 --> 02:22:58.740
<v Speaker 4>Human physiology is not gonna change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ldl receptors don't change.</v>

2915
02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:03.860
<v Speaker 4>It all goes back to basic biochemistry </v>
<v Speaker 4>and when we understand that we can </v>

2916
02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:05.910
<v Speaker 4>manipulate it to better health,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can do it through pharmacology.</v>

2917
02:23:05.911 --> 02:23:08.610
<v Speaker 4>we can do through diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be doing it through gene therapy,</v>

2918
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:11.520
<v Speaker 4>stem cell therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't understand about chemistry.</v>

2919
02:23:11.521 --> 02:23:14.160
<v Speaker 4>We're cuttIng out a pillar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to have for better health.</v>

2920
02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Chris,</v>

2921
02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:20.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many more times I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm just saying the same thing over</v>

2922
02:23:20.691 --> 02:23:23.870
<v Speaker 3>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to look at the research,</v>

2923
02:23:23.900 --> 02:23:26.660
<v Speaker 3>that weight of the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to look at randomized controlled</v>

2924
02:23:26.661 --> 02:23:31.661
<v Speaker 3>trials that actually look at what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens when people consume saturated </v>

2925
02:23:31.661 --> 02:23:35.891
<v Speaker 3>fat and dietary cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These studies as the mechanistic </v>

2926
02:23:36.591 --> 02:23:41.591
<v Speaker 3>arguments are not persuasive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's not happening in real in real </v>

2927
02:23:41.591 --> 02:23:45.221
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're measuring in a randomized </v>

2928
02:23:45.221 --> 02:23:45.221
<v Speaker 3>controlled trial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're controlling,</v>

2929
02:23:45.221 --> 02:23:49.650
<v Speaker 3>you're measuring what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people eat saturated fat and </v>

2930
02:23:49.650 --> 02:23:49.880
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you do a meta analysis of these</v>

2931
02:23:49.881 --> 02:23:52.850
<v Speaker 3>controlled trials and you're finding </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I what I just said,</v>

2932
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:56.690
<v Speaker 3>that's way more persuasive to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is your take on that?</v>

2933
02:23:56.730 --> 02:23:59.630
<v Speaker 4>Joel?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The royal academy of the same,</v>

2934
02:24:00.430 --> 02:24:05.430
<v Speaker 4>just the royal academy of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since we can give the nobel prize in </v>

2935
02:24:05.430 --> 02:24:06.870
<v Speaker 4>medicine for what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>and nobody's changed that.</v>

2936
02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:11.871
<v Speaker 4>I mean I totally disagree with chris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that human physiology didn't change from</v>

2937
02:24:12.391 --> 02:24:17.391
<v Speaker 4>1985 nobel prize to 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's that relationship between </v>

2938
02:24:17.391 --> 02:24:19.650
<v Speaker 4>eating saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lowering your ldl receptor,</v>

2939
02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:21.240
<v Speaker 4>raising your blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ldl,</v>

2940
02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:24.630
<v Speaker 4>developing atheroma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go in at three in the morning and bust</v>

2941
02:24:24.631 --> 02:24:27.170
<v Speaker 4>open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your plaques you live has not changed.</v>

2942
02:24:27.171 --> 02:24:32.171
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are these studies made and what's </v>

2943
02:24:32.171 --> 02:24:32.171
<v Speaker 4>wrong with them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the.</v>

2944
02:24:33.930 --> 02:24:38.930
<v Speaker 4>Nothing's changed about understanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>the biochemistry of metabolism and </v>

2945
02:24:38.930 --> 02:24:39.300
<v Speaker 4>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

2946
02:24:39.301 --> 02:24:41.340
<v Speaker 4>there's always advancements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2947
02:24:41.341 --> 02:24:44.640
<v Speaker 4>the ldl receptor has led to the staten </v>
<v Speaker 4>field,</v>

2948
02:24:44.641 --> 02:24:47.610
<v Speaker 4>a new class of drugs called pcsk nine </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhibitors.</v>

2949
02:24:47.970 --> 02:24:50.730
<v Speaker 4>It's all because of the biochemistry </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people are living longer,</v>

2950
02:24:50.731 --> 02:24:55.731
<v Speaker 4>living better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are plaqueS are being reduced </v>

2951
02:24:55.731 --> 02:24:58.280
<v Speaker 4>through lifestyle medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But thank god we also pharmacology </v>

2952
02:24:58.280 --> 02:24:58.280
<v Speaker 4>that's advanced</v>

2953
02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:02.280
<v Speaker 3>wrong with these studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these studies that are showing these </v>

2954
02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:03.160
<v Speaker 3>results that he's descrIbing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're disputing what is wrong with</v>

2955
02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:04.690
<v Speaker 3>these studies and what is wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their results.</v>

2956
02:25:04.691 --> 02:25:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Results.</v>

2957
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:09.910
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would urge everybody to take the </v>

2958
02:25:09.910 --> 02:25:13.001
<v Speaker 4>broad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high level view of science and not </v>

2959
02:25:13.001 --> 02:25:15.491
<v Speaker 4>pixels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the basic biochemistry and now </v>

2960
02:25:15.491 --> 02:25:17.981
<v Speaker 4>we're circling around what's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>epidemiology with the Clinical </v>

2961
02:25:17.981 --> 02:25:18.320
<v Speaker 4>randomized trials and what's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>centenarian studies there?</v>

2962
02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:23.340
<v Speaker 4>There is no new data that you live to </v>
<v Speaker 4>100 by adding saturated fat to your </v>

2963
02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:23.340
<v Speaker 4>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You may.</v>

2964
02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:24.040
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about that.</v>

2965
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:26.770
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about the actual physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>results on human bodies.</v>

2966
02:25:26.771 --> 02:25:30.010
<v Speaker 3>When you consume saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's describing,</v>

2967
02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:35.330
<v Speaker 4>take a new metabolic ward study that </v>
<v Speaker 4>negated</v>

2968
02:25:35.530 --> 02:25:40.530
<v Speaker 3>keys equation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state equation that there's linear </v>

2969
02:25:40.530 --> 02:25:42.901
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three hundred 95 metabolic says it </v>

2970
02:25:42.901 --> 02:25:42.901
<v Speaker 3>doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you saying to that,</v>

2971
02:25:42.901 --> 02:25:46.981
<v Speaker 3>chris?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A metabolic ward study that says eating </v>

2972
02:25:46.981 --> 02:25:49.021
<v Speaker 3>saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would not take a job where we have </v>

2973
02:25:49.021 --> 02:25:51.631
<v Speaker 3>randomized controlled trials which is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very high standard of evidence and </v>

2974
02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:56.440
<v Speaker 3>observational data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>large amounts of observational data that</v>

2975
02:25:56.441 --> 02:26:01.120
<v Speaker 3>have been reviewed that answer this </v>
<v Speaker 3>question and we we also,</v>

2976
02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:06.240
<v Speaker 3>we have many rcts of low carb diets and </v>
<v Speaker 3>even ketogenic diets that are not </v>

2977
02:26:06.311 --> 02:26:10.000
<v Speaker 3>showing a significant impacts that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joel,</v>

2978
02:26:10.001 --> 02:26:12.790
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a dietary,</v>

2979
02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:17.820
<v Speaker 3>here's a 2018 review of all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>previous science on dietary cholesterol </v>

2980
02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:21.820
<v Speaker 3>in eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the conclusion says,</v>

2981
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:24.730
<v Speaker 3>reese overall recent intervention </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies with eggs,</v>

2982
02:26:24.731 --> 02:26:26.350
<v Speaker 3>recent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2983
02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:31.500
<v Speaker 3>demonstrate that the additional dietary </v>
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol does not negatively affect </v>

2984
02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:35.141
<v Speaker 3>serum lipids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in some cases appears to improve </v>

2985
02:26:35.141 --> 02:26:37.711
<v Speaker 3>lipoprotein particle profiles like have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a beneficial effect and hdl </v>

2986
02:26:37.711 --> 02:26:40.480
<v Speaker 3>functionality which is the so called </v>
<v Speaker 3>good cholesterol.</v>

2987
02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:45.960
<v Speaker 3>And he talks about here in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion that eggs shift ldl particles</v>

2988
02:26:46.601 --> 02:26:49.570
<v Speaker 3>to the less detrimental large buoyant </v>
<v Speaker 3>ldl,</v>

2989
02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:54.600
<v Speaker 3>which is less atherogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says eggs also typically increase </v>

2990
02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:58.920
<v Speaker 3>hdl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says that eggs probably have other </v>

2991
02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:01.100
<v Speaker 3>beneficial impacts on in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>phospho lippitt,</v>

2992
02:27:01.101 --> 02:27:04.930
<v Speaker 3>contact qa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there's no relationship between</v>

2993
02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:08.080
<v Speaker 3>the consumption of eggs and heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>

2994
02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:12.750
<v Speaker 3>So thIs is a 2018 review.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's by christopher blessed.</v>

2995
02:27:12.751 --> 02:27:15.850
<v Speaker 3>So dietary cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>serum lipids and heart heart disease.</v>

2996
02:27:15.851 --> 02:27:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Are eggs working for and against you </v>
<v Speaker 3>published in nutrients?</v>

2997
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:23.910
<v Speaker 3>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that that's correct and </v>

2998
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:24.130
<v Speaker 3>that there's some misunderstanding about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the previous data?</v>

2999
02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:27.360
<v Speaker 4>It's a different topic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's eggs,</v>

3000
02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:29.730
<v Speaker 4>it's cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were talking saturated fat.</v>

3001
02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:34.760
<v Speaker 4>Does It raise your cholesterol?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're different topics and then </v>

3002
02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:35.130
<v Speaker 4>we've introduced a very hot topic about </v>
<v Speaker 4>ldl particle size,</v>

3003
02:27:35.131 --> 02:27:36.870
<v Speaker 4>which we should break down and talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

3004
02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:38.850
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not sure quite how to respond </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we</v>

3005
02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:43.900
<v Speaker 3>got off track by shifting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>consistently low carb and the eggs and </v>

3006
02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:45.350
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about cholesterol,</v>

3007
02:27:45.410 --> 02:27:46.160
<v Speaker 3>what we're talking about</v>

3008
02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:50.300
<v Speaker 4>raised blood cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm,</v>

3009
02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:53.420
<v Speaker 4>I stand by the fact human physiology </v>
<v Speaker 4>will not change.</v>

3010
02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:56.630
<v Speaker 3>We have receptor understanding of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiology advance.</v>

3011
02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:00.070
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3012
02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:01.420
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you an example.</v>

3013
02:28:01.540 --> 02:28:06.540
<v Speaker 4>Until 20 years ago nobody ever heard a </v>
<v Speaker 4>word pcs canine god or somebody gave us </v>

3014
02:28:08.441 --> 02:28:12.040
<v Speaker 4>a protein in our blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pcsk nine that goes to your Liver,</v>

3015
02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:17.100
<v Speaker 4>sits in a receptor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>causes the ldl receptor to go internal </v>

3016
02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:17.860
<v Speaker 4>and you're frigging blood cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes up.</v>

3017
02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:21.100
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a class of drugs that's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>antibody to pcsk,</v>

3018
02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:26.620
<v Speaker 4>lowers your cholesterol draMatically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're finding it reduces plaque and </v>

3019
02:28:26.620 --> 02:28:26.620
<v Speaker 4>lowers your risk of heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3020
02:28:26.620 --> 02:28:27.470
<v Speaker 4>New science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

3021
02:28:27.471 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 4>Totally consistent with what brown and </v>
<v Speaker 4>goldstein showing that led to statens.</v>

3022
02:28:31.970 --> 02:28:34.220
<v Speaker 4>Now we have a new treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a wonderful thing.</v>

3023
02:28:34.221 --> 02:28:39.221
<v Speaker 4>It didn't rock the boat a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we still don't know to this day why we </v>

3024
02:28:39.221 --> 02:28:42.881
<v Speaker 4>have that a protein in our Blood and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're lucky enough to be born with a </v>

3025
02:28:42.881 --> 02:28:45.560
<v Speaker 4>low level of pcsk nine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your cholesterol is lower,</v>

3026
02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:47.240
<v Speaker 4>you have less disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you live longer.</v>

3027
02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:52.240
<v Speaker 4>That was part of the data I published in</v>
<v Speaker 4>2012 with brian ferentz at wayne state </v>

3028
02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:52.610
<v Speaker 4>university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes,</v>

3029
02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:54.680
<v Speaker 4>we've learned more about human </v>
<v Speaker 4>physiology.</v>

3030
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:59.710
<v Speaker 4>Totally consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't disrupt anything and lead to </v>

3031
02:28:59.710 --> 02:28:59.710
<v Speaker 4>better treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

3032
02:28:59.710 --> 02:29:00.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has,</v>

3033
02:29:00.380 --> 02:29:03.500
<v Speaker 4>has human physiology been challenged?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you another.</v>

3034
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:05.760
<v Speaker 4>We've learned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and chris menTioned this,</v>

3035
02:29:05.790 --> 02:29:07.760
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fair to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a court of law.</v>

3036
02:29:07.761 --> 02:29:12.761
<v Speaker 4>he opened it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm cross examining nobody in the world </v>

3037
02:29:12.761 --> 02:29:15.731
<v Speaker 4>ever heard the word of four letters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>T m a o 2011 cardiologists sitting at </v>

3038
02:29:16.071 --> 02:29:18.920
<v Speaker 4>the cleveland clinic said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's got to be more in the blood that</v>

3039
02:29:18.921 --> 02:29:20.330
<v Speaker 4>hurts arteries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go find him.</v>

3040
02:29:20.331 --> 02:29:23.000
<v Speaker 4>They found this chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They learned how to measure it.</v>

3041
02:29:23.001 --> 02:29:24.830
<v Speaker 4>They patent and how to measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tmao.</v>

3042
02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:27.230
<v Speaker 4>They took 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people on the cath lab table.</v>

3043
02:29:27.350 --> 02:29:32.350
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if the level of tmao and the </v>

3044
02:29:32.350 --> 02:29:32.350
<v Speaker 4>blood correlates with how clogged up </v>
<v Speaker 4>your arteries are,</v>

3045
02:29:32.350 --> 02:29:32.450
<v Speaker 4>but doom.</v>

3046
02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:37.600
<v Speaker 4>It worked perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they figured out if you eat red </v>

3047
02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:38.570
<v Speaker 4>meat that has rich in l carnitine amino </v>
<v Speaker 4>acids,</v>

3048
02:29:38.571 --> 02:29:41.600
<v Speaker 4>you eat exits rich and coleen and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrient,</v>

3049
02:29:41.601 --> 02:29:43.220
<v Speaker 4>I think amino acid and blanket for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>minute.</v>

3050
02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:46.490
<v Speaker 4>Those directly led your liver to create </v>
<v Speaker 4>tmao.</v>

3051
02:29:46.670 --> 02:29:48.920
<v Speaker 4>They took studies where they reduced </v>
<v Speaker 4>carnitine,</v>

3052
02:29:48.921 --> 02:29:50.960
<v Speaker 4>reduced coleen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The team mail goes down.</v>

3053
02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:56.080
<v Speaker 4>What is tmao do it stunted your hdl so </v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't reverse cholesterol </v>

3054
02:29:56.080 --> 02:29:57.410
<v Speaker 4>transport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It causes ldl to enter the cell wall and</v>

3055
02:29:57.411 --> 02:29:58.910
<v Speaker 4>create foam cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Macrophages,</v>

3056
02:29:58.911 --> 02:30:03.911
<v Speaker 4>plaque and you get a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It actually screws up your kidney and </v>

3057
02:30:03.911 --> 02:30:04.580
<v Speaker 4>causes it to be fibrosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have heart failure,</v>

3058
02:30:04.581 --> 02:30:06.710
<v Speaker 4>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or heart disease or hypertension,</v>

3059
02:30:06.711 --> 02:30:09.650
<v Speaker 4>you're tmao is up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've actually drawn more tmao levels.</v>

3060
02:30:09.651 --> 02:30:12.050
<v Speaker 4>I think any physician United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is my baby.</v>

3061
02:30:12.260 --> 02:30:17.260
<v Speaker 4>New human physiology that has not led us</v>
<v Speaker 4>to back off the idea that limiting the </v>

3062
02:30:18.470 --> 02:30:23.470
<v Speaker 4>animal product consumption in this case </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically egg yolk and red meat may </v>

3063
02:30:23.470 --> 02:30:23.470
<v Speaker 4>have benefit to your health.</v>

3064
02:30:23.470 --> 02:30:25.790
<v Speaker 4>We just learned in the academy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>increased,</v>

3065
02:30:25.870 --> 02:30:30.870
<v Speaker 4>went in diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>increases tmao orders of magnitude more </v>

3066
02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:34.220
<v Speaker 4>hazard right in their fish flesh along </v>
<v Speaker 4>with mercury and pcbs and ddt.</v>

3067
02:30:34.250 --> 02:30:38.630
<v Speaker 4>What is the association of seafood </v>
<v Speaker 4>intake with heart disease mortality?</v>

3068
02:30:38.660 --> 02:30:41.270
<v Speaker 4>Can we use epidemiology studies or that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're off the table?</v>

3069
02:30:41.271 --> 02:30:46.271
<v Speaker 4>As I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can use epidemiology when we use it </v>

3070
02:30:46.271 --> 02:30:49.451
<v Speaker 4>wisely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but selective chris use it or don't use </v>

3071
02:30:49.451 --> 02:30:49.760
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always use epidemiology.</v>

3072
02:30:49.761 --> 02:30:54.761
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent of the job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've been talking about large reviews </v>

3073
02:30:54.761 --> 02:30:56.570
<v Speaker 4>of epidemiology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that suggests that heart,</v>

3074
02:30:56.720 --> 02:31:00.470
<v Speaker 4>that saturated fat and cholesterol don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>increase the risk of heart disease.</v>

3075
02:31:00.471 --> 02:31:05.471
<v Speaker 4>So if you could answer Their question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the association of fish with </v>

3076
02:31:06.650 --> 02:31:11.650
<v Speaker 4>cardiova,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would most doctors and researchers </v>

3077
02:31:11.650 --> 02:31:14.710
<v Speaker 4>say about fish consumption and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cardiovascular disease and mortality was</v>

3078
02:31:14.711 --> 02:31:19.711
<v Speaker 4>since it has saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most high level 2018 and advisors are </v>

3079
02:31:19.711 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 4>two meals a week of</v>

3080
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:25.010
<v Speaker 5>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Balancing out with 19 meals a week of </v>

3081
02:31:25.010 --> 02:31:26.940
<v Speaker 5>plant based is the usda guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Answer the question long.</v>

3082
02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:30.310
<v Speaker 5>Can you look at the data?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are a few things that,</v>

3083
02:31:30.450 --> 02:31:35.450
<v Speaker 5>that are associated with a greater </v>
<v Speaker 5>decrease in cardiovascular disease risk </v>

3084
02:31:35.450 --> 02:31:37.620
<v Speaker 5>than fish consumption of fruits and </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetables.</v>

3085
02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:42.680
<v Speaker 5>Cmio is if you look at a graph and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>

3086
02:31:42.781 --> 02:31:44.370
<v Speaker 5>if you google,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3087
02:31:44.820 --> 02:31:46.860
<v Speaker 5>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe jamie,</v>

3088
02:31:46.861 --> 02:31:49.260
<v Speaker 5>you can pull this up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kresser tmao.</v>

3089
02:31:50.290 --> 02:31:54.030
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you click on that first link,</v>

3090
02:31:54.031 --> 02:31:59.031
<v Speaker 5>red meat and tmao.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You scroll down and there's a picture of</v>

3091
02:32:00.690 --> 02:32:02.310
<v Speaker 5>jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where are you?</v>

3092
02:32:02.311 --> 02:32:05.850
<v Speaker 5>Ben?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a picture a scroll down.</v>

3093
02:32:06.010 --> 02:32:08.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>

3094
02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:13.770
<v Speaker 5>So that picture shows the increase in </v>
<v Speaker 5>tmao from eggs,</v>

3095
02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:14.880
<v Speaker 5>beef,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cheese,</v>

3096
02:32:14.881 --> 02:32:16.020
<v Speaker 5>milk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clams,</v>

3097
02:32:16.021 --> 02:32:18.210
<v Speaker 5>and then look at cod and halibut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3098
02:32:18.330 --> 02:32:20.910
<v Speaker 5>Let me just see the reference data </v>
<v Speaker 5>reference beef,</v>

3099
02:32:20.970 --> 02:32:22.620
<v Speaker 5>the references in the article.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joel,</v>

3100
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:25.900
<v Speaker 5>as always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can see it there,</v>

3101
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:29.190
<v Speaker 5>there jan referenced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not fair.</v>

3102
02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:30.590
<v Speaker 5>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>master john.</v>

3103
02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:34.260
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not so cod and halibut or increasing</v>

3104
02:32:34.261 --> 02:32:36.090
<v Speaker 5>tmao,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>

3105
02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:38.640
<v Speaker 5>orders of magnitude more than beef or </v>
<v Speaker 5>eggs.</v>

3106
02:32:38.641 --> 02:32:43.641
<v Speaker 5>You can't even see eggs and beef there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the data show that fish consumption.</v>

3107
02:32:44.491 --> 02:32:49.491
<v Speaker 5>I think almost every public health </v>
<v Speaker 5>authority would recommend would agree </v>

3108
02:32:49.491 --> 02:32:53.121
<v Speaker 5>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is reducing the risk of heart disease </v>

3109
02:32:53.121 --> 02:32:54.030
<v Speaker 5>and mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So tmao Is another mechanism,</v>

3110
02:32:54.031 --> 02:32:57.650
<v Speaker 5>it's another interesting mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not very understood.</v>

3111
02:32:57.660 --> 02:33:00.030
<v Speaker 5>It's not fully understood and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

3112
02:33:00.031 --> 02:33:05.031
<v Speaker 5>we have to look at the data on red meat </v>
<v Speaker 5>consumption and heart disease and </v>

3113
02:33:06.060 --> 02:33:09.690
<v Speaker 5>mortality to to really figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can't,</v>

3114
02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:11.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a speculative mechanism.</v>

3115
02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:15.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't disagree that it's important to </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at mechanisms,</v>

3116
02:33:15.001 --> 02:33:18.300
<v Speaker 5>but you can't draw conclusions based on </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

3117
02:33:18.301 --> 02:33:23.190
<v Speaker 5>And this single fact about tmao just </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of blows the thing apart.</v>

3118
02:33:23.610 --> 02:33:28.610
<v Speaker 5>The other thing about tmao to know is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that certain types of gut bacteria </v>

3119
02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:32.730
<v Speaker 5>metabolize coleen and carnitine into </v>
<v Speaker 5>tmao,</v>

3120
02:33:32.731 --> 02:33:33.960
<v Speaker 5>whereas others don't.</v>

3121
02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:39.140
<v Speaker 5>And so a lot of scientists have </v>
<v Speaker 5>speculated that high tmao levels are </v>

3122
02:33:39.871 --> 02:33:43.140
<v Speaker 5>essentially a result of a disrupted gut </v>
<v Speaker 5>microbiome.</v>

3123
02:33:43.950 --> 02:33:48.950
<v Speaker 5>and that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have 60 percent of the calories </v>

3124
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:52.911
<v Speaker 5>that americans are consuming or from </v>
<v Speaker 5>ultra processed food and we know that </v>

3125
02:33:52.911 --> 02:33:53.460
<v Speaker 5>that totally screws up the gut </v>
<v Speaker 5>microbiome.</v>

3126
02:33:53.850 --> 02:33:57.270
<v Speaker 5>Then if you get a person eating a </v>
<v Speaker 5>standard american diet,</v>

3127
02:33:57.570 --> 02:34:01.290
<v Speaker 5>then they're tmao.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tmao levels may go up with red meat.</v>

3128
02:34:01.291 --> 02:34:06.291
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you take someone who's got a </v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy microbiome because they're </v>

3129
02:34:06.291 --> 02:34:07.950
<v Speaker 5>eating lots of plant foods that support </v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy gut,</v>

3130
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:12.990
<v Speaker 5>then you may not see the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>association and part of what supports </v>

3131
02:34:12.990 --> 02:34:16.911
<v Speaker 5>that is a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's studies showing that rifaximin,</v>

3132
02:34:17.170 --> 02:34:18.340
<v Speaker 5>which is an antibiotic</v>

3133
02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:21.520
<v Speaker 2>that treats bacterial overgrowth in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>small intestine,</v>

3134
02:34:21.521 --> 02:34:26.380
<v Speaker 2>reduces serum tmao levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which suggests that it's mediated by the</v>

3135
02:34:26.381 --> 02:34:31.381
<v Speaker 2>gut microbiome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So consumpTion of fish has been </v>

3136
02:34:31.381 --> 02:34:32.530
<v Speaker 2>universally shown to decrease heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

3137
02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:38.280
<v Speaker 2>The mechanism is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but overall it may be very complicated </v>

3138
02:34:38.741 --> 02:34:41.740
<v Speaker 2>with many factors and we might not know </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>

3139
02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that's what takes us back to </v>

3140
02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:48.511
<v Speaker 2>let's look at the data on whether red </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat increases the risk of death or </v>

3141
02:34:48.511 --> 02:34:51.160
<v Speaker 2>heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joel,</v>

3142
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:53.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chris has referenced,</v>

3143
02:34:53.771 --> 02:34:56.830
<v Speaker 2>was giving credit to another bloggers </v>
<v Speaker 2>article.</v>

3144
02:34:56.831 --> 02:34:58.960
<v Speaker 2>That's not science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to go to the bloggers article</v>

3145
02:34:58.961 --> 02:35:01.480
<v Speaker 2>and look at it was number 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>

3146
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:06.190
<v Speaker 2>We have to find the reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sloppy referencing.</v>

3147
02:35:06.410 --> 02:35:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him explain what the references said</v>

3148
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:11.340
<v Speaker 2>there that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that graph came.</v>

3149
02:35:11.690 --> 02:35:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Explain number 15 is the reference </v>
<v Speaker 2>dietary precursors of trimethylamine and</v>

3150
02:35:16.601 --> 02:35:18.550
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pilot study tmao.</v>

3151
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a blog.</v>

3152
02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:25.560
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a tmao is a hot topic </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now that is largely being </v>

3153
02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:27.910
<v Speaker 2>researched in terms of a egg yolk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat consumption.</v>

3154
02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:30.520
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not preliminary science.</v>

3155
02:35:30.660 --> 02:35:31.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3156
02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:36.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not playing with science or coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with pharmacologic agents right now </v>

3157
02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:36.940
<v Speaker 2>to block it and we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see a new class of drugs they were</v>

3158
02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:41.960
<v Speaker 2>just reported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that with significant or is it more </v>

3159
02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:42.820
<v Speaker 2>important to concentrate on gut biome </v>
<v Speaker 2>and healthY diet?</v>

3160
02:35:43.310 --> 02:35:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

3161
02:35:43.850 --> 02:35:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Why are we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we instantly giving the ball to </v>

3162
02:35:48.850 --> 02:35:49.990
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceuticals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ask the question,</v>

3163
02:35:49.991 --> 02:35:52.930
<v Speaker 2>is there any new human physiology that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant?</v>

3164
02:35:52.931 --> 02:35:57.931
<v Speaker 2>We've started with pcsk nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm introducing tmao is new human </v>

3165
02:35:57.931 --> 02:36:01.321
<v Speaker 2>physiology that's relevant that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>lead to improvements in clinical </v>

3166
02:36:01.321 --> 02:36:05.131
<v Speaker 2>outcomes as suggested by observation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about what he just showed </v>

3167
02:36:05.131 --> 02:36:05.131
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The graph.</v>

3168
02:36:05.131 --> 02:36:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Dismiss the graph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he gave you a study for the graph </v>

3169
02:36:09.410 --> 02:36:09.410
<v Speaker 2>and you just sort of glossed over it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3170
02:36:09.410 --> 02:36:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3171
02:36:09.870 --> 02:36:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that contributed fish is a flush</v>

3172
02:36:13.241 --> 02:36:18.241
<v Speaker 2>source of tmao.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about whether fish in 2018 </v>

3173
02:36:18.241 --> 02:36:20.410
<v Speaker 2>is uniformly a healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying,</v>

3174
02:36:20.411 --> 02:36:23.380
<v Speaker 2>and he's also talking about gut biome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gut bacteria,</v>

3175
02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:28.710
<v Speaker 2>then consumption of red meat being </v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly less than the consumption </v>

3176
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:32.371
<v Speaker 2>of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is universally said to be a good </v>

3177
02:36:32.371 --> 02:36:32.371
<v Speaker 2>thing for your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

3178
02:36:32.371 --> 02:36:34.060
<v Speaker 2>So a bunch of layers there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real quick,</v>

3179
02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:39.990
<v Speaker 2>everybody who studies tmao knows that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the microbiome is a critical component </v>

3180
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:41.530
<v Speaker 2>to people can eat a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's classic study.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't make tmao why?</v>

3184
02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Because my microbiome was different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>yours feed and on the board of steak,</v>

3185
02:36:53.711 --> 02:36:57.820
<v Speaker 2>they make tmao within 12 hours now </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating a standard american diet.</v>

3186
02:36:58.330 --> 02:36:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But none the less,</v>

3187
02:36:59.450 --> 02:37:04.450
<v Speaker 2>it's pointed to the fact that it was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome you give a mouse meat and </v>

3188
02:37:04.450 --> 02:37:08.731
<v Speaker 2>given an antibiotic that wipes out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome a won't make tmao tmao </v>

3189
02:37:08.731 --> 02:37:12.151
<v Speaker 2>dependency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The microbiome dependency of tmao is </v>

3190
02:37:12.151 --> 02:37:12.151
<v Speaker 2>well known science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3191
02:37:12.151 --> 02:37:15.190
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not denigrate the topic.</v>

3192
02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:16.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a side topic.</v>

3193
02:37:16.641 --> 02:37:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Is fish always healthy in a world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ddt?</v>

3194
02:37:19.851 --> 02:37:22.520
<v Speaker 2>pcb mercury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about christmas practice,</v>

3195
02:37:22.521 --> 02:37:27.521
<v Speaker 2>but every patient I see gets blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>mercury levels and those that eat </v>

3196
02:37:27.521 --> 02:37:28.790
<v Speaker 2>routinely heavy or very often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's another subject.</v>

3197
02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:30.980
<v Speaker 2>That's another subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

3198
02:37:31.250 --> 02:37:34.190
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to look at old data on fish and</v>

3199
02:37:34.191 --> 02:37:37.580
<v Speaker 2>now I'm bringing up 2018 clinical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what he's doing.</v>

3200
02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:42.610
<v Speaker 2>We're not bringing up old data on female</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat up old data and I'm bringing </v>

3201
02:37:42.610 --> 02:37:47.290
<v Speaker 2>relevant clinical materials about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute mechanism that's caused by the </v>

3202
02:37:47.991 --> 02:37:49.100
<v Speaker 2>consumption of meat.</v>

3203
02:37:49.130 --> 02:37:54.130
<v Speaker 2>He brought up fish consumption which </v>
<v Speaker 2>vastly elevates this and yet fish </v>

3204
02:37:56.391 --> 02:37:59.060
<v Speaker 2>consumption is not correlated with heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

3205
02:37:59.061 --> 02:38:04.061
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's correlated with people having </v>

3206
02:38:04.061 --> 02:38:06.041
<v Speaker 2>healthier hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're suggesting to me is the </v>

3207
02:38:06.041 --> 02:38:08.210
<v Speaker 2>recommendation today in this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat fish,</v>

3208
02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:10.460
<v Speaker 2>but limit egg yolk and meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd agree with that.</v>

3209
02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:15.520
<v Speaker 2>That's not what it says because the fish</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumption vastly elevates what you </v>

3210
02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:20.411
<v Speaker 2>were saying was significant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's saying it's not a significant </v>

3211
02:38:20.411 --> 02:38:24.191
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a mechanism and it's an </v>

3212
02:38:24.191 --> 02:38:26.171
<v Speaker 2>interesting mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's part of a much larger and </v>

3213
02:38:26.171 --> 02:38:28.100
<v Speaker 2>probably very poorly understood </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

3214
02:38:29.210 --> 02:38:32.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's completely true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we do know is that true?</v>

3215
02:38:32.450 --> 02:38:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3216
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:36.980
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's true and I would say </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another proxy marker for crappy,</v>

3217
02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:40.750
<v Speaker 2>crappy diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we know is that eating red meat and</v>

3218
02:38:40.751 --> 02:38:44.330
<v Speaker 2>the context of a standard american diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3219
02:38:44.510 --> 02:38:49.510
<v Speaker 2>may slightly raise your tmao but not </v>
<v Speaker 2>nearly as much as eating fish will.</v>

3220
02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:54.260
<v Speaker 2>So you brought up this tmao and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically just squashed that argument,</v>

3221
02:38:54.430 --> 02:38:57.140
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's a scientifically wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>

3222
02:38:57.141 --> 02:39:02.141
<v Speaker 2>the wealth of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean is that about tmao about </v>

3223
02:39:02.141 --> 02:39:06.230
<v Speaker 2>female because what about the fish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a few specific fish,</v>

3224
02:39:06.290 --> 02:39:09.490
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that egg yolk and red meat,</v>

3225
02:39:09.491 --> 02:39:11.450
<v Speaker 2>cleveland clinic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new england journal medicine is,</v>

3226
02:39:11.451 --> 02:39:15.770
<v Speaker 2>is this a step of eden adjusting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>precursor going through your microbiome,</v>

3227
02:39:15.980 --> 02:39:20.980
<v Speaker 2>going through an enzyme called </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and your small intestine </v>

3228
02:39:20.980 --> 02:39:21.980
<v Speaker 2>going to your liver as tma and green </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolize it tmao.</v>

3229
02:39:22.190 --> 02:39:24.140
<v Speaker 2>That process is correlated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>atherosclerosis,</v>

3230
02:39:24.260 --> 02:39:29.260
<v Speaker 2>atherosclerosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That process is correlated with </v>

3231
02:39:29.260 --> 02:39:29.260
<v Speaker 2>increased activity of ldl within your </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell wall,</v>

3232
02:39:29.350 --> 02:39:32.180
<v Speaker 2>leaded by epidemiologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bio chemistry,</v>

3233
02:39:32.181 --> 02:39:34.730
<v Speaker 2>biochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know how it works in the petri dish.</v>

3234
02:39:34.731 --> 02:39:39.620
<v Speaker 2>That was the brilliance of this rapid </v>
<v Speaker 2>development from 2011 to 2013 to now,</v>

3235
02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:41.820
<v Speaker 2>so it's not in fish.</v>

3236
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:46.910
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't been studied is if fish flesh </v>
<v Speaker 2>already has preformed tmao.</v>

3237
02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:49.730
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if it activates ldl </v>
<v Speaker 2>activation.</v>

3238
02:39:49.731 --> 02:39:51.380
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if it's dones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hdl.</v>

3239
02:39:51.530 --> 02:39:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's looked at the correlation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish flesh,</v>

3240
02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:57.230
<v Speaker 2>preformed tmao,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a 4,000</v>

3241
02:39:57.231 --> 02:40:02.231
<v Speaker 2>patients studied in the cath lab table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know they're wonderful </v>

3242
02:40:02.231 --> 02:40:02.420
<v Speaker 2>questIons to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but until they're done,</v>

3243
02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:07.750
<v Speaker 2>there is reason to be concerned that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a new pathway that might be </v>

3244
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:09.410
<v Speaker 2>involved in athletes talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally different thing.</v>

3245
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3246
02:40:11.180 --> 02:40:16.180
<v Speaker 2>If if consuming food that raises your </v>
<v Speaker 2>tmao increased the risk of heart disease</v>

3247
02:40:16.651 --> 02:40:19.080
<v Speaker 2>and you'd see people who are eating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most fish,</v>

3248
02:40:19.081 --> 02:40:24.081
<v Speaker 2>having the most heart attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the opposite of what you see </v>

3249
02:40:24.081 --> 02:40:24.780
<v Speaker 2>that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's reductionist because what</v>

3250
02:40:24.781 --> 02:40:29.781
<v Speaker 2>does fish out reductiveness to bring up </v>
<v Speaker 2>tmao in the first place because you </v>

3251
02:40:29.781 --> 02:40:33.831
<v Speaker 2>brought her even more than what I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>said because I zoomed out a little bit </v>

3252
02:40:33.831 --> 02:40:35.310
<v Speaker 2>to look at the actual relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>mortality.</v>

3253
02:40:35.490 --> 02:40:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a blood level.</v>

3254
02:40:37.081 --> 02:40:39.180
<v Speaker 2>That's not atherosclerosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not outcome.</v>

3255
02:40:39.181 --> 02:40:41.730
<v Speaker 2>That's not kidney function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not stroke risk and heart rates,</v>

3256
02:40:41.731 --> 02:40:46.731
<v Speaker 2>which happens about tmao.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am talking about what that graph </v>

3257
02:40:47.731 --> 02:40:50.700
<v Speaker 2>showed was tmao back it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You eat red meat,</v>

3258
02:40:50.730 --> 02:40:55.730
<v Speaker 2>you make tmao.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your microbiome is of a certain </v>

3259
02:40:55.730 --> 02:40:55.730
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat egg yolk,</v>

3260
02:40:55.730 --> 02:40:56.520
<v Speaker 2>you make tmao.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's a certain constitution,</v>

3261
02:40:56.670 --> 02:40:59.130
<v Speaker 2>is it good to have high levels with tmao</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the blood,</v>

3262
02:40:59.131 --> 02:41:00.660
<v Speaker 2>whether they're from fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>egg yolk,</v>

3263
02:41:00.661 --> 02:41:02.370
<v Speaker 2>or red meat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The science of justice.</v>

3264
02:41:02.371 --> 02:41:07.371
<v Speaker 2>Not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can you do to lower your </v>

3265
02:41:07.371 --> 02:41:07.371
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me pause you.</v>

3266
02:41:07.371 --> 02:41:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Let me pause you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does the science suggests it's no </v>

3267
02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:13.281
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's large levels of tmao that </v>

3268
02:41:13.281 --> 02:41:13.281
<v Speaker 2>come from fish and when you eat that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish,</v>

3269
02:41:13.281 --> 02:41:15.900
<v Speaker 2>it's directly correlated with less heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

3270
02:41:15.930 --> 02:41:19.670
<v Speaker 2>What it would take an evaluation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the calorie content of the United</v>

3271
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:21.030
<v Speaker 2>States from cod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>halibut,</v>

3272
02:41:21.210 --> 02:41:22.410
<v Speaker 2>red meat and egg yolk.</v>

3273
02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:27.440
<v Speaker 2>I would think the calorie content of egg</v>
<v Speaker 2>yolk and red meat is higher than cotton </v>

3274
02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:31.710
<v Speaker 2>helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that data and that's a </v>

3275
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:33.801
<v Speaker 2>global perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you are up to date in the </v>

3276
02:41:33.801 --> 02:41:33.801
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3277
02:41:33.801 --> 02:41:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to lead a lower tmao life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>

3278
02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say with all boldness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've drawn more blood levels on anybody </v>

3279
02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:42.921
<v Speaker 2>in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe according to the cleveland </v>

3280
02:41:42.921 --> 02:41:44.841
<v Speaker 2>heart labs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will want to do all steps to lower </v>

3281
02:41:44.841 --> 02:41:48.141
<v Speaker 2>it and maybe you want to leave fishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the complimentary benefit that </v>

3282
02:41:48.141 --> 02:41:52.341
<v Speaker 2>fishes shown maybe from omega three </v>
<v Speaker 2>speculative though we don't understand </v>

3283
02:41:52.341 --> 02:41:53.250
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tmi te,</v>

3284
02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:55.140
<v Speaker 2>te reo as a mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3285
02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:59.250
<v Speaker 2>It's purely speculative to say that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tmao from fish is healthy,</v>

3286
02:41:59.251 --> 02:42:01.950
<v Speaker 2>but the tmao from beef and eggs is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3287
02:42:01.951 --> 02:42:04.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we know the answer because</v>

3288
02:42:04.681 --> 02:42:07.140
<v Speaker 2>it's seven year old science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're stating it though.</v>

3289
02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not saying that you're studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tmao is a massive concern.</v>

3290
02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:14.190
<v Speaker 2>That is scientifically true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it scientifically true?</v>

3291
02:42:14.191 --> 02:42:17.130
<v Speaker 2>If there's so much tmao and fish and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no concern?</v>

3292
02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:20.280
<v Speaker 2>There's two species of fish that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest levels.</v>

3293
02:42:20.281 --> 02:42:25.281
<v Speaker 2>You saw the other levels or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones filling fish in </v>

3294
02:42:25.281 --> 02:42:27.610
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't rare fish and we're not,</v>

3295
02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:31.830
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about beef and eggs barely</v>

3296
02:42:31.831 --> 02:42:35.590
<v Speaker 2>even register on that grass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orders of magnitude higher.</v>

3297
02:42:35.591 --> 02:42:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Like what percentage looked like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

3298
02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:39.650
<v Speaker 2>It was hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3299
02:42:39.660 --> 02:42:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I probably 20 fold higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty four,</v>

3300
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:47.150
<v Speaker 2>20 times higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I might've even mentioned that in </v>

3301
02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:47.750
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my original article.</v>

3302
02:42:47.970 --> 02:42:49.920
<v Speaker 2>joel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is you brought up to mayo in</v>

3303
02:42:49.921 --> 02:42:51.990
<v Speaker 2>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was this.</v>

3304
02:42:52.170 --> 02:42:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me just tell you,</v>

3305
02:42:53.681 --> 02:42:54.340
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

3306
02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:58.230
<v Speaker 2>let's everybody look at molecular </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition food research.</v>

3307
02:42:58.231 --> 02:43:03.231
<v Speaker 2>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does fish protein when it elevates tmao </v>

3308
02:43:03.231 --> 02:43:05.850
<v Speaker 2>accelerated atherosclerosis according to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a research study,</v>

3309
02:43:05.851 --> 02:43:09.300
<v Speaker 2>when fish raised tml,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they accelerate atherosclerosis.</v>

3310
02:43:10.050 --> 02:43:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can check the lead author.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot</v>

3311
02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:14.240
<v Speaker 4>say the name yazdi gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dee.</v>

3312
02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:17.080
<v Speaker 4>Conclusion reached,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3313
02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:18.730
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a petri dish.</v>

3314
02:43:18.731 --> 02:43:19.900
<v Speaker 4>Data,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3315
02:43:19.901 --> 02:43:21.430
<v Speaker 4>is a petri dish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking for a minute.</v>

3316
02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:26.760
<v Speaker 4>It's basic biochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens to atherosclerosis in </v>

3317
02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:27.640
<v Speaker 4>arteries when you feed this was a mouse </v>
<v Speaker 4>data.</v>

3318
02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:30.310
<v Speaker 4>That's how you generate hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3319
02:43:30.311 --> 02:43:34.840
<v Speaker 4>it hasn't been done in humans yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not such a thing as pure fact.</v>

3320
02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:40.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the assumption is the fishes a </v>

3321
02:43:40.020 --> 02:43:40.020
<v Speaker 4>superfood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've Already knocked It down for several</v>

3322
02:43:40.020 --> 02:43:40.240
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

3323
02:43:40.350 --> 02:43:43.750
<v Speaker 4>the fish intake is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>increased risk of diabetes.</v>

3324
02:43:43.751 --> 02:43:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's epidemiology.</v>

3325
02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:48.910
<v Speaker 4>Fish is here with inCreased risk of </v>
<v Speaker 4>diabetes.</v>

3326
02:43:48.911 --> 02:43:52.450
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got protein epidemiology studies.</v>

3327
02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:55.330
<v Speaker 4>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a randomized study,</v>

3328
02:43:55.331 --> 02:44:00.331
<v Speaker 4>basic biochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would understand that from the </v>

3329
02:44:00.331 --> 02:44:03.091
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat content of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be largely epidemiologic </v>

3330
02:44:03.091 --> 02:44:03.091
<v Speaker 4>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that,</v>

3331
02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:05.110
<v Speaker 1>but when you're saying epidemiology </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>

3332
02:44:05.111 --> 02:44:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you're asking people what do you eat on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a regular basis and if they say fish and</v>

3333
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:13.080
<v Speaker 1>french fries and hot dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3334
02:44:13.090 --> 02:44:14.290
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3335
02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:19.380
<v Speaker 1>the fish is associated with an increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it can happen and it's not </v>

3336
02:44:20.921 --> 02:44:21.640
<v Speaker 1>isolated.</v>

3337
02:44:22.290 --> 02:44:27.290
<v Speaker 4>It's connected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the other things with that isolated </v>

3338
02:44:27.290 --> 02:44:27.750
<v Speaker 4>what you're trying to isolate out things</v>
<v Speaker 4>by multivariate analysis.</v>

3339
02:44:27.751 --> 02:44:29.240
<v Speaker 4>Emmy is not one study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's many,</v>

3340
02:44:29.550 --> 02:44:32.970
<v Speaker 4>but diabetes and Fish really is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>real?</v>

3341
02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:33.850
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

3342
02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:39.940
<v Speaker 5>review that said that and review because</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a 2012 review that does not find</v>

3343
02:44:42.281 --> 02:44:46.060
<v Speaker 5>any association between fish consumption</v>
<v Speaker 5>and diabetes.</v>

3344
02:44:46.090 --> 02:44:51.090
<v Speaker 5>So you're thinking this is for 440,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people with an average of 11 year follow</v>

3345
02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:56.290
<v Speaker 5>up published in the american diabetes </v>
<v Speaker 5>association,</v>

3346
02:44:56.350 --> 02:44:59.080
<v Speaker 5>diabetes care journal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I.</v>

3347
02:44:59.081 --> 02:45:01.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you know it.</v>

3348
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:04.540
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard I think to make the claim that</v>

3349
02:45:04.541 --> 02:45:09.541
<v Speaker 5>fish consumption is harmful for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>enormous weight of evidence and yes,</v>

3350
02:45:11.051 --> 02:45:16.051
<v Speaker 5>there are concerns now about toxins then</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might change over time and there are </v>

3351
02:45:16.051 --> 02:45:17.290
<v Speaker 5>also issues with overfishing and all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3352
02:45:17.291 --> 02:45:22.291
<v Speaker 5>but on different story we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about just the association of fish </v>

3353
02:45:22.291 --> 02:45:25.810
<v Speaker 5>consumption and health and longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think if you've got 100 scientists</v>

3354
02:45:25.811 --> 02:45:29.620
<v Speaker 5>in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe 99 of them would agree that that's</v>

3355
02:45:29.790 --> 02:45:30.920
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you know,</v>

3356
02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:35.940
<v Speaker 5>there are a few things in nutritional </v>
<v Speaker 5>research that are less controversial </v>

3357
02:45:35.940 --> 02:45:35.940
<v Speaker 5>than that.</v>

3358
02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:37.690
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm just,</v>

3359
02:45:37.700 --> 02:45:39.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making this shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Journal,</v>

3360
02:45:39.330 --> 02:45:44.330
<v Speaker 4>american college and nutrition intake of</v>
<v Speaker 4>fish was correlated positively with the </v>

3361
02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:45.290
<v Speaker 4>increased risk of diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the science is out there.</v>

3362
02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:48.950
<v Speaker 4>Is it crystal clear as well defined as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the head of state equation,</v>

3363
02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:51.410
<v Speaker 4>dietary saturated fat changing </v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol?</v>

3364
02:45:51.411 --> 02:45:56.411
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it an association that could be of </v>

3365
02:45:56.411 --> 02:45:56.420
<v Speaker 4>concern and basic biochemistry said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fish?</v>

3366
02:45:56.421 --> 02:46:01.421
<v Speaker 4>You have saturated fat that could </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly caused something called lipo </v>

3367
02:46:01.421 --> 02:46:01.610
<v Speaker 4>toxicity fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have animal protein.</v>

3368
02:46:01.611 --> 02:46:06.611
<v Speaker 4>We've already talked where animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>proteins very different than plant </v>

3369
02:46:06.611 --> 02:46:06.611
<v Speaker 4>proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The concept is plausible.</v>

3370
02:46:06.611 --> 02:46:07.370
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it resolved?</v>

3371
02:46:07.371 --> 02:46:10.220
<v Speaker 4>It's not resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is fish a better than eating</v>

3372
02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:14.620
<v Speaker 5>fried chicken or a piece of affiliate </v>
<v Speaker 5>hoagie stake?</v>

3373
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:15.990
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's upsetting.</v>

3374
02:46:16.060 --> 02:46:16.590
<v Speaker 5>Just pull it up.</v>

3375
02:46:16.650 --> 02:46:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Then up here it says the findings is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive.</v>

3376
02:46:18.481 --> 02:46:23.481
<v Speaker 1>Beneficial effect of total fish type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish or epa and dha intake on the risk </v>

3377
02:46:25.741 --> 02:46:28.110
<v Speaker 1>of type two diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alternatively,</v>

3378
02:46:28.380 --> 02:46:33.380
<v Speaker 1>other dietary components such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>selenium and unmeasured contaminants </v>

3379
02:46:34.141 --> 02:46:35.670
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present in fish.</v>

3380
02:46:35.671 --> 02:46:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Might explain</v>

3381
02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:37.870
<v Speaker 5>jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3382
02:46:37.871 --> 02:46:42.871
<v Speaker 5>read the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Total fish intake was associated </v>

3383
02:46:42.871 --> 02:46:45.190
<v Speaker 5>positively with the risk of type two </v>
<v Speaker 5>diabetes that says there's epidemiology.</v>

3384
02:46:45.191 --> 02:46:50.191
<v Speaker 5>That should be further studied,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but maybe somebody wants to cut back </v>

3385
02:46:50.191 --> 02:46:53.860
<v Speaker 5>their fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're looking at a single study here</v>

3386
02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:56.140
<v Speaker 5>to look at the weight of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

3387
02:46:56.141 --> 02:46:57.070
<v Speaker 5>you're bad man.</v>

3388
02:46:57.550 --> 02:47:02.550
<v Speaker 1>A minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says findings do not support a </v>

3389
02:47:02.550 --> 02:47:06.311
<v Speaker 1>beneficial effect of total fish type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish or epa dpa on the intake,</v>

3390
02:47:07.761 --> 02:47:11.080
<v Speaker 1>on the risk of type two diabetes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3391
02:47:11.390 --> 02:47:15.560
<v Speaker 5>lean fish was associated with developing</v>
<v Speaker 5>type two diabetes.</v>

3392
02:47:15.561 --> 02:47:18.650
<v Speaker 5>Fatty fish was not because you probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>want that omega three,</v>

3393
02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:24.220
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not telling anybody it's a resolved </v>

3394
02:47:24.220 --> 02:47:24.220
<v Speaker 5>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that yours?</v>

3395
02:47:24.220 --> 02:47:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Sang tma from animal protein is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes this problem?</v>

3396
02:47:28.781 --> 02:47:28.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3397
02:47:28.900 --> 02:47:32.580
<v Speaker 5>it's actually more specific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's coleen and carnitine in egg yolk.</v>

3398
02:47:32.581 --> 02:47:34.030
<v Speaker 5>It's not really animal protein.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

3399
02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:37.440
<v Speaker 5>But you said the tmao tmao.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tmao is.</v>

3400
02:47:37.441 --> 02:47:40.650
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so what's in meat?</v>

3401
02:47:40.651 --> 02:47:45.651
<v Speaker 5>That's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>although if you're hungry on an island </v>

3402
02:47:45.651 --> 02:47:45.651
<v Speaker 5>and you're dying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eat meat,</v>

3403
02:47:45.651 --> 02:47:50.361
<v Speaker 5>we all recognize it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you're looking for optimal </v>

3404
02:47:50.361 --> 02:47:52.431
<v Speaker 5>health,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should be concerned about saturated </v>

3405
02:47:52.431 --> 02:47:54.621
<v Speaker 5>fat content.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should be concerned that animal </v>

3406
02:47:54.621 --> 02:47:57.150
<v Speaker 5>protein accelerates aging and igf one is</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3407
02:47:57.151 --> 02:47:59.430
<v Speaker 5>but proven that animal protein </v>
<v Speaker 5>accelerates aging.</v>

3408
02:47:59.650 --> 02:48:00.960
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he says no,</v>

3409
02:48:00.961 --> 02:48:05.810
<v Speaker 5>we should just stop because that's it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>world class science.</v>

3410
02:48:05.811 --> 02:48:10.811
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just because you say it doesn't mean we </v>

3411
02:48:10.811 --> 02:48:13.320
<v Speaker 5>did go visit a possibility that high </v>
<v Speaker 5>intakes of mathias [inaudible],</v>

3412
02:48:13.370 --> 02:48:18.370
<v Speaker 5>which isn't one of the amino acids in </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal protein in the absence of </v>

3413
02:48:19.321 --> 02:48:24.321
<v Speaker 5>sufficient intakes of glycine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is another amino acid that's in </v>

3414
02:48:24.321 --> 02:48:27.510
<v Speaker 5>animal proteins and an intake of </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrients like b,</v>

3415
02:48:27.511 --> 02:48:30.120
<v Speaker 5>12 and b,</v>
<v Speaker 5>six and b,</v>

3416
02:48:30.121 --> 02:48:31.440
<v Speaker 5>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is full eight.</v>

3417
02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:36.800
<v Speaker 5>Could some of the animal studies suggest</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that has an effect on longevity,</v>

3418
02:48:36.991 --> 02:48:40.320
<v Speaker 5>but this is why I've always been an </v>
<v Speaker 5>advocate of eating nose to tail,</v>

3419
02:48:40.380 --> 02:48:45.380
<v Speaker 5>so not just eating lean meats that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>very high and matthias and making sure </v>

3420
02:48:45.380 --> 02:48:46.840
<v Speaker 5>you're getting enough of the glycine </v>
<v Speaker 5>rich foods,</v>

3421
02:48:46.841 --> 02:48:48.270
<v Speaker 5>the bone broth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera,</v>

3422
02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:51.280
<v Speaker 5>and then you're also eating plenty of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3423
02:48:51.290 --> 02:48:56.290
<v Speaker 5>a mixed diet that contains 12 and full </v>
<v Speaker 5>eight and b six and the other nutrients </v>

3424
02:48:56.581 --> 02:49:01.581
<v Speaker 5>that balance out the effects of excess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>MatthIas matheny as well as fiber for a </v>

3425
02:49:01.581 --> 02:49:02.220
<v Speaker 5>healthy gut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

3426
02:49:02.221 --> 02:49:05.280
<v Speaker 5>And when you pulled up that conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no fiber in meat,</v>

3427
02:49:05.310 --> 02:49:06.820
<v Speaker 5>no meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3428
02:49:06.850 --> 02:49:08.160
<v Speaker 5>Will you eat other things?</v>

3429
02:49:08.610 --> 02:49:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I've never argued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never bad except Sean Baker.</v>

3430
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole nother ball of wax or </v>

3431
02:49:18.830 --> 02:49:21.861
<v Speaker 1>that whole carnivore diet conclusions at</v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated evidence generated from this</v>

3432
02:49:22.951 --> 02:49:27.951
<v Speaker 1>meta analysis does not support the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall inverse association of fish or </v>

3433
02:49:27.951 --> 02:49:30.920
<v Speaker 1>fish oil intake with incidents of </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes.</v>

3434
02:49:31.290 --> 02:49:36.290
<v Speaker 3>That'S saying that they couldn't confirm</v>
<v Speaker 3>increase fish intake doesn't lower the </v>

3435
02:49:36.290 --> 02:49:40.641
<v Speaker 3>risk of diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not saying that it increases the </v>

3436
02:49:40.641 --> 02:49:40.641
<v Speaker 3>risk.</v>

3437
02:49:40.641 --> 02:49:44.350
<v Speaker 1>So it says it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no relationship there taking </v>

3438
02:49:44.350 --> 02:49:46.190
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that no one's saying that it</v>

3439
02:49:46.191 --> 02:49:48.900
<v Speaker 1>causes diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever it does.</v>

3440
02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.520
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

3441
02:49:49.530 --> 02:49:50.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

3442
02:49:50.150 --> 02:49:52.120
<v Speaker 1>where does it say that it causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes?</v>

3443
02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:57.160
<v Speaker 1>What does this study nobody said to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause this is classic association </v>

3444
02:49:57.160 --> 02:49:58.220
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know if it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein,</v>

3445
02:49:58.221 --> 02:49:59.600
<v Speaker 1>the fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mercury,</v>

3446
02:49:59.601 --> 02:50:03.780
<v Speaker 1>the pcbs and ddt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are fish die.</v>

3447
02:50:03.790 --> 02:50:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're eating fish and chips.</v>

3448
02:50:05.610 --> 02:50:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3449
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:11.390
<v Speaker 1>This is clearly not to the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying processed red meat causes cancer.</v>

3450
02:50:11.391 --> 02:50:16.391
<v Speaker 1>This is saying fish consumption in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies is associated with type two </v>

3451
02:50:16.391 --> 02:50:17.360
<v Speaker 1>diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are heavily flood studies.</v>

3452
02:50:17.361 --> 02:50:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Would you agree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't throw them all under the bus.</v>

3453
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:21.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how science works.</v>

3454
02:50:21.981 --> 02:50:23.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it slowly plods forward,</v>

3455
02:50:23.891 --> 02:50:24.440
<v Speaker 1>smiling.</v>

3456
02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

3457
02:50:27.570 --> 02:50:32.570
<v Speaker 3>we were starting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe brought up tmao and then that's how </v>

3458
02:50:32.570 --> 02:50:36.821
<v Speaker 3>we got onto fish in diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there is no strong evidence that</v>

3459
02:50:37.041 --> 02:50:40.220
<v Speaker 3>fish causes diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eating fish causes diabetes.</v>

3460
02:50:40.221 --> 02:50:45.221
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of evidence that suggests </v>
<v Speaker 3>that eating seafood reduces </v>

3461
02:50:45.221 --> 02:50:47.840
<v Speaker 3>significantly the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the incidence of cardiovascular disease.</v>

3462
02:50:47.841 --> 02:50:52.841
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if tma out were a problem then eating a </v>

3463
02:50:52.841 --> 02:50:53.570
<v Speaker 3>lot of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should not have that impact.</v>

3464
02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:56.120
<v Speaker 1>I believe that this is probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I shouldn't say you believe.</v>

3465
02:50:56.121 --> 02:50:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe this is from essential </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatty acids that are found in fish,</v>

3466
02:50:59.331 --> 02:51:00.770
<v Speaker 1>particularly fatty fish?</v>

3467
02:51:01.380 --> 02:51:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's plausible given what we </v>

3468
02:51:06.380 --> 02:51:07.080
<v Speaker 3>know about epa and dha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are the long chain essential fatty</v>

3469
02:51:07.081 --> 02:51:12.081
<v Speaker 3>acids and their benefits and it could be</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish is also a really great source of </v>

3470
02:51:13.561 --> 02:51:16.800
<v Speaker 3>selenium as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as that one study said 16 and the tWenty</v>

3471
02:51:16.801 --> 02:51:19.740
<v Speaker 3>five top sources of slain income from </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean fish.</v>

3472
02:51:20.190 --> 02:51:22.740
<v Speaker 3>Fish is a great source of bioavailable </v>
<v Speaker 3>protein.</v>

3473
02:51:23.070 --> 02:51:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are lots of reasons why,</v>

3474
02:51:25.270 --> 02:51:27.360
<v Speaker 3>why fish consumption could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial.</v>

3475
02:51:27.450 --> 02:51:27.960
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3476
02:51:28.360 --> 02:51:33.360
<v Speaker 1>in your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tHis sort of highlights that there's a </v>

3477
02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:36.481
<v Speaker 1>lot of complex different moving parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we dOn't totally understand and </v>

3478
02:51:37.781 --> 02:51:42.781
<v Speaker 1>that this is why you don't want to rely </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely on just the mechanisms and </v>

3479
02:51:43.720 --> 02:51:47.480
<v Speaker 1>these things that are occurring in petri</v>
<v Speaker 1>dishes or mice studies or</v>

3480
02:51:47.780 --> 02:51:49.190
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3481
02:51:49.191 --> 02:51:53.600
<v Speaker 3>So going back to the bradford hill </v>
<v Speaker 3>criteria that we mentioned before,</v>

3482
02:51:53.601 --> 02:51:58.601
<v Speaker 3>which are ways of kind of determining </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether associations that should show up</v>

3483
02:51:59.181 --> 02:52:01.220
<v Speaker 3>and observational studies might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>causal.</v>

3484
02:52:02.410 --> 02:52:05.620
<v Speaker 3>The plausibility one of one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>criteria is mechanism.</v>

3485
02:52:05.621 --> 02:52:06.430
<v Speaker 3>Is there a plausible</v>

3486
02:52:06.430 --> 02:52:11.430
<v Speaker 5>mechanism that could explain the </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship between this variable and </v>

3487
02:52:11.430 --> 02:52:12.600
<v Speaker 5>that variable?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there are other criteria,</v>

3488
02:52:12.620 --> 02:52:13.840
<v Speaker 5>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 5>consistency,</v>

3489
02:52:13.841 --> 02:52:15.580
<v Speaker 5>specificity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>temporality,</v>

3490
02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:20.800
<v Speaker 5>plot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a biological gradient like a dose </v>

3491
02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:20.800
<v Speaker 5>response.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3492
02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:22.600
<v Speaker 5>coherence experiment analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yes,</v>

3493
02:52:22.630 --> 02:52:23.830
<v Speaker 5>mechanisms are great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

3494
02:52:23.831 --> 02:52:27.050
<v Speaker 5>it's important to study them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm all for that and we,</v>

3495
02:52:27.090 --> 02:52:31.300
<v Speaker 5>we absolutely need to correlate them </v>
<v Speaker 5>with real outcomes and real human beings</v>

3496
02:52:31.301 --> 02:52:36.130
<v Speaker 5>to see both in observational studies </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are well designed and in randomized</v>

3497
02:52:36.131 --> 02:52:38.290
<v Speaker 5>controlled trials to see if it makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>

3498
02:52:38.291 --> 02:52:40.900
<v Speaker 5>And the tmao.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a great example of that.</v>

3499
02:52:41.270 --> 02:52:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it fair to say that we really just </v>

3500
02:52:46.270 --> 02:52:46.610
<v Speaker 2>are looking at a puzzle and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all the pieces?</v>

3501
02:52:46.640 --> 02:52:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I think you can say that in many cases </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in this case for sure.</v>

3502
02:52:52.490 --> 02:52:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree that there's a tremendous </v>

3503
02:52:57.490 --> 02:52:59.981
<v Speaker 2>group and you can pull this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we went jamie called true health </v>

3504
02:52:59.981 --> 02:53:00.050
<v Speaker 2>initiative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more than 400,</v>

3505
02:53:00.051 --> 02:53:05.051
<v Speaker 2>I'd call world experts on nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairy divergent food philosophies,</v>

3506
02:53:05.600 --> 02:53:10.600
<v Speaker 2>paleo mediterranean plants specifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreeing well so that there's no </v>

3507
02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:15.431
<v Speaker 2>consensus to advise the public on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy diet for humans.</v>

3508
02:53:15.690 --> 02:53:17.720
<v Speaker 2>They disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we said.</v>

3509
02:53:17.900 --> 02:53:19.740
<v Speaker 2>That's what we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we said was that there's.</v>

3510
02:53:19.790 --> 02:53:22.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a complex puzzle and we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the pieces.</v>

3511
02:53:22.610 --> 02:53:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that,</v>

3512
02:53:23.451 --> 02:53:26.420
<v Speaker 2>but we have enough to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommendations because we have enough.</v>

3513
02:53:26.570 --> 02:53:31.570
<v Speaker 2>We have enough to make recommendations </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the public and the true health </v>

3514
02:53:31.570 --> 02:53:31.570
<v Speaker 2>initiative has crystallized that.</v>

3515
02:53:31.570 --> 02:53:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what we were discussing </v>

3516
02:53:36.350 --> 02:53:36.350
<v Speaker 2>right there about recommendations to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>

3517
02:53:36.350 --> 02:53:39.761
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about mechanisms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's understood all the </v>

3518
02:53:39.761 --> 02:53:42.290
<v Speaker 2>different moving pieces in terms of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body absorbs nutrients and food.</v>

3519
02:53:43.250 --> 02:53:48.250
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an endless flow of new knowledge </v>

3520
02:53:48.250 --> 02:53:48.250
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why?</v>

3521
02:53:48.250 --> 02:53:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Why did you disagree with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't disagree with it.</v>

3522
02:53:50.140 --> 02:53:53.480
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree when he said that.</v>

3523
02:53:53.481 --> 02:53:57.290
<v Speaker 2>That's an accurate assessment that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have all the pieces to the puzzle.</v>

3524
02:53:57.310 --> 02:54:02.310
<v Speaker 2>We definitely go to have all the pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have enough to make recommendations </v>

3525
02:54:02.310 --> 02:54:03.560
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll reevaluate and all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want another new meat problem?</v>

3526
02:54:03.860 --> 02:54:05.330
<v Speaker 2>It's coolest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latest science.</v>

3527
02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3528
02:54:06.470 --> 02:54:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you go to please meet allergy on </v>

3529
02:54:11.470 --> 02:54:11.870
<v Speaker 2>google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>university of Virginia,</v>

3530
02:54:12.020 --> 02:54:14.900
<v Speaker 2>atherosclerosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So little tolerance meat allergy.</v>

3531
02:54:14.901 --> 02:54:18.080
<v Speaker 2>You wait and go to the second tick.</v>

3532
02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a baby.</v>

3533
02:54:19.131 --> 02:54:20.890
<v Speaker 2>You are so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe lactose,</v>

3534
02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:26.040
<v Speaker 2>my gel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am so overwhelmed by your science and </v>

3535
02:54:26.040 --> 02:54:26.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean that sincerely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the one that says nih?</v>

3536
02:54:27.410 --> 02:54:32.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a number to hit and google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is something that is caused by </v>

3537
02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:37.480
<v Speaker 2>an adverse reaction to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to listener here who's in </v>

3538
02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:41.171
<v Speaker 2>Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you see a segue question whether </v>

3539
02:54:43.130 --> 02:54:45.200
<v Speaker 2>the average person should eat meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

3540
02:54:46.090 --> 02:54:50.420
<v Speaker 2>but if you get started with this here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

3541
02:54:50.421 --> 02:54:55.421
<v Speaker 2>So this is diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'd go to the second </v>

3542
02:54:55.421 --> 02:54:55.421
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have the picture just real quick.</v>

3543
02:54:55.421 --> 02:54:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live in Virginia,</v>

3544
02:54:57.140 --> 02:54:59.690
<v Speaker 2>you end up putting god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

3545
02:55:00.140 --> 02:55:05.140
<v Speaker 2>You end up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up on my cath table because </v>

3546
02:55:05.140 --> 02:55:05.960
<v Speaker 2>you're in the emergency room for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason.</v>

3547
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I draw a blood sample on you.</v>

3548
02:55:07.940 --> 02:55:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Twenty four percent of those people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a antibody to alpha gal,</v>

3549
02:55:13.641 --> 02:55:17.150
<v Speaker 2>which is a carbohydrate found in meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that shocks people.</v>

3550
02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:20.540
<v Speaker 2>There are carbohydrates and mainly red </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat specifically and only red meat,</v>

3551
02:55:20.541 --> 02:55:23.510
<v Speaker 2>specifically 24 percent of Virginia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so the antibody,</v>

3552
02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:27.470
<v Speaker 2>so that was interesting and some are now</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing anaphylaxis,</v>

3553
02:55:27.650 --> 02:55:29.870
<v Speaker 2>carrying epi pens because they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate allergy.</v>

3554
02:55:29.871 --> 02:55:32.660
<v Speaker 2>that isn't two point four percent is 24 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent have the antibody,</v>

3555
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:37.870
<v Speaker 2>but what was discovered university of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia is if you then look at their </v>

3556
02:55:37.870 --> 02:55:39.290
<v Speaker 2>heart arteries by ultrasound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more plaque they have,</v>

3557
02:55:39.291 --> 02:55:42.110
<v Speaker 2>the higher is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tighter the antibody brand new science.</v>

3558
02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:47.200
<v Speaker 2>It's an association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows there is of course the </v>

3559
02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:48.200
<v Speaker 2>possibility of inflammation from immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>activation.</v>

3560
02:55:48.620 --> 02:55:49.850
<v Speaker 2>That's wild data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3561
02:55:49.851 --> 02:55:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't wish that on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wished we live in a world,</v>

3562
02:55:52.281 --> 02:55:57.281
<v Speaker 2>but people didn't have nut allergies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have lactose in towns and didn't </v>

3563
02:55:57.281 --> 02:56:00.791
<v Speaker 2>have meat allergies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is there may be a </v>

3564
02:56:00.791 --> 02:56:03.611
<v Speaker 2>pathway previous unknown that is hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this all goes back to your question.</v>

3565
02:56:04.340 --> 02:56:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Is there any new physiology about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole stop you right there.</v>

3566
02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:11.990
<v Speaker 2>This is a pathogen activated allergy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's from a pretty severe.</v>

3567
02:56:11.991 --> 02:56:14.660
<v Speaker 2>People don't walk around with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>without knowing that they have it.</v>

3568
02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:18.560
<v Speaker 2>They have severe allergic reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically like lyme disease,</v>

3569
02:56:18.670 --> 02:56:23.670
<v Speaker 2>that lactic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about like a mild gi </v>

3570
02:56:24.861 --> 02:56:29.861
<v Speaker 2>discomfort when we're talking about us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is a mechanism that </v>

3571
02:56:29.861 --> 02:56:30.940
<v Speaker 2>has existed for a long time to explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

3572
02:56:30.970 --> 02:56:35.970
<v Speaker 2>but this is something that's only been </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered over the last couple of </v>

3573
02:56:35.970 --> 02:56:39.380
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of those 24 percent that have the </v>

3574
02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:39.380
<v Speaker 2>antibody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few had the full clinical syndrome,</v>

3575
02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:40.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's still correlated with heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

3576
02:56:40.520 --> 02:56:42.710
<v Speaker 2>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep an open mind.</v>

3577
02:56:42.890 --> 02:56:45.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the data accumulate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting healthier.</v>

3578
02:56:45.560 --> 02:56:48.320
<v Speaker 2>can I ask you this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that it's because they have</v>

3579
02:56:48.350 --> 02:56:53.350
<v Speaker 2>a mild case of this tick borne disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>or this tickborne disease is like </v>

3580
02:56:53.690 --> 02:56:56.540
<v Speaker 2>because it is fairly recent in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our discovery of it,</v>

3581
02:56:56.541 --> 02:56:59.300
<v Speaker 2>is it advancing and evOlving and getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>more potent?</v>

3582
02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I doubt you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basic biochemistry of meat and the </v>

3583
02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:05.300
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates and meet have changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has the.</v>

3584
02:57:05.890 --> 02:57:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Has the lone star tick become more </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequent naps,</v>

3585
02:57:14.170 --> 02:57:19.170
<v Speaker 2>cross reaction between glyphosate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>being bit by a tick and our intestinal </v>

3586
02:57:19.170 --> 02:57:23.411
<v Speaker 2>permeability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of crazy ideas that </v>

3587
02:57:23.411 --> 02:57:24.380
<v Speaker 2>need to be pursued because some of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>will run santos round off.</v>

3588
02:57:25.870 --> 02:57:27.810
<v Speaker 2>It's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3589
02:57:28.490 --> 02:57:31.070
<v Speaker 2>it's all their correlation is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>causation.</v>

3590
02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:34.280
<v Speaker 2>we know you agree with this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have to keep that in mind.</v>

3591
02:57:34.281 --> 02:57:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's that there's a great study </v>
<v Speaker 2>done in one of my favorites.</v>

3592
02:57:38.860 --> 02:57:43.860
<v Speaker 2>It was purposely done to illustrate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger of assuming that correlation </v>

3593
02:57:43.860 --> 02:57:48.070
<v Speaker 2>equals causation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a study done of the most common </v>

3594
02:57:48.070 --> 02:57:52.601
<v Speaker 2>diagnoses for hospitalization in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 point 6 million people and they found</v>

3595
02:57:53.301 --> 02:57:58.301
<v Speaker 2>that 24 diagnoses were significantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the participants </v>

3596
02:57:58.301 --> 02:58:02.040
<v Speaker 2>astrological science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people</v>

3597
02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:07.040
<v Speaker 5>who are born under the sign of leo had a</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 percent higher risk of being </v>

3598
02:58:07.171 --> 02:58:10.140
<v Speaker 5>hospitalized for gi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gastrointestinal hemorrhage,</v>

3599
02:58:10.141 --> 02:58:15.141
<v Speaker 5>and sagittarians had a 38 percent higher</v>
<v Speaker 5>risk of being hospitalized for an arm </v>

3600
02:58:15.141 --> 02:58:18.580
<v Speaker 5>fracture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now remember the the candidates,</v>

3601
02:58:18.581 --> 02:58:23.581
<v Speaker 5>the proposed increase in risk of for for</v>
<v Speaker 5>process meat and cancer is 18 percent,</v>

3602
02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:28.770
<v Speaker 5>so these risks are on the process at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same process,</v>

3603
02:58:28.771 --> 02:58:32.670
<v Speaker 5>meet at that same level so it </v>
<v Speaker 5>sagittarian has a higher risk of being.</v>

3604
02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:38.000
<v Speaker 5>If we believe in this correlation data,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you can't assume correlations </v>

3605
02:58:38.851 --> 02:58:40.710
<v Speaker 5>or causation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's basic and I,</v>

3606
02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:45.910
<v Speaker 5>and it doesn't again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there extent you can use bradford hill </v>

3607
02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:46.200
<v Speaker 5>and other things to strengthen the </v>
<v Speaker 5>association,</v>

3608
02:58:46.201 --> 02:58:51.201
<v Speaker 5>but you need to test it with an </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiment or the association needs to </v>

3609
02:58:51.201 --> 02:58:53.820
<v Speaker 5>be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It needs to be over 100 percent at least</v>

3610
02:58:53.850 --> 02:58:57.750
<v Speaker 5>to really rise out of the noise and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

3611
02:58:57.751 --> 02:58:59.160
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're really seeing a signal.</v>

3612
02:58:59.460 --> 02:59:04.460
<v Speaker 5>Let me give you another example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a recent study just published </v>

3613
02:59:04.460 --> 02:59:07.050
<v Speaker 5>that showed that women pregnant women </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the highest maternal consumption of</v>

3614
02:59:07.051 --> 02:59:12.051
<v Speaker 5>gluten had a twofold risk of type one </v>
<v Speaker 5>diabetes and their offspring and their </v>

3615
02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:14.610
<v Speaker 5>children.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a double,</v>

3616
02:59:15.090 --> 02:59:20.090
<v Speaker 5>that was over a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that is actuallY worth paying </v>

3617
02:59:20.090 --> 02:59:23.211
<v Speaker 5>attention to because that's so such a </v>
<v Speaker 5>large increase in risk that it doesn't </v>

3618
02:59:24.721 --> 02:59:27.300
<v Speaker 5>confirm it by any stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it does mean.</v>

3619
02:59:27.810 --> 02:59:29.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe we should look into this further.</v>

3620
02:59:29.821 --> 02:59:31.920
<v Speaker 5>If that was a five percent increased </v>
<v Speaker 5>risk,</v>

3621
02:59:32.580 --> 02:59:33.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3622
02:59:33.351 --> 02:59:33.900
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3623
02:59:33.960 --> 02:59:37.680
<v Speaker 5>you might as well say that sagittarians </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a higher risk of fracture.</v>

3624
02:59:37.710 --> 02:59:42.710
<v Speaker 5>Is it fair to say that we're doing all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these nutritional studies that you're </v>

3625
02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:44.700
<v Speaker 5>looking at a poverty of data?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3626
02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:47.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Johnny enedis had a quote.</v>

3627
02:59:47.660 --> 02:59:50.580
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's see if I can quickly find it.</v>

3628
02:59:51.210 --> 02:59:56.210
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're comparing all these </v>

3629
02:59:56.210 --> 02:59:58.320
<v Speaker 5>different studies and mean obviously </v>
<v Speaker 5>joel thinks one thing.</v>

3630
02:59:58.320 --> 02:59:59.640
<v Speaker 5>You think another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3631
02:59:59.670 --> 03:00:01.740
<v Speaker 5>so here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the end of this quote.</v>

3632
03:00:01.770 --> 03:00:06.770
<v Speaker 5>Moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 5>given the complicated associations of </v>

3633
03:00:06.770 --> 03:00:07.090
<v Speaker 5>eating behaviors and patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3634
03:00:07.550 --> 03:00:08.400
<v Speaker 5>oops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lost my place.</v>

3635
03:00:08.401 --> 03:00:13.401
<v Speaker 5>Given the complicated associations of </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating behaviors and patterns with many </v>

3636
03:00:13.401 --> 03:00:16.410
<v Speaker 5>time varying social and behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 5>factors that also affect health.</v>

3637
03:00:16.920 --> 03:00:21.920
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>currently available cohort includes </v>

3638
03:00:21.920 --> 03:00:24.000
<v Speaker 5>sufficient information to address </v>
<v Speaker 5>confounding in nutritional association.</v>

3639
03:00:24.001 --> 03:00:25.560
<v Speaker 5>So he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3640
03:00:25.620 --> 03:00:30.620
<v Speaker 5>lay-person translation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many factors that affect our </v>

3641
03:00:30.620 --> 03:00:32.130
<v Speaker 5>health from our sleep to our physical </v>
<v Speaker 5>activity to our,</v>

3642
03:00:32.690 --> 03:00:34.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether we smoke,</v>

3643
03:00:34.350 --> 03:00:37.080
<v Speaker 5>whether we drink your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our social relationships.</v>

3644
03:00:37.081 --> 03:00:39.180
<v Speaker 5>There was a study that I think I talked </v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

3645
03:00:39.181 --> 03:00:40.830
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of my previous appearances that,</v>

3646
03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:45.860
<v Speaker 5>that shows that I'm having not having </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough good relationships will increase </v>

3647
03:00:46.201 --> 03:00:48.990
<v Speaker 5>your risk of death more than smoking 15 </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes a day,</v>

3648
03:00:49.350 --> 03:00:54.350
<v Speaker 5>no studies or controlling for that gut </v>
<v Speaker 5>microbiome we now know is really </v>

3649
03:00:54.511 --> 03:00:57.870
<v Speaker 5>important for our overall health.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are any sTudies comparing for pe?</v>

3650
03:00:57.910 --> 03:01:02.910
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually controlling for people's state </v>

3651
03:01:02.910 --> 03:01:02.910
<v Speaker 5>of people's got microbiome?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely not.</v>

3652
03:01:02.910 --> 03:01:04.750
<v Speaker 5>Which is a problem with the tmao </v>
<v Speaker 5>research.</v>

3653
03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:10.140
<v Speaker 5>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean that observational </v>

3654
03:01:10.140 --> 03:01:13.021
<v Speaker 5>studies are not useful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It means we have to take them with a </v>

3655
03:01:13.021 --> 03:01:15.601
<v Speaker 5>huge grain of salt and the fewer things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are actually controlled for the </v>

3656
03:01:15.671 --> 03:01:20.020
<v Speaker 5>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the grain of salt will be joe w.</v>

3657
03:01:20.140 --> 03:01:25.140
<v Speaker 4>I eman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of had a sense that it's so </v>

3658
03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:27.451
<v Speaker 4>overwhelming and there's so many spots </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the data that we're unable to advise </v>

3659
03:01:27.581 --> 03:01:28.420
<v Speaker 4>the public.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

3660
03:01:28.421 --> 03:01:31.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Think we have more than enough data.</v>

3661
03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:33.850
<v Speaker 4>you can go to michael polan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat food,</v>

3662
03:01:33.851 --> 03:01:35.440
<v Speaker 4>not too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mostly plants.</v>

3663
03:01:35.441 --> 03:01:38.980
<v Speaker 4>Everybody loves it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>consistent with the overwhelming 50,000</v>

3664
03:01:38.981 --> 03:01:39.490
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3665
03:01:39.700 --> 03:01:42.160
<v Speaker 4>you can go to the true health initiative</v>
<v Speaker 4>that says 15,000</v>

3666
03:01:42.161 --> 03:01:43.040
<v Speaker 4>level look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3667
03:01:43.130 --> 03:01:45.790
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole level of biology,</v>

3668
03:01:45.820 --> 03:01:48.130
<v Speaker 4>basic science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>centenarian,</v>

3669
03:01:48.820 --> 03:01:50.890
<v Speaker 4>randomized clinical trials,</v>
<v Speaker 4>epidemiology.</v>

3670
03:01:51.130 --> 03:01:53.320
<v Speaker 4>You got to talk to a patient monday </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning.</v>

3671
03:01:53.500 --> 03:01:58.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get mired in confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell that patient eat real </v>

3672
03:01:58.500 --> 03:02:00.760
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't eat too much and eat mostly plants</v>

3673
03:02:00.761 --> 03:02:04.540
<v Speaker 4>because that is a synthesis of 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>in nutritional research.</v>

3674
03:02:04.600 --> 03:02:07.300
<v Speaker 4>are we going to evolve that to something</v>
<v Speaker 4>more brilliant?</v>

3675
03:02:07.420 --> 03:02:12.420
<v Speaker 4>You might add now fast five days a month</v>
<v Speaker 4>or don't eat 12 hours a day.</v>

3676
03:02:12.790 --> 03:02:17.790
<v Speaker 4>We might be able to refine it with some </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the new science on it using fasting </v>

3677
03:02:17.790 --> 03:02:18.880
<v Speaker 4>intelligently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's pretty strong.</v>

3678
03:02:19.030 --> 03:02:22.270
<v Speaker 4>When I go to the true health initiative </v>
<v Speaker 4>and say it's all confusing,</v>

3679
03:02:22.370 --> 03:02:24.970
<v Speaker 4>but 400 scientific international experts</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

3680
03:02:25.180 --> 03:02:30.180
<v Speaker 4>eat locally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>source close to the ground per plant </v>

3681
03:02:30.180 --> 03:02:33.301
<v Speaker 4>predominant with water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>400 scientists say that's pretty </v>

3682
03:02:33.301 --> 03:02:36.901
<v Speaker 4>reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I can tell my patient on monday is </v>

3683
03:02:36.901 --> 03:02:39.811
<v Speaker 4>something they can actually activate and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll figure out tmao with a blocker </v>

3684
03:02:39.811 --> 03:02:44.280
<v Speaker 4>with fish or with eggs with coleen or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether this tick allergy ends up </v>

3685
03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:47.080
<v Speaker 4>spreading into Michigan or California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And There's a way to deal with it.</v>

3686
03:02:47.250 --> 03:02:52.250
<v Speaker 4>For now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are critically simple lessons for </v>

3687
03:02:52.250 --> 03:02:52.250
<v Speaker 4>the public.</v>

3688
03:02:52.250 --> 03:02:53.570
<v Speaker 5>I'd actually agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Including the part about plants.</v>

3689
03:02:53.571 --> 03:02:58.571
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I recommend my recommendation is your </v>

3690
03:02:58.571 --> 03:02:58.571
<v Speaker 5>plate should be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3691
03:02:58.571 --> 03:03:00.130
<v Speaker 5>two thirds or three quarters plants and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

3692
03:03:00.230 --> 03:03:03.260
<v Speaker 5>and then animal products,</v>
<v Speaker 5>animal foods.</v>

3693
03:03:03.261 --> 03:03:08.261
<v Speaker 5>So the question here is not that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should we eat a healthy whole foods </v>

3694
03:03:08.631 --> 03:03:10.670
<v Speaker 5>diet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We both agree on that 100 percent.</v>

3695
03:03:10.700 --> 03:03:13.720
<v Speaker 5>The question is whether animal foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3696
03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:17.420
<v Speaker 5>should be a part of the diet based on </v>
<v Speaker 5>their nutrient density,</v>

3697
03:03:17.421 --> 03:03:19.850
<v Speaker 5>which unfortunately we haven't had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>chance to get into yet.</v>

3698
03:03:19.851 --> 03:03:24.851
<v Speaker 5>And their bioavailability and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 5>that humans in our hominid ancestors </v>

3699
03:03:24.851 --> 03:03:26.900
<v Speaker 5>have been consuming them for over two </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a half million years.</v>

3700
03:03:27.350 --> 03:03:28.340
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3701
03:03:28.610 --> 03:03:31.160
<v Speaker 5>that's my argument is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3702
03:03:31.540 --> 03:03:33.380
<v Speaker 5>on that plate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for most people,</v>

3703
03:03:33.381 --> 03:03:35.420
<v Speaker 5>they're going to benefit from having </v>
<v Speaker 5>some animal foods.</v>

3704
03:03:35.421 --> 03:03:36.800
<v Speaker 5>How much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3705
03:03:36.801 --> 03:03:38.930
<v Speaker 5>what proportions of carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fat,</v>

3706
03:03:39.380 --> 03:03:40.490
<v Speaker 5>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all of that.</v>

3707
03:03:40.490 --> 03:03:45.490
<v Speaker 5>That depends on the person and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to see big differences actually </v>

3708
03:03:45.490 --> 03:03:45.490
<v Speaker 5>from person to person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3709
03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:48.040
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3710
03:03:48.680 --> 03:03:53.680
<v Speaker 5>I think today has made it clear there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>no convincing data that shows that </v>

3711
03:03:54.140 --> 03:03:59.140
<v Speaker 5>completely removing animal products from</v>
<v Speaker 5>that plate going to lead to a longer </v>

3712
03:03:59.140 --> 03:04:03.080
<v Speaker 5>life span or significant reductions in </v>
<v Speaker 5>disease.</v>

3713
03:04:03.260 --> 03:04:08.260
<v Speaker 5>Let me put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the benefit of putting that one </v>

3714
03:04:08.260 --> 03:04:11.240
<v Speaker 5>quarter of your plate putting animal </v>
<v Speaker 5>protein?</v>

3715
03:04:11.810 --> 03:04:16.810
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what Is the nutrient density of it that </v>

3716
03:04:16.810 --> 03:04:16.970
<v Speaker 5>makes lots of benefits?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3717
03:04:16.971 --> 03:04:17.810
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3718
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:19.970
<v Speaker 5>animal protein is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3719
03:04:20.150 --> 03:04:23.480
<v Speaker 5>more nutrient dense in essential </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrients.</v>

3720
03:04:23.970 --> 03:04:26.650
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so making it clear that I,</v>

3721
03:04:26.660 --> 03:04:31.660
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I support eating both plants and animal </v>

3722
03:04:31.660 --> 03:04:34.871
<v Speaker 5>foods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So animals or animal foods are higher </v>

3723
03:04:34.871 --> 03:04:35.840
<v Speaker 5>and be 12 bioavailable zinc,</v>
<v Speaker 5>iron,</v>

3724
03:04:36.290 --> 03:04:40.040
<v Speaker 5>calcium,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a coleen taurine,</v>

3725
03:04:40.310 --> 03:04:45.310
<v Speaker 5>creatine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not just higher in terms of the </v>

3726
03:04:45.310 --> 03:04:46.400
<v Speaker 5>actual amounts but higher in the amount </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you,</v>

3727
03:04:46.460 --> 03:04:47.660
<v Speaker 5>that you absorb.</v>

3728
03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:51.800
<v Speaker 5>And that's a very key point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>whereas plant foods tend to be higher in</v>

3729
03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:55.810
<v Speaker 5>carotinoids polyphenols,</v>
<v Speaker 5>flavanoids,</v>

3730
03:04:56.050 --> 03:04:58.520
<v Speaker 5>diallo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>little sulfides which are in cruciferous</v>

3731
03:04:58.521 --> 03:05:02.210
<v Speaker 5>vegetables and fiber and those are </v>
<v Speaker 5>important as well.</v>

3732
03:05:02.211 --> 03:05:04.010
<v Speaker 5>And so to get the best of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3733
03:05:04.020 --> 03:05:04.600
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3734
03:05:04.940 --> 03:05:09.940
<v Speaker 5>the widest spectrum of nutrient density,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want to eat the animals for those </v>

3735
03:05:09.940 --> 03:05:12.680
<v Speaker 5>nutrients in animal foods and then the </v>
<v Speaker 5>plant foods for those other nutrients.</v>

3736
03:05:13.940 --> 03:05:18.940
<v Speaker 5>And whaT would be negative about </v>
<v Speaker 5>removing the animal products from that </v>

3737
03:05:20.211 --> 03:05:21.860
<v Speaker 5>one quarter of your plate?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

3738
03:05:21.861 --> 03:05:26.260
<v Speaker 5>what could you not fill in with plant </v>
<v Speaker 5>protein a,</v>

3739
03:05:26.350 --> 03:05:31.350
<v Speaker 5>b?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Clearly some people get by with just </v>

3740
03:05:31.350 --> 03:05:31.350
<v Speaker 5>plant protein b.</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 is the,</v>

3741
03:05:31.350 --> 03:05:32.990
<v Speaker 5>is the biggest issue for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3742
03:05:32.991 --> 03:05:37.991
<v Speaker 5>it's not really found in plant foods </v>
<v Speaker 5>except for some exotic species of wild </v>

3743
03:05:38.211 --> 03:05:41.930
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and nori and plants and mushrooms aren't</v>

3744
03:05:41.931 --> 03:05:43.820
<v Speaker 5>really plants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3745
03:05:44.360 --> 03:05:46.720
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in non animal foods,</v>

3746
03:05:46.721 --> 03:05:47.810
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could say,</v>

3747
03:05:47.950 --> 03:05:52.950
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if it's not just a question of </v>

3748
03:05:52.950 --> 03:05:56.530
<v Speaker 5>what's theoretically possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a question of looking at the </v>

3749
03:05:56.530 --> 03:05:58.130
<v Speaker 5>studies that show us what are the </v>
<v Speaker 5>average,</v>

3750
03:05:58.300 --> 03:05:59.600
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3751
03:06:00.020 --> 03:06:05.020
<v Speaker 5>how common are nutrient deficiencies on </v>
<v Speaker 5>omnivorous versus vegetarian and vegan </v>

3752
03:06:05.210 --> 03:06:05.720
<v Speaker 5>diets.</v>

3753
03:06:05.720 --> 03:06:08.060
<v Speaker 5>And if you go to [inaudible] dot com </v>
<v Speaker 5>slash rogan,</v>

3754
03:06:08.390 --> 03:06:13.390
<v Speaker 5>there's a whole section on that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>links to a very in depth article that </v>

3755
03:06:13.390 --> 03:06:13.850
<v Speaker 5>shows that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

3756
03:06:13.940 --> 03:06:17.750
<v Speaker 5>of vegetarians and vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the average omnivore,</v>

3757
03:06:17.930 --> 03:06:20.480
<v Speaker 5>the rate of between depletion is 11 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent.</v>

3758
03:06:20.570 --> 03:06:24.800
<v Speaker 5>And then for vegetarians at 77 Percent </v>
<v Speaker 5>and for vegans it's 92 percent,</v>

3759
03:06:24.830 --> 03:06:28.220
<v Speaker 5>92 percent of depletion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the first stage.</v>

3760
03:06:28.221 --> 03:06:30.410
<v Speaker 5>There's four stages of b,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 deficiency.</v>

3761
03:06:30.411 --> 03:06:34.730
<v Speaker 5>And that's the first stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the earlier studies that showed less</v>

3762
03:06:34.731 --> 03:06:37.850
<v Speaker 5>of a difference used only crm b12 as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>marker,</v>

3763
03:06:37.880 --> 03:06:42.290
<v Speaker 5>but it turns out that crmb 12 is not a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very accurate marker of b 12 deficiency.</v>

3764
03:06:42.620 --> 03:06:45.050
<v Speaker 5>And we need to be using more accurate </v>
<v Speaker 5>markers like holo,</v>

3765
03:06:45.051 --> 03:06:47.720
<v Speaker 5>transcobalamin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>methylmalonic acid,</v>

3766
03:06:47.850 --> 03:06:51.080
<v Speaker 5>homocysteine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you use those newer markers,</v>

3767
03:06:51.380 --> 03:06:53.540
<v Speaker 5>you see those broad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>broad,</v>

3768
03:06:53.570 --> 03:06:55.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very big differences,</v>

3769
03:06:55.470 --> 03:07:00.470
<v Speaker 5>deficiency rates and furthermore there </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a study done in vegans and </v>

3770
03:07:00.470 --> 03:07:03.360
<v Speaker 5>vegetarians in the Netherlands that were</v>
<v Speaker 5>at a summer camp.</v>

3771
03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:06.750
<v Speaker 5>So these were people who were educated </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarians and vegans,</v>

3772
03:07:06.751 --> 03:07:11.751
<v Speaker 5>they were really into it and the average</v>
<v Speaker 5>crmb 12 level for them even it was below</v>

3773
03:07:13.111 --> 03:07:15.450
<v Speaker 5>200,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is in a deficiency state.</v>

3774
03:07:15.840 --> 03:07:20.840
<v Speaker 5>And even the people who were </v>
<v Speaker 5>supplementing had significant levels of </v>

3775
03:07:20.850 --> 03:07:24.990
<v Speaker 5>b 12 deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's probably because studies have</v>

3776
03:07:24.991 --> 03:07:29.991
<v Speaker 5>shown that the amount that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 5>supplement with is about a 100 times </v>

3777
03:07:29.991 --> 03:07:32.700
<v Speaker 5>higher than the rda.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the rda is two point five micro grams</v>

3778
03:07:33.180 --> 03:07:37.020
<v Speaker 5>and you really need 250 micrograms to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get your levels up.</v>

3779
03:07:37.021 --> 03:07:40.620
<v Speaker 5>And if you're deficient you need 200 </v>
<v Speaker 5>times more than the rda,</v>

3780
03:07:40.650 --> 03:07:44.670
<v Speaker 5>500 micrograms and this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the studies are there on,</v>

3781
03:07:44.671 --> 03:07:49.671
<v Speaker 5>on my site.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it is the problem that beat twelves </v>

3782
03:07:49.671 --> 03:07:50.580
<v Speaker 5>nonexistent and plant based foods or </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's not as bioavailable.</v>

3783
03:07:50.660 --> 03:07:52.020
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't exist.</v>

3784
03:07:52.021 --> 03:07:57.021
<v Speaker 5>The true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>true cobalamin absorbable b12 doesn't </v>

3785
03:07:57.021 --> 03:07:57.880
<v Speaker 5>exist in implant that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3786
03:07:58.340 --> 03:08:03.340
<v Speaker 5>you can get other koba minds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other forms of implant,</v>

3787
03:08:03.630 --> 03:08:05.370
<v Speaker 5>even algae,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even algae.</v>

3788
03:08:05.371 --> 03:08:05.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most,</v>

3789
03:08:06.060 --> 03:08:11.060
<v Speaker 5>most vegans who are well who were </v>
<v Speaker 5>educated about this know this and they </v>

3790
03:08:11.060 --> 03:08:11.730
<v Speaker 5>take a 12 suPplement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3791
03:08:11.790 --> 03:08:14.710
<v Speaker 5>but the [inaudible] supplement is </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably based on what,</v>

3792
03:08:14.970 --> 03:08:16.950
<v Speaker 5>like what is it coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3793
03:08:17.190 --> 03:08:17.920
<v Speaker 5>it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3794
03:08:18.170 --> 03:08:19.890
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't necessarily make the </v>
<v Speaker 5>difference.</v>

3795
03:08:19.900 --> 03:08:22.050
<v Speaker 5>It's are they taking enough to meet your</v>
<v Speaker 5>needs?</v>

3796
03:08:22.051 --> 03:08:27.051
<v Speaker 5>So I hope that anyone who is listening </v>
<v Speaker 5>to this make sure that they're getting </v>

3797
03:08:27.051 --> 03:08:27.051
<v Speaker 5>enough b,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12,</v>

3798
03:08:27.051 --> 03:08:27.350
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>RIght.</v>

3799
03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:29.400
<v Speaker 5>But what is it coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's not active?</v>

3800
03:08:29.730 --> 03:08:33.330
<v Speaker 4>I make be 12 cows are eating dirty </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>

3801
03:08:33.331 --> 03:08:38.331
<v Speaker 4>they get bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cows stored in their stomach plants if </v>

3802
03:08:38.331 --> 03:08:41.211
<v Speaker 4>you don't wash will give you be 12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's the bacteria hanging on the </v>

3803
03:08:41.211 --> 03:08:41.211
<v Speaker 4>carrot</v>

3804
03:08:41.211 --> 03:08:44.860
<v Speaker 5>and we make the 12 too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but It's in the colon and we can absorb </v>

3805
03:08:44.860 --> 03:08:44.860
<v Speaker 5>it in the small intestine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3806
03:08:44.860 --> 03:08:45.860
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3807
03:08:46.220 --> 03:08:51.220
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just making sure that if someone is </v>

3808
03:08:51.220 --> 03:08:53.051
<v Speaker 5>following this diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're getting enough b 12 and that </v>

3809
03:08:53.051 --> 03:08:53.051
<v Speaker 5>they're using the right markers to </v>
<v Speaker 5>assess their status.</v>

3810
03:08:53.051 --> 03:08:57.911
<v Speaker 5>Crmb 12 only goes out of range In the </v>
<v Speaker 5>final stages of b 12 deficiency and by </v>

3811
03:08:57.911 --> 03:09:02.861
<v Speaker 5>then it can be too late some of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>effects of b 12 deficiency or </v>

3812
03:09:02.861 --> 03:09:05.150
<v Speaker 5>irreversible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a pretty serious thing and it's,</v>

3813
03:09:05.210 --> 03:09:08.900
<v Speaker 5>it's a really important thing for any </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarian or vegan to be aware of,</v>

3814
03:09:08.901 --> 03:09:11.570
<v Speaker 5>given those big differences in </v>
<v Speaker 5>depletion,</v>

3815
03:09:11.950 --> 03:09:13.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>between the population.</v>

3816
03:09:13.860 --> 03:09:18.860
<v Speaker 5>So joel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you been a vegan since you've been </v>

3817
03:09:18.860 --> 03:09:18.860
<v Speaker 5>18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously must've been on top of all the</v>

3818
03:09:18.860 --> 03:09:21.560
<v Speaker 5>supplementation and making sure that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get your nutrients</v>

3819
03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:22.810
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's out.</v>

3820
03:09:23.020 --> 03:09:28.020
<v Speaker 4>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's responsible for a healthcare </v>

3821
03:09:28.020 --> 03:09:30.370
<v Speaker 4>practitioner to advise somebody eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>plant based to take vitamin b.</v>

3822
03:09:30.371 --> 03:09:31.150
<v Speaker 4>12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

3823
03:09:31.270 --> 03:09:35.350
<v Speaker 4>There are people that do it because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>fortified in many foods and nori,</v>

3824
03:09:35.351 --> 03:09:40.351
<v Speaker 4>if you eat sushi and nutritional yeast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't advise my patients to rely on </v>

3825
03:09:40.351 --> 03:09:43.690
<v Speaker 4>food because there's a neurologic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hematologic potential for trouble.</v>

3826
03:09:43.780 --> 03:09:48.780
<v Speaker 4>If you don't be 12,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it actually takes years to deplete your </v>

3827
03:09:48.780 --> 03:09:49.090
<v Speaker 4>b 12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting statistic.</v>

3828
03:09:49.091 --> 03:09:51.430
<v Speaker 4>I want to come back to humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ninety percent of all b,</v>

3829
03:09:51.431 --> 03:09:55.510
<v Speaker 4>12 right now is being given to lock cows</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they don't eat dirt anymore.</v>

3830
03:09:55.511 --> 03:09:57.340
<v Speaker 4>They're inside a building that has no </v>
<v Speaker 4>dirt.</v>

3831
03:09:57.460 --> 03:10:00.550
<v Speaker 4>They dOn't get be 12,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the public wants be 12 rich meat,</v>

3832
03:10:00.700 --> 03:10:02.990
<v Speaker 4>so they'd give be 12 to cows to make b </v>
<v Speaker 4>12.</v>

3833
03:10:03.020 --> 03:10:05.620
<v Speaker 4>There is little vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These cows,</v>

3834
03:10:05.621 --> 03:10:08.030
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a source anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No animal.</v>

3835
03:10:08.031 --> 03:10:09.900
<v Speaker 4>They usually talking about factory </v>
<v Speaker 4>farming,</v>

3836
03:10:09.901 --> 03:10:12.220
<v Speaker 4>factory farming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know if you're out there eating dirt</v>

3837
03:10:12.221 --> 03:10:13.940
<v Speaker 4>in the field are going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>college,</v>

3838
03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:14.440
<v Speaker 4>have a job,</v>

3839
03:10:15.350 --> 03:10:16.970
<v Speaker 3>be right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say that,</v>

3840
03:10:17.150 --> 03:10:22.150
<v Speaker 3>so is it impossible to live a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>plant based lifestyle without </v>

3841
03:10:23.631 --> 03:10:24.500
<v Speaker 3>supplementation?</v>

3842
03:10:24.540 --> 03:10:25.770
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many many people do,</v>

3843
03:10:25.800 --> 03:10:27.830
<v Speaker 4>but if you're saying you don't remember </v>
<v Speaker 4>amended,</v>

3844
03:10:27.870 --> 03:10:29.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't recommend it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they should get bloodwork.</v>

3845
03:10:29.780 --> 03:10:30.870
<v Speaker 4>Know your vitamin d,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3846
03:10:30.871 --> 03:10:35.871
<v Speaker 4>your omega three and know your b 12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm all for optimal health and I'm </v>

3847
03:10:35.871 --> 03:10:39.681
<v Speaker 4>practicing high level medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have friends that adamantly show </v>

3848
03:10:39.681 --> 03:10:43.731
<v Speaker 4>me their blood work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't take pills and look at my blood </v>

3849
03:10:43.731 --> 03:10:43.731
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they may sneak by.</v>

3850
03:10:43.731 --> 03:10:46.540
<v Speaker 4>It's not my medical recommendation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fish and recommendations is every,</v>

3851
03:10:46.770 --> 03:10:51.770
<v Speaker 4>everybody over age 50 and the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States take be 12 for brain and mental </v>

3852
03:10:51.770 --> 03:10:55.911
<v Speaker 4>health,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever your diet and that's a wise </v>

3853
03:10:55.911 --> 03:10:59.091
<v Speaker 4>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether you take a multivitamin every </v>

3854
03:10:59.091 --> 03:10:59.091
<v Speaker 4>couple of days like dr longo recommends </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3855
03:10:59.091 --> 03:11:00.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a real problem.</v>

3856
03:11:01.050 --> 03:11:03.030
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's denying that chris has laid it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

3857
03:11:03.031 --> 03:11:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a simple solution.</v>

3858
03:11:05.400 --> 03:11:09.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to demonstrate my be 12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the source of your [inaudible]?</v>

3859
03:11:09.800 --> 03:11:14.070
<v Speaker 4>It's synthesize methological bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got 1000 micrograms of vitamin b,</v>

3860
03:11:14.071 --> 03:11:19.071
<v Speaker 4>12 with 400 micro with 400 milligrams of</v>
<v Speaker 4>dha with 2000 international units of </v>

3861
03:11:19.531 --> 03:11:24.420
<v Speaker 4>vitamin d three and I did vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just did that once a day and I'm done.</v>

3862
03:11:24.421 --> 03:11:26.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's all vegan and has nothing to do</v>

3863
03:11:26.401 --> 03:11:29.560
<v Speaker 4>with living organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's made synthesized a,</v>

3864
03:11:29.650 --> 03:11:31.680
<v Speaker 4>b.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twelve is synthesizing labs.</v>

3865
03:11:31.681 --> 03:11:36.681
<v Speaker 4>MethylcobAlamin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people believe is the preferred </v>

3866
03:11:36.681 --> 03:11:37.290
<v Speaker 4>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think chris would agree with.</v>

3867
03:11:37.530 --> 03:11:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Contrary to popular belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be gotten by completely humane </v>

3868
03:11:42.530 --> 03:11:43.630
<v Speaker 3>and ethical ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a,</v>

3869
03:11:43.840 --> 03:11:44.880
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's lpg,</v>

3870
03:11:44.930 --> 03:11:49.930
<v Speaker 4>it's lg for dha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's synthesize for be tWelve and </v>

3871
03:11:49.930 --> 03:11:51.580
<v Speaker 4>vitamin d three is synthesized to it </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to be made from cows,</v>

3872
03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:53.840
<v Speaker 4>a secretion called land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sheep's secretion</v>

3873
03:11:53.840 --> 03:11:58.840
<v Speaker 3>called land limpets synthesize now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does beg the question of whether </v>

3874
03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:03.310
<v Speaker 3>we should be following a diet that can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet our essential nutrient needs and </v>

3875
03:12:03.310 --> 03:12:07.331
<v Speaker 3>that leads to deficiencies of many other</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrients much more commonly than an </v>

3876
03:12:07.331 --> 03:12:09.950
<v Speaker 3>omnivorous diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3877
03:12:09.980 --> 03:12:14.980
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my position has always been we should </v>

3878
03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:17.171
<v Speaker 3>get as many nutrients as food as we as </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can because that's the way that </v>

3879
03:12:17.171 --> 03:12:18.020
<v Speaker 3>humans are adapted to getting new </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrients.</v>

3880
03:12:18.480 --> 03:12:21.110
<v Speaker 3>There's issues with supplementation </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

3881
03:12:21.111 --> 03:12:22.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3882
03:12:22.580 --> 03:12:26.000
<v Speaker 3>both like getting too much of a nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3883
03:12:26.030 --> 03:12:29.060
<v Speaker 3>can be a problem in several cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the case in b12,</v>

3884
03:12:29.090 --> 03:12:34.090
<v Speaker 3>which is great because it means people </v>
<v Speaker 3>can take really high doses and it won't </v>

3885
03:12:34.090 --> 03:12:34.610
<v Speaker 3>be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as I mentioned,</v>

3886
03:12:34.611 --> 03:12:39.611
<v Speaker 3>a lot of vegetarians and vegans who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplementing are still at risk and </v>

3887
03:12:39.611 --> 03:12:44.101
<v Speaker 3>still deficient because crmb b 12 is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>main marker that is used in this </v>

3888
03:12:44.271 --> 03:12:45.470
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not even,</v>

3889
03:12:45.500 --> 03:12:47.840
<v Speaker 3>most physicians don't test for cmv </v>
<v Speaker 3>tWelve.</v>

3890
03:12:47.841 --> 03:12:49.340
<v Speaker 3>I know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably know this,</v>

3891
03:12:49.341 --> 03:12:51.920
<v Speaker 3>joel from people come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've never had be 12 tests,</v>

3892
03:12:52.250 --> 03:12:54.260
<v Speaker 5>but then when they do get the cnb 12 </v>
<v Speaker 5>tests,</v>

3893
03:12:54.261 --> 03:12:57.630
<v Speaker 5>it's going to miss a large percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are already in the stage two.</v>

3894
03:12:57.640 --> 03:12:59.800
<v Speaker 5>I do a methylmalonic methylmalonic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3895
03:12:59.810 --> 03:13:04.810
<v Speaker 5>So methylmalonic acid and homocysteine </v>
<v Speaker 5>are much more important markers and I </v>

3896
03:13:05.771 --> 03:13:10.771
<v Speaker 5>agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at average homocysteine </v>

3897
03:13:10.771 --> 03:13:13.391
<v Speaker 5>levels in vegans and vegetarians are </v>
<v Speaker 5>significantly higher than in omnivores </v>

3898
03:13:14.790 --> 03:13:18.140
<v Speaker 5>because of this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the high prevalence of,</v>

3899
03:13:18.590 --> 03:13:22.250
<v Speaker 5>of b12 deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what's ironic about that is a lot of</v>

3900
03:13:22.251 --> 03:13:27.251
<v Speaker 5>people turn to a plant based,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even want to say plant based </v>

3901
03:13:27.251 --> 03:13:29.280
<v Speaker 5>because I would consider a neutral or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>paleo diet to be plant based to but uh,</v>

3902
03:13:29.510 --> 03:13:33.080
<v Speaker 5>no animal product diet to improve their </v>
<v Speaker 5>cardiovascular health.</v>

3903
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:37.870
<v Speaker 5>And yet you're seeing much higher rates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your rates of homocysteine,</v>

3904
03:13:37.871 --> 03:13:42.871
<v Speaker 5>like the average and vegans is 16,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a rate that's clearly </v>

3905
03:13:42.871 --> 03:13:44.120
<v Speaker 5>associated with increased risk of not </v>
<v Speaker 5>only cardiovascular disease,</v>

3906
03:13:44.121 --> 03:13:46.220
<v Speaker 5>but also dementia and alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>RighT.</v>

3907
03:13:46.390 --> 03:13:47.260
<v Speaker 4>Chris?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't agree more.</v>

3908
03:13:47.261 --> 03:13:52.261
<v Speaker 4>I've written many articles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be a dumb vegan and I don't mean </v>

3909
03:13:52.261 --> 03:13:52.570
<v Speaker 4>to offend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what you know you,</v>

3910
03:13:52.630 --> 03:13:57.630
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are prone and I mean there's no </v>

3911
03:13:57.630 --> 03:13:57.630
<v Speaker 4>bullshit here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is too important for people.</v>

3912
03:13:57.630 --> 03:14:01.800
<v Speaker 4>We are prone to have a few holes in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wall that an intelligent person knows </v>

3913
03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:04.180
<v Speaker 4>how to plug it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vitamin d,</v>

3914
03:14:04.210 --> 03:14:06.730
<v Speaker 4>it's dha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's be 12.</v>

3915
03:14:06.760 --> 03:14:09.490
<v Speaker 4>You might go onto say iodine touring </v>
<v Speaker 4>vanadium,</v>

3916
03:14:09.491 --> 03:14:11.440
<v Speaker 4>chromium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got those.</v>

3917
03:14:11.441 --> 03:14:14.170
<v Speaker 4>That's what I do every other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally complete.</v>

3918
03:14:14.200 --> 03:14:18.430
<v Speaker 4>My patients are totally complete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The industry has provided solutions to a</v>

3919
03:14:18.460 --> 03:14:20.250
<v Speaker 4>relatively simple problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3920
03:14:20.540 --> 03:14:21.550
<v Speaker 4>So you got a mouthful.</v>

3921
03:14:22.570 --> 03:14:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

3922
03:14:23.530 --> 03:14:28.530
<v Speaker 1>is it fair to say that you believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>What the vegan diet is like?</v>

3923
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:32.710
<v Speaker 1>You can essentially hack your way to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

3924
03:14:32.711 --> 03:14:36.610
<v Speaker 1>healthier life by just adding a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like be 12,</v>

3925
03:14:36.611 --> 03:14:39.400
<v Speaker 1>a few other nutrients that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get from the diet,</v>

3926
03:14:39.401 --> 03:14:43.030
<v Speaker 1>but with those together you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're far healthier.</v>

3927
03:14:43.080 --> 03:14:45.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because what I didn't get,</v>

3928
03:14:45.051 --> 03:14:46.920
<v Speaker 4>I substituted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I don't want,</v>

3929
03:14:46.921 --> 03:14:51.921
<v Speaker 4>I'm not taking in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is animal saturated fat animal </v>

3930
03:14:51.921 --> 03:14:51.921
<v Speaker 4>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not taking</v>

3931
03:14:51.921 --> 03:14:56.160
<v Speaker 1>main disagreement here between the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you is whether or not saturated fat.</v>

3932
03:14:56.340 --> 03:14:59.190
<v Speaker 4>Chris and I would both agree as </v>
<v Speaker 4>educators,</v>

3933
03:14:59.400 --> 03:15:04.400
<v Speaker 4>all the public and specifically plant </v>
<v Speaker 4>eaters should be aware of nutritional </v>

3934
03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:07.821
<v Speaker 4>deficiencies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A two year paleo followup study said </v>

3935
03:15:07.821 --> 03:15:08.280
<v Speaker 4>that people were deficient in iodine on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the paleo diet.</v>

3936
03:15:08.470 --> 03:15:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Sounds have much higher rates of iodine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know it's common in America.</v>

3937
03:15:13.281 --> 03:15:13.600
<v Speaker 4>MucH higher</v>

3938
03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:15.660
<v Speaker 1>rates of iodine deficiency than paleo</v>

3939
03:15:15.820 --> 03:15:17.680
<v Speaker 4>unless you eat some nori,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some kelp,</v>

3940
03:15:18.160 --> 03:15:20.170
<v Speaker 4>unless use iodized salt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you would just put</v>

3941
03:15:20.690 --> 03:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>though that the paleo diet is the issue,</v>

3942
03:15:24.530 --> 03:15:29.530
<v Speaker 4>just people deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paleo diet goes back 10 to 12 years in </v>

3943
03:15:29.530 --> 03:15:34.480
<v Speaker 4>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand nine is about the first </v>

3944
03:15:34.480 --> 03:15:36.421
<v Speaker 4>good paleo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sansa showed up and I honor the paleo </v>

3945
03:15:36.421 --> 03:15:36.421
<v Speaker 4>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is good reason to consider it as a</v>

3946
03:15:36.421 --> 03:15:41.161
<v Speaker 4>food option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll us news and world report does </v>

3947
03:15:41.161 --> 03:15:41.161
<v Speaker 4>not agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to say,</v>

3948
03:15:41.161 --> 03:15:43.270
<v Speaker 4>what are they basing it on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not scientists.</v>

3949
03:15:43.570 --> 03:15:47.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their panel of scientists that they read</v>

3950
03:15:47.021 --> 03:15:48.210
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they read it for lunch.</v>

3951
03:15:48.260 --> 03:15:50.100
<v Speaker 4>The bigger question is just what?</v>

3952
03:15:50.130 --> 03:15:55.130
<v Speaker 5>You know what's going to happen for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>average person who's following these </v>

3953
03:15:55.130 --> 03:15:57.080
<v Speaker 5>diets and I agree 100 percent with joel </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you know,</v>

3954
03:15:57.081 --> 03:16:00.030
<v Speaker 5>we have to educate people on whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet they're on and I've,</v>

3955
03:16:00.170 --> 03:16:01.860
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've said this to people,</v>

3956
03:16:01.920 --> 03:16:05.440
<v Speaker 5>that's why I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never advocated strict paleo be.</v>

3957
03:16:05.820 --> 03:16:07.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think that can work for some </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

3958
03:16:07.741 --> 03:16:12.741
<v Speaker 5>but I've never been an ideological about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that because I actually think that full </v>

3959
03:16:12.741 --> 03:16:17.301
<v Speaker 5>fat fermented dairy is really beneficial</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it's well tolerated and one of the </v>

3960
03:16:17.301 --> 03:16:21.531
<v Speaker 5>reasons for it is iodine dairy is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually one of the best sources of </v>

3961
03:16:21.531 --> 03:16:25.431
<v Speaker 5>iodine in the diet and it's not because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the dairy products contain iodine but </v>

3962
03:16:25.431 --> 03:16:29.051
<v Speaker 5>they're stored in tanks that were iota </v>
<v Speaker 5>for is the cleanser that's used for the </v>

3963
03:16:29.071 --> 03:16:31.360
<v Speaker 5>tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We basically pure just pure it.</v>

3964
03:16:31.370 --> 03:16:35.280
<v Speaker 5>Interesting and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and gross.</v>

3965
03:16:35.700 --> 03:16:36.660
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

3966
03:16:36.670 --> 03:16:37.350
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3967
03:16:37.351 --> 03:16:39.240
<v Speaker 5>the iodine you use to clean.</v>

3968
03:16:39.270 --> 03:16:44.270
<v Speaker 5>It's just a natural nutrient.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where do you get it from food though </v>

3969
03:16:44.270 --> 03:16:46.620
<v Speaker 5>outside?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the three top sources of iodine would</v>

3970
03:16:46.621 --> 03:16:49.410
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well iodized salt is the main one.</v>

3971
03:16:49.411 --> 03:16:51.690
<v Speaker 5>That's why it was added to salt in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first place,</v>

3972
03:16:51.691 --> 03:16:56.691
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of people on a healthy diet </v>
<v Speaker 5>remove iodized salt in favor of sea </v>

3973
03:16:56.691 --> 03:16:57.900
<v Speaker 5>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think is a good choice overall,</v>

3974
03:16:57.930 --> 03:17:02.930
<v Speaker 5>but one of the downsides of that is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are no longer consuming the main </v>

3975
03:17:02.930 --> 03:17:06.351
<v Speaker 5>source of iodine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then dairy products and then sea </v>

3976
03:17:06.351 --> 03:17:06.351
<v Speaker 5>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as joel mentioned,</v>

3977
03:17:06.351 --> 03:17:09.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm like kelp and he jiechi and rma and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no worry,</v>

3978
03:17:09.241 --> 03:17:14.241
<v Speaker 5>not as much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the only sea vegetable that </v>

3979
03:17:14.241 --> 03:17:14.241
<v Speaker 5>most americans consume in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 5>sushi.</v>

3980
03:17:14.241 --> 03:17:15.360
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3981
03:17:15.480 --> 03:17:19.020
<v Speaker 5>so if you take someone on a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a vegan diet or a paleo diet for that</v>

3982
03:17:19.021 --> 03:17:21.830
<v Speaker 5>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they remove dairy seat,</v>

3983
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:24.690
<v Speaker 5>a iodized salt and they're not eating </v>
<v Speaker 5>sea vegetables,</v>

3984
03:17:24.691 --> 03:17:26.940
<v Speaker 5>then yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is a risk for iodine deficiency.</v>

3985
03:17:26.940 --> 03:17:30.180
<v Speaker 5>I have written about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's look at things like calcium.</v>

3986
03:17:30.210 --> 03:17:32.190
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at iron.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at zinc.</v>

3987
03:17:32.250 --> 03:17:34.830
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at coleen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at taurine.</v>

3988
03:17:34.831 --> 03:17:36.930
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at creotine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at retina,</v>

3989
03:17:36.931 --> 03:17:40.170
<v Speaker 5>which is preformed vitamin a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And let's look at epa and dha.</v>

3990
03:17:40.740 --> 03:17:45.740
<v Speaker 5>All of these are shown to be lower in </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarians and vegans and they are in </v>

3991
03:17:45.740 --> 03:17:47.820
<v Speaker 5>omnivores and it Just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

3992
03:17:47.821 --> 03:17:49.260
<v Speaker 5>you can supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it just,</v>

3993
03:17:49.350 --> 03:17:54.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are the supplements have the same </v>

3994
03:17:54.350 --> 03:17:54.350
<v Speaker 5>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like look at calcium.</v>

3995
03:17:54.350 --> 03:17:58.760
<v Speaker 5>dietary calcium has inversely related to</v>
<v Speaker 5>heart disease and kidney stones,</v>

3996
03:17:59.160 --> 03:18:01.800
<v Speaker 5>meaning the more dietary calcium you </v>
<v Speaker 5>eat,</v>

3997
03:18:02.040 --> 03:18:07.040
<v Speaker 5>the lower risk of those conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you look at studies on calcium </v>

3998
03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:09.630
<v Speaker 5>supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the opposite is true calcium supplements</v>

3999
03:18:09.631 --> 03:18:14.631
<v Speaker 5>are associated with an increase in heart</v>
<v Speaker 5>disease and an increase in kidney </v>

4000
03:18:14.631 --> 03:18:17.160
<v Speaker 5>stones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So associated by epidemiology studies.</v>

4001
03:18:17.700 --> 03:18:18.390
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

4002
03:18:19.140 --> 03:18:24.140
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the theory is that because you went </v>

4003
03:18:24.140 --> 03:18:27.290
<v Speaker 5>with the supplemental,</v>
<v Speaker 5>calcium is not the same as dietary </v>

4004
03:18:27.290 --> 03:18:29.931
<v Speaker 5>calcium.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get a large bolus of calcium that </v>

4005
03:18:29.931 --> 03:18:32.271
<v Speaker 5>goes into your blood all at once and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then it can get into the soft tissues </v>

4006
03:18:32.271 --> 03:18:34.620
<v Speaker 5>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can make them stiffer,</v>

4007
03:18:34.650 --> 03:18:38.070
<v Speaker 5>which is joel will tell you is not good </v>
<v Speaker 5>for your heart health.</v>

4008
03:18:38.071 --> 03:18:41.610
<v Speaker 5>And so my point is that supplements </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't always affect the body in the same</v>

4009
03:18:41.611 --> 03:18:46.611
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I just think it's better to </v>

4010
03:18:46.611 --> 03:18:49.281
<v Speaker 5>get nutrients from food if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's the way we've been </v>

4011
03:18:49.281 --> 03:18:49.281
<v Speaker 5>getting them for</v>

4012
03:18:49.281 --> 03:18:49.850
<v Speaker 3>millions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4013
03:18:49.900 --> 03:18:54.900
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about something I think you </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys can both agree on because I am </v>

4014
03:18:54.900 --> 03:18:57.380
<v Speaker 3>baffled by this carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4015
03:18:57.430 --> 03:19:02.430
<v Speaker 3>And baffled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm baffled by how many people are </v>

4016
03:19:02.430 --> 03:19:06.840
<v Speaker 3>clinging to it as a panacea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm baffled by whether or not it's a </v>

4017
03:19:06.840 --> 03:19:11.050
<v Speaker 3>physiological effect or whether there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a placebo effect going on.</v>

4018
03:19:11.080 --> 03:19:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I have a theory please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4019
03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:17.110
<v Speaker 3>So my theory is that it mimics some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of fasting,</v>

4020
03:19:18.820 --> 03:19:22.990
<v Speaker 3>but allows people to persist for longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's providing some nutrition.</v>

4021
03:19:23.110 --> 03:19:23.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

4022
03:19:24.220 --> 03:19:25.750
<v Speaker 3>if you look in the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature,</v>

4023
03:19:25.751 --> 03:19:28.930
<v Speaker 3>fasting is the cure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>all for everything I agree with.</v>

4024
03:19:28.931 --> 03:19:33.010
<v Speaker 3>you mean like you can look at any </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition and fasting is the cure time,</v>

4025
03:19:33.011 --> 03:19:35.080
<v Speaker 3>water fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can do it for two,</v>

4026
03:19:35.081 --> 03:19:35.830
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four weeks.</v>

4027
03:19:36.240 --> 03:19:40.810
<v Speaker 3>I tried that for a year and that will be</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cure for life in that case.</v>

4028
03:19:42.190 --> 03:19:44.620
<v Speaker 3>The longest example is a year of water </v>
<v Speaker 3>fest.</v>

4029
03:19:44.650 --> 03:19:46.530
<v Speaker 3>So most people die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That last,</v>

4030
03:19:46.531 --> 03:19:46.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

4031
03:19:48.060 --> 03:19:51.490
<v Speaker 3>he was extremely obese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of energy stores,</v>

4032
03:19:52.300 --> 03:19:53.320
<v Speaker 3>fat stores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4033
03:19:53.620 --> 03:19:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Anything about that was he actually his </v>
<v Speaker 3>skin shrank to.</v>

4034
03:19:56.650 --> 03:19:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is really,</v>

4035
03:19:57.751 --> 03:19:59.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which doesn't usually happen with weight</v>

4036
03:19:59.411 --> 03:20:01.450
<v Speaker 3>loss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is just a theory.</v>

4037
03:20:01.451 --> 03:20:02.660
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4038
03:20:02.670 --> 03:20:07.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we meet as absorbed very high up in </v>

4039
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:10.390
<v Speaker 3>the digestive tract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you only eat meat,</v>

4040
03:20:10.391 --> 03:20:15.391
<v Speaker 3>it's a low residue diet and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing leftover to irritate or inflame </v>

4041
03:20:15.391 --> 03:20:20.371
<v Speaker 3>the gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My theory is a lot of people who are </v>

4042
03:20:20.371 --> 03:20:20.371
<v Speaker 3>benefiting from this have a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrupted gut microbiome.</v>

4043
03:20:20.470 --> 03:20:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Alessio fasano has argued that leaky gut</v>
<v Speaker 3>is kind of a preconditioned for auto </v>

4044
03:20:25.470 --> 03:20:28.120
<v Speaker 3>immunity and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the carnivore diet is essentially like a</v>

4045
03:20:28.121 --> 03:20:33.121
<v Speaker 3>gut rest or a fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't know the out that people </v>

4046
03:20:33.461 --> 03:20:38.461
<v Speaker 3>are benefiting from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is what is the longterm </v>

4047
03:20:38.461 --> 03:20:38.461
<v Speaker 3>implication?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there is no.</v>

4048
03:20:38.461 --> 03:20:41.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a few people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been doing this,</v>

4049
03:20:41.170 --> 03:20:43.810
<v Speaker 3>some anecdotal evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been doing it for a few decades.</v>

4050
03:20:43.880 --> 03:20:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4051
03:20:44.181 --> 03:20:49.181
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually going on my homeboy sean </v>

4052
03:20:49.181 --> 03:20:49.550
<v Speaker 4>baker's podcasts in a few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're humble.</v>

4053
03:20:49.690 --> 03:20:51.860
<v Speaker 4>We started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sean and I started as enemies.</v>

4054
03:20:51.861 --> 03:20:52.940
<v Speaker 4>We love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shannon,</v>

4055
03:20:52.941 --> 03:20:55.190
<v Speaker 4>I love your brother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have an honest discussion</v>

4056
03:20:55.220 --> 03:21:00.220
<v Speaker 4>as much as you can to say why has my </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kayla Peterson feeling good and you got </v>

4057
03:21:00.331 --> 03:21:03.380
<v Speaker 4>to love that and honor that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If she had done water fasting,</v>

4058
03:21:03.440 --> 03:21:06.440
<v Speaker 4>transitioning to an ultra clean diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you have done as well,</v>

4059
03:21:06.650 --> 03:21:09.830
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to look at sean baker's labs and say</v>

4060
03:21:10.040 --> 03:21:14.450
<v Speaker 4>prediabetic low testosterone high bun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned,</v>

4061
03:21:14.451 --> 03:21:19.451
<v Speaker 4>although he just published his coronary </v>
<v Speaker 4>calcium scan to zero and I honor that </v>

4062
03:21:19.451 --> 03:21:20.480
<v Speaker 4>he's got little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want the guy to drop dead,</v>

4063
03:21:20.481 --> 03:21:25.481
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's it's way preliminary for the </v>

4064
03:21:25.481 --> 03:21:28.361
<v Speaker 4>bandwagon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's testosterone thing though is he </v>

4065
03:21:28.361 --> 03:21:31.241
<v Speaker 4>said that he had been dead lifting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>day before and the day before he took </v>

4066
03:21:31.251 --> 03:21:34.610
<v Speaker 4>his test out of sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Significantly decreased testosterone.</v>

4067
03:21:34.850 --> 03:21:39.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said he repeated it a few times and </v>

4068
03:21:39.850 --> 03:21:39.850
<v Speaker 4>has stayed low,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're total raised,</v>

4069
03:21:40.050 --> 03:21:42.230
<v Speaker 4>it didn't raise rates by 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4070
03:21:42.240 --> 03:21:44.420
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like 237,</v>

4071
03:21:44.421 --> 03:21:46.120
<v Speaker 4>I can't memorize last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's little</v>

4072
03:21:46.130 --> 03:21:47.090
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of data.</v>

4073
03:21:47.091 --> 03:21:49.460
<v Speaker 2>If you're sharing a total testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 2>was less than 250.</v>

4074
03:21:49.461 --> 03:21:52.130
<v Speaker 2>It's an adverse mortality predictor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4075
03:21:52.190 --> 03:21:54.440
<v Speaker 2>he wants to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't need to do it.</v>

4076
03:21:54.570 --> 03:21:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Kayla peterson and Jordan might need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it until they find a better path.</v>

4077
03:21:58.430 --> 03:21:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Sean's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4078
03:21:59.430 --> 03:22:00.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopted it.</v>

4079
03:22:00.531 --> 03:22:01.740
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4080
03:22:01.760 --> 03:22:04.330
<v Speaker 2>the biggest puzzle is quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly,</v>

4081
03:22:04.340 --> 03:22:09.340
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that plant based </v>
<v Speaker 2>eaters and people that fill three </v>

4082
03:22:09.340 --> 03:22:13.691
<v Speaker 2>quarters of their plate with fruit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables get way more than everybody </v>

4083
03:22:13.691 --> 03:22:16.121
<v Speaker 2>else has lots of vitamin c and vitamin c</v>
<v Speaker 2>builds healthy walls and build south </v>

4084
03:22:16.121 --> 03:22:16.550
<v Speaker 2>immune systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You love vitamin c?</v>

4085
03:22:16.551 --> 03:22:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I love vitamin c,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it from foods.</v>

4086
03:22:18.291 --> 03:22:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind it as a supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind it.</v>

4087
03:22:20.211 --> 03:22:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Intravenous vitamin c,</v>
<v Speaker 2>linus pauling.</v>

4088
03:22:23.070 --> 03:22:24.610
<v Speaker 2>There's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4089
03:22:25.340 --> 03:22:27.860
<v Speaker 2>benefits of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are these people?</v>

4090
03:22:27.861 --> 03:22:30.440
<v Speaker 2>When every chart says that meat has no </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin c,</v>

4091
03:22:30.470 --> 03:22:31.640
<v Speaker 2>are they eating raw meat?</v>

4092
03:22:31.640 --> 03:22:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Which might've vitamin c?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they eating organ meat which might </v>

4093
03:22:36.640 --> 03:22:40.341
<v Speaker 2>have some invited?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me stop you there because I'll tell </v>

4094
03:22:40.341 --> 03:22:42.371
<v Speaker 2>you what the explanation has been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The explanation to me has been that </v>

4095
03:22:42.371 --> 03:22:46.151
<v Speaker 2>there is a decrease in absorption of </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin c when you're consuming vitamin </v>

4096
03:22:46.151 --> 03:22:48.010
<v Speaker 2>c with all these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cruciferous vegetables,</v>

4097
03:22:48.200 --> 03:22:53.200
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things that there's </v>

4098
03:22:53.200 --> 03:22:53.200
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an adverse effect.</v>

4099
03:22:53.200 --> 03:22:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a fact?</v>

4100
03:22:54.800 --> 03:22:57.800
<v Speaker 2>If you take a thousand milligrams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin c will absorb a lot of,</v>

4101
03:22:57.960 --> 03:23:00.950
<v Speaker 2>take 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>milligrams by percentage,</v>

4102
03:23:00.951 --> 03:23:05.951
<v Speaker 2>you won't absorb as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll still get more than a </v>

4103
03:23:05.951 --> 03:23:06.440
<v Speaker 2>thousand milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also this theory that sensor</v>

4104
03:23:06.441 --> 03:23:11.441
<v Speaker 2>eating basically and no added glucose </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet that there's some kind of </v>

4105
03:23:11.441 --> 03:23:13.410
<v Speaker 2>competition in us between glucose and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

4106
03:23:13.411 --> 03:23:17.390
<v Speaker 2>So even if they get a touch a c,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're absorbing it hyper efficiently.</v>

4107
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't developed getting clothes </v>

4108
03:23:22.510 --> 03:23:23.600
<v Speaker 2>from glucogenesis uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>internally,</v>

4109
03:23:23.601 --> 03:23:23.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4110
03:23:23.870 --> 03:23:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Because they're adding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surely it's a low carb diet and elidel </v>

4111
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:31.310
<v Speaker 2>alpha gal in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's about the only I think.</v>

4112
03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point is we just don't know.</v>

4113
03:23:33.200 --> 03:23:34.320
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4114
03:23:34.450 --> 03:23:38.660
<v Speaker 2>and I mean as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a practitioner myself,</v>

4115
03:23:38.661 --> 03:23:43.661
<v Speaker 2>and as someone who's dealt with chronic </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness who wasn't able to find help </v>

4116
03:23:43.661 --> 03:23:43.661
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4117
03:23:43.661 --> 03:23:48.401
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not be grudged people for sticking </v>

4118
03:23:48.401 --> 03:23:51.341
<v Speaker 2>with something that they've tried </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and nothing has worked and </v>

4119
03:23:51.341 --> 03:23:51.341
<v Speaker 2>they do this and they feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4120
03:23:51.341 --> 03:23:53.810
<v Speaker 2>who can blame Them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dinner with Jordan,</v>

4121
03:23:53.840 --> 03:23:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's eating these big giant stakes and </v>

4122
03:23:58.840 --> 03:23:59.540
<v Speaker 2>he looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's lighter than he's been since he was</v>

4123
03:23:59.541 --> 03:24:04.541
<v Speaker 2>20 and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent empathetic with that </v>

4124
03:24:04.541 --> 03:24:05.510
<v Speaker 2>because I've been through something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that myself.</v>

4125
03:24:05.511 --> 03:24:10.310
<v Speaker 2>But to then take that and say that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain that it's safe is a big leap.</v>

4126
03:24:10.520 --> 03:24:11.330
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4127
03:24:11.380 --> 03:24:15.020
<v Speaker 2>my field atherosclerosis takes years to </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop and I wish him well.</v>

4128
03:24:15.021 --> 03:24:16.910
<v Speaker 2>He contributing amazing things in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

4129
03:24:17.150 --> 03:24:22.150
<v Speaker 2>but unless he's tracking carotid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>coronary and doing it year after year </v>

4130
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:22.150
<v Speaker 2>after year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4131
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:23.760
<v Speaker 2>it's an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might not Want to run,</v>

4132
03:24:24.770 --> 03:24:29.770
<v Speaker 2>run those tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baseline baseline some nutrient </v>

4133
03:24:29.770 --> 03:24:32.790
<v Speaker 2>deficiencies also take many years to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider.</v>

4134
03:24:33.320 --> 03:24:34.820
<v Speaker 2>There's another guy that I follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

4135
03:24:34.850 --> 03:24:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the gentleman's name,</v>

4136
03:24:36.141 --> 03:24:39.410
<v Speaker 2>but he advocates organ meat and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that organ meat,</v>

4137
03:24:39.470 --> 03:24:41.840
<v Speaker 2>if you just eating steak that you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue,</v>

4138
03:24:42.110 --> 03:24:44.250
<v Speaker 2>but if you take into count liver</v>

4139
03:24:44.310 --> 03:24:49.310
<v Speaker 3>and heart kidneys that you are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get all these essential nutrients from </v>

4140
03:24:49.310 --> 03:24:53.091
<v Speaker 3>that you're still not getting vitamin c </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm aware of an insignificant </v>

4141
03:24:53.091 --> 03:24:57.561
<v Speaker 3>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting cArotinoids and </v>

4142
03:24:57.561 --> 03:24:57.910
<v Speaker 3>flavonoids and people not getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller phenol.</v>

4143
03:24:57.970 --> 03:24:59.040
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

4144
03:24:59.670 --> 03:25:00.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

4145
03:25:01.230 --> 03:25:04.140
<v Speaker 3>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is a good summation of of is it possible</v>

4146
03:25:04.141 --> 03:25:09.141
<v Speaker 3>that there's some mechanism that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that picture he was eating steak and </v>

4147
03:25:09.241 --> 03:25:14.241
<v Speaker 3>cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's apparently not an all meat diet </v>

4148
03:25:14.241 --> 03:25:16.551
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not slamming them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really wish him well and he can do </v>

4149
03:25:16.551 --> 03:25:16.551
<v Speaker 3>what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4150
03:25:16.551 --> 03:25:17.040
<v Speaker 3>Very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4151
03:25:17.041 --> 03:25:22.041
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>just detail is important though because </v>

4152
03:25:22.041 --> 03:25:24.900
<v Speaker 3>the organ meats and then like fattier </v>
<v Speaker 3>cuts of meat,</v>

4153
03:25:24.901 --> 03:25:27.540
<v Speaker 3>have glycine and other nutrients that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are really important.</v>

4154
03:25:27.541 --> 03:25:30.720
<v Speaker 3>If you're only eating lean meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think yeah,</v>

4155
03:25:30.721 --> 03:25:32.400
<v Speaker 3>I would be very concerned about that.</v>

4156
03:25:32.430 --> 03:25:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Children do not try this at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone tried to get me there were </v>

4157
03:25:37.430 --> 03:25:38.910
<v Speaker 3>saying you should try a carnivore diet </v>
<v Speaker 3>for 90 days,</v>

4158
03:25:39.150 --> 03:25:39.870
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4159
03:25:39.930 --> 03:25:44.930
<v Speaker 3>the real problem with that be I game and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's extremely smart and I like </v>

4160
03:25:46.561 --> 03:25:48.180
<v Speaker 3>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love vegetables.</v>

4161
03:25:48.210 --> 03:25:53.210
<v Speaker 3>I like to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat vegetables with essentially every </v>

4162
03:25:53.210 --> 03:25:56.811
<v Speaker 3>single meal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very smart because I told you </v>

4163
03:25:56.811 --> 03:25:56.811
<v Speaker 3>it's an antidote if nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>

4164
03:25:56.811 --> 03:26:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I do think that it's entirely possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe it's people that have this </v>

4165
03:26:01.790 --> 03:26:05.250
<v Speaker 3>disrupted gut microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that some people might be alert.</v>

4166
03:26:05.430 --> 03:26:10.430
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that mckayla peterson </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought up when she was on the podcast </v>

4167
03:26:10.430 --> 03:26:12.360
<v Speaker 3>that it might very well be that she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>allergic to almost everything.</v>

4168
03:26:12.361 --> 03:26:14.370
<v Speaker 3>She has some sort of an allergic </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction.</v>

4169
03:26:14.640 --> 03:26:19.640
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you both think that that could </v>

4170
03:26:19.640 --> 03:26:19.640
<v Speaker 3>be because of a fucked up.</v>

4171
03:26:19.640 --> 03:26:20.310
<v Speaker 3>Got my maps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely.</v>

4172
03:26:20.311 --> 03:26:22.020
<v Speaker 3>She just hasn't had evaluated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

4173
03:26:22.230 --> 03:26:24.840
<v Speaker 3>she started to laugh when I talked to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>naturopath.</v>

4174
03:26:24.870 --> 03:26:26.400
<v Speaker 3>That's what you should have kept on </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

4175
03:26:26.460 --> 03:26:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Gotten her gut analyte and gotten her </v>
<v Speaker 3>gut healed.</v>

4176
03:26:28.680 --> 03:26:30.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe that would've helped her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4177
03:26:30.900 --> 03:26:35.400
<v Speaker 3>kind of problem with those natural path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like good psychics and can I try to</v>

4178
03:26:35.401 --> 03:26:37.710
<v Speaker 3>find one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that it's also not.</v>

4179
03:26:37.740 --> 03:26:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all problems are solvable,</v>

4180
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:41.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's we,</v>

4181
03:26:41.850 --> 03:26:46.850
<v Speaker 3>that's a really hard thing to accept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let's say you get in a car accident </v>

4182
03:26:46.850 --> 03:26:48.480
<v Speaker 3>and your spine is crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4183
03:26:48.481 --> 03:26:51.300
<v Speaker 3>most in short of a miracle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4184
03:26:51.301 --> 03:26:56.301
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that person's not going to read fully </v>

4185
03:26:56.301 --> 03:26:58.521
<v Speaker 3>regained their 100 percent of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>musculoskeletal capabilities.</v>

4186
03:26:59.020 --> 03:27:04.020
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we don't have that same </v>

4187
03:27:04.020 --> 03:27:04.440
<v Speaker 3>understanding with other conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>health conditions.</v>

4188
03:27:04.441 --> 03:27:09.441
<v Speaker 3>Let's say I go to Indonesia and I get 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>parasites and you know,</v>

4189
03:27:11.640 --> 03:27:12.100
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4190
03:27:12.110 --> 03:27:15.060
<v Speaker 3>and then I'd have to take tons of </v>
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics to deal with that.</v>

4191
03:27:15.450 --> 03:27:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Is my gut ever going to return to 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the function that it,</v>

4192
03:27:19.520 --> 03:27:22.050
<v Speaker 3>that it had before that even with all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right things,</v>

4193
03:27:22.051 --> 03:27:27.051
<v Speaker 3>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm not saying that the people </v>

4194
03:27:27.051 --> 03:27:30.441
<v Speaker 3>should give up hope and I'm saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like we have to separate between this is</v>

4195
03:27:31.321 --> 03:27:35.220
<v Speaker 3>helping me and it's making me feel great</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nothing else worked.</v>

4196
03:27:35.610 --> 03:27:39.630
<v Speaker 3>and we know with 100 percent certainty </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is safe for the long term.</v>

4197
03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Those are two very questions</v>

4198
03:27:42.430 --> 03:27:47.430
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally empathetic to that and I </v>

4199
03:27:47.430 --> 03:27:51.091
<v Speaker 5>would probably do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>situate yourself that has gone through </v>

4200
03:27:51.091 --> 03:27:52.450
<v Speaker 5>this process of being extremely </v>
<v Speaker 5>unhealthy and I might even say,</v>

4201
03:27:52.720 --> 03:27:53.620
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4202
03:27:53.621 --> 03:27:56.770
<v Speaker 5>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I'll die five years earlier,</v>

4203
03:27:56.771 --> 03:27:58.480
<v Speaker 5>but I'll enjoy the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4204
03:27:58.510 --> 03:28:03.510
<v Speaker 5>those years of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I won't be in pain and discomfort the </v>

4205
03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:04.600
<v Speaker 5>entire time then sign me up or I might,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might say to myself,</v>

4206
03:28:05.020 --> 03:28:10.020
<v Speaker 5>well wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can't be that good for me to be </v>

4207
03:28:10.020 --> 03:28:10.020
<v Speaker 5>inflamed all the time and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4208
03:28:10.450 --> 03:28:13.030
<v Speaker 5>that can't be good for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so maybe even though the,</v>

4209
03:28:13.230 --> 03:28:18.230
<v Speaker 5>the all meat diet might have some </v>
<v Speaker 5>downsides and it actually might be </v>

4210
03:28:18.230 --> 03:28:19.300
<v Speaker 5>reducing inflammation and therefore that</v>
<v Speaker 5>will cancel out.</v>

4211
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:21.380
<v Speaker 5>We just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about all meat diet?</v>

4212
03:28:21.400 --> 03:28:24.190
<v Speaker 5>The thing that gets me is there's no </v>
<v Speaker 5>vitamin supplementation.</v>

4213
03:28:24.191 --> 03:28:29.191
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about an all meat diet with good </v>

4214
03:28:29.191 --> 03:28:29.290
<v Speaker 5>supplementation of multivitamin and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty smart idea.</v>

4215
03:28:29.850 --> 03:28:34.850
<v Speaker 5>It was fiber omega three coming fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's being questioned.</v>

4216
03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:40.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It as centraL to health in the medical </v>

4217
03:28:40.560 --> 03:28:40.960
<v Speaker 5>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr.</v>

4218
03:28:40.960 --> 03:28:42.820
<v Speaker 5>Dennis burkitt from england went to </v>
<v Speaker 5>africa.</v>

4219
03:28:42.850 --> 03:28:47.850
<v Speaker 5>Describe fiber described it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reduced all kinds of chronic diseases </v>

4220
03:28:47.850 --> 03:28:49.000
<v Speaker 5>that you wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a book called the fiber man and all.</v>

4221
03:28:49.420 --> 03:28:52.480
<v Speaker 5>It's being questioned now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so entrenched.</v>

4222
03:28:52.481 --> 03:28:55.090
<v Speaker 5>Have we got it all wrong and only plants</v>
<v Speaker 5>of fiber.</v>

4223
03:28:55.300 --> 03:28:57.040
<v Speaker 5>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where are they getting their fiber?</v>

4224
03:28:57.220 --> 03:29:02.220
<v Speaker 5>Their meat is sticking in their colon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called putrefaction for days and </v>

4225
03:29:02.220 --> 03:29:02.320
<v Speaker 5>days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's is it?</v>

4226
03:29:02.590 --> 03:29:03.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it's.</v>

4227
03:29:03.550 --> 03:29:08.550
<v Speaker 5>That is what happens and they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jaime died at 100 percent with every </v>

4228
03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:10.300
<v Speaker 5>single person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you chew it well and drink water,</v>

4229
03:29:10.301 --> 03:29:13.300
<v Speaker 5>does it always get stuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's generally thought that it's fiber.</v>

4230
03:29:13.301 --> 03:29:16.480
<v Speaker 5>That is the process of moving abdominal </v>
<v Speaker 5>contents,</v>

4231
03:29:16.481 --> 03:29:18.020
<v Speaker 5>whether you eat a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

4232
03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:19.650
<v Speaker 5>an all plant diet or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4233
03:29:19.790 --> 03:29:24.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think there's still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely controversy about </v>

4234
03:29:24.790 --> 03:29:28.171
<v Speaker 5>fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think the weight of the evidence </v>

4235
03:29:28.171 --> 03:29:28.900
<v Speaker 5>still still does suggested fermentable </v>
<v Speaker 5>carbohydrates.</v>

4236
03:29:28.930 --> 03:29:33.930
<v Speaker 5>Fiber essentially beneficial because the</v>
<v Speaker 5>very important for the microbiome and we</v>

4237
03:29:35.591 --> 03:29:35.970
<v Speaker 5>have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4238
03:29:36.050 --> 03:29:41.050
<v Speaker 5>people like justin sonnenburg at </v>
<v Speaker 5>stanford who's done a lot of good work </v>

4239
03:29:41.050 --> 03:29:41.050
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4240
03:29:41.050 --> 03:29:42.180
<v Speaker 5>do we know with a hundred perCent </v>
<v Speaker 5>certainty?</v>

4241
03:29:42.240 --> 03:29:47.240
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we also know that virtually every </v>

4242
03:29:47.240 --> 03:29:49.360
<v Speaker 5>human population that's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 5>studied had significant amounts of fiber</v>

4243
03:29:49.361 --> 03:29:50.620
<v Speaker 5>in their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

4244
03:29:50.990 --> 03:29:52.810
<v Speaker 5>so if we're going with die,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4245
03:29:53.210 --> 03:29:53.660
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4246
03:29:53.810 --> 03:29:57.910
<v Speaker 5>they did a very high note,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the warriors,</v>

4247
03:29:58.120 --> 03:30:03.120
<v Speaker 5>they consumed the warriors consumed milk</v>
<v Speaker 5>and meat and blood at certain times of </v>

4248
03:30:03.120 --> 03:30:04.870
<v Speaker 5>year when they were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4249
03:30:04.910 --> 03:30:09.910
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and other times of year they did eat </v>

4250
03:30:09.910 --> 03:30:09.910
<v Speaker 5>more plant foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the white,</v>

4251
03:30:09.910 --> 03:30:10.320
<v Speaker 5>the white plants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in the,</v>

4252
03:30:10.420 --> 03:30:12.490
<v Speaker 5>even the nun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the traditional knew it,</v>

4253
03:30:12.580 --> 03:30:17.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had a d during certain times a </v>

4254
03:30:17.580 --> 03:30:20.680
<v Speaker 5>year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the winter when the ground was </v>

4255
03:30:20.680 --> 03:30:22.771
<v Speaker 5>covered with snow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had a very low intake of plant </v>

4256
03:30:22.771 --> 03:30:25.411
<v Speaker 5>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they would still trade for them and </v>

4257
03:30:25.411 --> 03:30:28.051
<v Speaker 5>then during the summer when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they were able to collect berries </v>

4258
03:30:28.051 --> 03:30:29.440
<v Speaker 5>and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would definitely do that.</v>

4259
03:30:29.560 --> 03:30:33.280
<v Speaker 5>So every culture that we know of that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>been studied,</v>

4260
03:30:33.281 --> 03:30:38.281
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some combination of animal and plant </v>

4261
03:30:38.281 --> 03:30:38.281
<v Speaker 5>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4262
03:30:38.281 --> 03:30:38.281
<v Speaker 5>what ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what amount,</v>

4263
03:30:38.281 --> 03:30:40.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that varies place to place</v>

4264
03:30:40.070 --> 03:30:41.790
<v Speaker 4>depending on where they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4265
03:30:41.900 --> 03:30:46.900
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what the anthropological data </v>

4266
03:30:46.900 --> 03:30:46.900
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's actually,</v>

4267
03:30:46.900 --> 03:30:48.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you talk about this too,</v>

4268
03:30:48.471 --> 03:30:50.210
<v Speaker 4>super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super cool piece of data.</v>

4269
03:30:50.211 --> 03:30:55.211
<v Speaker 4>I'll go quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a professor at university of </v>

4270
03:30:55.211 --> 03:30:55.211
<v Speaker 4>pittsburgh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>steven o'keefe,</v>

4271
03:30:55.211 --> 03:30:58.421
<v Speaker 4>who took 20 african americans in </v>
<v Speaker 4>pittsburgh eating and intercity not </v>

4272
03:30:58.421 --> 03:31:02.351
<v Speaker 4>healthy diet and 20 rural africans in </v>
<v Speaker 4>South Africa eating from the bush and </v>

4273
03:31:02.351 --> 03:31:06.791
<v Speaker 4>largely plants and they switched them </v>
<v Speaker 4>for 20 days and they measured every </v>

4274
03:31:06.791 --> 03:31:07.190
<v Speaker 4>single thing they can measure in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>microbiome,</v>

4275
03:31:07.191 --> 03:31:08.750
<v Speaker 4>in their stool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>metabolites,</v>

4276
03:31:08.751 --> 03:31:13.751
<v Speaker 4>tmao and all the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body is so amazing that 20 days on </v>

4277
03:31:13.751 --> 03:31:14.210
<v Speaker 4>a better diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4278
03:31:14.220 --> 03:31:16.310
<v Speaker 4>what I would call the rural african died</v>
<v Speaker 4>a better diet.</v>

4279
03:31:16.580 --> 03:31:21.580
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was incredible changes towards </v>

4280
03:31:21.580 --> 03:31:21.580
<v Speaker 4>health,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making butyric acid,</v>

4281
03:31:21.580 --> 03:31:26.351
<v Speaker 4>having bacteroidetes and prepatella I </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean changes and the the rural african </v>

4282
03:31:26.391 --> 03:31:31.391
<v Speaker 4>suffered american illness in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you can measure within two weeks </v>

4283
03:31:31.391 --> 03:31:34.930
<v Speaker 4>now there's data I just learned </v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday in los angeles that I'm </v>

4284
03:31:34.930 --> 03:31:34.930
<v Speaker 4>microbiome changes in five days.</v>

4285
03:31:34.930 --> 03:31:37.580
<v Speaker 4>You go to a low sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>low protein plant diet.</v>

4286
03:31:37.581 --> 03:31:39.200
<v Speaker 4>This is university of southern </v>
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>

4287
03:31:39.380 --> 03:31:42.320
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you in five days michela </v>
<v Speaker 4>peterson's microbiome would change.</v>

4288
03:31:42.470 --> 03:31:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Would she feel better?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4289
03:31:44.330 --> 03:31:47.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm just pointing out just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>remarkable resiliency and that's part of</v>

4290
03:31:47.991 --> 03:31:52.991
<v Speaker 4>the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can feed a human a whole lot of </v>

4291
03:31:52.991 --> 03:31:55.571
<v Speaker 4>diets and make it through procreation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is our main purpose of </v>

4292
03:31:55.571 --> 03:31:58.931
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary biology to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about from procreation to </v>

4293
03:31:58.931 --> 03:32:00.440
<v Speaker 4>death for optimal health,</v>
<v Speaker 4>longevity,</v>

4294
03:32:00.441 --> 03:32:03.350
<v Speaker 4>health span.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's more than one path.</v>

4295
03:32:03.650 --> 03:32:06.770
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's not beat on our plant base,</v>

4296
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:10.640
<v Speaker 4>the people out there because we've shown</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can reverse atherosclerosis.</v>

4297
03:32:10.641 --> 03:32:12.860
<v Speaker 4>We've shown you can reverse prostate </v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer,</v>

4298
03:32:13.040 --> 03:32:18.040
<v Speaker 4>university of California south as a use </v>
<v Speaker 4>csf and we've shown you can lengthen </v>

4299
03:32:18.040 --> 03:32:22.181
<v Speaker 4>your telomeres,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which may have implications for </v>

4300
03:32:22.181 --> 03:32:24.341
<v Speaker 4>longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's done through ketogenic diet as </v>

4301
03:32:24.341 --> 03:32:24.341
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

4302
03:32:24.341 --> 03:32:27.080
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't that lengthen your telomeres?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's been published.</v>

4303
03:32:27.620 --> 03:32:29.450
<v Speaker 4>It's a be an interesting project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4304
03:32:29.451 --> 03:32:31.950
<v Speaker 4>it takes about three to six months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you'd have nobody.</v>

4305
03:32:31.990 --> 03:32:33.110
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not been looked at.</v>

4306
03:32:33.670 --> 03:32:38.670
<v Speaker 4>And they say the same thing about a diet</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is rich in a,</v>

4307
03:32:40.280 --> 03:32:44.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables and fruits and animal foods.</v>

4308
03:32:44.300 --> 03:32:44.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4309
03:32:44.910 --> 03:32:48.200
<v Speaker 4>the benefits that you can reverse heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease with what you just said.</v>

4310
03:32:48.201 --> 03:32:53.201
<v Speaker 4>Don't touch that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot reverse atherosclerosis with </v>

4311
03:32:53.201 --> 03:32:53.201
<v Speaker 4>animal products.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's never been studied.</v>

4312
03:32:53.201 --> 03:32:57.761
<v Speaker 4>The only thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then how can you say you cannot do </v>

4313
03:32:57.761 --> 03:32:57.761
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do we have studies?</v>

4314
03:32:57.761 --> 03:33:00.740
<v Speaker 4>What would you tell a patient with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>99 percent blockages that come to me?</v>

4315
03:33:00.741 --> 03:33:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Go eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

4316
03:33:02.670 --> 03:33:07.670
<v Speaker 4>We have studies that show that switching</v>
<v Speaker 4>from a standard american diet to a </v>

4317
03:33:09.530 --> 03:33:11.130
<v Speaker 4>neutral for diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4318
03:33:11.580 --> 03:33:13.340
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a new word,</v>

4319
03:33:13.400 --> 03:33:16.640
<v Speaker 4>neutraL for you coined this sarah </v>
<v Speaker 4>ballantine.</v>

4320
03:33:17.090 --> 03:33:21.170
<v Speaker 4>And this is the idea is just plant based</v>
<v Speaker 4>meat.</v>

4321
03:33:21.890 --> 03:33:22.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4322
03:33:22.850 --> 03:33:23.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4323
03:33:23.391 --> 03:33:27.530
<v Speaker 4>it's a whole foods diet with fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables,</v>

4324
03:33:27.531 --> 03:33:30.440
<v Speaker 4>nuts and seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some starchy plants and animal foods.</v>

4325
03:33:31.980 --> 03:33:33.290
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you call that paleo?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now?</v>

4326
03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:38.300
<v Speaker 4>The problem with paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>paleolithic people didn't really eat </v>

4327
03:33:38.300 --> 03:33:38.300
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a lot of grains.</v>

4328
03:33:38.300 --> 03:33:38.300
<v Speaker 4>So when</v>

4329
03:33:38.480 --> 03:33:43.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>

4330
03:33:43.260 --> 03:33:47.520
<v Speaker 5>neutral four is a more inclusive term.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That just means that what I said,</v>

4331
03:33:47.521 --> 03:33:52.521
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't necessarily some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some neutral voice might include some </v>

4332
03:33:52.521 --> 03:33:55.791
<v Speaker 5>dairy products.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They might include some grains or </v>

4333
03:33:55.791 --> 03:33:55.791
<v Speaker 5>lagoons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4334
03:33:55.791 --> 03:33:59.580
<v Speaker 5>but what they're eating whole real foods</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're including animal foods there</v>

4335
03:33:59.610 --> 03:34:04.610
<v Speaker 5>to distinguish that from vegan or </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarian isn't the criticism of the </v>

4336
03:34:04.610 --> 03:34:06.330
<v Speaker 5>paleolithic diet or calling it the </v>
<v Speaker 5>paleolithic diet.</v>

4337
03:34:06.331 --> 03:34:11.331
<v Speaker 5>The people in the paleolithic era </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually did experience at least some </v>

4338
03:34:11.331 --> 03:34:14.190
<v Speaker 5>form of agriculture people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There has been recent data that suggests</v>

4339
03:34:14.191 --> 03:34:19.191
<v Speaker 5>that a green consumption in lagoon </v>
<v Speaker 5>consumption went back further than it </v>

4340
03:34:19.321 --> 03:34:21.570
<v Speaker 5>was originally thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

4341
03:34:21.720 --> 03:34:26.720
<v Speaker 5>whether those were prominent parts of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the diet or fall back foods is another </v>

4342
03:34:27.001 --> 03:34:29.700
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And does that even matter?</v>

4343
03:34:29.701 --> 03:34:34.701
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is why I've argued that the </v>

4344
03:34:34.701 --> 03:34:37.011
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary perspective is important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a way of generating </v>

4345
03:34:37.011 --> 03:34:39.240
<v Speaker 5>hypotheses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of like observational research.</v>

4346
03:34:39.650 --> 03:34:42.840
<v Speaker 5>It's not an.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't look at what our ancestors ate</v>

4347
03:34:42.841 --> 03:34:45.450
<v Speaker 5>and say that therefore that's what we </v>
<v Speaker 5>should eat right now.</v>

4348
03:34:45.480 --> 03:34:46.800
<v Speaker 5>You can look at it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4349
03:34:46.801 --> 03:34:48.630
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's test this out.</v>

4350
03:34:48.690 --> 03:34:49.970
<v Speaker 5>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how does it reverse</v>

4351
03:34:50.140 --> 03:34:50.780
<v Speaker 4>disease?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4352
03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:53.740
<v Speaker 4>Ketogenic diet and tila mirrors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no sane studies out there.</v>

4353
03:34:53.741 --> 03:34:56.860
<v Speaker 4>Just to follow up to know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4354
03:34:57.610 --> 03:35:01.030
<v Speaker 4>how does it reverse heart disease?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go back to los angeles,</v>

4355
03:35:01.031 --> 03:35:03.340
<v Speaker 4>California in 1948,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr.</v>

4356
03:35:03.340 --> 03:35:04.480
<v Speaker 4>Lester morrison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>internist.</v>

4357
03:35:04.481 --> 03:35:09.481
<v Speaker 4>It's real answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saw that in the country of Norway in </v>

4358
03:35:09.481 --> 03:35:12.811
<v Speaker 4>world war two where they dropped their </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal food consumption because of the </v>

4359
03:35:12.811 --> 03:35:13.690
<v Speaker 4>nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heart disease slowed for those two,</v>

4360
03:35:13.691 --> 03:35:14.920
<v Speaker 4>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

4361
03:35:14.921 --> 03:35:17.260
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what happens with my heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>patients in los angeles,</v>

4362
03:35:17.261 --> 03:35:19.210
<v Speaker 4>he had 100 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no treatment.</v>

4363
03:35:19.211 --> 03:35:23.020
<v Speaker 4>in 1948,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he put half of them on a low animal diet</v>

4364
03:35:23.021 --> 03:35:26.350
<v Speaker 4>with very high plants that half of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>make like los angeles people.</v>

4365
03:35:26.500 --> 03:35:31.500
<v Speaker 4>Eight years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 percent on the high plant lowfat </v>

4366
03:35:31.500 --> 03:35:31.500
<v Speaker 4>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're alive.</v>

4367
03:35:31.500 --> 03:35:35.461
<v Speaker 4>Zero percent on the standard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Los angeles died and then a series of </v>

4368
03:35:35.461 --> 03:35:36.790
<v Speaker 4>people said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's start doing that more routinely.</v>

4369
03:35:36.880 --> 03:35:41.880
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately there were randomized </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinical studies using cath lab </v>

4370
03:35:41.880 --> 03:35:43.210
<v Speaker 4>techniques using ultrasound techniques </v>
<v Speaker 4>using pet scanning.</v>

4371
03:35:43.210 --> 03:35:48.210
<v Speaker 4>This shows it actually causes small </v>
<v Speaker 4>decreases in the amount of plaque in </v>

4372
03:35:48.210 --> 03:35:52.291
<v Speaker 4>your heart arteries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which results in tripling of blood flow </v>

4373
03:35:52.291 --> 03:35:54.100
<v Speaker 4>because it's it's fluid physiology that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is four r squared,</v>

4374
03:35:54.101 --> 03:35:59.101
<v Speaker 4>so small decreases in plaque.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody ever thought you could decrease </v>

4375
03:35:59.101 --> 03:36:02.311
<v Speaker 4>plaque with diet and lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can cause this big increase in </v>

4376
03:36:02.311 --> 03:36:02.311
<v Speaker 4>flow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So within three,</v>

4377
03:36:02.311 --> 03:36:02.800
<v Speaker 4>four weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chest pain goes away.</v>

4378
03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:04.390
<v Speaker 4>Within three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four months,</v>

4379
03:36:04.391 --> 03:36:05.590
<v Speaker 4>stressed us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get better,</v>

4380
03:36:05.740 --> 03:36:10.740
<v Speaker 4>and as you keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a number of hospitalizations procedures </v>

4381
03:36:10.740 --> 03:36:13.240
<v Speaker 4>go down dramatically to the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Initially small studies got big enough.</v>

4382
03:36:13.450 --> 03:36:18.450
<v Speaker 4>In 2010 medicare said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll pay for patients to learn how to </v>

4383
03:36:18.450 --> 03:36:20.890
<v Speaker 4>do this reversal lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't pay for mediterranean diet,</v>

4384
03:36:20.920 --> 03:36:22.990
<v Speaker 4>they don't pay for dash diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't pay for paleo,</v>

4385
03:36:22.991 --> 03:36:23.940
<v Speaker 4>keto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>neutral for.</v>

4386
03:36:24.130 --> 03:36:25.860
<v Speaker 4>They pay for plant based diets for </v>
<v Speaker 4>advantage</v>

4387
03:36:26.260 --> 03:36:31.260
<v Speaker 5>only because the these concepts of </v>
<v Speaker 5>neutral bar and paleo have not been </v>

4388
03:36:31.260 --> 03:36:32.500
<v Speaker 5>around for very long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So all you said</v>

4389
03:36:33.140 --> 03:36:35.140
<v Speaker 4>the study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4390
03:36:35.430 --> 03:36:35.650
<v Speaker 4>you don't</v>

4391
03:36:35.980 --> 03:36:39.000
<v Speaker 5>have the millions of dollars to do this </v>
<v Speaker 5>study but don't.</v>

4392
03:36:39.090 --> 03:36:43.780
<v Speaker 5>Don't be rigorous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So all all that you have said,</v>

4393
03:36:43.781 --> 03:36:46.300
<v Speaker 5>which I agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that a plant,</v>

4394
03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:51.480
<v Speaker 5>a vegan or plant based kind of diet </v>
<v Speaker 5>compared to a standard american diet </v>

4395
03:36:51.480 --> 03:36:53.490
<v Speaker 5>will reverse some markers of </v>
<v Speaker 5>atherosclerosis.</v>

4396
03:36:53.540 --> 03:36:55.490
<v Speaker 5>Tip number one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

4397
03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:59.590
<v Speaker 5>I agree with that statement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's no.</v>

4398
03:37:00.070 --> 03:37:05.070
<v Speaker 5>We don't have research.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like studies have been done </v>

4399
03:37:05.070 --> 03:37:08.700
<v Speaker 5>taking people from standard american to </v>
<v Speaker 5>neutral for paleo and we haven't seen </v>

4400
03:37:08.700 --> 03:37:10.450
<v Speaker 5>benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have rcts that have shown significant</v>

4401
03:37:10.451 --> 03:37:15.451
<v Speaker 5>benefits in cardiovascular markers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>markers neutral for diets and paleo and </v>

4402
03:37:16.691 --> 03:37:19.060
<v Speaker 5>low carb for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and key to genic.</v>

4403
03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:25.480
<v Speaker 5>Your assumption is that the real issues </v>
<v Speaker 5>of standard american diet is killing </v>

4404
03:37:25.480 --> 03:37:28.420
<v Speaker 5>people and lack of that lack of evidence</v>
<v Speaker 5>is not evidence against it,</v>

4405
03:37:28.460 --> 03:37:31.680
<v Speaker 5>so we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know that.</v>

4406
03:37:31.840 --> 03:37:35.170
<v Speaker 5>How long have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long have these concepts been around</v>

4407
03:37:35.171 --> 03:37:36.370
<v Speaker 5>neutral for paleo?</v>

4408
03:37:36.640 --> 03:37:39.040
<v Speaker 5>How many studies have been done looking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>comparing,</v>

4409
03:37:39.340 --> 03:37:44.340
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's do it would be great if we had a </v>

4410
03:37:44.340 --> 03:37:44.340
<v Speaker 5>study where you had standard american </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet,</v>

4411
03:37:44.340 --> 03:37:48.920
<v Speaker 5>then you had two different groups you </v>
<v Speaker 5>had or a control group of standard </v>

4412
03:37:48.920 --> 03:37:52.831
<v Speaker 5>american diet and then you had you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>vegan diet and then you had neutral for </v>

4413
03:37:52.831 --> 03:37:53.290
<v Speaker 5>paleo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't have that study,</v>

4414
03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:58.570
<v Speaker 5>so we can't say that that eating a diet </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's rich in whole foods but contained</v>

4415
03:37:58.571 --> 03:38:01.660
<v Speaker 5>some animal foods isn't going to reverse</v>
<v Speaker 5>atherosclerosis.</v>

4416
03:38:02.020 --> 03:38:07.020
<v Speaker 5>We can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think one thing that we can </v>

4417
03:38:07.020 --> 03:38:09.001
<v Speaker 5>absolutely agree on is that the standard</v>
<v Speaker 5>american diet socks and that a vegan </v>

4418
03:38:09.001 --> 03:38:11.020
<v Speaker 5>diet is superior to the standard </v>
<v Speaker 5>american diet.</v>

4419
03:38:11.080 --> 03:38:12.040
<v Speaker 5>These,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these two men,</v>

4420
03:38:12.730 --> 03:38:16.980
<v Speaker 5>these two things are if the vegan </v>
<v Speaker 5>implementing wisely,</v>

4421
03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:18.250
<v Speaker 5>wisely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just tell you,</v>

4422
03:38:18.470 --> 03:38:21.670
<v Speaker 5>and this is very subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but vegan diets as which you can't do.</v>

4423
03:38:21.670 --> 03:38:25.360
<v Speaker 5>You can't eat dairy and eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't eat fish can eat whole food.</v>

4424
03:38:25.361 --> 03:38:27.700
<v Speaker 5>Plant based is really the proper medical</v>
<v Speaker 5>term.</v>

4425
03:38:27.760 --> 03:38:29.610
<v Speaker 5>What do you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eat john.</v>

4426
03:38:29.620 --> 03:38:33.400
<v Speaker 5>Joseph talks about too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he calls it call with a whole food plant</v>

4427
03:38:33.401 --> 03:38:34.930
<v Speaker 5>based because you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4428
03:38:34.931 --> 03:38:36.730
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to be just eating pasta </v>
<v Speaker 5>all day.</v>

4429
03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:42.000
<v Speaker 5>Oh absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No food vegetarian or junk food vegan </v>

4430
03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:45.031
<v Speaker 5>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the dispute is whether or not animal </v>

4431
03:38:45.031 --> 03:38:47.030
<v Speaker 5>protein in organ meats will advance your</v>
<v Speaker 5>health and,</v>

4432
03:38:47.090 --> 03:38:48.910
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and make in debt.</v>

4433
03:38:48.911 --> 03:38:52.780
<v Speaker 5>It's a superior diet when you add that </v>
<v Speaker 5>one quarter of your plate.</v>

4434
03:38:52.781 --> 03:38:53.680
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm.</v>

4435
03:38:53.681 --> 03:38:56.350
<v Speaker 5>One of the ways to answer this is to </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at nutrient density.</v>

4436
03:38:56.440 --> 03:39:00.220
<v Speaker 5>So I have this study on my websites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my yo,</v>

4437
03:39:00.250 --> 03:39:02.440
<v Speaker 5>I think my low and my french is </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible.</v>

4438
03:39:02.441 --> 03:39:06.040
<v Speaker 5>M a I l l o,</v>
<v Speaker 5>t and m,</v>

4439
03:39:06.820 --> 03:39:07.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's uh,</v>

4440
03:39:07.810 --> 03:39:11.240
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] dot com slash rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4441
03:39:11.350 --> 03:39:16.350
<v Speaker 5>and he looked at nutrient density of </v>
<v Speaker 5>foods and categorize them based on </v>

4442
03:39:16.350 --> 03:39:17.630
<v Speaker 5>nutrient density and he was only looking</v>
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>

4443
03:39:17.830 --> 03:39:20.890
<v Speaker 5>he was looking at essential nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so all the vitamins and minerals that we</v>

4444
03:39:20.891 --> 03:39:25.891
<v Speaker 5>absolutely need for health.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't looking at polyphenols and </v>

4445
03:39:25.891 --> 03:39:26.710
<v Speaker 5>flavonoids and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are beneficial,</v>

4446
03:39:26.711 --> 03:39:31.711
<v Speaker 5>but we don't absolutely need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the number one food in terms of </v>

4447
03:39:32.231 --> 03:39:37.231
<v Speaker 5>nutrient density,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you want to guess what organ meats </v>

4448
03:39:37.231 --> 03:39:38.480
<v Speaker 5>organized score of seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fifty four.</v>

4449
03:39:38.540 --> 03:39:41.360
<v Speaker 5>Next highest shellfish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Six 43.</v>

4450
03:39:41.361 --> 03:39:43.700
<v Speaker 5>And I've often said this to my patients </v>
<v Speaker 5>like kale,</v>

4451
03:39:43.900 --> 03:39:47.720
<v Speaker 5>you can be a vegetarian or an only eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>organ,</v>

4452
03:39:47.721 --> 03:39:52.721
<v Speaker 5>meats and shellfish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd be doing really well because of </v>

4453
03:39:52.721 --> 03:39:52.721
<v Speaker 5>just how nutrient dense they are.</v>

4454
03:39:52.721 --> 03:39:54.150
<v Speaker 4>And that's not really a controversial.</v>

4455
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:56.870
<v Speaker 5>Let me come here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fatty fish,</v>

4456
03:39:56.900 --> 03:40:00.890
<v Speaker 5>six slash 22.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lean fish is three 75.</v>

4457
03:40:01.320 --> 03:40:03.560
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then vegetables or 3:52</v>

4458
03:40:03.561 --> 03:40:04.190
<v Speaker 5>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4459
03:40:04.191 --> 03:40:06.800
<v Speaker 5>vegetables are on there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a organ,</v>

4460
03:40:06.801 --> 03:40:07.820
<v Speaker 5>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shellfish,</v>

4461
03:40:07.850 --> 03:40:09.740
<v Speaker 5>fatty fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lean fish,</v>

4462
03:40:10.270 --> 03:40:13.250
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are all higher than,</v>

4463
03:40:13.310 --> 03:40:18.310
<v Speaker 5>than vegetables and grains and lagoons </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't even really make the,</v>

4464
03:40:19.470 --> 03:40:24.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're nowhere close in terms of </v>

4465
03:40:24.470 --> 03:40:24.470
<v Speaker 5>nutrient density.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we can all agree that,</v>

4466
03:40:24.470 --> 03:40:28.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when someone goes from the standard </v>

4467
03:40:28.770 --> 03:40:31.181
<v Speaker 5>american diet to a vegan diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a real reason why they're </v>

4468
03:40:31.181 --> 03:40:31.430
<v Speaker 5>experiencing significant health </v>
<v Speaker 5>benefits,</v>

4469
03:40:31.610 --> 03:40:33.710
<v Speaker 5>particularly if they supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>YeAh,</v>

4470
03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:34.550
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

4471
03:40:34.551 --> 03:40:38.150
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are highly processed and refined,</v>

4472
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:43.630
<v Speaker 5>assuming they're eating a whole foods </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegan diet and not just subsisting on </v>

4473
03:40:43.630 --> 03:40:46.580
<v Speaker 5>begets and cookies and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which unfortunately people do.</v>

4474
03:40:46.610 --> 03:40:49.800
<v Speaker 5>We'll do just like people eat the </v>
<v Speaker 5>standard american diet and you know,</v>

4475
03:40:49.820 --> 03:40:52.090
<v Speaker 5>for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like people who go paleo and,</v>

4476
03:40:52.300 --> 03:40:57.300
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and are eating paleo donuts and paleo </v>

4477
03:40:57.300 --> 03:40:57.300
<v Speaker 5>ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

4478
03:40:57.300 --> 03:41:02.141
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you can do it on any dietary </v>

4479
03:41:02.141 --> 03:41:02.141
<v Speaker 5>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No foods.</v>

4480
03:41:02.141 --> 03:41:02.190
<v Speaker 4>It was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4481
03:41:02.200 --> 03:41:06.230
<v Speaker 4>I never have proposed except for one </v>
<v Speaker 4>small subset that everybody needs to eat</v>

4482
03:41:06.231 --> 03:41:08.170
<v Speaker 4>a completely plant based diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if they do,</v>

4483
03:41:08.171 --> 03:41:09.460
<v Speaker 4>they're probably going to have good </v>
<v Speaker 4>health.</v>

4484
03:41:09.640 --> 03:41:11.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a concept called the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr.</v>

4485
03:41:11.950 --> 03:41:13.300
<v Speaker 4>Dean ornish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people beat up on,</v>

4486
03:41:13.301 --> 03:41:18.301
<v Speaker 4>but he's done all these studies on </v>
<v Speaker 4>reversal of atherosclerosis and he </v>

4487
03:41:18.301 --> 03:41:18.760
<v Speaker 4>celebrated around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has a book called the spectrum.</v>

4488
03:41:18.820 --> 03:41:21.790
<v Speaker 4>Go as far towards it as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll love you wherever you're at,</v>

4489
03:41:21.791 --> 03:41:23.230
<v Speaker 4>you choose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not judging you.</v>

4490
03:41:23.231 --> 03:41:25.390
<v Speaker 4>And that's I think the message for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>listeners.</v>

4491
03:41:25.391 --> 03:41:28.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean it what you're eating vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 4>or fruit or maybe it's just vegetables.</v>

4492
03:41:28.871 --> 03:41:33.871
<v Speaker 4>Every meal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the example people need to hear </v>

4493
03:41:33.871 --> 03:41:33.910
<v Speaker 4>and they don't need to abandon </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything else.</v>

4494
03:41:34.090 --> 03:41:36.100
<v Speaker 4>Just don't do it with a donut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't do it with a bagel.</v>

4495
03:41:36.101 --> 03:41:39.160
<v Speaker 4>Don't do these calorie empty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also time restricted eating.</v>

4496
03:41:39.161 --> 03:41:41.380
<v Speaker 4>I think we all agree on the awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twelve hours,</v>

4497
03:41:41.381 --> 03:41:46.381
<v Speaker 4>14 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of four or five days a </v>

4498
03:41:46.381 --> 03:41:47.410
<v Speaker 4>month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lowering calories with low protein,</v>

4499
03:41:47.411 --> 03:41:49.210
<v Speaker 4>low sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now the science is coming out.</v>

4500
03:41:49.270 --> 03:41:51.250
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right here from los angeles.</v>

4501
03:41:51.670 --> 03:41:52.660
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4502
03:41:52.730 --> 03:41:57.730
<v Speaker 5>so I want to say that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about helping people and I was a vegan </v>

4503
03:41:57.730 --> 03:42:01.460
<v Speaker 5>at one point and a vegetarian and I have</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends that are vegans and vegetarians.</v>

4504
03:42:01.461 --> 03:42:03.540
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not ideological about this at all.</v>

4505
03:42:04.300 --> 03:42:06.530
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I want to say like,</v>

4506
03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:11.560
<v Speaker 5>so someone who is a vegetarian or vegan </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just to show how nutrient dense </v>

4507
03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:15.610
<v Speaker 5>organ meats and shellfish are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want it to be a vegan but you're </v>

4508
03:42:15.610 --> 03:42:15.800
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4509
03:42:15.980 --> 03:42:20.930
<v Speaker 5>ideologically opposed to eating some </v>
<v Speaker 5>small amount of animal product or animal</v>

4510
03:42:20.931 --> 03:42:25.931
<v Speaker 5>food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could eat one clam oyster and four </v>

4511
03:42:25.931 --> 03:42:29.231
<v Speaker 5>grams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a tiny amount of liver a day </v>

4512
03:42:29.231 --> 03:42:29.710
<v Speaker 5>and you would completely meet your needs</v>
<v Speaker 5>for b12,</v>

4513
03:42:29.750 --> 03:42:31.040
<v Speaker 5>zinc,</v>
<v Speaker 5>copper,</v>

4514
03:42:31.050 --> 03:42:31.740
<v Speaker 5>coleen,</v>

4515
03:42:32.130 --> 03:42:37.130
<v Speaker 2>and many other nutrients with no other </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumption of animal foods beyond that.</v>

4516
03:42:37.740 --> 03:42:41.100
<v Speaker 2>So this is what I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the spectrum is large,</v>

4517
03:42:41.101 --> 03:42:42.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people might consume a much,</v>

4518
03:42:42.660 --> 03:42:46.590
<v Speaker 2>a higher percentage of animal foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people could consume just that much</v>

4519
03:42:46.650 --> 03:42:51.650
<v Speaker 2>and they would still improve their </v>
<v Speaker 2>health and wellbeing by doing that from </v>

4520
03:42:52.290 --> 03:42:55.740
<v Speaker 2>then eating a strictly a plant diet.</v>

4521
03:42:56.840 --> 03:42:57.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4522
03:42:57.740 --> 03:42:59.660
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I do have to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joel,</v>

4523
03:42:59.661 --> 03:43:04.661
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you keep saying that nick and </v>

4524
03:43:04.661 --> 03:43:04.661
<v Speaker 1>nate diaz or vegan,</v>

4525
03:43:04.661 --> 03:43:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I know they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've fallen back.</v>

4526
03:43:05.900 --> 03:43:07.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't keep saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've fallen back.</v>

4527
03:43:07.660 --> 03:43:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you brought it up a bunch of times,</v>

4528
03:43:09.551 --> 03:43:10.570
<v Speaker 2>but he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he,</v>

4529
03:43:10.600 --> 03:43:11.750
<v Speaker 2>when he won the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

4530
03:43:12.810 --> 03:43:14.990
<v Speaker 2>he was eating fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish and eggs.</v>

4531
03:43:15.030 --> 03:43:16.040
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worry about this tape,</v>

4532
03:43:16.050 --> 03:43:16.950
<v Speaker 2>male level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's cool.</v>

4533
03:43:17.280 --> 03:43:18.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

4534
03:43:18.071 --> 03:43:19.600
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the explosion,</v>

4535
03:43:19.601 --> 03:43:23.080
<v Speaker 2>the Tennessee titans and kyrie irving </v>
<v Speaker 2>and serena williams.</v>

4536
03:43:23.081 --> 03:43:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean serena williams is vegan as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4537
03:43:25.121 --> 03:43:27.610
<v Speaker 2>She reversed and auto immune disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>called sjogren's.</v>

4538
03:43:27.611 --> 03:43:32.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is it isn't necessary to be plant </v>

4539
03:43:32.611 --> 03:43:33.100
<v Speaker 2>based to be a world class athlete?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nick,</v>

4549
03:43:53.340 --> 03:43:58.000
<v Speaker 2>the point is it's an option to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>super athlete without animal products.</v>

4550
03:43:58.180 --> 03:44:00.830
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing it more and more recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which troll on your thing,</v>

4551

<v Speaker 2>vegetables.</v>

4554
03:44:10.690 --> 03:44:15.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole lot better than the crap </v>
<v Speaker 2>american diet that a lot of athletes </v>

4555
03:44:15.690 --> 03:44:17.500
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just cut out all the land animals.</v>

4556
03:44:17.580 --> 03:44:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You initially started doing it to make.</v>

4557
03:44:20.021 --> 03:44:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

4558
03:44:21.970 --> 03:44:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

4559
03:44:23.050 --> 03:44:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>

4560
03:44:24.190 --> 03:44:26.350
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>quicker recovery that.</v>

4561
03:44:26.920 --> 03:44:29.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some like alex and sarah </v>
<v Speaker 2>sees the world</v>

4562
03:44:29.240 --> 03:44:30.220
<v Speaker 1>class fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

4563
03:44:30.280 --> 03:44:35.190
<v Speaker 1>He's completely vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean o'malley was for awhile,</v>

4564
03:44:35.210 --> 03:44:38.570
<v Speaker 1>but he found himself to have much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy when he started eating meat,</v>

4565
03:44:38.571 --> 03:44:41.100
<v Speaker 1>but he might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might've been doing it wrong or not.</v>

4566
03:44:41.400 --> 03:44:43.810
<v Speaker 2>My biome and supplementation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4567
03:44:44.110 --> 03:44:45.020
<v Speaker 2>believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4568
03:44:45.021 --> 03:44:46.020
<v Speaker 2>but that's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

4569
03:44:46.030 --> 03:44:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I forget her name right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chef that cooked for 15 Tennessee </v>

4570
03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:53.701
<v Speaker 2>titans and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just kicking ass and griff </v>

4571
03:44:53.701 --> 03:44:53.701
<v Speaker 2>wailin used to be with the miami </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins.</v>

4572
03:44:53.701 --> 03:44:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I forget where he is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oakland raiders,</v>

4573
03:44:54.730 --> 03:44:55.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great,</v>

4574
03:44:55.451 --> 03:44:56.920
<v Speaker 2>great tight end and such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4575
03:44:57.100 --> 03:45:02.100
<v Speaker 2>it's possible that we can say scott </v>
<v Speaker 2>jurek set the world record for the </v>

4576
03:45:02.100 --> 03:45:03.970
<v Speaker 2>appalachian trail faster than either the</v>
<v Speaker 2>person eat beans.</v>

4577
03:45:03.971 --> 03:45:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

4578
03:45:05.570 --> 03:45:08.440
<v Speaker 2>A level of athletic fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The appalachian trail.</v>

4579
03:45:08.500 --> 03:45:09.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 24,</v>

4580
03:45:09.380 --> 03:45:10.810
<v Speaker 2>100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2,400</v>

4581
03:45:10.811 --> 03:45:13.930
<v Speaker 2>miles fast as human to ever accomplish </v>
<v Speaker 2>it on beans.</v>

4582
03:45:13.931 --> 03:45:15.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty cool.</v>

4583
03:45:15.371 --> 03:45:20.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was such an amazing thing to watch </v>

4584
03:45:20.371 --> 03:45:20.371
<v Speaker 2>a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4585
03:45:20.371 --> 03:45:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Should we wrap this up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4586
03:45:22.240 --> 03:45:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We obviously we've left</v>

4587
03:45:24.350 --> 03:45:26.050
<v Speaker 1>flat on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still alive.</v>

4588
03:45:26.060 --> 03:45:27.380
<v Speaker 1>We did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's disputed.</v>

4589
03:45:27.740 --> 03:45:32.740
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one thing that we came to a </v>

4590
03:45:32.740 --> 03:45:35.641
<v Speaker 1>really solid conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as a standard american diet sucks </v>

4591
03:45:35.641 --> 03:45:39.630
<v Speaker 1>and any deviation from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole food based diet and </v>

4592
03:45:39.630 --> 03:45:43.770
<v Speaker 1>especially with proper nutrients that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are supplemented if you're vegan or what</v>

4593
03:45:43.781 --> 03:45:48.781
<v Speaker 1>have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be better than standard </v>

4594
03:45:48.781 --> 03:45:51.001
<v Speaker 1>american diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dispute is whether or not the </v>

4595
03:45:51.001 --> 03:45:51.490
<v Speaker 1>nutrient dense organ meats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shellfish,</v>

4596
03:45:51.520 --> 03:45:53.110
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

4597
03:45:53.410 --> 03:45:58.410
<v Speaker 1>and these things would eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That these would benefit you </v>

4598
03:45:58.410 --> 03:46:01.201
<v Speaker 1>significantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's how we got through </v>

4599
03:46:01.241 --> 03:46:02.340
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like very peacefully,</v>

4600
03:46:02.360 --> 03:46:02.790
<v Speaker 1>just just</v>

4601
03:46:03.100 --> 03:46:04.600
<v Speaker 2>eat real food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real food.</v>

4602
03:46:04.690 --> 03:46:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I actually refer people in san francisco</v>
<v Speaker 2>to chris.</v>

4603
03:46:07.301 --> 03:46:12.301
<v Speaker 2>I honor what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we may have this dispute about </v>

4604
03:46:12.301 --> 03:46:12.670
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat and cholesterol and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not unimportant,</v>

4605
03:46:12.671 --> 03:46:16.240
<v Speaker 2>but he is a prime practitioner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's treating people at the right level.</v>

4606
03:46:16.241 --> 03:46:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I believe I'm doing that in detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people that come to see me,</v>

4607
03:46:19.040 --> 03:46:20.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the solution.</v>

4608
03:46:20.141 --> 03:46:22.270
<v Speaker 2>We're not the problem despite the </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

4609
03:46:22.271 --> 03:46:23.980
<v Speaker 2>And you're a good man to bring us on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4610
03:46:24.040 --> 03:46:24.720
<v Speaker 2>point all that out.</v>

4611
03:46:24.970 --> 03:46:27.310
<v Speaker 1>both handled yourself admirably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>

4612
03:46:27.320 --> 03:46:31.720
<v Speaker 1>this is a very emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly contested sort of a dispute.</v>

4613
03:46:31.721 --> 03:46:36.721
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thank you both very much for being </v>

4614
03:46:36.721 --> 03:46:36.721
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

4615
03:46:36.721 --> 03:46:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Well thanks for the opportunity to joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the have the chance to do this </v>

4616
03:46:39.330 --> 03:46:41.980
<v Speaker 2>for what almost four hours now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

4617
03:46:42.010 --> 03:46:47.010
<v Speaker 2>And it serves people because on most tv </v>
<v Speaker 2>segments it's like five minutes and you </v>

4618
03:46:47.010 --> 03:46:48.010
<v Speaker 2>just get the headlines and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>depth.</v>

4619
03:46:48.011 --> 03:46:50.930
<v Speaker 2>So you get these click bait articles and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's confusing.</v>

4620
03:46:51.100 --> 03:46:54.220
<v Speaker 2>So thanks for giving us the chance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really dive deeply on it.</v>
