1
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.090
Why.
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.290
this episode of the podcast is brought to you by audible.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.620
Audible is the Internet's leading provider of digital audio entertainment as far

4
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:23.160
as audio books,
um,
radio broadcast lectures,

5
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:27.180
comedy specials.
Basically they have no peer.

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.670
There is no one like audible,
audible rules.
Uh,

7
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.580
it is my favorite place to download audio books.

8
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.420
They have over 150,000 titles.

9
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.750
So essentially you could probably do it until the day you die if you really

10
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:46.210
thought about it.
Like,
how many books do you read in your life?
Do you really,

11
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.830
do you think you read a higher 50,000 bucks?
Probably not,

12
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.910
but you could have 150,000 books read to you and it's much less effort and you

13
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:56.640
can help people you read when you're not really reading.
You know what I mean?

14
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.970
It's like you can read while doing other shit.

15
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.030
And that's the cool thing about audio books.
If you're commuting,

16
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:03.990
if you're on a plane,

17
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.030
I have stopped in my driveway and listened to a book for like an extra 15,

18
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:10.890
20 minutes.
Um,

19
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.790
why I don't make the best decisions in this life,

20
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.290
but I enjoy it.
I really enjoy audible too.
If you go to audible.com,

21
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:23.370
forward slash jail,
you can get a free audio book and you can get a month,

22
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:27.420
a free month of audible service.
It is really an excellent,

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.620
excellent resource when it comes to audio books.
Um,

24
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.160
if I could recommend one to you,
hmm,
what's it going to recommend,
Jamie?

25
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.660
A Burt Chrysler's life of the party.
Pretty good.
What a great suggestion.

26
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.440
Read by Bert and uh,

27
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:46.680
the audio books by the way are crushing the,

28
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.210
the reading books because much like Burt,
his fans do not reach it.

29
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.620
But again,
you can get all the information.
It's exactly as if you read it.
Uh,

30
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.500
so go there,

31
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.740
pick up the life of the party by our pal Bert Kreischer and enjoy the 150,000

32
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:06.600
plus other titles at audible.

33
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.620
A fantastic resource for people who enjoy audio books.

34
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:13.140
That's audible.com forward slash Joe four,

35
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:18.141
your free audio book and 33 days of all audible service.

36
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.290
Like I did that.
Oh,
audible service.

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.660
We're also brought to you by ting.
Ting is one.
My favorite is,
um,

38
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.960
not just one of my favorite podcast sponsors,
but it's also,
um,

39
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.810
the official podcast phone,
the phone,

40
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.680
the phone that we use for the podcasts,

41
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:42.090
we're booking guests and stuff is a Tang phone.
Why?
Because it's first of all,

42
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.020
if you're economically inclined,
if you think about saving money,

43
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.310
there's no better place than tank.
98% of people.
I'll say that again.

44
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.730
98% of people would save money with tank.
Why didn't have to say it again?

45
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.980
Say it again.
I sound like a Douche.
Like when people say that,

46
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:58.470
like the beginning of comedy clubs,
they do this thing where they go,

47
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:01.060
all right everybody,
you ready for the show?
And then people clapped.
They go,

48
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.280
that's not good enough.
I need here.
Oh,
come on you fuckhead I hated,
it's gross.

49
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.720
So foul should be abandoned and should be outlawed.

50
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.050
But there I said it anyway.
A lot of fucking people.

51
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.150
How about that would save money with Tang including you?

52
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:20.680
21 bucks is the average monthly bill with Tang.
What is Ting?
First of all,

53
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.480
ting is they use the sprint backbone.
So it is just like having a spawn,

54
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.530
a phone on sprint,

55
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.000
a major network and instead of doing it anyone else's way,

56
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:34.600
when you rent time on a backbone and you can kind of do it your own way and

57
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.950
their own way is the best way to look at it.
It's like it's very ethical.

58
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.680
It's very,
it's a very good deal.

59
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:46.480
What they do is they provide you with excellent service but they cut out all the

60
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:50.580
bullshit,
no early termination fees,
no contracts,
uh,

61
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.570
you pay for what you use,

62
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:56.080
which I believe is the future of cell phone service.

63
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.810
Now the way it is with most people,

64
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:03.090
if you are with a major network or a major carrier or other,
um,

65
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.310
you pay for x amount of minutes per month and if you go under that,

66
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.640
you don't get any money back.
And if you go over that,
they charge you,

67
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.870
you get charged,
you get penalized with Ting,

68
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.220
you pay for what you use.
If you use less,
you pay less.

69
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:19.090
If you use more,

70
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:23.680
you pay more and Ting on their second year anniversary for no reason other than

71
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:27.130
the fact that they could give people a better deal slash their prices.

72
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.840
He can Google it.
You could read the articles.
I will.
I'll spare you the details,

73
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.310
but I just love the way they do business and I've heard zero complaints from any

74
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:39.880
of my friends that use Tang.
I have zero complaints about tink personally.

75
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.910
I think they're excellent and if you go to rogan.tang.com you can save $25 off

76
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:50.500
of one of their outstanding and droid devices.
They even sell iPhone fives.

77
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:53.580
They have the iPhone five that you can get an iPhone four okay,
safe.

78
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.620
You're frugal.
You got an iPhone four for 95 bucks folks,

79
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.970
and if you pay 95 bucks,
it's yours.
That's the other thing I like.

80
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.750
I do not like when you buy a phone and Save,
let's,
you know,

81
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:05.950
we don't need the name of provider,

82
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:10.390
but say the phone cost to 99 it doesn't really cost to 99 it probably costs 600

83
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:14.980
bucks,
but it says to 99 and you pay two 99 initially,

84
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.000
but then every month you're paying a little bit of that phone off so that if you

85
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:22.210
try to cancel and try to leave,
that's where the termination fees come from.

86
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.440
That's where he cancellation fees.
It's very tricky.
It's,
you know,

87
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:29.800
it's like you're mortgaging a phone.
Fuck all that nonsense.

88
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.980
You can get a Samsung galaxy s four,
four,

89
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:35.740
$425 how about that?

90
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.310
You can get the HTC one m eight which is an outstanding phone,

91
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.900
600 bucks and it's yours.
The uh,
Samsung Galaxy s five,

92
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:48.520
the newest and greatest 597 bucks.
But when you pay that 597 bucks,

93
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.480
that's it.
It's yours now.
You could do whatever the fuck you want with it.
You,

94
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.560
it's yours.
Okay.
You don't have to pay anymore.
You don't have to pay any less.

95
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.440
rogan.ting.com save yourself 25 bucks.
It's an awesome service.

96
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.230
We're also brought to you by on it.

97
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.480
This is the last commercial o n n I t on it is a human optimization website.

98
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.060
What we sell it on,
it is essentially all things that I use.

99
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.230
I have found over the course of my life and athletics and martial arts,

100
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.260
I have found a bunch of things that have been shown through science,

101
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.670
through,
um,

102
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.050
through people that are a strength and conditioning experts that recommend it.

103
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.610
What are you doing over there,
Jamie?
He just jumped up,
panicked,

104
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.700
thought some shit was on fire.
Um,
through science,

105
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:36.140
through strength and conditioning experts,

106
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.320
things that have been shown to improve physical condition,

107
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.590
things that have been shown to improve cognitive function,

108
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.370
which is a very controversial aspect.
I mean,

109
00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:47.600
he's like saying something's gonna improve cognitive function.

110
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.510
Meaning if you're one of the dumber people listening,

111
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.520
that means you make your brain work better.
Uh,

112
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.900
that sounds like it's gonna make your Dick Bigger,
right?

113
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.250
This is where it's wrong.
Have you ever had a day where you're like,

114
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.320
I feel like shit today.
I'm stupid,

115
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:03.500
my fucking brains not working and I can't remember what I wear when I'm supposed

116
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:04.220
to do.

117
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.600
There's days that you just don't feel right and then there's days where you feel

118
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:12.860
fantastic.
I believe,
and it's not just me,

119
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.760
it's been proven through science and studies that there's a bunch of different

120
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:21.470
factors involved in cognitive function.
Here's a big one.
Sleep.

121
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.700
Sleep's a huge one.

122
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.120
I mean it's mega like eight hours of sleep a night will will change the way your

123
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:31.700
body functions.
If you can get eight hours sleep at night,

124
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.910
your body will have the ability to recover that.
It just is not going to get,

125
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:38.690
if you're doing four and three and five and four and three,

126
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:42.200
it's just like you're breaking your body down.
So sleep number one,
nutrition,

127
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:45.320
huge,
gigantic,
absolutely.

128
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.470
Give your brain the ability to recover,

129
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:52.040
give your body to the ability to recover and it's going to function better.

130
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.280
Give it the nutrients it deserves and it's going to work better.

131
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.540
And some of those nutrients directly aid cognitive function.

132
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.790
And we have with Alpha brain taken the ones that we have shown or that have been

133
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:06.920
shown through clinical trials,

134
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:11.510
through anecdotal evidence that have been backed up by clinical trials,

135
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.400
years and years,
thousands of years for some of them have of use of human use.

136
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.720
And they have shown that there are some certain elements,

137
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.500
some certain elements of nutrition that you can take that actually improve your

138
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:27.680
memory,
that actually improve the,
the word,
the way your brain works.

139
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.460
And if you're skeptical,
you should be a,

140
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:36.250
if you go to onnit.com click on the Alpha brain link and then click on the rep,

141
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.100
the research page.
It'll show you all the different tests with sources,

142
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:43.760
with references that have been done on each of the individual ingredients.

143
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.870
And then it'll also show you the Alpha Blaine Alpha.
Blame.
This,

144
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:50.340
we need Alpha brain clinical trial.

145
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.680
Obviously I haven't taken any today on the Alpha brain clinical trial research

146
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:57.360
results.
Um,
we have done one test so far.

147
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.110
A double blind placebo controlled test showed positive results.

148
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.680
We're also doing a much larger one now.
The first one was called a pilot test.

149
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.770
You do it with 20 people,
I think three or four dropped out,

150
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:12.090
so it wound up being 16 people.
Uh,
but excellent results.
Um,

151
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.350
especially with when it comes to memory,
memory is a big one.
It's a,

152
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.130
it's one of the things like when you were,
when you're reaching for information,

153
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:22.890
when you're reaching,
when you trying to um,
formulate sentences,

154
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.910
that's where I feel that Alpha brain really benefits me.
The benefit,

155
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:30.060
it makes it easier for me to formulate sentences and it makes me easier for me

156
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:32.970
to know what the fuck I'm talking about when I'm saying things.
Uh,

157
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.140
if you're skeptical,
you should be,
um,

158
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.110
that's one of the reasons why we have the research page.

159
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:40.950
It's also one of the reasons why on and has a 100% money back guarantee on the

Alright,

173
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.960
<v 0>Isaac Haxton Aka [inaudible].
We're going to go with Ike.</v>

174
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.510
Is that your writing is good?
Is that what your friends call you?
Yeah,

175
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.160
I want to be your friend.
All right,
let's go with,
let's go with,
um,

176
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.440
one of the things.
Um,
you,
you are a big time poker player,

177
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.850
travel all over the world.
Um,
and uh,

178
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.850
there's a lot of people on my message spore that are big poker fans and uh,

179
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.380
very excited to have you on the podcast.
One of the things they,

180
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.300
they asked me to differentiate because I bring this up all the time,
um,

181
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.590
that a lot of poker players are gamblers and a lot of poker players are kind of

182
00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:01.520
degenerate gamblers,

183
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:06.740
but poker is not really a gambling thing.

184
00:11:06.741 --> 00:11:11.741
It's more of a game of intelligence and a game of information and a game of

185
00:11:13.161 --> 00:11:13.990
strategy.

186
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.250
<v 2>Is that true?
Yeah,</v>

187
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:20.310
well it's gambling in the sense that on any given day you win or lose money if

188
00:11:22.361 --> 00:11:24.760
you're playing for high stakes when they lose a bunch of money.

189
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.120
But it's not gambling in the sense that it's outside of your control.

190
00:11:32.351 --> 00:11:35.740
It's not like going to the roulette wheel and saying,

191
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.180
I'm in a red sort of mood,
let's bet on red and see what happens.

192
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.170
So it's gambling in the sense that there's money at stake.

193
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.200
It's not gambling in the sense that you are submitting yourself to chance and

194
00:11:50.081 --> 00:11:51.130
just seeing what happens.

195
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.090
<v 0>How did you get involved with,
well first of all,
your,
what are you,
28 years old,</v>

196
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.950
28 years old and you are a world traveling poker player.
I mean,

197
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:03.430
that is first of all.
Awesome.
I love it.
Congratulations.

198
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:08.380
I'm sure congratulations on really being able to craft that kind of a life

199
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:11.740
because I think that's excellent.
It's really cool.
Um,

200
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:16.330
so how did you get started and how did you make this leap to becoming this,

201
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.700
you know,
internationally known professional?

202
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.651
<v 2>Well,</v>

203
00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:24.300
I've been sort of an obsessed game player my entire life.

204
00:12:24.301 --> 00:12:26.940
I started playing chess when I was four.

205
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:30.660
I started playing pretty seriously in tournaments when I was like six,

206
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.000
played chess pretty seriously from six to maybe 13 or so.

207
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.820
I was never really great at chess.

208
00:12:38.821 --> 00:12:42.780
Like probably my greatest accomplishment as a chess player is eighth place in

209
00:12:42.781 --> 00:12:45.970
the New York state,
third grade and under tournament.
Um,

210
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.260
but,
uh,
so I played chess seriously for a while around 13.

211
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.940
I reached this point in my chess career where it got really boring where I was

212
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.240
just really solidly the second best player in the county.

213
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.630
And every time I'd go to a chess tournament,
I knew it was going to happen.

214
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.010
I was going to beat all these kids.

215
00:13:05.011 --> 00:13:08.460
I was a lot better than I was going to play this dude nick in the final and I

216
00:13:08.461 --> 00:13:12.180
was going to lose.
Why would nick beat you?
It was better than me.

217
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.780
He's studied harder and he had a sharper chess mind than me.
Um,

218
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.040
something that I never really got past in chess was that

219
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.470
<v 3>okay,</v>

220
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.850
<v 2>it's really easy to make one small mistake and end the game and poker is a</v>

221
00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:33.320
little more forgiving of slight oversights.
Like in chess

222
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.850
you think through a move,
it looks pretty good,

223
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.480
you make the move and then right after you made the move,

224
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.780
Oh fuck bishop takes Knight Knight lose and poker is not quite the same.

225
00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:52.450
In poker you make a comparable blunder and you bet the river and you think this

226
00:13:54.381 --> 00:13:55.340
is a pretty good bet,

227
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.600
you're going to beat a bit more than half the hands to call you and then you

228
00:13:59.601 --> 00:14:01.100
think,
oh shit.

229
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.180
Actually he can also have played King Jack of spades this way.

230
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.840
This was a slightly bad bet rather than a slightly good bet and it doesn't end

231
00:14:11.271 --> 00:14:14.990
your tournament to have made a slightly wrong play in chat.

232
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.790
In poker the same way it doesn't chess.

233
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:21.290
So I think my brain is set up better to be an extremely good poker player than

234
00:14:21.291 --> 00:14:23.150
in an extremely good chess player.

235
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.940
<v 0>Would it be,
uh,</v>

236
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:30.050
an irrelevant analogy to say that playing poker is like more of a,

237
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:35.870
a game where you restart every time?
Yeah.

238
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.570
Whereas Chaz is like a sword fight.
Like you,

239
00:14:39.571 --> 00:14:43.640
you get one chance to not get stabbed.
If you get your arm cut off,

240
00:14:43.641 --> 00:14:46.990
you're going to die.
Yeah.
That,
that is actually a pretty good analogy.
You,

241
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.620
so when you play poker,
um,
are you the of guy,

242
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:56.650
like when you like read a person and you have an idea that you have a big

243
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:01.580
advantage,
will you then take a big chance?

244
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.030
Will you then gamble or you are,
are you a conservative,

245
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.620
calculated sort of a guy?

246
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.913
<v 2>MMM.</v>

247
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.390
<v 0>You don't want to give up your hand,
doesn't want to tell people how he thinks.</v>

248
00:15:15.391 --> 00:15:17.220
I see what he's doing.
He's like,
I see what you're doing.

249
00:15:17.221 --> 00:15:19.830
You playing chess right now he's going back and forth.

250
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.480
I should maybe shut the fuck up,
man.

251
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.510
<v 2>No,
I,
I'd say I'm more in the former category.
I mean,</v>

252
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.270
so you're more of a gambler guy.

253
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:35.630
In poker you have to make the best of the edges that you're given.

254
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:38.483
You

255
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:44.670
aren't presented with constant unlimited opportunities to get an advantage.

256
00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:48.790
So when you are presented with one yet you have to,

257
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.690
<v 0>so there's a certain amount of courage that's involved in playing the game of</v>

258
00:15:52.691 --> 00:15:56.350
poker as it's not something that you chip away at necessarily.

259
00:15:56.351 --> 00:15:59.290
It's something that when the opportunity presents itself and you believe that

260
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:00.830
you have it,
do you have like a,

261
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.720
a green light that goes off in your head or do you have an instinct that you

262
00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:05.800
sort of rely on?

263
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.790
<v 2>Um,
in,</v>

264
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.580
in terms of like the risk management part of what you're talking about?

265
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.820
A lot of that is actually outside of the process of making decisions within a

266
00:16:19.801 --> 00:16:24.240
hand.
So like
in terms of risk management,

267
00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:28.320
a lot of that is like managing the stakes you play relative to how much money

268
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.130
you have.

269
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:34.130
So if I'm playing a cash game and it's a game where you buy in for $5,000

270
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:42.330
that's a game where losing one hand for the maximum amount isn't going to ruin

271
00:16:44.501 --> 00:16:48.850
my life,
isn't going to have a big impact on anything.

272
00:16:48.851 --> 00:16:51.010
So in that context,

273
00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:56.011
I can go ahead and risk of the full $5,000 that's in front of me on a half a

274
00:16:57.461 --> 00:17:02.050
percent edge because that's how you make money playing poker.

275
00:17:02.051 --> 00:17:06.700
You identify an edge and you
exploit it.

276
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.310
So in terms of like courage and risk management,

277
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:16.240
the risk management thing comes in before you're actually playing a hand.

278
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.850
And then in the course of playing a hand,

279
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.650
you have already made decisions that put you in a position to be comfortable

280
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.110
taking the maximum amount of risk that

281
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.850
you could be confronted with after that point is what I'm saying.
Making sense?

282
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.090
<v 0>Yes,
totally makes sense.</v>

283
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.720
So you're more inclined to take a big chance if you're betting a small amount of

284
00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:40.090
money.
That's what you're saying for the small amount of money going in.

285
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.270
Now when you go,
what is the,

286
00:17:42.271 --> 00:17:45.580
like the biggest buy in that you've ever had to play?

287
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:50.990
<v 2>Uh,
for a tournament it would be a dollar buy in.
Oh,</v>

288
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.960
Jesus.
Little weasel.
Wow.

289
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.460
<v 0>So,
um,
when you do that,
um,
I see you're sponsored by pokerstars.</v>

290
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:04.230
Dot Net.
Um,
does pokerstars pay for a portion of that?

291
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.780
Did they give you a piece of the action?
How's that work?

292
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.420
<v 2>Are pokerstars does not,
but what I,</v>

293
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.010
well part of my contract with poker stars does involve getting a certain amount

294
00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:21.011
of money per year that is earmarked toward buying into poker tournaments.

295
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:27.070
But they're not like explicitly staking me in the poker tournaments.

296
00:18:27.891 --> 00:18:31.840
It's just Mike compensation for,
right.
So you're setting,

297
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.420
<v 0>so your compensation is essentially up to your management discretion.
Yeah.</v>

298
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.140
<v 2>So when I play something like a million dollar buy in poker tournament,</v>

299
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:44.170
what I do is I take on investors who are typically other professional poker

300
00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:48.170
players and they buy shares of me in the tournament.

301
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.100
They put up a fraction of the buy in and if I win,

302
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.270
they get a fraction of the winnings.

303
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.710
<v 0>Oh,
that's fascinating.
So,
uh,
you guys kind of back each other.
Yeah.
Hmm.</v>

304
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.410
So you,
if you go into a poker tournament and there's maybe 20 guys,

305
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.640
it's conceivable that you and the guy you're playing against in the finals have

306
00:19:07.641 --> 00:19:10.190
a piece of each other.
Yeah.
That happens somewhat off.

307
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:15.410
That's a big thing in the world of pool.
But Pool,
they do it in billiards,

308
00:19:15.411 --> 00:19:19.970
professional pool because they don't make as much money and so they,
they,
they,

309
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.960
you know,
they kind of like a make a saver.
That's what we call it.

310
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.890
So like say if you and I worked to play in the finals and it was a major pool

311
00:19:27.891 --> 00:19:32.480
tournament,
I,
it depends on the agreement,
but we might make a 50,
50 or 60,

312
00:19:32.481 --> 00:19:37.010
40 split.
So we would play our best,
but you would know that no matter what,

313
00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:40.730
worst case scenario,
even if you lost,
you were going to get 40% of the purse.

314
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.030
<v 2>Right.
The same thing also happens in poker tournaments.</v>

315
00:19:44.031 --> 00:19:47.210
In addition to what I was describing where people sell action before the

316
00:19:47.211 --> 00:19:48.290
tournament starts,

317
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.970
there are also often deals made toward the end of the tournament.

318
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.620
So I was recently playing a tournament in Las Vegas and when we got down to

319
00:19:57.621 --> 00:19:58.850
three players left,

320
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.260
it was me and two other guys who I think are also really strong poker players

321
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:08.180
and we agreed that rather than play it out,

322
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.600
we are going to just divide up the remaining prize money according to how many

323
00:20:14.031 --> 00:20:18.620
chips each of us have and called today.
Wow.

324
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.620
<v 0>Does that bother people,
does that,
is there an ethical quandary involved in that</v>

325
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:26.423
<v 2>there?</v>

326
00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:31.650
I would say there's a vocal minority of people who are bothered by that and that

327
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.080
most people are not bothered by it at all.

328
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.650
That's something you see happen everywhere from the very highest stakes

329
00:20:37.651 --> 00:20:42.651
tournaments in the world to a weekly $20 tournament that at some point people

330
00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:48.160
will agree to a chop.
It can be a partial chop where they just take out

331
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.680
<v 4>some of the money,
like the saver sorta thing you were talking about.</v>

332
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.820
Or it can be a complete drop where they just split up the prize pool and call it

333
00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:55.150
a day,

334
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.150
<v 0>but the vocal minority,
what is their argument like?
What did they say?</v>

335
00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.920
They say you guys are ruining it.

336
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:03.340
This is like poker supposed to be about gambling and chance,

337
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:05.110
and that's where the excitement comes in and

338
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.350
<v 4>that,
or it's supposed to be a pure competition.</v>

339
00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:12.370
It's not supposed to be about this deal making,
supposed to be,
you go in,

340
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:15.820
you compete the best or luckiest player wins.

341
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.650
And that's the guy who gets all the money.

342
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.060
<v 0>Now the vocal minority,</v>

343
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:23.170
are they the spectators or are they the actual players themselves?

344
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.390
Are they the commentators?
Are they the,

345
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:31.650
<v 4>it's the spectators and the media then people who are actually in there playing</v>

346
00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:33.640
on a day to day basis.

347
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.540
<v 0>Same thing with billiards.
Yeah.
That's interesting.</v>

348
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.900
So the spectators feel like it's not as exciting for them?
Is that the idea?

349
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:42.990
Hmm.

350
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.350
So will they want to see one guy win 1 million bucks and one guy went dog shit.

351
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:51.240
Yeah.
And I mean,
that's understandable,
right?
Like I guess,
yeah,

352
00:21:51.241 --> 00:21:54.800
I guess,
yeah.
I don't know man.
I mean,
uh,

353
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.190
I think I'm too close to stuff like this to see it objectively because I'm

354
00:21:59.191 --> 00:22:02.880
friends with so many pool players and because,
um,
I don't,
you know,

355
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.350
I think people should be compensated.
I,

356
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.910
I hate the idea of a winner take all thing.
Right.
You know,

357
00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:12.510
because like if to like there was a big pool tournament called the tournament of

358
00:22:12.511 --> 00:22:16.860
champions and every year the winter gets a a good for pool.

359
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.240
I think it's like 50 grand.

360
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.950
It's not much for poker but everybody else gets dark shit,
you know,
so.

361
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.910
So of course people they chop it up.
Yeah,
they definitely chop it up.

362
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.630
So the people that are the,
the commentators and the spectators like,
um,

363
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.750
you say the vocal minority,

364
00:22:33.751 --> 00:22:36.810
is it only small percentage of the commentators and spectators?

365
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.150
<v 4>It's hard to tell cause it's the people who don't have jacked on saying anything</v>

366
00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:44.450
about it.
Right.
But I would guess it's only a small percentage

367
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.330
<v 0>now.
There's no rules against it though.
Right.</v>

368
00:22:47.331 --> 00:22:49.370
It's not like something you guys have to do on the sneak tip.

369
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.680
<v 4>There are some tournament venues that won't enforce the chop,</v>

370
00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.490
which means I'm at the majority of tournament venues.

371
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.130
You say to the tournament director,

372
00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:07.810
we've agreed to this chop pay each of us this amount of money at a minority of

373
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:11.170
venues.
You can't do that.
You say that the tournament directors has,

374
00:23:11.171 --> 00:23:14.190
I don't want to hear it.
You have to play the tournament out and then you do it.

375
00:23:14.191 --> 00:23:18.010
You're and then you have to do it on your own and then you have to trust the

376
00:23:18.011 --> 00:23:23.011
other people at the final table to honor the agreement and turn around and hand

377
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:25.440
you the cash right after the turn.

378
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.590
<v 0>Has Anybody ever not honor that agreement?</v>

379
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.150
<v 4>Very rare.
Very rare.
I can't think of,</v>

380
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.690
I can't think of a circumstance where it was like a handshake deal chop at the

381
00:23:35.691 --> 00:23:38.590
final table and then somebody just didn't pay.
I couldn't.

382
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.120
That would be a disastrous thing there.
That person,

383
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.200
there've been a handful of cases where somebody has made backing deal and then

384
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.870
refuse to pat their backer.
Whoa.

385
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.840
There was a really high profile one with the guy who won the world series of

386
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:56.870
poker main event several years ago on Jamie gold.

387
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:02.410
Got Taken to court by a guy who claimed to have a backing arrangement with him

388
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:07.400
and had like voicemails saying,
yeah,

389
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:10.400
I'm giving you this amount of money for 50% of your winnings,

390
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.800
and then after the fact Jamie gold,
like,
nope.
Why did he say that?

391
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:20.000
I don't know.
He was a pretty weird guy.
He was still,
no,

392
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:20.834
it still is.

393
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.450
He's a pretty weird guy who I have considerably less exposure to lately because

394
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.350
he has more or less moved on from the poker world.

395
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.370
<v 0>W Well,
Jesus Christ,
he won the world series of poker,</v>

396
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.110
<v 4>won the world series of poker main event,</v>

397
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.000
had a big dispute with a guy who claimed to be entitled to a big share of his

398
00:24:40.001 --> 00:24:42.910
winnings and then just faded out of poker because of that,

399
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:48.580
not because of that all lost back a lot of what he'd won playing in tournaments

400
00:24:48.581 --> 00:24:50.340
and cash games and

401
00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.810
<v 0>just decided,
fuck this game.
Pretty much.
Yeah.
How do you get to,</v>

402
00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:00.280
I just would imagine that if you've got so good that you win the world series of

403
00:25:00.281 --> 00:25:04.470
poker,
that's like a very profitable way to

404
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.710
<v 3>okay.</v>

405
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.070
<v 4>To spend your time.
Well,</v>

406
00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:12.071
I think that's the thing is that not everyone who wins the world series of poker

407
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:17.390
main event is an excellent poker player.
It's one way.
It's one tournament with,

408
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.253
uh,

409
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.580
on the order of 6,000 players and the best player in the tournament is maybe 10

410
00:25:26.361 --> 00:25:28.670
times as likely to win it as the worst player in the tournament,

411
00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:29.504
but it's one tournament.

412
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:35.460
<v 0>So it's possible that a middling tournament player can win the world series of</v>

413
00:25:35.461 --> 00:25:39.060
poker happens all the time.
Wow.
I never knew that.
Oh yeah.

414
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.590
That's crazy.
See that never happens in pool.
No.

415
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.780
Yeah.
You're not going to beat like Earl Strickland in the finals if you suck.

416
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.190
That's so crazy.

417
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.220
<v 4>And that's why you can play poker for high stakes and it's pretty hard to find a</v>

418
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.660
high stakes pool again without some careful handicapping.

419
00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.830
<v 0>Yeah.
Wow.
I never knew that.
That's fascinating.</v>

420
00:26:00.831 --> 00:26:04.340
I always felt like the guy who won was the best guy or there's like a handful of

421
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:08.720
best guys and they swap positions and it's about who's focusing more.

422
00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:10.520
<v 4>No,
I mean</v>

423
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.600
this year a guy made the world series of poker final table for two years in a

424
00:26:17.601 --> 00:26:21.170
row.
That hasn't happened in about 10 years.

425
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.780
<v 0>Ah,
that's interesting.
I need to pay attention more than this poker shit.
Um,</v>

426
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.390
now what about gambling in Vegas?
Did they put a line on who's going to win?

427
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.270
<v 4>Uh,
yeah,
you can.</v>

428
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:36.170
You can make bets on the outcome of the tournament,
but

429
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:37.630
<v 3>okay.</v>

430
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:38.470
<v 4>They only,</v>

431
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.890
whereas for like a football,

432
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.250
if

433
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.083
<v 3>the</v>

434
00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.120
<v 4>giants are playing the falcons,</v>

435
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:55.110
you can that the money wine and you can get two to one on the giants if they're

436
00:26:57.221 --> 00:27:02.221
the underdog or lay two to one and take the Falcons for poker tournaments.

437
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.390
The bookmakers are not that confident that they know the right prices and they

438
00:27:07.391 --> 00:27:11.200
only put up one side.
If you want to bet on one guy to win the tournament,

439
00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.180
they'll give you a price,

440
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.870
but it's a really bad price and you're going to lose making that bet and you

441
00:27:16.871 --> 00:27:18.220
can't take the other side.

442
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:19.710
<v 5>Ah,
okay.</v>

443
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.030
<v 4>Betting on the outcome of poker tournaments is a pretty small market.
Okay.</v>

444
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.740
<v 5>Yeah,
because the,
that's another thing they tried with pool,
but um,</v>

445
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.290
they took the one time they did it in Vegas,

446
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:35.010
there's this big tournament and this one guy,
Mike,
Lebron is an excellent player,

447
00:27:35.011 --> 00:27:37.220
but it was like the 40 to 100 dog.

448
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.470
So they all dumped to Michael O'Brien and they all put that on Mike,

449
00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:44.830
Lebron and Mike.
Lebron won to winning the whole tournament.
And then the,

450
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.300
you know,
of course Vegas is like,
all right,
you fucking shortsighted assholes.

451
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.360
We're done.
Right.
You know,
all the 40 to one guy,

452
00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:54.180
one and everybody's missing balls they should never fucking miss.

453
00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:55.380
And it was just so ugly.

454
00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.780
<v 4>Yeah.
That,
I mean,
that's kind of attentional issue.</v>

455
00:27:59.781 --> 00:28:04.550
Anytime you're betting on the outcome of a sporting event that it could be
fixed,

456
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.840
<v 5>especially a sporting event with the players.
Don't make so much money.</v>

457
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.510
<v 4>That's the thing is when you get to the small market stuff like pool or the</v>

458
00:28:11.511 --> 00:28:14.990
players aren't making a lot and you can bet more on the outcome of the

459
00:28:14.991 --> 00:28:17.000
tournament and the tournament itself,
it's worth,

460
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.310
that's obviously creating a bad situation.

461
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.250
<v 5>World series of poker comes along and uh,</v>

462
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.440
Vegas puts up a line I could bet on you to win the whole thing.
Yeah.

463
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.820
But that's basically it.

464
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:31.440
I couldn't bet on you against individual players and individual games or

465
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.873
<v 4>um,</v>

466
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:38.150
maybe some of the smaller online bookmakers you could get some prop bet saw

467
00:28:38.151 --> 00:28:42.570
unlike who'll be in the tournament longer,
me or Phil Ivey,
that type of thing.

468
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.680
Right.
But

469
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.470
<v 3>yeah,</v>

470
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.470
<v 4>betting on the outcome of poker tournaments real small.</v>

471
00:28:48.471 --> 00:28:50.360
Like if you wanted to bet,
they'd probably let you bet.

472
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:51.980
Maybe a couple hundred dollars.

473
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.210
<v 5>No,
a lot of these poker players,
oh,
you won't,</v>

474
00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:57.720
you couldn't buy like 50 grand or something.
Right now,

475
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.970
a lot of these poker players are like serious crazy gamblers.

476
00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.430
They'll gamble on golf and they don't even play golf.

477
00:29:03.431 --> 00:29:07.140
Like they'll do shit like that.
Like $1 million on a game of golf.
Who,

478
00:29:07.141 --> 00:29:09.640
who's like the nuttiest when it comes to that stuff?

479
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.280
<v 4>MMM.</v>

480
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.843
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

481
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.200
<v 4>that's a good question.
Phil.
Ivey does.
A lot of that comes to mind,</v>

482
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:23.230
but the thing with him is he's a real sharp guy when it comes to bedding on

483
00:29:24.411 --> 00:29:29.270
stuff.
He is
not as crazy as he'd want you to think.

484
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:33.440
Um,
like with golf for example,

485
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.800
he started playing higher and higher stakes golf with people and was losing

486
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.080
everybody's like Phil's.
We all got to gamble

487
00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.390
<v 2>on golf with Phil Who's dumping,
he wasn't dumping,
he was legitimately bad.</v>

488
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:51.810
But then what he did was he went and got coached by tiger woods' coach and got

489
00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:58.741
really fucking good and came back and played for huge stakes against a couple of

490
00:30:00.161 --> 00:30:04.810
guys and smashed them midway through the round.
They're like,

491
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.800
this is bullshit.
What's going on?
When did Phil get good?

492
00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:15.300
<v 0>So how did he do it on the sneak tip?
Did he put like a mask on and fucking,</v>

493
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.910
I mean,
everybody knows what Phil Ivey looks like.

494
00:30:17.911 --> 00:30:19.770
If you're a pool player or poker player rather,

495
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.060
<v 2>what would he need to be sneaky about?
Like where he practiced?
Oh yeah.</v>

496
00:30:24.061 --> 00:30:29.061
I mean I guess he like took a vacation to Hawaii or something.

497
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.740
Wouldn't it take more than like one vacation must be a really sharp dude month

498
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.850
long every day.

499
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.390
<v 0>Yeah.
And then came back and kick some,</v>

500
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.630
see I don't do the golf thing is so bizarre to me.

501
00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:46.340
I would think there's so many variables involved in golf that like the courses

502
00:30:46.341 --> 00:30:50.930
themselves are variable,
the wind is variable.
There's,

503
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.960
there's so much going on like figuring out where the ball lies and then trying

504
00:30:56.451 --> 00:31:00.400
to figure out the roles of the hill and all that jazz and trying to get,
I mean,

505
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.000
<v 2>yeah,
it seems pretty damn complicated.
I haven't played really long time.
But</v>

506
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.200
<v 0>yeah,
the mechanics of it seem very difficult to learn and I understand like the</v>

507
00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:11.690
coaching could help that.
But even just the variables,

508
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.550
like when a guy like tiger woods was just dominating everybody,

509
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.880
like winning like crazy.
It just,

510
00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.270
I defied my imagination because I was always like,

511
00:31:20.271 --> 00:31:24.560
how could this one guy figure out this weird game?

512
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.060
Like where there's so many variables,
so much better than everybody else.

513
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:32.780
Like what could it possibly be?
Yeah.
Is it feels it touch?
Is it,

514
00:31:32.781 --> 00:31:33.201
you know,

515
00:31:33.201 --> 00:31:37.430
like what is it that's allowing him to see the roles and the of the hills and

516
00:31:37.431 --> 00:31:39.560
then how does it all go away with one divorce?

517
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.300
<v 2>That's the really crazy part.
That's the craziest of the crazy,</v>

518
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:48.990
I read this study that I'm on hedge fund managers that by far the most

519
00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:56.260
predictive variable of the performance of a hedge fund is whether or not the

520
00:31:56.261 --> 00:31:59.110
manager is currently going through a divorce.
Oh yeah.

521
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:03.180
<v 0>Cause then your life just goes into a turmoil.
Yeah.
Hmm.</v>

522
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:08.510
Or if your wife's or can't you get out of that divorce and you just fucking free

523
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.270
thoughts are clear.
It really just depends.
Right.

524
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.240
It depends on whether or not it's a good divorce.
Whether you're not,
you want it.

525
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:20.340
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
even if you want it,
I bet it's still a pretty big disruption.</v>

526
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:25.390
<v 0>Depends,
man.
Yeah.
I've seen both sides.
I've seen horrible,</v>

527
00:32:25.391 --> 00:32:27.520
horrible divorces where you know,

528
00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:30.520
the guy's just destroyed and usually it's financial.

529
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:35.650
The financial stress of of divorce is really for,

530
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.130
for a person who's never been through it or never seen someone go it,
it's,

531
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:45.050
<v 5>it's like you're being attacked by aliens that you can't see and they're</v>

532
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:49.670
stealing money from you.
And just like every second of every day,

533
00:32:49.671 --> 00:32:53.480
thousands of dollars are leaving your bank account and you're watching yourself

534
00:32:53.481 --> 00:32:57.290
go broke.
You watching years of your life,
all the work you've put in.

535
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.080
I had a good friend that,
I've talked about it on the podcast before,

536
00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:03.710
but not only did he get divorced,

537
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:08.690
but his wife calculated and planned it where she went to every good defense

538
00:33:08.691 --> 00:33:13.691
attorney or every good divorce attorney in town and consulted with them before

539
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:20.600
she decided to pick one so that when the husband found out that she was

540
00:33:20.601 --> 00:33:21.434
divorcing him,

541
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.950
he couldn't get a good attorney because they had already talked to her.

542
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.550
So some sort of a conflict of interest,
that's pretty diabolical.

543
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.850
She's his diabolical as it gets.
Not only did she do that,

544
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:34.070
but because they were together for so long,

545
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:39.170
he had to pay for her attorney because she didn't work and he has to pay her for

546
00:33:39.171 --> 00:33:41.180
essentially the rest of her life because they were,

547
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:44.600
they were married from one than 12 years.
California has some wacky laws,

548
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:49.370
so the only way it will be different is if she remarries,

549
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.120
which of course she never would because you know,
she's,
she would lose her,

550
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.860
her sweet paycheck that she gets her mind.

551
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:59.980
I watched this guy like age 10 years into,

552
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:00.801
in two years,

553
00:34:00.801 --> 00:34:04.460
he probably aged 10 and just was pulling his fucking hair out and going crazy

554
00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:08.120
and it was never over.
I was like,
are you out yet?
Is it over yet?
It's like,
no,
no,

555
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:11.200
no,
no.
She's renegotiating,
she's changing the term.
She's doing it.

556
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.300
And she was doing it because he had to pay for her lawyer as well.

557
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.270
So she just dragged it out as long as possible.

558
00:34:17.271 --> 00:34:21.770
She dragged it out for almost two years.
Is Poor guy got destroyed.

559
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.570
So for him.
Yeah,
I would fucking w I wouldn't bet on him playing golf.

560
00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.090
That guy will be fucking knocking balls into the tree tops and screaming and

561
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:37.060
attacking birds.
It,
his clubs.
Uh,
it's,
it's devastating for people.
They do.

562
00:34:37.061 --> 00:34:40.610
You mean when you know,
and women want to know why,
why guys don't get divorced?

563
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.190
Maybe they know somebody like that,
you know,
or tiger woods.
Yeah.

564
00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:50.870
Poor bastard.
Not really though.
Right?
He's still fine.
Yeah.
I think he'll make it.

565
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.590
Yeah.
He'll make it.
He's just a,
he's not tiger woods anymore,
right?
Yeah.

566
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:59.540
Like how many,
how many golf tournaments as he won since the,
uh,

567
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.463
since the divorce.

568
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:04.360
<v 4>Oh,
really?
Follow Golf.
But I don't think it's money.
Why?
It's weird.</v>

569
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:07.840
Do you follow Jamie?
Yeah,
he's won a few.
Yeah.

570
00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.860
He recently coming back from an injury.
Right now.
Everybody this,

571
00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.130
I just saw something the other day.
He,

572
00:35:12.131 --> 00:35:16.360
they say he's got about 10 years left in his career to catch Jack Nicholson.

573
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:21.370
How do you get an injury playing golf
back?
I mean,

574
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.170
there's a lot of torque in that swing.

575
00:35:23.171 --> 00:35:27.190
I can sit down at your back fucking pussies.
Jesus Christ.

576
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.000
You're playing golf.
I would surely get injured.

577
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.400
I just hit myself with the club.
Well that's,
if you knew what you're doing,

578
00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:37.234
I bet you would.

579
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.610
<v 5>So you're 28 years old.
How long have you been a professional poker player?</v>

580
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:47.150
I've been playing seriously and making money at it about 10 years.
Uh,

581
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.130
filing taxes as a professional gambler since I was 18.

582
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:55.530
I was in school and only sort of playing part time for the first few of those

583
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.990
years.
So six to 10 years depending how you count.

584
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.590
So you're doing it through college.
Yeah.

585
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.490
And at one point in time when you were in college and you were in the middle of

586
00:36:02.491 --> 00:36:05.490
some stupid course that you didn't really give a fuck about,
where you like,

587
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:08.310
you know what,
I think I could be a gun damn professional poker player.

588
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.470
Definitely.
That's what it was.

589
00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:15.100
<v 2>Second semester of my junior year,
um,
poker was going great.</v>

590
00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:20.050
School was not.
Um,
I was studying computer science,

591
00:36:20.051 --> 00:36:24.250
which at one point I was pretty good at.
I thought,

592
00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:25.750
this is the thing for me.

593
00:36:25.751 --> 00:36:28.810
I'm going to get my undergrad degree in computer science.

594
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:31.390
I'm going to go to Grad school,

595
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:35.830
do some more computer science and become a professor or working research,

596
00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:40.360
something like that.
I thought that was my career.
Um,
second semester,

597
00:36:40.361 --> 00:36:41.230
my junior year,

598
00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.430
this thing started happening to me where I'd go to the computer lab and sit down

599
00:36:45.431 --> 00:36:49.390
to do a project and an hour would go by and I just still be staring at a blank

600
00:36:49.391 --> 00:36:54.130
screen.
I just hit a wall.
I couldn't do it anymore.
Wow.

601
00:36:54.131 --> 00:36:57.670
What was that?
I don't know exactly.
Um,
I,

602
00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:03.210
I think it was some subconscious part of my brain realizing ahead of the more

603
00:37:06.341 --> 00:37:10.930
conscious and willful part that this was not what I wanted to do long term.

604
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.660
<v 5>That's fascinating.
So you had a passion for it at one point in time,</v>

605
00:37:14.661 --> 00:37:18.440
or at least an interest in it.
Yeah.
And was it just that the,
the passion,

606
00:37:18.441 --> 00:37:20.900
the interest for poker sort of overcame it?

607
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.540
That it became an option?
That it became like,
I think that was

608
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.380
<v 2>probably only a small part of it.</v>

609
00:37:27.381 --> 00:37:32.381
I think that even if I hadn't found poker and decided to make a career of that,

610
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.290
that I would have made myself get through Undergrad,

611
00:37:36.291 --> 00:37:41.291
computer science and somewhere around Grad school or early into a career doing

612
00:37:42.531 --> 00:37:45.200
that,
I would have realized it wasn't doing it for me.

613
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.690
<v 5>Yeah.
That's something that some kids do when they're young and there's,</v>

614
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.990
they're starting to try to pick a career.
They,

615
00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:55.660
they look at something that they think they can do and then once they start

616
00:37:55.661 --> 00:37:59.350
doing it,
they go,
this is not what I want to do though.
Oh Shit.
You're 18,

617
00:37:59.351 --> 00:38:02.530
you get to school and they tell you pick a major.
Yeah.
How crazy is that?

618
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.420
<v 2>And like I took an econ class,
a math class,</v>

619
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.770
a computer science class,
and a cognitive science class.

620
00:38:10.771 --> 00:38:15.600
My first semester of college I was like,
I really don't like the math class.

621
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.580
The econs kind of boring.

622
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.300
I don't really think there's a career for me and cognitive science.

623
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:22.680
I guess I'm a computer scientist now,

624
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.940
<v 5>but it's not what you were drawn to.</v>

625
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.460
<v 2>I mean,
I liked it.
I thought it was interesting.
Um,</v>

626
00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:32.080
some of the classes more than others.

627
00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:36.100
I liked the theory and math side of it than I liked

628
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.310
<v 0>spending 12 hours in the computer lab banging out code.</v>

629
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:43.990
Isn't it so weird that we expect kids at 18 years of age to be able to pick

630
00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:47.520
their future to be able to pick a direction for their future?
Yeah.

631
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.540
It's just so bizarre.
I just,

632
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:54.160
I can't imagine going through that again.
You know,
for me,

633
00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:54.994
I um,

634
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:59.530
I took a year off when I got out of high school and then I went to Umass Boston

635
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.260
for three years,
but I completely half assed it.

636
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.890
Like I just was doing it cause I didn't want to be a loser so it was good.

637
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:11.860
I was going to school with no idea whatsoever how I was ever going to fit into

638
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.960
any traditional work environment.

639
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:18.230
And all the while I had a sort of a career because I was teaching martial arts

640
00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:20.790
and I was teaching it at a high level,

641
00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:23.650
is teaching it in Boston University and I had my own school and everything like

642
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:28.330
that,
but I was still going to school and I was like,
what the fuck am I doing?

643
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.880
But at least I had like some things that I was interested in,

644
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:35.020
but I had friends that were going to school and they're like,
well,

645
00:39:35.021 --> 00:39:38.380
I'm going to be an electrical engineer.
I'm like,
is that what you want to do?

646
00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.880
You know?
I Dunno.
I'm okay.
That's it's good money.
You can make good money.

647
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:47.350
I'm like,
okay,
well want to get a job?
Yeah.
But that life is a weird life,
man.

648
00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:49.510
That's the life that the majority of people do.

649
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:54.250
The majority of people do this life where they start doing something because

650
00:39:54.251 --> 00:39:58.450
it's a job that they can do.
Fuck man,
that's a,

651
00:39:58.451 --> 00:40:03.070
that's terrifying to me.
Sad,
scary thought for a guy like you.

652
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.800
So that's why when I hear about a guy like you,
I go,
yes.
Like,

653
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.730
I love when my guy,
yes,
I fucking love when I meet a,
uh,

654
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.650
another comedian I love when I meet a guy who makes a living as a musician.

655
00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.330
I love when I meet a writer,
you know,

656
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:20.110
I have lovely people that have figured out a way to stay out of that fucking

657
00:40:20.111 --> 00:40:25.060
trap,
that weird trap of just doing something because you can do it.

658
00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:25.481
And you know,

659
00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:28.630
and people who are doing something cause they can do it and they're listening to

660
00:40:28.631 --> 00:40:33.220
this,
don't they?
I'm not criticizing you.
I easily could have been you easily.

661
00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.390
You know,
it's not,
no one's better than you.
I'm just celebrating you.

662
00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.110
You like that you,
you did it,
you figured it out.

663
00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.430
There's a lot of luck involved.
So fuck on in different ways.
There's a luck,

664
00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.260
a lot of luck involved in being American.

665
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.550
It's a lot of luck involved and having good,
you know,

666
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:54.190
motor skills that you can walk and you don't have a disease and you know,

667
00:40:54.191 --> 00:40:56.980
you don't have a fucking cancer.
Your eyes work,
you know,

668
00:40:56.981 --> 00:40:58.960
there's a lot of luck involved in a lot of different things.

669
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:03.520
So no doubt about it.
And there's definitely a lot of luck in finding a path,

670
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:08.650
picking a path,
and then figuring out that this is something you can actually do.

671
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.970
And that's when the courage and then the determination come in once there was an

672
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:15.610
opening to just run,
run through that door.

673
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.870
So when you were 18 and you started making money doing poker and then you

674
00:41:19.871 --> 00:41:22.060
realize that like school was kind of whack,

675
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.830
what did your parents think about that?
Well,
the way that played out was,

676
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:32.110
like I said,
second semester,
my junior year,
I failed most of my classes

677
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:34.100
after like

678
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.450
<v 2>straight A's for five semesters.
Um,
suspect drugs.</v>

679
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:40.580
<v 4>Hm.</v>

680
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.560
<v 2>No,
I,
I don't think that was,</v>

681
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.730
<v 5>that's what I was expecting.
I'll give you a little piss test tomorrow.</v>

682
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:50.770
You Fuck you doing all that college tuition and those cup,

683
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.380
what did they think?
Um,

684
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:56.303
<v 4>you're bored.</v>

685
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:59.390
<v 2>Yeah,
board.
Uh,</v>

686
00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.300
<v 3>okay.</v>

687
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.540
<v 2>I think that they were a little skeptical of the computer science thing all</v>

688
00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:05.374
along that

689
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.940
I just seemed just sort of pick something out of a hat and go for it.

690
00:42:09.941 --> 00:42:12.520
And it was not a huge surprise to them

691
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:17.360
<v 4>that I was getting sick of it.
And then</v>

692
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:22.830
<v 2>by coincidence are over the following summer,</v>

693
00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:28.700
some legal rumbling started in Washington that maybe it's time to crack down on

694
00:42:30.961 --> 00:42:31.920
online gambling.

695
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:37.640
And a bill called the unlawful Internet gambling enforcement act got passed,

696
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:43.770
um,
or was due to get past that fall.

697
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:48.740
And
I started thinking,
shit,

698
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.940
online poker might be going away.
I got to get all the money while I can.

699
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:57.320
And I called up the school,
this was like late August.

700
00:42:57.321 --> 00:43:02.300
I'm like about to go back to school.
I called up the university and said,

701
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.630
uh,
I made me want to take next year off.

702
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:11.330
What happens if I do?
Is there any penalty?
Can I come back the following year?

703
00:43:11.331 --> 00:43:13.950
No issue.
And they said,
yeah,
it's fine.
Uh,

704
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.910
you've got like one more week to let us know.
I said,
okay,

705
00:43:16.911 --> 00:43:20.060
I'll call you back in a bit.
I call it my parents.
I was like,

706
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.330
I'm pretty sure I want to take the year off and just play poker full.

707
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:25.970
<v 5>Wow.
And what did they say?</v>

708
00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.620
<v 2>And they said,
why?</v>

709
00:43:28.621 --> 00:43:33.621
And I explained the Uid a thing and the

710
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:35.710
<v 3>okay.</v>

711
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:39.730
<v 2>Getting sick of computer science thing and my mom said,</v>

712
00:43:39.731 --> 00:43:43.240
how much money do you think you can make if you take a year off and play poker

713
00:43:43.241 --> 00:43:47.020
full time?
It's like a,
my goal would be about a million dollars.

714
00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:52.770
<v 5>Whoa.
And she said,
that sounds good.
I think you should do that.
Yeah,</v>

715
00:43:52.771 --> 00:43:54.900
you got to go high.
You can't get it.

716
00:43:54.901 --> 00:43:58.260
I hope to make about 30 grand the first year.
But yeah,

717
00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.480
1 million bucks is a good call.

718
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:05.310
People like hearing that their kid made 1 million bucks.
Yeah,
go for it son.

719
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.390
And you were only 18,
right?
Yeah,

720
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:11.820
<v 2>no,
I was um,
about 21.
21.
Yeah,</v>

721
00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:13.440
I'd been doing it for three years already.

722
00:44:13.441 --> 00:44:15.990
I've made a few hundred thousand bucks already by that point.

723
00:44:15.991 --> 00:44:18.740
It wasn't out of thin air.
Yes.

724
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:22.590
It was like I'm going to be playing these stakes this many hours a week.

725
00:44:22.591 --> 00:44:26.850
I beat these games for this much.
It was like a realistic target for me.

726
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.250
<v 5>Wow.
Now,</v>

727
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:31.940
what is the difference between a successful online poker player and a non

728
00:44:31.941 --> 00:44:32.490
successful

729
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:36.990
<v 0>when it was legal?
Because obviously now it's a big fucking mess,
right?</v>

730
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:41.250
You can't,
you could legally gamble if you are a resident of Nevada online.

731
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:42.084
Isn't that the case?

732
00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:47.820
<v 4>The legal situation in the US and worldwide is pretty complicated.</v>

733
00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.900
Um,
the really weird thing is that

734
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:59.190
no laws actually changed how the government felt like enforcing them changed

735
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:04.140
when the law was talking about the You iga past.
I didn't know this at the time.

736
00:45:04.141 --> 00:45:06.060
I was making a decision to take the year off,

737
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:11.420
but the final language of the bill says nothing about what unlawful Internet

738
00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:15.750
gambling is.
It assumes that something that

739
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:22.300
somebody else already knows and provides for enforcement against the banking and

740
00:45:22.311 --> 00:45:26.090
credit card transactions that facilitate illegal online gambling.

741
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:31.270
It's in no way clear what illegal online gambling in the u s is what they're,

742
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.560
they're gone so crazy.
There's,

743
00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:38.980
there are no federal laws about online gambling other than this anti illegal

744
00:45:39.951 --> 00:45:41.570
online gambling enforcement act.

745
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:47.470
Online gambling is treated as illegal by

746
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:54.400
the Department of Justice on the basis of a law from the 60s called the wire act

747
00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.070
that says you can't play sports bets over telegram.

748
00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:00.913
And they're like,

749
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:05.470
<v 0>yeah,
fucking telegram,
telegram.
Oh my God.</v>

750
00:46:05.471 --> 00:46:09.220
How about smoke signals?
Is that legal still?
Jesus Christ.
And they're like,

751
00:46:09.221 --> 00:46:13.840
that's basically like playing poker on the Internet.
Wow.
That is so crazy.

752
00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:18.070
So they decided that that's playing poker on the Internet.
Yeah.
Wow.

753
00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:22.090
Gambling on sports through a telegraph that is,

754
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:23.860
that's so loopy.
Yeah.

755
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:26.830
And what was this like sponsored by the casinos or something like that?

756
00:46:26.831 --> 00:46:31.300
Is that how it got weasel through the wire act or the UAE?
You Egg Ga,

757
00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:35.080
the them cracking down on it had to be right.
Yeah,

758
00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.720
<v 4>probably.
It's hard to tell.
Um,</v>

759
00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:42.880
the casino lobby is really fucking powerful in America.
Oh yeah.

760
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.210
A lot of goddamn money involved.
A lot of money involved.

761
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.920
Donate a lot of money to both political parties.
Um,
yeah.

762
00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.370
And,
and then of course that you can see these as well.

763
00:46:56.371 --> 00:47:00.490
Right?
The unions,
I'm sure as well.
Uh,
yeah,

764
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:05.810
the,
it's like for instance there are,

765
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.370
I don't actually know what Union represents casino workers,
but um,

766
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:14.810
I think it's one of the bigger like food service sorta ones and is a big deal.

767
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:15.161
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

768
00:47:15.161 --> 00:47:19.660
I would imagine that they would do it just to shore to strengthen their position

769
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:24.690
as job holders because like the the you have c has a big issue with the culinary

770
00:47:25.631 --> 00:47:26.464
union.
Yeah.

771
00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:29.980
<v 4>I think that's who has a lot of the casino jobs as</v>

772
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.390
<v 0>well.
I'm not sure.
I'm sure.</v>

773
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:34.330
Well that's what they're trying to do is the reason why the UFC has an issue

774
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:38.440
with the culinary unions because the zoo for the company that owns UFC also own

775
00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:39.400
station casinos.

776
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:44.490
So there's this huge push to try to get them to turn their casinos into union

777
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:49.210
casinos.
So they're keeping the UFC out of New York that way.

778
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:52.180
Like paying off politicians.
It's fascinating.

779
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:56.740
It's fascinating because it's so old school and so transparent like the

780
00:47:56.741 --> 00:47:59.730
corruption.
So I mean New York state like the,

781
00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.400
the actual people themselves would benefit tremendously if they allowed mixed

782
00:48:03.401 --> 00:48:07.290
martial arts.
Sure.
They also have boxing already there,
which is more dangerous.

783
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:11.080
They mean it's all proven and they still,
for whatever reason,

784
00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:13.960
have been able to bribe these politicians transparently.

785
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.830
All that shit is just a power struggle over the money it seems like.

786
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.060
So they just try to keep online.
Yeah.

787
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:25.120
<v 2>Poker,
online gambling,
it was the same thing.
The online or the uh,
casino lobby,</v>

788
00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:30.170
the u s has gone through a few stages in what they think about online gambling.

789
00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.910
At first they just ignored it.
Didn't give a shit.
That's not a real thing.

790
00:48:35.911 --> 00:48:38.490
Nobody's going to gamble on the Internet.
Who Cares?

791
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.810
And then around about 2005,

792
00:48:42.811 --> 00:48:47.460
2006 they started saying,
oh no,
this is,
this is unethical.

793
00:48:47.461 --> 00:48:49.860
We can't let people gamble from their homes.

794
00:48:49.861 --> 00:48:53.790
They need to drive to their local casino and gamble.
That's where we make money

795
00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:55.170
<v 0>and that's where we serve liquor.</v>

796
00:48:55.171 --> 00:48:57.360
So we can be sure that they're fucked up when they're growing.

797
00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:02.890
<v 2>And think of the children,
if you're playing online,
it could be anybody,</v>

798
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.320
which of course is wrong in both directions.

799
00:49:08.321 --> 00:49:12.280
For one thing.
People Gamble under age and casinos all at the time for the other,

800
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:16.090
the identity verification stuff for online gambling,

801
00:49:16.091 --> 00:49:20.530
it's probably stricter than for live gambling anyhow.

802
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:23.700
<v 0>That's a pretty interesting is it?
I didn't know that.</v>

803
00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.350
So like what are you like what's the online thing?
Like what do you use?

804
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:31.140
You have to show a photo of your credit card.
Your driver's license

805
00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.340
<v 2>varies from site to site and ramps up if there was more money involved.</v>

806
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:39.080
<v 0>And how would they go to you and not just someone who has the information.</v>

807
00:49:39.081 --> 00:49:40.240
Like if you were a 16 year old kid,

808
00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:43.100
you grab your dad's information and just start entering it in,

809
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.310
you need more than a credit card.
What do you mean?

810
00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.770
<v 2>Uh,
it,
it depends on the site,
but like</v>

811
00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.440
copy of photo id,
utility bill,

812
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.600
you might need to answer a phone call on a landline associated with the address

813
00:49:59.601 --> 00:50:00.434
you claim.

814
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.990
<v 0>Why I cause not the one who's making this gamble.
It's me.
My name's George.</v>

815
00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.430
I'm 50 bass in my voice on and yeah,

816
00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:17.360
obviously you can get around anything.
I'm making a online,

817
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:21.060
I mean making a phone call.
That seems like so fucking old school.
Yeah,

818
00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:28.310
that's such a weird way to verify,
isn't it?
I mean it's

819
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:32.960
<v 2>one layer of a whole bunch of different shit that they do too.</v>

820
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.210
If it's on a land line,

821
00:50:36.211 --> 00:50:39.710
it demonstrates that you are physically in the place place you're claiming to
be.

822
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:42.200
Okay.
That makes sense.
I guess,

823
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:45.080
but just it seems like anybody could just be on the phone unless you're

824
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:49.730
facetiming.
Yeah,
I mean it,
that's why it's only one aspect of it.

825
00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.860
<v 0>Then you just have to hire a makeup artists looking he up like your dad,</v>

826
00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.220
I'm dead.
But that Internet gambling thing though that did,

827
00:51:00.221 --> 00:51:02.170
it was a big crackdown because I remember it.

828
00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:06.040
I remember at one point in time you used to be able to gamble on sports online.

829
00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:09.940
Guys used to be able to used to play poker for money online.

830
00:51:09.941 --> 00:51:14.650
It was really common.
And there was even some websites that were,
uh,
there was a,

831
00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:19.150
I'm sure they're still around Bodog they still around.

832
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:23.880
<v 2>Bulldog in the u s has become Valda.
And</v>

833
00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:30.720
what does Bo Vada Bova is the entity that they spun off of the main Bodog

834
00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:40.650
corporate entities because operating online gambling in the u s is so risky that

835
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:44.223
uh,

836
00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:48.970
they have basically set up their corporate fall guy of Bova,

837
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000
which is what gets fucked when inevitably continuing to take bets from the u s

838
00:51:55.511 --> 00:51:56.620
eventually goes poorly.

839
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:57.960
<v 0>Oh,
I see.
So they're,</v>

840
00:51:57.961 --> 00:52:02.490
they're just kind of like setting up a straw house to blow down when the shit

841
00:52:02.491 --> 00:52:02.731
gets,

842
00:52:02.731 --> 00:52:06.540
but there meanwhile taking money out of Straw house and putting it in this big

843
00:52:06.541 --> 00:52:08.340
stone mansion somewhere that's under a different,

844
00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:13.190
<v 2>and yet Bodog I,
I shouldn't say any of this to confidently,</v>

845
00:52:13.191 --> 00:52:14.810
I haven't been paying close attention to it,

846
00:52:14.811 --> 00:52:17.120
but I think [inaudible] on the podcast every day,

847
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:24.220
I think Bodog is continuing to operate around the world as Bodog and his bow

848
00:52:24.951 --> 00:52:28.640
Vata only for its US facing operations.

849
00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:32.590
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
That makes sense.
That Calvin,
I or guy,
he,</v>

850
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.380
he can't even come into the America and to North America.

851
00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.760
<v 2>Yeah.
The are a bunch of people in the online gambling industry.
That's up.
Fuck.</v>

852
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.790
They just live in Costa Rica.
Now or something.
Yeah.

853
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:48.150
<v 0>It's so crazy.
It's so weird that that's what gets you locked up.</v>

854
00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:52.380
And what is it that they're saying they're not paying taxes?
Like what is the,

855
00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.150
why would they not want revenue?
So he doesn't make any sense to me.

856
00:52:57.151 --> 00:53:01.530
If people were willing to gamble and then they will pay taxes on those gambling

857
00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.390
debts or gambling profits or whatever it was,
or even losses.
Um,

858
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:11.220
it seems like,
you know,
if the company wins money or if the person wants money,

859
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:15.330
taxes are going to be paid.
Like it seems like that should be pretty easy to,

860
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.781
<v 2>well,</v>

861
00:53:15.781 --> 00:53:19.890
so to go back to what I was saying about the stages that the casino lobby has

862
00:53:19.891 --> 00:53:24.240
gone through in their attitude online gambling around 2005,
2006,

863
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:26.310
they decided this is bad.

864
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:31.290
<v 4>We need to shut it down.
It's competing money.
They fought.</v>

865
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:33.850
They were,
they weren't,
they weren't that,

866
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:38.520
I mean this is my opinion here.
Um,
I,

867
00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:43.760
I think that casinos saw online gambling as competition when it wasn't that,

868
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.573
um,

869
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.930
online gambling and casino gambling or not the same product.
I don't

870
00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:59.060
if I'm the type of person who either likes to go play blackjack at my local

871
00:53:59.061 --> 00:54:01.910
casino or likes to play slots on the Internet,

872
00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:05.930
I don't play less black jacket,
my casino,

873
00:54:05.931 --> 00:54:07.870
because I could play slots on the Internet.
They're,

874
00:54:07.871 --> 00:54:11.270
they're not the same experience.
Right.
You don't get the same things out of them.

875
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:13.820
Um,
if anything,

876
00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:20.080
the availability of online gambling was feeding casinos,

877
00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:25.370
new customers because people would play a little online and say,

878
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:28.550
this seems fun.
I kind of understand this now.

879
00:54:28.551 --> 00:54:30.630
Maybe I'll give gambling at the casino would try it.
Yeah.

880
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.473
That's how I would look.

881
00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:36.140
Especially with respect to poker as opposed to other sorts of gambling going

882
00:54:36.141 --> 00:54:38.330
into a casino to play poker,
having never done it before,

883
00:54:38.331 --> 00:54:39.410
it's a little bit intimidating.

884
00:54:39.411 --> 00:54:44.411
You don't really know how it works and you're surrounded by people who do and

885
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:51.470
the ability to get a little experience playing online in the lower pressure

886
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.033
environment,

887
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.040
I think introduces people to the game who then go on to play in life.

888
00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:01.690
<v 0>Well,
no.
When you go to a lot of casino,</v>

889
00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:06.700
how many people are like me that don't know how to play poker at all?

890
00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:08.230
But they're still trying to play poker.
I like to,

891
00:55:08.231 --> 00:55:10.990
people get liquored up and just wandering in the poker room.
Go there.

892
00:55:10.991 --> 00:55:12.670
It's fucking give this shot

893
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:19.190
<v 4>every once in a while and more at lower stakes than at higher stakes obviously.</v>

894
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.360
Obviously.
Uh,

895
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:26.300
at high stakes it's pretty rare to see somebody who has never really played

896
00:55:27.301 --> 00:55:28.020
poker before.

897
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:30.690
<v 0>But it happens,
it happens for sure.</v>

898
00:55:30.691 --> 00:55:33.180
Does that like when you see some fucking fish,

899
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:36.420
some big fish that comes in some way,
what do you call them?
Whales?

900
00:55:36.421 --> 00:55:39.930
Is that what you guys call them?
Fish.
Whales?
What's the common pool?

901
00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.000
Criminology in poker.

902
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:46.350
So they come in and a lot of money don't know what the fuck they're doing and

903
00:55:46.351 --> 00:55:48.460
everybody's slowly starts circling them.
Yup.

904
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:51.650
<v 4>There is a long wait list to play at the table that guys,</v>

905
00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:55.980
that if there's not a seat available,
he walks in,
he says,
I want to play.

906
00:55:55.981 --> 00:56:00.390
Everybody looks up,
that guy looks rich and we don't know him.
Uh,

907
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:03.270
this game can become 10 handed.
Now pull up a chair.

908
00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:08.530
<v 0>So when a guys,
when you don't know a guy,
so the world of poker essentially,</v>

909
00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:12.730
you know,
all the elite players.
Yeah.
There's no one who could sneak up on you.

910
00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:14.310
<v 4>Ah,</v>

911
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:18.550
I mean there are probably a few people there probably like a handful of guys who

912
00:56:18.551 --> 00:56:21.910
mostly play online,
turn off at a casino and

913
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:28.830
I wouldn't recognize him,
but they're among the best players in the world.
Wow.

914
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.380
But for the most part,
yeah,

915
00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:34.380
I recognize most of the top layers.

916
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:38.180
<v 5>My friend Ari Shaffir who's a standup comedian,
great guy,
funny,</v>

917
00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.580
hilarious motherfucker,
but very smart.
And uh,

918
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.820
when he was struggling as a standup comedian,

919
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:47.240
he's playing poker tournaments and you're just making more money playing in

920
00:56:47.241 --> 00:56:50.140
casinos playing poker than he was doing standup.
Yeah,

921
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:52.850
I've heard already talked about that before.
I mean,
he's making a living,

922
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:55.520
doing it,
doing poker.
And uh,

923
00:56:55.521 --> 00:56:58.510
I always found that incredibly fascinating that he was doing that,

924
00:56:58.511 --> 00:57:01.010
that it was just going from place to place and playing poker.
And he gets,

925
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:04.550
he said he could kind of tell you kind of tell them people knew what the fuck

926
00:57:04.551 --> 00:57:06.320
they were doing and where people would just assholes

927
00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:07.740
<v 4>instantly.
I mean,</v>

928
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.350
<v 5>but does anybody ever hustle like the way they do in pool there?</v>

929
00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:14.110
Pretend the sock and then they rope you in and yeah,

930
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.360
<v 4>some,
uh,</v>

931
00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:25.020
it's more common,
I'd say at the mid stakes then at the highest stakes,

932
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:27.630
just because the world is too small to get away with it much.

933
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:28.920
Right at the highest stakes.

934
00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:30.480
<v 5>Yeah,
the high,
the highest stakes.</v>

935
00:57:30.481 --> 00:57:32.850
How many guys are there in the world that are just elite?

936
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.680
<v 4>Dozens to hundreds depending on how you're counting it,
I guess.</v>

937
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:41.040
So hundreds maybe,
maybe.

938
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.800
<v 5>But out of those hundreds you're aware of all of them,
you think?
Pretty much.</v>

939
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:45.840
And if you're not

940
00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.000
<v 4>the overwhelming majority,
if I'm not,</v>

941
00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:51.960
it's because they're playing in games that don't have a lot of intersect with

942
00:57:51.961 --> 00:57:54.110
the games I'm playing in.
What,
like

943
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.690
<v 5>what about places like Macau or places like,
I mean,</v>

944
00:57:56.691 --> 00:57:58.220
that's obviously a huge gamble.

945
00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:03.390
<v 4>Miguel is really interesting.
Um,
I've played a couple of tournaments in Macau.</v>

946
00:58:03.391 --> 00:58:06.330
I've never played in a cash game in Macau.
Um,

947
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:12.900
do I have played in cash games with Macau guys a few times.

948
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:17.570
<v 5>The UFC did some uh,
shows in Macau and um,</v>

949
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:21.530
there's been some boxing out there and I think they're doing another UFC out

950
00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:26.030
there,
but they said that like,
it's just like Vegas Times a hundred.

951
00:58:26.031 --> 00:58:27.070
They said it's madness.

952
00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:30.500
Like the amount of gambling and the craziness and the majesty of it all.

953
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:33.290
It's real crazy.
Where is that exactly?

954
00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:37.110
<v 4>Ah,
it's right next to Hong Kong.
It's like a one hour ferry ride from Hong Kong.</v>

955
00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:41.400
And how long has this been around Macau?
Ahm,

956
00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:48.030
I want to say maybe 15 years,
maybe less.

957
00:58:48.031 --> 00:58:52.710
I go crazy.
I think it's gotten huge in less than the last 10.

958
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.180
How does something like that happen?

959
00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:58.230
How does something way bigger than Vegas just sprout out of China?

960
00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:03.320
China says you can gamble here and the millions of Chinese millionaires save.

961
00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:06.180
That sounds like a good idea.

962
00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:10.860
Let's go gamble here and then just a building and there it is.

963
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.220
What is it like like the,

964
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:16.920
as far as like the buildings and far as like the Bizarro Vegas.

965
00:59:16.921 --> 00:59:21.800
It's creepy.
I lived in Vegas for three years so I go there and

966
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:27.190
<v 2>oh that's the win and it looks exactly like the win only it's on exactly the</v>

967
00:59:27.771 --> 00:59:30.740
opposite side of the world and everyone's Chinese.

968
00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.170
<v 5>Wow.
So they call it the when the,</v>

969
00:59:34.171 --> 00:59:38.410
when the Venetian or they rip offs or is it the same people?

970
00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.920
Because you know how China does,
they do wacky shit like that.

971
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:46.050
They'll build like a fake Paris.
Like it's really strange how their,

972
00:59:46.051 --> 00:59:51.051
their laws are over there as far as what's fake Eiffel Tower in Shanghai or

973
00:59:51.201 --> 00:59:53.060
something like that.
And always they are fake guys.
It's hours.

974
00:59:53.061 --> 00:59:57.060
This is like fake entire towns like European villages,

975
00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.740
towns like down to the brick.
It look exactly like them.
There was this,

976
01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:05.880
this story that was on one of the major websites,
I forget what it was,

977
01:00:05.881 --> 01:00:07.950
where they deep,
I think it was vice actually,

978
01:00:07.951 --> 01:00:12.951
they detailed all these different towns that have been constructed in China that

979
01:00:13.381 --> 01:00:17.760
were exact replicas of famous like you know,
Swiss Alps towns.

980
01:00:17.761 --> 01:00:21.720
And stuff like that.
So really weird.
I'm trying to is fucking weird.
Oh yeah.

981
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.100
Are you just got back from China too?

982
01:00:23.101 --> 01:00:26.670
And he's just talking about how crazy it was there.
He told us about gutter oil.

983
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.570
Did you hear about,
you know,

984
01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.640
got her on her on the podcast that can't be real and yes,

985
01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:36.780
a lot of delicious food and Hong Kong I hope wasn't a delicious poop.

986
01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.630
Might not be as bad in Hong Kong is mainland,
but maybe,
I don't know.

987
01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:48.290
But so Macau has all the major players like the win and then the Venetian and

988
01:00:48.451 --> 01:00:49.230
all that jazz

989
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:52.500
<v 2>and uh,
a bunch of,
there's like a hard rock.</v>

990
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:54.930
That tournament I played there was at the hard rock Macau.

991
01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:59.940
<v 5>And does everyone speak English there?
No.
What about the hookers?</v>

992
01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:04.290
Speak English?
I didn't talk to any,
I bet.

993
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:06.070
I bet

994
01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:10.280
<v 2>there there's certainly a market for it.
Oh yeah.
You'll think,</v>

995
01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:14.590
I would guess that market forces for some hookers to speak English in Macau.

996
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.880
<v 5>Yeah.
Yeah.
My friend who went there said you couldn't get away from them.</v>

997
01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.060
They're just swarming you and they were like flies.

998
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:24.360
You said it was like mosquitoes in a hot summer day in the northeast.

999
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:29.260
It says crazy like how many,
how many hookers or where,
but it makes sense.
I mean,

1000
01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.160
a lot of people gambling a lot of money and lot of celebration.
A lot of victims,

1001
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:34.303
uh,
drunks.

1002
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.753
<v 2>Yup.</v>

1003
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:39.230
<v 5>I just can't believe that something like that can just explode out.</v>

1004
01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:43.590
Like I never even heard of Macau until maybe two or three years ago.

1005
01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:47.820
Like A,
I remember peripherally reading about it online,
something like that.

1006
01:01:47.821 --> 01:01:52.821
And then I heard about boxing matches being held there and basically didn't know

1007
01:01:53.191 --> 01:01:56.100
anything about it till poker took off there maybe four or five years ago.

1008
01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.300
So you're 18 years old,
you start playing poker,
you're 21 years old.

1009
01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:03.090
You tell your parents,
you know what,
fuck it.
I'm going to give it a go.
Yeah.

1010
01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:05.640
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna try to make $1 million in the first year.
How many,

1011
01:02:05.641 --> 01:02:07.530
how much did you actually want it making that first year?

1012
01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.570
<v 6>MMM,</v>

1013
01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.660
<v 2>1.6</v>

1014
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:20.160
God damn son.
Oh,
a couple months after I said that.

1015
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:25.310
I played in one of my first ever big live tournament and finished second for

1016
01:02:26.011 --> 01:02:28.560
like 850,000 so I got up at about head start.

1017
01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:33.250
<v 5>Wow.
Jesus Christ.
So everyone's happy at the,</v>

1018
01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:38.260
at the accident household?
Yes.
Yeah,
yeah.
They,
they were okay with my plan.

1019
01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:41.800
So then from there do you just go guns blazing and just,

1020
01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:46.650
I went back and I finished school.
I only had a year left,
so I am you went,

1021
01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.430
you want 1,000,006 and went back and I would have told school does suck my Dick.

1022
01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:56.050
I would call come up,
fuck you and fuck computers that,

1023
01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:56.913
that was

1024
01:02:57.090 --> 01:03:01.980
<v 2>80% what I did.
I went back and I decided to get a degree in philosophy.</v>

1025
01:03:01.981 --> 01:03:06.981
I figured out that there was a particular track within the philosophy department

1026
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:11.010
called a philosophy of science and logic that I could count some of the classes

1027
01:03:11.011 --> 01:03:16.011
I had already done toward and it was like five bullshit classes away from a

1028
01:03:16.111 --> 01:03:18.990
degree in philosophy.
I was like,
all right,
I can do that.

1029
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.720
I'll get my college degree before.

1030
01:03:21.721 --> 01:03:26.320
I have to be the creepy old guy who's back on campus in 10 years when pokers

1031
01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:27.750
done,
I'll be happy.
I have yeah.

1032
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.730
<v 5>Degree.
Why did you think you were going to have you?
We're planning on failing.</v>

1033
01:03:31.731 --> 01:03:34.220
You thought it was possible that it could all go away?

1034
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:38.340
<v 2>I thought it was possible.
It could all go away.
I thought it was possible.</v>

1035
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.230
It could get too hard.

1036
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:44.310
I thought that maybe I'm really good relative to my competition now,

1037
01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:47.610
but who knows about in 10 years.
Hmm.
You know,

1038
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.180
it's like competing in a sport at some point.

1039
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:56.130
You're older than the other people.
You're not as sharp as them.

1040
01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:59.340
They're hungrier than you are and you can't keep up.

1041
01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.450
<v 5>Do you,
were we talked about in the,
um,
the ads,
uh,</v>

1042
01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:05.000
I was talking about Alpha brain,

1043
01:04:05.001 --> 01:04:08.300
but there's a bunch of cognitive enhancing things that people take.

1044
01:04:08.301 --> 01:04:12.410
I know some folks take Adderall and some folks take a,
uh,

1045
01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.260
new Virginia or pro vigil,
um,

1046
01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:18.890
like these different cognitive enhancing smart drugs.

1047
01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.750
Do you guys fuck with those things?
Poker players in general?
Absolutely.

1048
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:25.580
Like what,
what is like the most common stuff?

1049
01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:29.570
<v 2>I mean caffeine is the number one.</v>

1050
01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.260
There are waitresses walking around and serving coffee at poker tournaments.

1051
01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.160
Yeah.
And Booze to lose if you want it.

1052
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:40.900
<v 5>How many guys get liquored up by their plan?
It seems like a bad move,
right</v>

1053
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:44.850
<v 2>ad hoc.
In terms of like high level competition,</v>

1054
01:04:44.851 --> 01:04:48.120
the biggest tournament's essentially nobody,
uh,

1055
01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:52.320
cash games in a casino on any given night.
It's reasonably common.

1056
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:56.770
<v 5>Right.
So,
um,
what,
what do most guys take besides a,</v>

1057
01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:00.740
<v 2>there are plenty of people who take Adderall or Ritalin.
Ritalin,</v>

1058
01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:03.280
it's a speed to right.
Yeah.

1059
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:08.310
It's another one of the Anti Adhd sorta things.
Um,

1060
01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.380
pro vigil is not unheard of.

1061
01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:17.060
I fucked with that a little bit in college for studying and that I just didn't

1062
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.190
like it very much.

1063
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.710
<v 0>I want to send you some Alpha brain,
say if you liked it.</v>

1064
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:24.640
A bunch of my friends use Alpha brain.
Yeah,
that's a good one.

1065
01:05:24.641 --> 01:05:28.060
Another good one is,
um,
there's a stuff called neuro one.

1066
01:05:28.061 --> 01:05:31.510
Have you ever heard of neuro one?
Um,
I've heard you talk about it before.

1067
01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:34.360
It's Bill Roman ASCII stuff.
Right?
It's really good as well.

1068
01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:37.480
There's a bunch of companies that are selling these cognitive enhancing formulas

1069
01:05:37.481 --> 01:05:40.540
now and especially now that Alpha brain has become really popular.

1070
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:44.800
It's become super popular to sell these blends cause it's all these like

1071
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.890
different things like per acid,
Tim and Coleen,

1072
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:50.530
there's all these different things that had been shown to have positive effects

1073
01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:51.720
on cognitive function.

1074
01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:56.810
<v 2>A friend of mine in a tournament a couple months ago gave me something called</v>

1075
01:05:56.811 --> 01:06:00.890
Smart Caffeine,
which is just caffeine and Elfie Janine.
Ah.

1076
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:04.820
And I thought that was awesome.
I've been taking some Elfie in Ian recently.

1077
01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.310
<v 0>Hmm.
Do you press to him?
You ever mess with that stuff?
Haven't,</v>

1078
01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.790
I've heard good things.
A few of my friends use it well are good.

1079
01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.610
One of my closest friends in poker is JC Alverado who no know he's on my
website.

1080
01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.670
Yeah,
met him much time.
Cool guy.
Yeah,
he's an awesome guy.

1081
01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:20.810
Great things to say about you.

1082
01:06:20.811 --> 01:06:25.190
He said that you were probably the best heads up player one on one player in the

1083
01:06:25.191 --> 01:06:28.490
world.
When you think about that Fella.

1084
01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:29.970
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1085
01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:33.540
<v 2>there are definitely in the running.
I mean,</v>

1086
01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:39.200
<v 0>so what is the different between playing heads up and playing Mike?</v>

1087
01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.930
You know,
a large tournament like 30,
40 people.

1088
01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:44.283
<v 2>Well,</v>

1089
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:48.310
<v 0>besides the obvious like what's the,
the strategic difference?</v>

1090
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:49.360
Like how you approach it.

1091
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:54.000
<v 2>It's simpler.
Um,</v>

1092
01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:58.230
which doesn't necessarily mean it's easier.

1093
01:06:58.231 --> 01:07:03.231
It means it's easier to get really in depth in how you're analyzing it.

1094
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:07.140
And the same situations come up over and over again because it's only two

1095
01:07:07.141 --> 01:07:10.950
players.
And if there are nine players at the table,

1096
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:15.870
that's nine different people who can do something different every hand.

1097
01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:19.320
And similar situations don't come up nearly as often.

1098
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:24.250
Whereas when I'm playing heads up
two hours into playing a guy,

1099
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:29.500
I can be in the spot where I'm on the button,
he's in the big blind,
I raise,

1100
01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:33.850
he calls,
flop,
comes down,
he checks,
I check,

1101
01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:38.920
turn comes down,
he bets,
I call river,
comes down,
he checks,
it's on me.

1102
01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:43.390
This exact situation,
no,
not the boards that have run out,
but the bedding action.

1103
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:48.730
That situation has come up already 20 times in the match that we're playing.

1104
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:49.863
And

1105
01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:55.000
I can have a pretty clear idea of in this exact spot,

1106
01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:59.800
this guy traps a little bit more than my average opponent.

1107
01:07:59.801 --> 01:08:04.420
He's going to take this line with a strong hand more than some other people
will.

1108
01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:09.570
So I can't bluff him as effectively or I can't make a value bet with quite as

1109
01:08:11.021 --> 01:08:13.090
weaker hand is.
I would against some other players.

1110
01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:16.280
And heads up poker

1111
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:21.280
<v 4>is more amenable to that sort of detailed analysis of how your opponent is</v>

1112
01:08:23.121 --> 01:08:23.954
playing.

1113
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:24.651
<v 0>By the way,</v>

1114
01:08:24.651 --> 01:08:29.651
I understood maybe 10 things out of 20 that you said.

1115
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:36.100
I don't even think 10 button blind flop all that river.

1116
01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.320
Oh let's fuck yeah,
fuck jargon.
So would it,
how much of it like this,

1117
01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:46.810
this expression,
this is a big one,
the um,
the,
the,

1118
01:08:46.811 --> 01:08:50.180
the big one is a poker face.
Having a poker face.

1119
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.700
Like how much of that is real?
Like how much of is,

1120
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:57.740
do you read a guy or do you worry the live poker?
Absolute.
Totally.
Yeah.

1121
01:08:57.770 --> 01:08:59.000
It's a huge factor.

1122
01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.220
So if we're looking at each other right now and we're playing,

1123
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.510
what are you looking for?

1124
01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:03.803
<v 4>MMM,</v>

1125
01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.300
<v 0>well feel it.
You sense it,
like</v>

1126
01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.970
<v 4>absolutely.
You do sense it and there's just a gut thing that happens for sure.</v>

1127
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:12.230
I,

1128
01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:16.760
you just look at somebody and he just doesn't look that comfortable where he

1129
01:09:16.761 --> 01:09:21.761
does look comfortable and often there's just a general sort of feel you get from

1130
01:09:22.161 --> 01:09:27.161
somebody that is difficult to put words to but that the top players are

1131
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:34.270
confident when they get those gut feelings and go with them.
Uh,
but there,

1132
01:09:34.271 --> 01:09:36.830
there are specific things you can look for to like,

1133
01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:41.860
you can you want to first get a sort of baseline reading on people's posture,

1134
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:46.700
like look at them sitting at the table when they're not playing a hand.

1135
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:50.480
And then having done that,
you can

1136
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.770
observe shifts from that.
Like somebody will,
um,

1137
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:58.340
bumping into the mic here,

1138
01:09:58.341 --> 01:10:03.341
but somebody will get up closer to the table when they're interested in invested

1139
01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:04.640
in the situation.

1140
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.830
Or you can even see somebody make like a micro gesture of recoiling in

1141
01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:13.460
frustration when a bad card hits the board.

1142
01:10:13.461 --> 01:10:15.890
Or You make a bet that they don't like,

1143
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:19.040
and you can see little movements like that.

1144
01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.350
You can read somebody's Paltz in their neck.
Watts.
Yeah.

1145
01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:28.380
<v 0>So you see some,
so you staring at someone's next.
In that sense,</v>

1146
01:10:28.381 --> 01:10:29.970
it would be good to be a Fatso,
right?
Yeah.

1147
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:33.840
Scarves while they play so that you can all,

1148
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:37.420
it's all the top German guys now are wearing scarves while they play because

1149
01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:41.300
Germans,
no,
Joe,
that's so crazy.

1150
01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.980
So you look at a guy's pulse in his neck and when you're looking for the amounts

1151
01:10:45.981 --> 01:10:47.150
of beets on,

1152
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:52.250
see if you can see how fast he going faster or like the blood pressure raising

1153
01:10:52.251 --> 01:10:57.080
when they're really tense.
Oh,
that's crazy.
I never would have thought that.

1154
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:58.690
Or House.
Keep

1155
01:10:58.690 --> 01:11:02.220
<v 4>someone who's breathing,
you can watch the rise and fall of their chest.
Wow.</v>

1156
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:08.550
One thing people do is people tend to be a lot more still and tight when they're

1157
01:11:08.951 --> 01:11:13.350
nervous and move around a little more and are more relaxed when they're

1158
01:11:13.351 --> 01:11:14.184
comfortable.

1159
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:19.550
And so when somebody is trying to just keep it together and look,

1160
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.680
put their poker face on look the same way,
they always look,

1161
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:33.330
but they're actually really comfortable because they've got a great hand and

1162
01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:36.080
they're about to win
one.

1163
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:41.250
You can sometimes see their legs will start pumping.
They'll,

1164
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.990
they'll start tapping their foot real fast.

1165
01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.030
They'll be keeping everything above the table still,
but they're like,

1166
01:11:46.031 --> 01:11:47.280
we'll start going real fast.

1167
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:54.460
Wow.
Now what about someone fake and all that stuff that happens all the time?

1168
01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:59.190
Does it?
Oh yeah.
Like in what way are any of those things like,
like to be,

1169
01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:02.170
now that I've just said,
I look at people's legs while they're applying.

1170
01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:05.410
I'm going to be playing in somebody's in a couple of weeks and he's going to be

1171
01:12:05.411 --> 01:12:07.360
bluffing me on the river.
He's going to start tapping his foot.

1172
01:12:07.361 --> 01:12:09.640
Cause I've just said that's something I'm looking for,

1173
01:12:09.641 --> 01:12:14.260
for evidence that they're strong.
So when you see someone like,
I'm sorry,

1174
01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.100
I think I used to do sometimes.
Uh,

1175
01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.640
I feel like I can't get away with it as much now because people know who I am

1176
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:26.910
and expect me to be pulling some bullshit and in control of my physical stuff.

1177
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:32.720
But something I would do is I would sit like this while playing in general and

1178
01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:33.520
on your face.

1179
01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:37.810
And like when I wanted to fake being nervous,

1180
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:38.890
I'd lean into it

1181
01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:43.030
and you can like see my cheat,

1182
01:12:43.031 --> 01:12:46.030
go a little white where my knuckles are making contact with my face.

1183
01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:48.390
And that would make you look more nervous.
Yeah.

1184
01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:55.210
Few practices stuff in front of a mirror.
Yeah.
I mean,
why not?

1185
01:12:55.211 --> 01:12:57.290
If you can make one point $6 million your first year,

1186
01:12:57.291 --> 01:13:01.480
I had practice like Goofy Shit to take tells can be real subtle.

1187
01:13:01.481 --> 01:13:05.470
Like what about guys who play with sunglasses on and it's not super common.

1188
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:10.060
It's very common.
Um,
tells from your eyes are,

1189
01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:14.380
it's a factor,
but it's not one of the biggest ones.
Um,

1190
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:19.510
because you're used to people looking at you in,
in the eyes,

1191
01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:24.040
you're practiced at lying with your eyes.
You,
you know,

1192
01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:26.680
people are looking at your eyes.
Isn't an Eagle Song,

1193
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:31.890
you can't hide your [inaudible]
sounds like an equal song.

1194
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:36.670
I believe it is.
Um,
so,
so the glasses not,

1195
01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:41.710
not a huge factor.
Not a huge factor is the biggest one.
The Lips,
um,

1196
01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:46.870
the neck,
hands on general posture,

1197
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:48.730
legs and feet.

1198
01:13:48.731 --> 01:13:53.050
Even people are not on top of that one.

1199
01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:56.320
How many times you've been faked out by fake towels?

1200
01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:58.961
It's hard to tell.

1201
01:13:58.961 --> 01:14:02.170
You don't necessarily know it was a fake afterwards because sometimes it's not

1202
01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:07.090
fake and you're just wrong.
You're wrong.
Your hand do you mean you're,
no,
you're,

1203
01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:11.980
the tell is genuine,
but you interpreted somebody,
he's

1204
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.540
<v 2>not actively faking you out,</v>

1205
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.050
but like none of this is an exact science.

1206
01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:18.730
Like I see somebody who's poults go up.

1207
01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:24.370
I know for sure their pulses up and that they're feeling something intense right

1208
01:14:24.371 --> 01:14:26.650
now.
It could be that they have a flush,
it could be,

1209
01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:28.810
it could be that they're really excited about their great hand,

1210
01:14:28.811 --> 01:14:31.270
or it could be that they're really stressed about the big bluff they're making.

1211
01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:34.910
<v 5>Ah,
right,
right,
right.
So you know,
something's going on.</v>

1212
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:37.160
<v 2>So,
yeah,
you get these physical signs,</v>

1213
01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:41.090
but there's not a direct path from that to knowing exactly what the heck

1214
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:44.310
<v 5>do you believe in psychic energy.</v>

1215
01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.750
Do you believe that you can read something from a person other than just tells?

1216
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.903
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1217
01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:54.300
<v 2>that's a tough one to answer.
Um,</v>

1218
01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.510
when you use the phrase psychic energy,

1219
01:14:57.511 --> 01:15:01.370
I'm inclined to say no because that sounds kind of magical and crazy,
but

1220
01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:07.220
I definitely believe that

1221
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:13.810
there is very subtle nonverbal communication that happens between people that is

1222
01:15:19.221 --> 01:15:22.880
sometimes in voluntary that you just,

1223
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:25.201
you know,

1224
01:15:25.201 --> 01:15:28.380
things about what's going through the mind of somebody you're sitting next to.

1225
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:33.480
And it's hard to tell exactly how and why,
you know,
I mean,
I think that's,

1226
01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:38.370
<v 5>look what happened.
Example,
like come on.
In what sense?
Um,</v>

1227
01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:41.603
<v 2>I mean,</v>

1228
01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.470
whether at the poker table or in any other context when you're,

1229
01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:53.900
you are reading people's moods and thoughts all the time.

1230
01:15:55.021 --> 01:15:58.950
You can tell when somebody is feeling relaxed and happy.

1231
01:15:58.951 --> 01:16:01.470
You can tell when they're stressed out.

1232
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:04.350
You can tell when they're

1233
01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.293
<v 3>okay</v>

1234
01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.700
<v 2>focused and thinking hard or when they're spacing out.</v>

1235
01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:18.540
<v 5>Right.
Donald makes sense.
Like you just need interpret regular human movement,</v>

1236
01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:21.900
communication and behavior patterns and such.

1237
01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:27.260
But I would say that one of the best sort of pieces of evidence that being

1238
01:16:28.190 --> 01:16:32.940
psychic doesn't exist is that there's no psychics that just become poker players

1239
01:16:32.941 --> 01:16:34.590
and start fucking cleaning up.

1240
01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.440
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,</v>

1241
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.440
clearly there's nobody who can just sit across the table from you and read your

1242
01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:43.560
mind.
Yeah.
Because every time,
if there weren't really psychics,

1243
01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:47.290
that would be the place where it would show up is poker.
Right?
Sure.
Or I mean,

1244
01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:49.810
any of a number of other places where you could

1245
01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:56.700
make a killing or otherwise be very successful and powerful based on that

1246
01:16:58.330 --> 01:16:59.320
ability.
I mean,

1247
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:04.340
<v 5>yeah,
those,
there'd be a lot of them.
Stock market would be a good one.</v>

1248
01:17:04.341 --> 01:17:06.380
I'm playing the lottery obviously.
Um,

1249
01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.460
<v 2>well that's getting into predicting the future versus</v>

1250
01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.740
<v 4>reading minds,
which,
I mean,
I,</v>

1251
01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:14.660
I don't think anybody's doing either of those things,

1252
01:17:14.661 --> 01:17:19.661
but reading minds seems marginally more plausible than predicting the future.

1253
01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.310
<v 5>Yeah.
Right.
That's a different kind of,</v>

1254
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:27.000
but reading the future's kind of interpreted as psychic,
right?
Isn't it?
I mean

1255
01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:29.850
in some way

1256
01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:34.850
<v 4>that they're there similarly crazy powers that some people claim to have</v>

1257
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:38.100
<v 5>design socially.
Does that like,
um,</v>

1258
01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:42.040
it seems to me that like the ability to read towels and to be able to do,

1259
01:17:42.041 --> 01:17:45.270
be so tuned into it because it's part of the game of poker.

1260
01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:49.320
Does that carry over to social communication?

1261
01:17:49.321 --> 01:17:52.230
Like do you notice things more and the way people,

1262
01:17:52.231 --> 01:17:54.510
like we all know when someone's a bullshitter,
right?

1263
01:17:54.511 --> 01:17:56.790
We all know when someone bullshits you and tells you,
sorry,

1264
01:17:56.791 --> 01:17:58.860
that's like a little fucking screwy.

1265
01:17:59.190 --> 01:18:03.060
I mean we kind of have this weird sense just based on the data that we've

1266
01:18:03.061 --> 01:18:06.000
accumulated over a lifetime's worth of communicating with people that

1267
01:18:06.001 --> 01:18:07.820
something's off here and it,

1268
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:11.370
and also if you've communicated with a bunch of bullshitters and kind of

1269
01:18:11.371 --> 01:18:12.350
recognize it.
Yeah.

1270
01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:18.260
So we feel like that like being a good poker player like makes you a better

1271
01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:19.590
social reader as well.

1272
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:24.080
<v 4>I think so.
I think probably not by a giant margin,
but yeah,</v>

1273
01:18:24.081 --> 01:18:27.640
I think I'm probably a bit above average at that.
Uh,

1274
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:29.900
I think I have

1275
01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:36.820
a more studied and self aware approach to it then a lot of other people do.

1276
01:18:41.241 --> 01:18:41.430
I,

1277
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:44.510
I think I may have started from a baseline of being a bit below average at that

1278
01:18:44.511 --> 01:18:46.070
kind of thing.
Um,

1279
01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:52.860
where somebody might say that story felt kind of bullshit.

1280
01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.060
I'm more likely to say,
well,
he said,

1281
01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:02.360
I think and equivocated on a couple of things where that's not a way you would

1282
01:19:02.701 --> 01:19:06.000
talk about it if you weren't full of Shit.
Uh,

1283
01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:10.420
his eyes were darting around a lot.
Uh,
so you look

1284
01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:14.800
<v 5>at it and you would look at it in an analytical sense instead of just basing</v>

1285
01:19:14.801 --> 01:19:18.880
Justin your instincts.
You would use both your instincts and analytical.
Yeah.

1286
01:19:19.810 --> 01:19:22.360
Yeah.
There's something,
there's something I,
I'm,
I'm one of the things,

1287
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:26.350
main things that I'm fascinated with with poker is the ability to read minds.

1288
01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:31.740
The or read tells rather to the ability to sort of get this a sense of where

1289
01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.210
persons going with things get the sense.

1290
01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:37.780
I think that's fascinating because I'd know that that exists in real life.

1291
01:19:37.781 --> 01:19:42.110
I know it does.
I know it exists,
like that thing exists with,

1292
01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:45.790
with human beings.
I just don't know exactly what it is.
I've always wondered,

1293
01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:49.270
I always wondered what exactly is going on when people are looking at each other

1294
01:19:49.271 --> 01:19:52.670
and you know something's off.
Yeah.
You know,
just as,

1295
01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:57.340
I guess a sense like this is a perfect story.
I've told this before,

1296
01:19:57.341 --> 01:20:00.310
but my friend Brian Cowen,
he used to,
he's a great guy,
but he,

1297
01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:03.280
he's to date like some of the craziest fucking people of all time.

1298
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:06.010
He's had a bunch of crazy people in his life too.

1299
01:20:06.011 --> 01:20:09.090
And I would hang out with them and he would have this guy over and I'd be like,

1300
01:20:09.091 --> 01:20:11.300
what do you disguise a fucking bullshit artists?
Like,
what do you,

1301
01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:15.090
he couldn't see it for whatever reason.
Just couldn't see it.
Yeah.
And um,

1302
01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:20.190
he introduced me to this girl within five seconds,
like a,
he goes,
hey,

1303
01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:23.700
this is blah,
blah,
blah.
This is my friend Joe.
Uh,
I go,
how are you doing?

1304
01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:28.670
And she goes,
oh,
hi.
I don't get my Brian,
I pulled him aside.

1305
01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:32.340
She's fucking crazy.
I go,
get out right now.
Whatever you're doing.
He goes,
no,

1306
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:36.330
it's not crazy.
It's just nervous to be around you.
I go,
dude,
trust me.
I,

1307
01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:41.250
I have a spidey sense for like real crazy.
I ain't go,
that girl's fucking crazy.

1308
01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:44.970
Turns out,
of course he didn't listen,
moves her and blah,
blah,
blah.

1309
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:50.040
Turns out she's on math completely out of her fucking mind,
uh,
is a prostitute.

1310
01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:54.660
Um,
has,
has,
uh,
these John's in her life and,

1311
01:20:54.661 --> 01:20:58.140
and you know,
fucking pimps in her life.
And then he,
you know,

1312
01:20:58.141 --> 01:21:02.790
he gets rid of her and then years later he's a on a bar,
uh,

1313
01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:07.310
at a bar on sunset and a about to walk in and she walks by and she street

1314
01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:12.060
walking.
Jeez.
Yeah,
I spotted it like that.

1315
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:17.580
Yeah.
He didn't spot it at all.
Fascinating.
He would be a suck ass poker player.

1316
01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:20.040
I don't think I'd be a good poker player.
I don't have the patience.

1317
01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:24.180
It's just not something I'm interested in.
But if I,
if I was interested in,

1318
01:21:24.181 --> 01:21:28.350
I wonder if I'd be able to pick up tells.
I find that so fascinating.

1319
01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:31.700
<v 4>I feel like with all the experience in martial arts,</v>

1320
01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:36.280
you would have a leg up on learning that stuff.
You're,
I mean,

1321
01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.970
picking up tells has some in common with,
you know,

1322
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:45.140
looking at somebody stance and picking up that they're about to throw a kick.

1323
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.260
<v 5>Hmm.
That's interesting because looking at someone's stance and whether or not</v>

1324
01:21:51.261 --> 01:21:54.500
they're going to throw a kick is based on data.
You know,
like,
um,

1325
01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:57.980
like sometimes I'll say like during a broadcast,

1326
01:21:57.981 --> 01:22:02.240
like he's about to throw a left high kick and someone will go how,
you know,

1327
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:07.750
and because there's a very small but perceptible rise in his heel,

1328
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:11.620
like his heel came up off the back foot in,

1329
01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:14.810
which means usually that a guy is trying to get a little bit of a head start

1330
01:22:14.811 --> 01:22:16.790
throwing a kick with his back leg and you just,

1331
01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:20.450
you see it because so many guys up throwing kicks at you or because you're,

1332
01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.390
you've tried to hide it on people.
When you throw the kicks at people,

1333
01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:27.470
you know there's,
there's a thing that you see,
but it's,
there's,
um,

1334
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:31.280
there was a book on this and it's not about martial arts,

1335
01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:36.340
it's about just acquiring massive amounts of data about very specific things and

1336
01:22:38.061 --> 01:22:42.020
then being able to see these things coming.
I forget the term that they use,

1337
01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:45.890
but it was just about that,
about how for a person who doesn't have this data,

1338
01:22:45.891 --> 01:22:48.950
in their mind it seems like,
like,
how's this guy seeing this?

1339
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:53.180
But for someone who has all that data,
it's like,
oh,
there it is.
You know,

1340
01:22:53.181 --> 01:22:54.680
just like this little blip little,

1341
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.300
<v 4>yeah,
it's exactly the same thing with picking up,</v>

1342
01:22:57.301 --> 01:23:01.950
tells him poker because just thousands of times I've sat across the table from a

1343
01:23:01.951 --> 01:23:03.420
guy,
I've looked at him,

1344
01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:06.760
I've thought about whether or not I think this guy has a good hand and then I've

1345
01:23:06.761 --> 01:23:09.350
put out my call and he shows me his hand.
And I,

1346
01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:11.860
I've just been through that routine thousands of times.

1347
01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:15.880
And so now I find myself in that spot and the guys bet and I'm looking at him

1348
01:23:15.881 --> 01:23:18.910
and thinking about whether or not to call and

1349
01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:24.140
I have a big sample of what people look like right before I called them.

1350
01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:27.050
And then whether or not they show me the winning hit.

1351
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:30.230
So a guy like Doyle Brunson who's been around for a hundred years,

1352
01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:33.080
it will be a wizard at that shit.
Right?
I would guess so.
Yeah.

1353
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:38.500
That's really interesting,
man.
That's really interesting.
Like that does,

1354
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:42.860
that guy should teach like tells,
right.
I give you,
you're that old.

1355
01:23:43.170 --> 01:23:46.910
Been around for that.
How long was that?
I've been playing so long time.

1356
01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:51.860
50 60 years or something crazy.
Like 50 years.
More like 60 yeah,

1357
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:56.780
60 years.
Yeah.
All that dude's in his eighties I'm pretty sure.
That's amazing,

1358
01:23:56.781 --> 01:23:58.090
man.
That's that,

1359
01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:03.160
that all those years of accumulating that data and a guy like that has been

1360
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:06.400
really been around for the transformation of poker too.

1361
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:09.380
It was a real different thing back in the 60s yeah.

1362
01:24:09.381 --> 01:24:12.500
It was like you'd go over people's houses,
right?
Yeah.
That was all it was.

1363
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:14.540
Did they have it in casinos back then?

1364
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:19.870
I want to say the 60s was when poker in casinos began picking up his sixties

1365
01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:26.660
yeah.
What,
what led to this poker revolution that we find now?
I'm fucking,

1366
01:24:26.661 --> 01:24:30.890
everybody plays poker now.
Yeah.
The,
there were a few stages of it.

1367
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:32.990
The earlier parts,

1368
01:24:32.991 --> 01:24:37.730
like what happened in the sixties and seventies I know less about,

1369
01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:43.150
but they started running the world series of poker in Vegas in the sixties mmm.

1370
01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.730
And have every year for

1371
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:54.760
eh,
I guess world series started in 69 I think.

1372
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:57.460
So they've run it every year for 40 some years now with the big one on

1373
01:24:57.461 --> 01:25:02.461
television was when they started showing those cameras and television the cards,

1374
01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.660
being able to see people's hands.

1375
01:25:04.661 --> 01:25:08.890
That was a shoe that was huge and making it a spectators or making an exciting,

1376
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:10.660
even for a guy like me who doesn't play,

1377
01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:14.350
if I'm sitting at a bar and I look up and there's a poker thing on,

1378
01:25:14.351 --> 01:25:18.710
you see each guy's hand,
that's,
to me it's very exciting.
Yeah.
That's,

1379
01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:20.070
that was a huge leap forward.

1380
01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:22.570
They had tried televising poker tournaments before that,

1381
01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.350
but it's especially to a casual,
if you were a lot less interesting,

1382
01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:29.510
but you see la less of it,
at least for the cow,
the the,
you know,

1383
01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:31.270
the non-involved observer like myself.

1384
01:25:31.271 --> 01:25:36.271
You see less of it on television now in the u s in the u s in other countries.

1385
01:25:36.461 --> 01:25:40.510
This is not,
it hasn't fallen off in nearly the same way in other places.

1386
01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:45.511
And the reason behind that is that in order to make a profitable TV show,

1387
01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:50.800
you have to sell advertising space.
If you're making a poker TV show,

1388
01:25:50.801 --> 01:25:54.430
who do you want to sell advertising space to?
Poker online poker sites,

1389
01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:59.190
online poker sites can't advertise in the u s anymore.
Motherfuckers,
here's this.

1390
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.070
Oh,
in Canada or England or France.

1391
01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.230
Poker on TV is still here.

1392
01:26:06.650 --> 01:26:08.870
<v 0>So in Canada it's legal.
The Bellman,</v>

1393
01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:13.350
<v 4>it is ambiguous,
ambiguous,</v>

1394
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.840
because in most of the world it's ambiguous.

1395
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:19.870
<v 0>Can,
I would seem that like if you were a poker player and you live in America,</v>

1396
01:26:19.871 --> 01:26:23.970
you just moved to Vancouver,
you play online,
Vancouver,

1397
01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:27.930
traveled on the America,
give up you to citizenship,
Canadians,

1398
01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:31.520
<v 4>US citizenship and getting citizenship somewhere else.
Difficult.</v>

1399
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:33.570
A lot tougher than you might guess.
Yeah,

1400
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:37.730
I would have bought them in 2011 when it became clear I was going to have to

1401
01:26:37.731 --> 01:26:39.770
leave the u s to keep playing poker online.

1402
01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.730
I was very startled that I can't just go wherever I want and set up shop and

1403
01:26:45.731 --> 01:26:49.630
stay there indefinitely.
So you would you live in Malta,

1404
01:26:49.631 --> 01:26:52.150
now's that your move?
Mostly.
Um,

1405
01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:55.660
I can only spend about half of the year there for visa reasons.

1406
01:26:55.690 --> 01:26:59.230
So I spend about half the year in Malta and do a lot of travelling around to

1407
01:26:59.231 --> 01:27:00.130
other places as well.

1408
01:27:00.210 --> 01:27:02.040
<v 0>You fucking pimp,
look at you.</v>

1409
01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:06.240
Kid goes from hating school trying to figure out,

1410
01:27:06.241 --> 01:27:11.040
gets the love of his parents fucking bolts.
Makes 1.6 a year,

1411
01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.120
the first year.

1412
01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:16.110
And then from there on when you got your degree and then you decided to just

1413
01:27:16.111 --> 01:27:18.030
dedicate yourself to being a professional poker player.

1414
01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:23.120
I like how many years was it until you kind of had to make this move out of the

1415
01:27:23.791 --> 01:27:24.624
United States?

1416
01:27:24.810 --> 01:27:27.780
<v 4>Three.
Uh,
I graduated in 2000 date,</v>

1417
01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:32.130
moved to Vegas and lived in Vegas from 2008 to 2011 and then move to Malta.

1418
01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.850
What was living in Vegas?
Clark?
It was pretty great.
Um,

1419
01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:41.420
I lived in panorama towers.
Uh,
you spend a lot time in Vegas,
you might know it.

1420
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:45.510
It's the apartment complex.
Next door to have Angela is Jim.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,

1421
01:27:45.511 --> 01:27:50.370
I know where that is.
Nice spot.
Yeah.
Uh,
and it was just full of poker players.

1422
01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:51.070
Oh really?

1423
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:55.440
So it was like some friends of mine from college who moved out there with me at

1424
01:27:55.441 --> 01:27:59.340
the same time.
Um,
I had two friends from college who,

1425
01:28:01.330 --> 01:28:03.250
uh,
one still is a professional poker player.

1426
01:28:03.251 --> 01:28:06.550
One was for a couple of years and then went to law school and they moved out to

1427
01:28:06.551 --> 01:28:09.850
Vegas with me.
Uh,
my girlfriend then who's now my wife,

1428
01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:14.140
came out with me and then I met a bunch of poker players who are already living

1429
01:28:14.141 --> 01:28:17.410
out there and panorama towers and like 2008,

1430
01:28:17.411 --> 01:28:21.880
2009 was just insanity.
Um,

1431
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.540
the whole building was just poker players and scrapers.

1432
01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.260
<v 0>Oh,
empty apartments.
Wow.</v>

1433
01:28:31.261 --> 01:28:34.650
What a party that must have been poker players and strippers.

1434
01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:36.203
How'd that work out?

1435
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:41.580
A lot of money being exchanged and those towers allegedly,
allegedly,

1436
01:28:41.581 --> 01:28:44.360
I don't know any details of that sort of thing.
Good for you.

1437
01:28:44.670 --> 01:28:46.260
Stay on the straight and narrow son.

1438
01:28:46.710 --> 01:28:49.920
Avoid the de force that fucking traps hedge fund managers,

1439
01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:54.810
sending them to their doom.
So,
um,
so you'll,
you'll live in Vegas.
You're,

1440
01:28:54.811 --> 01:28:56.970
you're doing the poker thing in Vegas

1441
01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:02.130
<v 4>and Vegas mainly online.
Mainly online still.
Yeah.
Why is that?
Um,
two</v>

1442
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:03.780
<v 0>more profitable.
Easier.</v>

1443
01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:05.370
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1444
01:29:05.370 --> 01:29:10.370
<v 4>More profitable for me at that time given my personal skillset and inclinations.</v>

1445
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:18.140
Um,
there's money to be made doing both.
Uh,

1446
01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:22.980
the advantages with online poker are you can get a lot more hands an hour in.

1447
01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:28.850
You don't have any of the cost or wasted time associated with going somewhere to

1448
01:29:29.971 --> 01:29:32.790
play.
There's not the drive to get there.

1449
01:29:32.791 --> 01:29:36.690
And the drive back and the time spent waiting for a seat in a game.

1450
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.340
Playing live poker involves all live cash games involves a lot of waiting around

1451
01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:42.300
for your term to get to play.

1452
01:29:43.210 --> 01:29:44.280
<v 0>Yeah,
I would imagine.</v>

1453
01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:47.420
<v 4>Um,
and then once you get in the game,</v>

1454
01:29:47.421 --> 01:29:50.840
you play 30 hands an hour online.

1455
01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.840
I'm playing three or 400 ads an hour and that,
that's not cool.

1456
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:56.390
That's not even particularly high volume.

1457
01:29:56.490 --> 01:30:00.870
<v 0>Are you playing more than one game at a time online?
Oh,
I see.</v>

1458
01:30:00.871 --> 01:30:02.850
So you run multiple computers or

1459
01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:08.230
<v 4>can it's just multiple windows on one computer.
Okay.
So there's different sites.</v>

1460
01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:11.200
You can play multiple tables on one side real.
Yeah.

1461
01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:15.010
You're not doing anything sneaky or bad by playing multiple tables.

1462
01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:18.790
<v 0>Now when you have a thing on sites,
do you have a time limit?</v>

1463
01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:22.060
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
pretty short.
Um,</v>

1464
01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:27.480
something like 15 seconds and then after 15 seconds it goes into your time bank,

1465
01:30:28.661 --> 01:30:30.490
which is like another minute worth of time.

1466
01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.730
But that is not constantly replenished.

1467
01:30:33.731 --> 01:30:37.150
So like you use 30 seconds of your time bank now you've only got 30 seconds left

1468
01:30:37.151 --> 01:30:40.750
for the next hand if you were to go into your time bank again.
So yeah,

1469
01:30:40.751 --> 01:30:42.770
you have to play quite quickly.
That's,

1470
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:44.950
<v 0>that seems like,
yeah.
Why,</v>

1471
01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:48.920
why would anybody go anywhere if you could play it on line like that.
And so

1472
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:52.800
<v 4>the games are tougher online because,</v>

1473
01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:54.490
<v 3>okay,</v>

1474
01:30:54.490 --> 01:30:56.080
<v 4>you can get so many more hands in.</v>

1475
01:30:56.081 --> 01:31:00.910
The best players are winning so much that the competition to be the best player

1476
01:31:00.911 --> 01:31:05.260
in the game online is stiffer.
Whereas live

1477
01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:11.060
is it more fun for many recreational players,

1478
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:16.610
people who are losing it,
poker,
not all of them.

1479
01:31:16.611 --> 01:31:21.611
Many preferred play in a live game where they can see and hang out with the

1480
01:31:21.771 --> 01:31:23.520
people you have to worry about

1481
01:31:23.610 --> 01:31:24.421
<v 0>when you play it online.</v>

1482
01:31:24.421 --> 01:31:26.820
Do you have to worry about bots or is that nothing anymore?

1483
01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:29.550
Like that was something that people are really worried about for awhile.

1484
01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:33.820
<v 4>It's a concern for sure.
Um,</v>

1485
01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:38.890
the biggest and best sites I think are doing a pretty good job at enforcing

1486
01:31:38.891 --> 01:31:40.450
against it.
Uh,

1487
01:31:40.451 --> 01:31:45.451
you can do various things to detect when it's a bot rather than a human playing

1488
01:31:46.810 --> 01:31:47.830
and shut it down.

1489
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:49.040
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1490
01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:49.801
<v 0>How do you do that?</v>

1491
01:31:49.801 --> 01:31:53.760
Like what could they run programs or something like that to try to,

1492
01:31:54.730 --> 01:31:59.730
<v 4>the site has various data to work with based on you're giving them,</v>

1493
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.233
<v 2>um,</v>

1494
01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:07.660
they're not like scanning your computer to see what other programs you're

1495
01:32:08.361 --> 01:32:11.390
running or anything like that.
They're not invading your privacy in that way,

1496
01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:16.780
but what they can do is they can keep track of your mouse movement around the

1497
01:32:18.411 --> 01:32:23.411
screen and the speed and timing that you're clicking on things.

1498
01:32:24.501 --> 01:32:29.450
And they can detect the difference between a human moving a mouse around the

1499
01:32:29.451 --> 01:32:29.751
screen,

1500
01:32:29.751 --> 01:32:34.580
like a human and a computer program that just jumps from button to button and

1501
01:32:34.581 --> 01:32:39.200
act instantly.
So at this point,

1502
01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:42.410
if you're running a bot that plays for you,

1503
01:32:43.130 --> 01:32:48.130
part of your challenge is that you have to code up software to move the mouse

1504
01:32:48.951 --> 01:32:53.951
around the screen in a convincingly human like fashion and evade this detection.

1505
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:55.310
Uh,

1506
01:32:55.310 --> 01:33:00.310
they track your playing hours if you're just regularly playing for 48 hours

1507
01:33:01.071 --> 01:33:04.260
straight,
that's pretty suspicious.
Um,

1508
01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:08.870
<v 7>once they get a nice fucking webcam video you'd doing crank set in front of a</v>

1509
01:33:08.871 --> 01:33:09.704
computer?

1510
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:12.310
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean occasionally it comes to that sort of thing.</v>

1511
01:33:12.311 --> 01:33:17.311
Like I'm a guy I know was playing 60 tables at once and they're like,

1512
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:23.260
that you're a Bot that a person can't do that.

1513
01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.270
And so he

1514
01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.640
<v 7>did the video of him doing that and he's like,
no,</v>

1515
01:33:28.641 --> 01:33:30.530
I'm fucking get this is what it looks like.

1516
01:33:30.531 --> 01:33:33.750
What does he have like a bank of screens in front of him?
No,
I think it is.

1517
01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:35.570
I think it was just all on one screen.

1518
01:33:35.571 --> 01:33:37.400
All the table stacked on top of each other.

1519
01:33:37.401 --> 01:33:41.690
So whichever table you have to act on pops to the top and you're just clicking.

1520
01:33:41.691 --> 01:33:44.660
It goes to the side and the next one you have to act on pops to the top.

1521
01:33:46.290 --> 01:33:50.930
Oh my God.
He was a competitive starcraft player before he came to poker.

1522
01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:56.130
[inaudible] speed clicking.
Oh yeah.
And multitasking though.

1523
01:33:56.131 --> 01:34:00.770
Starcraft players into amazing,
no,
I don't sane.
I don't know what they're doing.

1524
01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.030
So a,
it's even more amazing to me yet.
Same every now and then.

1525
01:34:05.031 --> 01:34:09.050
I watched those videos and it's nuts.
Dunkin's obsessed with that shit.

1526
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:12.840
He was a silver whatever the fuck that is on starcraft for awhile.

1527
01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:17.600
And then he lost his silver standing.
Very,
very upset,
very embarrassed.
But uh,

1528
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:21.860
I would watch him get obsessed with that stuff and he would watch the videos in

1529
01:34:21.861 --> 01:34:25.340
his eyes would light up and his pupils would dilate and oh yeah,

1530
01:34:25.670 --> 01:34:29.600
those videos are insane.
And it's a huge spectator sport in Korea.
Right?

1531
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:34.970
Huge.
There's like TV stations devoted to just that.
I'm pretty sure.
Yeah.

1532
01:34:34.971 --> 01:34:38.300
I need to talk to one of the golf channels,
starcraft,
starcraft dudes.

1533
01:34:38.690 --> 01:34:40.400
Apparently it's a very,
very,

1534
01:34:40.401 --> 01:34:44.950
very difficult game to that is in a lot of ways very chess.

1535
01:34:44.951 --> 01:34:49.951
Like in that sense it's very strategic and but also like almost athletic and the

1536
01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.510
sort of speed clicking demands.

1537
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:58.040
Well Three d games are very in that sense,
the

1538
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.150
<v 4>hand eye coordination that are involved in playing like games like unreal or</v>

1539
01:35:02.151 --> 01:35:06.440
quake or you know,
doom or any of those crazy fast twitch games.

1540
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:12.020
Competitive Gamers who transitioned to poker and are now professional poker

1541
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:13.220
players bottom.

1542
01:35:13.221 --> 01:35:17.990
Imagine that people that just have this inclination towards like figuring things

1543
01:35:17.991 --> 01:35:20.540
out in a game sense,

1544
01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.070
they would have that towards a lot of things.
Yeah.

1545
01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:29.080
Poker is full of people who were in some other game or a sport before poker.

1546
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:30.980
The pool thing is huge.
It's very,

1547
01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:33.740
a lot of pool players go into poker because they can actually make money doing

1548
01:35:33.741 --> 01:35:38.210
it as opposed to pool.
It's very difficult to do.
So when you,
um,
you,

1549
01:35:38.211 --> 01:35:41.060
you live in Vegas for a little bit baggy hanging out with strippers

1550
01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:46.640
and poker players and strippers and poker players and uh,

1551
01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:51.110
then so you decide how do you,
how do you go with Malta?
Um,

1552
01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.250
it's a weird story actually how I ended up in Malta.

1553
01:35:55.251 --> 01:35:59.630
I'm originally,
it had a lot to do.
Where is Malta?

1554
01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.160
It's like right next to Sicily.

1555
01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:03.380
<v 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1556
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:08.210
<v 4>It's like a couple of hours on the ferry to Sicily.
Hmm.
Okay.</v>

1557
01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:13.100
That's where my grandparents were from.
Oh cool.
So yeah,
I'm sorry.

1558
01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:16.510
[inaudible] real nearby.
I drink a lot of Sicilian wine.
Neat.

1559
01:36:16.511 --> 01:36:19.310
A lot of Sicilian pizza there.
Batman.
The food.

1560
01:36:19.311 --> 01:36:22.420
They're supposed to be sensational,
like a seafood supposed to be amazing.

1561
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:26.930
All the local red king prawns and Malta or some of the most delicious things

1562
01:36:26.931 --> 01:36:30.890
I've ever eaten.
Wow.
Okay.
So how do you,
what,
what makes you live there?

1563
01:36:30.891 --> 01:36:35.180
So the tax things at a gambling on residency thing,
it's easy.

1564
01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:40.340
It looked like it was going to be when I started looking into it at the time,
um,

1565
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:45.610
it was basically just mean to pave some relatively small fees for the process.

1566
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:48.050
You need to fill in a bunch of paperwork.

1567
01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:52.850
Mainly stuff like demonstrating that you have enough money to support yourself,

1568
01:36:52.851 --> 01:36:56.070
that you haven't been convicted of any crimes in the country.

1569
01:36:56.071 --> 01:36:59.710
You're coming from basic stuff like that.

1570
01:36:59.950 --> 01:37:03.460
And they will give you a permit to stay there as long as you like.

1571
01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:07.810
So do you speak Spanish or Italian?
Like what did speak there in Malta,

1572
01:37:07.811 --> 01:37:11.380
they speak multi and English.
Malty.

1573
01:37:11.381 --> 01:37:15.790
And what does malty it is a Semitic language.
So like closest to Arabic,

1574
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:17.100
Jesus Christ.

1575
01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:21.730
But it's a Ritz in like Roman characters.
Like

1576
01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:27.640
that finger used
Roman numerals.
No,
not running.

1577
01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:32.560
They're like these instead of use the alphabet we use for English and French and

1578
01:37:32.561 --> 01:37:35.560
Spanish and Italian.
Wow.
But it's a semantic language,

1579
01:37:35.561 --> 01:37:36.610
but it's a Semitic language,

1580
01:37:36.611 --> 01:37:41.611
so it's just full of like x's and queues and teaches that you can't pronounce

1581
01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:43.323
all.

1582
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:48.130
I needed to go to the post office to pick up a package that had been sent to me

1583
01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:50.710
and I don't have a car there,
so I need to take a taxi.

1584
01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:54.340
So I get the address of the post office.
I write it down.
It's in a town.

1585
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:56.040
I thought it was called core

1586
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.610
<v 2>me.
It's spelled Q.
O.
R.
M.
I.
I got in the taxi.</v>

1587
01:37:59.611 --> 01:38:03.420
I say I need to go to the post office and core me guy looks at me like I've just

1588
01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:05.820
told him I need to go to the post office on the moon.

1589
01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:08.460
He's never heard of core me.
It's not a big island.

1590
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:09.930
They're like 500,000 people there.

1591
01:38:09.931 --> 01:38:12.330
You can drive from one end to the other and then hour it.

1592
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:14.423
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1593
01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:18.550
<v 2>say it again.
I show it to him on the piece of paper.
He says,
oh army.
Yes,</v>

1594
01:38:18.551 --> 01:38:21.520
we can go to army or with the silent Q,

1595
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:26.470
<v 5>a silent Q or a guest.
Silent cues.</v>

1596
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:30.490
Why use it?
How weird.
What a strange thing.

1597
01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.150
That whole part of the world is so bizarre because it's like the sort of the,

1598
01:38:34.151 --> 01:38:37.660
the echos of the conqueror movements of thousands of

1599
01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:40.950
<v 2>Oh yeah.
And you can really see it in Malta.
I mean it,</v>

1600
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:44.490
it's been conquered by so many people over the years.
Um,

1601
01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:49.820
obviously the language is Semitic because at one point it was under more

1602
01:38:51.031 --> 01:38:51.990
pressure,
Arabic

1603
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:56.750
<v 5>control,
which is why that scene from true romance with the Moore's and Sicily.</v>

1604
01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:00.910
Yeah.
With,
you know,
where's saying that?
Yeah.

1605
01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:05.300
The rates of scene where all the black people that mean this is the reason why

1606
01:39:05.301 --> 01:39:07.250
so many Sicilians of dark skin.

1607
01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:07.741
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1608
01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:12.741
Here and a Maltese people look roughly like Lebanese people or something.

1609
01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:17.130
Wow.
Pretty dark skinned.
Uh,

1610
01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:21.550
they speak a language that sounds a lot like Arabic with an Italian accent

1611
01:39:21.551 --> 01:39:25.960
basically.
Did you do like a lot of research before you decided on Malta?

1612
01:39:26.230 --> 01:39:29.230
Medium amount?
Uh,
no.
Anybody living there already?

1613
01:39:29.710 --> 01:39:31.720
I knew a few people who had been there.

1614
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:37.480
He just fucking move to some strange island.
What happened was,
uh,

1615
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:42.430
the Department of Justice cracked out on the poker sites happened in April,

1616
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:45.340
2011 and a few weeks went by.

1617
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:47.560
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1618
01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.250
<v 2>we're thinking maybe this will all just blow over and everything will be back to</v>

1619
01:39:51.251 --> 01:39:52.210
the way it was.

1620
01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:57.300
In a month or two it became pretty clear that was not going to be the case by

1621
01:39:58.030 --> 01:40:02.230
late May and the world series of poker is about to start in Vegas.

1622
01:40:02.231 --> 01:40:05.890
I'm going to be playing a poker tournament every day for six weeks.

1623
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:07.660
Um,

1624
01:40:08.590 --> 01:40:12.850
but I'm beginning to plan ahead to what I'm going to do after that so I can get

1625
01:40:12.851 --> 01:40:17.851
back to playing online and talking to my girlfriend about where we're going to

1626
01:40:18.641 --> 01:40:19.474
move

1627
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:25.750
and the idea of multi comes up and we decided she's going to go there by herself

1628
01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:30.560
and check it out while I'm playing the world series.

1629
01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:32.090
And she's like,

1630
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:37.090
not really that enthusiastic about this idea at the time.

1631
01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:41.600
She was like,
we're gonna go to this little shitty island,
the middle of nowhere.

1632
01:40:41.601 --> 01:40:45.230
I don't know about this.
It sounds weird,

1633
01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.970
but she went over there and ended up loving it.
It's like Malta is great.

1634
01:40:49.971 --> 01:40:53.980
Let's go there.
Wow.
Yeah.
It came back just the where the other poker

1635
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.100
<v 4>players go on.
Anybody follow you over there?</v>

1636
01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:02.400
Two other guys came with me over there and didn't stay fascinating.

1637
01:41:04.781 --> 01:41:07.660
Vagabond lifestyle you guys have.
Yeah,
that's nuts.
Uh,

1638
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:12.750
all my friends who were living in Panorama towers in Vegas are now scattered all

1639
01:41:12.761 --> 01:41:16.870
over the world.
So no one stayed in Vegas.
One Dude stayed in Vegas.
One Dude.

1640
01:41:16.871 --> 01:41:17.704
Out of how many?

1641
01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:23.150
One dude out of my like close group of 10 friends or so,

1642
01:41:23.151 --> 01:41:27.460
and a handful more out of the like 50 or 60 who are living in the building,

1643
01:41:27.490 --> 01:41:32.110
but isn't it legal now to gamble online on some sites?
If you live in Vegas?

1644
01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:37.180
Yes,
there is online poker in Nevada,
but it's Nevada only,

1645
01:41:37.630 --> 01:41:40.130
so play against other people in Nevada.

1646
01:41:40.610 --> 01:41:42.730
So it was a limited group of people to play with.

1647
01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:45.550
You can't play very high stakes.
There aren't a lot of games.

1648
01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:51.060
Playing full time from Nevada is not a very appealing proposition.

1649
01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:56.500
The Guy who decided to stay is playing mainly and casinos.
Wow.

1650
01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:01.570
Now is it,
is there any movement to change this as far as the online laws?

1651
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.240
Cause yes.
What year was this all implemented?

1652
01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:07.240
You?

1653
01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.950
Iga passed in 2006 but it's not relieve and clear how much that had to do with

1654
01:42:11.951 --> 01:42:16.951
anything that what happened right after the UID passed in 2006 was that some

1655
01:42:17.441 --> 01:42:22.441
poker sites voluntarily pulled out of the u s market and that doing transactions

1656
01:42:22.631 --> 01:42:27.580
with poker sites became more complicated because it will remember what I was

1657
01:42:27.581 --> 01:42:31.480
saying about the you aga.
It didn't change what was illegal.
It was,

1658
01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:35.710
it's not like online poker was illegal before that and then it wasn't,

1659
01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:39.520
it's not like online poker was clearly illegal the whole time.

1660
01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:42.880
Nobody really knows.
It's up to

1661
01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:48.550
prosecutors to decide that they want to prosecute a case against an online

1662
01:42:48.551 --> 01:42:51.070
gambling site on the basis of the laws that are on the books,

1663
01:42:51.071 --> 01:42:52.090
which are pretty vague.

1664
01:42:53.050 --> 01:42:58.050
And then courts to decide if it's fair to apply those laws to the case in

1665
01:42:59.381 --> 01:43:02.680
question.
So was anybody from the U S it's a poker player,

1666
01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:07.660
tried playing online poker from the United States and been prosecuted.

1667
01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:13.000
Players don't really get prosecuted,
so it's essentially the site owners.

1668
01:43:13.001 --> 01:43:16.960
The sites are the ones that are exposed to legal risk.

1669
01:43:17.170 --> 01:43:20.140
So I'll give you just decided to stay in Vegas and start getting,

1670
01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.570
keep playing online.
What would be the risk?

1671
01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:25.090
The sites wouldn't take my business that wouldn't take your business.

1672
01:43:25.091 --> 01:43:27.790
What have you went through a proxy.
Then

1673
01:43:29.310 --> 01:43:31.980
I might trick them and I might get to play on the site,

1674
01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:37.520
but I would be constantly at risk of being caught and confiscated.

1675
01:43:40.230 --> 01:43:43.960
If I'm caught,
I might lose all my money.
Yeah.
So,
yeah,
you,

1676
01:43:43.961 --> 01:43:48.180
you have to do all sorts of identity masking bullshit to get away with playing

1677
01:43:48.181 --> 01:43:52.040
on international poker sites from the u s so what's done to try to change

1678
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.840
<v 5>that</v>

1679
01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:57.840
<v 4>are in some ways it's pretty similar to the marijuana movement in the u s</v>

1680
01:43:59.681 --> 01:44:02.440
actually it's happening on a state by state basis.

1681
01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:03.563
<v 6>MMM.</v>

1682
01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:08.060
<v 4>There's probably not going to be a federal bill anytime soon.
They,</v>

1683
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:09.860
there've been some attempts.

1684
01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:11.050
<v 6>Ah,
okay.</v>

1685
01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:15.720
<v 4>But they haven't come very close to passing.
But so far,</v>

1686
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.823
Nevada,

1687
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:21.830
New Jersey and Delaware have past online poker bills and you can play in those

1688
01:44:26.221 --> 01:44:28.710
three places.
That's it.
That's it.
So far.

1689
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:33.420
California is at the forefront and is a huge one.
Um,

1690
01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:37.650
if California becomes an online poker state,

1691
01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:41.790
even if you can only play against other California residents,

1692
01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:47.060
it's a big enough state with enough money that that will be a full fledge poker

1693
01:44:47.101 --> 01:44:47.934
economy.

1694
01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.110
<v 5>Yeah.
20 million people here.
This is a goddamn country.
Yeah.</v>

1695
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:57.200
This is Canada close.
10 is 40.
Is it?
I think so.

1696
01:44:57.201 --> 01:45:01.500
I think I looked that up recently.
I think you did too.
I think you're right.

1697
01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.670
I think we looked it up actually.
Well,
let's find out right now,

1698
01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:08.230
population of can I want to say it's 37 population that sounds right.
Yeah.

1699
01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:08.540
<v 4>Right.</v>

1700
01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:13.540
I think California is actually higher than 20 to 34 34.8 California or Canada.

1701
01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:19.670
Three and 4.8 which is close.

1702
01:45:19.690 --> 01:45:23.530
I mean La is 12 or 14 already.

1703
01:45:23.531 --> 01:45:27.970
38 California 38 so yeah,
California is a bit bigger than Canada,

1704
01:45:28.150 --> 01:45:29.020
so pretty close.

1705
01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:34.170
38 and 35 and then those are pretty comparable to like the larger European

1706
01:45:34.301 --> 01:45:37.810
countries.
That's like La is 20 million.
At least 20 million.
Yeah.

1707
01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:42.840
<v 5>Wow.
That's what,
uh,
the 20 million came from.
But that's just without Mexicans.</v>

1708
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:44.970
They have no idea how many people really are here.
Right.

1709
01:45:44.971 --> 01:45:49.971
It could easily be 30 or 40 there's a lot of people here that are undocumented.

1710
01:45:52.410 --> 01:45:55.560
Yeah.
That's the crazy thing.
Yeah.
The actual numbers,
I mean,

1711
01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:57.930
I'm sure they probably have some sort of a vague idea,

1712
01:45:57.931 --> 01:46:02.250
but unless they're going from neighborhood to neighborhood scanning,

1713
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:06.630
how do they know?
That's the whole idea is that they were here illegally.

1714
01:46:06.631 --> 01:46:08.230
There's no documentation.
Yeah.
You,

1715
01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:12.550
I guess you could like Nikki gas somehow or another.
Yeah.
You could.
Yeah.

1716
01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:15.930
<v 4>Track indicators of economic activity.</v>

1717
01:46:15.931 --> 01:46:20.931
Like how many fucking bags of rice or being held at the supermarket races.

1718
01:46:25.110 --> 01:46:28.640
<v 5>Um,
I don't know if that would work,
but uh,
I mean</v>

1719
01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:33.050
<v 4>track how much food is sold.
Yeah.
In La,</v>

1720
01:46:33.051 --> 01:46:35.630
that asked me pretty closely correlated with how many people,

1721
01:46:36.090 --> 01:46:38.870
<v 5>I guess,
well how much cash business do they do?</v>

1722
01:46:38.871 --> 01:46:43.160
That's where things get really squirrely because a lot of folks in the illegal

1723
01:46:43.161 --> 01:46:47.480
community,
they to work for cash.
They right.
They spend cash on their,

1724
01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:51.840
their bills,
cash to the grocery store.
The grocery store has a record of that.

1725
01:46:51.841 --> 01:46:54.180
They don't know who spent it,
but they know how much food they're selling.

1726
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:56.880
But it would be racist to check cause you'd have to check those,

1727
01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:01.510
those weird markets,
weird Spanish names.
He drive by like you go down van.

1728
01:47:01.511 --> 01:47:04.920
Oh and you see those,
you check all the markets.
Yeah,
I guess.

1729
01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:08.560
And then just just calculate how many people are buying that food.
Yeah.

1730
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.180
Look at you.
You clever bathroom.
He treated it like a goddamn poker game.

1731
01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:19.120
So how long have you been in [inaudible]?
Since September of 2011

1732
01:47:21.690 --> 01:47:25.680
and any plans on what about like Monaco or and those other places where you can

1733
01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:28.890
like this creepy?
Is it Monaco?
Is it creepy?

1734
01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:33.600
So much fucking money.
And they're so snobby.

1735
01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:37.570
So this is the guy who made 1,000,006 his first year playing poker.
Eh,

1736
01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.110
those fucking rich assholes.

1737
01:47:40.890 --> 01:47:43.020
You'll see a car drive by in the states.

1738
01:47:43.021 --> 01:47:46.890
It'll have like a handwritten sign in the window for sale.

1739
01:47:46.891 --> 01:47:51.360
$15,000 call this number
in Monaco.

1740
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:56.390
You'll see that only it'll be like the fucking McLaren or something for sale.

1741
01:47:57.690 --> 01:48:02.220
1.5 million euro.
She can really sign in the window.
Come on.
I seen that.

1742
01:48:02.221 --> 01:48:06.070
And Monica,
but Claren for sale.
Like well,

1743
01:48:06.071 --> 01:48:08.730
the little handmade signs.
I don't know shit about cars.

1744
01:48:08.731 --> 01:48:10.980
I might be guessing the wrong name,
but yeah.

1745
01:48:11.050 --> 01:48:15.090
Well it was really an expense for cars.
Wow,
that sounds crazy.

1746
01:48:15.091 --> 01:48:17.040
Why wouldn't they go to a broker?
The taxis,

1747
01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:20.040
they're all Cadillacs that much money.
Why wouldn't you go to,

1748
01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:22.530
if you have enough money for a fucking Mclaren,
not a,

1749
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:25.590
there's different Mclaren's.
There's,
uh,
there's,
uh,

1750
01:48:25.591 --> 01:48:28.230
I've talked about this in the podcast before people got upset at me,

1751
01:48:28.770 --> 01:48:33.540
but there's this,
so saying that Mclaren's don't sound very good.

1752
01:48:33.541 --> 01:48:35.280
And then they said,
what about this sounds awesome.

1753
01:48:35.610 --> 01:48:39.020
That's the million dollar Mclaren,
it's a million plus dollar.

1754
01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:42.540
Mclaren has this amazing sound to it.
But the regular Mclaren,

1755
01:48:42.541 --> 01:48:47.160
that's like I think 200 plus thousand.
It doesn't sound bad.

1756
01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.220
It just doesn't sound like a Ferrari.
Ferrari's have this

1757
01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:56.850
part of the,
the beauty of a Ferrari is the sound.
It makes the pat,

1758
01:48:57.150 --> 01:48:59.220
like people underestimate that.

1759
01:48:59.221 --> 01:49:03.510
That's one of the reasons why turbo charged cars aren't appealing to a lot of,

1760
01:49:03.511 --> 01:49:07.920
um,
real sports cars fanatics because they just don't have the same sound because

1761
01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:11.310
yeah,
the forced induction with the air,
it just doesn't,

1762
01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.880
it doesn't give the same exhaust sound so much so that a lot of turbo,

1763
01:49:15.210 --> 01:49:16.890
like some of the new turbo charged cars,

1764
01:49:16.891 --> 01:49:19.560
what they're actually doing is they're faking the sound.

1765
01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:24.330
So there's a thing called the sound synthesizer.
The use on the BMW m five.

1766
01:49:24.331 --> 01:49:28.830
You could turn it off,
praise Allah.
Um,
cause it's really gross.

1767
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:30.510
And when you,
when you have it on,

1768
01:49:30.511 --> 01:49:34.920
it's actually pumping sounds like engine sounds through your speakers.

1769
01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.760
So it uses a sound system of the car to make you think that you're making all

1770
01:49:41.131 --> 01:49:45.810
this engine.
Which cars?
The BMW m five,
which is a brilliant automobile,

1771
01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.040
but they just tacked that on cause it was too

1772
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:48.910
<v 2>quiet by default.</v>

1773
01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:53.990
<v 5>Well they used to have a v 10 and the V 10 was a monster engine.</v>

1774
01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:58.440
It was just a,
an incredible,
incredible engine.
And uh,

1775
01:49:58.590 --> 01:50:00.840
it made so much cool noise.

1776
01:50:00.841 --> 01:50:04.770
It was just like just fucking throaty deep,
powerful.

1777
01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:08.520
Pretty sure it was a v 10.
Hold on a second.
BMW V 10,
like pull it off real quick.

1778
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:13.860
Um,
uh,
W v done.
Um,

1779
01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:17.970
and they switched to a turbocharged engine.
Yeah,
yeah.
It was a v 10.

1780
01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:22.260
So they switched to a turbocharged engine for the new one.
It has more power,

1781
01:50:22.261 --> 01:50:26.820
more torque.
It's faster,
but it just doesn't sound as good.
It just doesn't,

1782
01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:30.270
you know,
the one that it,
you know,

1783
01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:34.980
it used to have this incredible whale to at this like here I'll play it for you

1784
01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.750
sound like a Ferrari

1785
01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:44.490
part of the best.
The delay.
Yeah.
Let me find this fucker.

1786
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:47.223
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1787
01:50:48.330 --> 01:50:48.751
<v 2>So anyway,</v>

1788
01:50:48.751 --> 01:50:52.680
what I was saying about Monaco is that more than any other place I've ever been

1789
01:50:52.681 --> 01:50:53.514
in the world,

1790
01:50:53.970 --> 01:50:58.970
there's this feeling that you don't belong there and that nobody is happy about

1791
01:50:59.131 --> 01:51:00.330
the fact that you turned up.

1792
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:04.380
Nobody's happy about the fact that you turned up like there,

1793
01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:09.030
there's one big poker tournament a year in Monaco that I have been to several

1794
01:51:09.031 --> 01:51:11.250
times and like

1795
01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:18.570
all the hotel staff and cab drivers and everybody else like that that I

1796
01:51:18.690 --> 01:51:23.690
interacted with there just seems like surprised and put off.

1797
01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:25.380
Then you're there.

1798
01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:30.740
There is like some young American dude who doesn't speak French who is in

1799
01:51:31.981 --> 01:51:33.060
Monica.
Yeah.

1800
01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:35.910
<v 5>Really?
So it's just a millionaire,
billionaire playboy.</v>

1801
01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:41.040
<v 2>Yeah.
And they want it for the rich French speaking people.</v>

1802
01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:46.490
<v 5>Hmm.
It doesn't like George Clooney lived there or some shit.
Yeah.
I mean</v>

1803
01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:49.640
<v 2>there are a bunch of people who are not French.</v>

1804
01:51:49.810 --> 01:51:53.730
<v 5>He's probably got like chateaus all around the world.
Sure,
sure.</v>

1805
01:51:53.731 --> 01:51:58.050
He knows chateau I shot too.

1806
01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:10.160
That's sort of BMW with a V 10.
Sounds like the new one series on one.

1807
01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:11.870
The new one sounds like a little bitch,

1808
01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:15.620
but the new one's a better car to catch 22.
It's like,

1809
01:52:15.621 --> 01:52:19.250
what are you going to do if you keep going with these bigger crazy throaty

1810
01:52:19.251 --> 01:52:24.230
engine.
So they just eat the gas,
they kill the seals and the Arctic shit

1811
01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:30.350
drown the polar bears,
the frozen glaciers and all that good stuff.
What is the,

1812
01:52:30.351 --> 01:52:34.640
uh,
the economy like in this multiply?
It's like,
what's a concern with

1813
01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:40.320
<v 2>a lot of it at this point has to do with,</v>

1814
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:41.340
<v 3>okay.</v>

1815
01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:45.980
<v 2>Foreign companies,
many of them in the online</v>

1816
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:47.600
<v 4>gaming industry a lot.</v>

1817
01:52:47.601 --> 01:52:51.360
Also just in banking and finance and stuff like that.

1818
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:54.080
<v 5>Is there a tricky laws there or something?
Is that when they move there?</v>

1819
01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:57.950
<v 4>Yeah,
it's uh,
some of the lowest tax rates in the EU.</v>

1820
01:52:58.010 --> 01:53:01.820
So like many small countries,

1821
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:03.830
it's like,
you know,

1822
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:09.210
Antigo or um,
saint Kitts are there,

1823
01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:14.220
there are a bunch of like island nations near the u s that have carved out a

1824
01:53:14.991 --> 01:53:19.991
niche for themselves as tax havens and business friendly economies.

1825
01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:26.260
Uh,
Malta has a bit of that going on as well.
So do you have,

1826
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:29.810
<v 5>do because you maintain your United States citizenship,
do you have to um,</v>

1827
01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:33.410
pay taxes there and here as well?
Is that how it works?

1828
01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:38.670
<v 4>Only here,
uh,
if I had become a resident,
like I was planning to,
um,</v>

1829
01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:42.930
which I never really finished that story.
Um,
if I'd be home president,

1830
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:46.140
a resident like I was planning to,
yes,
I would owe taxes there.

1831
01:53:46.350 --> 01:53:51.350
They have a tax treaty with the U S so I can deduct what I pay there against

1832
01:53:51.541 --> 01:53:54.450
what I would,
oh here you don't end up getting double taxed.

1833
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:56.183
<v 6>MMM.</v>

1834
01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:01.240
<v 4>But since I'm not a resident,
no,
I have no tax liability anywhere in the US.</v>

1835
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:04.450
<v 5>See.
But if you,
if you do become a residence somewhere else,</v>

1836
01:54:04.451 --> 01:54:06.760
you have to give up your residents here,
right?

1837
01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:11.500
<v 4>No,
not always.
I mean in this case,
not at all,</v>

1838
01:54:11.501 --> 01:54:15.010
that this isn't becoming a citizen,
this is just becoming a permanent resident.

1839
01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:19.120
So I don't get a Maltese passport or anything like that.

1840
01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:24.360
I get like a sticker that goes inside my us passport saying that I am a

1841
01:54:24.851 --> 01:54:26.200
registered permanent resident.

1842
01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:30.250
<v 5>Yeah.
There's a thing like that with um,
with Mexico.
Yeah.</v>

1843
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:33.310
All our resident visa,
something like that.

1844
01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:36.690
You could stay like six months at a time and then you have to go back and forth.

1845
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:38.220
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The,</v>

1846
01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:43.280
they're all kinds of visas for every country has their own set of rules and

1847
01:54:44.821 --> 01:54:47.930
different rules that apply to citizens of different other countries.

1848
01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:52.160
<v 5>And do you enjoy this,
this living in Malta and doing your online gambling now?</v>

1849
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:57.200
<v 4>Yeah.
Uh,
it's a pretty decent place to live.
Um,</v>

1850
01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:02.920
if I could live anywhere in the world and to keep playing online poker,

1851
01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:07.120
there's a decent chance I'd pick somewhere like San Francisco over Malta.

1852
01:55:07.210 --> 01:55:09.460
Why San Francisco?
I just really like it there.

1853
01:55:09.461 --> 01:55:14.461
I was like getting ready to move to there from Vegas just before the DOJ

1854
01:55:15.610 --> 01:55:16.443
crackdown

1855
01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:20.620
<v 5>just because of the atmosphere of the town.
Yes.
Nice place.
Great Place.</v>

1856
01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:23.740
Very smart.
Yeah.
One of the smartest cities I think in the country.

1857
01:55:24.590 --> 01:55:27.770
It's also like one of the most tech savvy.
There's so much,

1858
01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:32.520
so many tech people there.
A lot of complaints though.
The uh,
the folks who,
uh,

1859
01:55:32.610 --> 01:55:35.730
were there for a long time are complaining about the real estate prices have

1860
01:55:35.731 --> 01:55:38.410
just shot through the roof or regular people can't even afford to live there

1861
01:55:38.411 --> 01:55:40.820
anymore.
They can't afford to buy houses.
Cause I've,

1862
01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:44.330
I looked at the housing prices in the San Francisco,
it's a predictor,

1863
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:47.640
a $4 million houses like this,
like regular house.

1864
01:55:47.641 --> 01:55:51.450
Like how was that a $4 million houses on a $2 million house.

1865
01:55:51.451 --> 01:55:56.430
Maybe it was telling a $4 million house.
I have friends who live in Atherton.

1866
01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:59.190
Do you know where that is?
No,
it's the richest.

1867
01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:01.910
It's one of the richest neighborhoods in the country.
Okay.

1868
01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:06.990
It's just outside of San Francisco and it's fucking preposterous.

1869
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:12.320
Like their houses worth $15 million and it's not worth $15 million.

1870
01:56:13.231 --> 01:56:15.870
It's just not,
it's just they have a large backyard,

1871
01:56:15.871 --> 01:56:20.871
but it means not large if you live in Kansas and Nebraska or anywhere else,

1872
01:56:21.330 --> 01:56:25.020
it's just large for this one fucking area where it's just ridiculous.

1873
01:56:25.021 --> 01:56:28.560
Real estate.
I mean,
it doesn't make any sense.
Like you look at this,
you're like,

1874
01:56:28.561 --> 01:56:31.890
how could you ever pay $15 million for this fucking house?

1875
01:56:31.891 --> 01:56:35.630
It doesn't make any sense.
Yeah.
That shits crazy.
It's coming.

1876
01:56:35.631 --> 01:56:39.030
All this blackie fucking billionaire Google people live out there.

1877
01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:40.553
It's just too much.

1878
01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:45.810
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean it's supply and demand.
People want to live in this one spot.</v>

1879
01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:49.740
There's limited space and those people have a whole lot of money.

1880
01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:53.820
<v 5>It drives me crazy though,
that you can't live here.
Not that I love you so much,</v>

1881
01:56:54.330 --> 01:56:59.330
but it just drives me crazy that you have to like leave the country to do what

1882
01:56:59.671 --> 01:57:03.030
you do for a living because of some fucking goofy laws that were obviously

1883
01:57:03.031 --> 01:57:06.630
putting in place by criminals or people that are just shady as,
fuck.

1884
01:57:07.190 --> 01:57:11.970
I don't love it.
It's fucking awful.
It's awful.

1885
01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:15.520
So if it does change,
will it be like a,

1886
01:57:15.570 --> 01:57:19.890
something that's going to happen within the next decade or is it like,

1887
01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:24.030
I think so,
yeah.
I mean there's like pokerstars.net.

1888
01:57:24.031 --> 01:57:26.700
Do they try to work on that?
Are they?
Yeah.

1889
01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:27.653
<v 4>Uh,</v>

1890
01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:33.320
there is a pretty good chance that they will be in the New Jersey market in the

1891
01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:40.830
next year or so.
Uh,
cause you need to get regulatory approval.
Um,

1892
01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:46.820
and obviously the u s casino interests are trying to keep pokerstars out.

1893
01:57:47.850 --> 01:57:49.860
It's not a company owned by a mirror.

1894
01:57:50.130 --> 01:57:54.690
<v 5>There's just send donuts to the Chris Christie Guy's house over and over and</v>

1895
01:57:54.691 --> 01:57:55.351
over.
We're going to heal that.

1896
01:57:55.351 --> 01:58:00.351
The men donuts and hot dogs and maybe cheese pizza just keeps saying send food

1897
01:58:02.371 --> 01:58:06.360
to that guy's house.
He'll say yes,
he loves food.

1898
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:10.290
He loves food probably as much as he loves money and money buys food.

1899
01:58:10.291 --> 01:58:13.860
And this is like,
you cut out the middle man,
just send them the food.
He it,

1900
01:58:14.130 --> 01:58:18.050
it looks like he's pretty enthusiastic about food.
Yeah.

1901
01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:22.740
He's not enthusiastic about Tesla's.
He's won't allow them to direct sell Teslas,

1902
01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.340
which is just shady as fuck.
I don't,
I don't know about that.

1903
01:58:26.610 --> 01:58:29.760
You didn't know about that?
What's the story with that?
I'll Google it.

1904
01:58:29.761 --> 01:58:34.470
So I have all the information so I don't fuck anything up.
But uh,
tests La,

1905
01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:40.020
New Jersey,
Christie,
he's just gross.
I just,

1906
01:58:40.021 --> 01:58:44.110
I,
Christy says Tesla criticism is complete crap.

1907
01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:48.130
He's such a fucking slob.
Um,

1908
01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:52.690
conservative criticism over his administration's decision to stop Tesla from

1909
01:58:52.691 --> 01:58:57.010
selling cars and it's showrooms in New Jersey's complete crap.
The fact is,

1910
01:58:57.011 --> 01:59:01.180
we looked away for a year to allow Tesla to do what they were doing and we

1911
01:59:01.181 --> 01:59:05.470
couldn't look away any longer.
Look away.
What do you,
what does that mean?

1912
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:08.570
<v 7>They put,
they had already been selling cars in New Jersey.</v>

1913
01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:11.990
They could interpret to stop them from doing that,

1914
01:59:12.110 --> 01:59:14.720
but they didn't for a little while and then decided they would,

1915
01:59:15.170 --> 01:59:18.130
the company cannot sell their cars from the showroom.

1916
01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:20.900
They have two showrooms for the company cannot sell their cars from the

1917
01:59:20.901 --> 01:59:21.860
showrooms or

1918
01:59:22.190 --> 01:59:24.380
<v 5>offer the customers test drives.</v>

1919
01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:29.480
The Jersey Law on the books since the 1970s requires cars to be sold through the

1920
01:59:29.481 --> 01:59:34.220
traditional dealership model.
Okay.
He says,
I don't like the law either.

1921
01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:36.260
I didn't vote for it,
I didn't sign it,

1922
01:59:36.650 --> 01:59:41.390
but I don't get to just ignore the laws that I don't like.
Hmm.
Okay.

1923
01:59:41.391 --> 01:59:42.940
Well that actually makes sense.
Yeah,

1924
01:59:43.070 --> 01:59:48.070
so probably was bitten food out when he said though probably had shit flying out

1925
01:59:48.411 --> 01:59:49.244
of his teeth.

1926
01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:53.270
<v 7>Somebody sued or whatever and they couldn't ignore it.
No,</v>

1927
01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:54.770
<v 5>maybe.
Yeah,</v>

1928
01:59:54.890 --> 01:59:58.790
probably something or someone paid someone off or something like that.

1929
01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:04.090
It's just gross.
I just,
I don't understand it.

1930
02:00:04.110 --> 02:00:07.450
First of all,
it doesn't make any sense.
Why would you have a,

1931
02:00:07.451 --> 02:00:08.720
a law like that in place?

1932
02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:11.600
The only reason why a law like that would be in place because someone paid

1933
02:00:11.601 --> 02:00:12.434
somebody off.

1934
02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:13.210
<v 7>Does it mean,</v>

1935
02:00:13.210 --> 02:00:18.140
I guess in theory the idea is you should need to have a license to sell cars.

1936
02:00:18.141 --> 02:00:21.560
Otherwise you might sell people real shitty cars that fall apart and then

1937
02:00:21.561 --> 02:00:26.561
disappear and not be accountable for selling people cars that don't work.

1938
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:33.950
I guess they're,
the rule was actually a result of a backroom deal.

1939
02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:38.060
Electric car makers chairman charges.
Hmm,
okay.

1940
02:00:38.061 --> 02:00:39.590
The Anti Tesla rule,

1941
02:00:39.591 --> 02:00:43.730
a new rule that effectively bands direct to consumer car sales.

1942
02:00:43.850 --> 02:00:48.260
This is what it's saying in this one article that is in a New jersey.com.

1943
02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.920
Oh,
this is sounding pretty suspect.

1944
02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:55.490
It's for specifically direct to consumer.

1945
02:00:55.670 --> 02:01:00.670
So like there has to be a middleman broker.

1946
02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:05.930
You have to have a manufacturer who sells to a dealer who sells to consumer and

1947
02:01:05.931 --> 02:01:10.130
Tesla was selling manufacturer to consumer and so they had to crack down on
that.

1948
02:01:10.131 --> 02:01:12.430
Is that what's going on?
Elon Musk,
the way he said it.

1949
02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:17.240
<v 5>Uh,
he said that if you believe that the law on the books protecting dealers are</v>

1950
02:01:17.241 --> 02:01:18.350
there for the good a consumer,

1951
02:01:18.351 --> 02:01:21.630
then governor Christie has a bridge closure that he wants to sell you,

1952
02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:28.790
which is of course in reference to the scandal where that slob closed down a

1953
02:01:28.791 --> 02:01:33.791
bridge for whatever political reason that had nothing to do with safety or the

1954
02:01:34.671 --> 02:01:38.930
health and welfare of the citizens is some political pressure.
Uh,

1955
02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:43.580
Christie has promised that this would be put to a vote of the elected state

1956
02:01:43.581 --> 02:01:46.670
legislature,
which is the appropriate way to change the law.

1957
02:01:46.671 --> 02:01:50.630
Musk said when it became apparent that the auto deal or La Brea Oh,
okay.

1958
02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:53.090
When it became apparent to the auto dealer lobby,

1959
02:01:53.091 --> 02:01:54.710
that this approach would not succeed.

1960
02:01:54.711 --> 02:01:58.190
They cut it back room deal with the governor to circumvent the legislative

1961
02:01:58.191 --> 02:02:03.191
process and pass a regulation that is fundamentally contrary to the intent of

1962
02:02:03.261 --> 02:02:08.120
the law.
Okay.
So he's a bullshit artist,
which makes sense.
Sounds about right.

1963
02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:11.570
Yeah,
that makes sense.
So New Jersey,
he's got a bunch of issues.

1964
02:02:11.571 --> 02:02:13.910
This is also the same guy who is morbidly obese,

1965
02:02:13.911 --> 02:02:17.990
but said that he's going to stop marijuana from being legal in his town than it

1966
02:02:17.991 --> 02:02:22.100
won't be legal in his state,
rather on his watch because of the children.

1967
02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:28.070
You know,
how about the children looking at you as their leader?

1968
02:02:28.071 --> 02:02:33.071
This morbidly obese person that's giving out any health related advice

1969
02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:38.840
whatsoever,
you know,
just drives me fucking bananas,
that kind of Shit.

1970
02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:41.740
And of course they have,

1971
02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:46.420
I don't have anything against fat people being elected to office,
but I do.

1972
02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:51.840
Yeah.
Yeah.
Morbidly obese.
I just don't think it's right.
Really?
No.

1973
02:02:52.050 --> 02:02:55.840
Oh,
okay.
Around
fucking around.
I mean,

1974
02:02:55.841 --> 02:02:59.020
if they're really know if they're really good at their job,
fuck yeah,

1975
02:02:59.030 --> 02:03:01.560
there should be,
but he's not good at his job.

1976
02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:05.040
It doesn't seem that white frat and he's a hypocrite.
It's just,
well,
I,
you know,

1977
02:03:05.041 --> 02:03:09.090
my issue became only with the marijuana thing,

1978
02:03:09.091 --> 02:03:13.170
which is marijuana is near and dear to my heart.
It's a fucking fantastic plant.

1979
02:03:13.171 --> 02:03:14.610
And I think it aids evolution.

1980
02:03:14.910 --> 02:03:17.860
And so I see some non-involved morbidly obese person.

1981
02:03:17.861 --> 02:03:18.900
It doesn't care about his health.

1982
02:03:18.901 --> 02:03:22.890
And he's trying to push what he's talking about it from a health perspective and

1983
02:03:22.891 --> 02:03:23.970
worrying about the children.

1984
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:29.130
Not only that he's citing studies that he doesn't understand non biased studies

1985
02:03:29.131 --> 02:03:30.640
that he doesn't understand at all.

1986
02:03:30.710 --> 02:03:33.900
Government studies on that stuff for and ignoring shady.
Yeah.

1987
02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:38.040
Ignoring all the positive benefits studies that have just time and time again

1988
02:03:38.041 --> 02:03:41.440
been pushed aside because of their agenda.
Well,
yeah,

1989
02:03:41.441 --> 02:03:43.170
and I mean in my opinion you don't even need

1990
02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:47.570
<v 4>did demonstrate that there's anything positive about it for it to be clear that</v>

1991
02:03:47.571 --> 02:03:51.830
it should be legal.
It just from a harm reduction standpoint,

1992
02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:56.360
people are gonna smoke weed,

1993
02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:01.400
whether or not you tell them it's legal and if you make it illegal then they're

1994
02:04:01.901 --> 02:04:04.810
going to have to deal with criminals to do it and they're going to be putting

1995
02:04:04.811 --> 02:04:09.790
themselves in danger and there's going to be more crime than the associated

1996
02:04:09.791 --> 02:04:11.780
grime that goes with that.
And

1997
02:04:11.970 --> 02:04:14.580
<v 5>not only that,
people are going to be locked up,
which is more harm.
Yeah.</v>

1998
02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:18.690
Which is ridiculous.
Blocking people out for nonviolent drug offenses is archaic.

1999
02:04:18.691 --> 02:04:20.100
It's stupid.
In fact,

2000
02:04:20.101 --> 02:04:23.130
the World Health Organization just recently called for the decriminalization of

2001
02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:27.060
all of that.
Yeah.
Fascinating.
Absolutely.
Think it's absolutely the right thing.

2002
02:04:27.090 --> 02:04:30.090
It is the right thing.
If you can have drugs and you can't have drugs,

2003
02:04:30.091 --> 02:04:34.230
there's goddamn plenty of drugs.
There's a moon God over this a thousand times,

2004
02:04:34.231 --> 02:04:38.430
but go to any corner liquor store.
You could drink yourself to death.

2005
02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:40.190
You go to any drugstore.

2006
02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:44.970
There's a liquor aisle that's filled with enough booze to kill dozens of people.

2007
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:49.700
Oh yeah.
We live in a preposterous Lee hypocritical society.

2008
02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:52.370
Is Malta like that?
Can you get good weed and Malta,

2009
02:04:52.690 --> 02:04:54.160
<v 4>was it like,
no,</v>

2010
02:04:54.161 --> 02:04:58.720
Malta is pre the repressive on the drug laws.

2011
02:04:58.820 --> 02:05:02.000
<v 5>Really.
It's a Catholic country.
Uh,
those fucks.</v>

2012
02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:06.750
So what happens if you get caught with a joint in Malta?
Ah,
def?

2013
02:05:07.770 --> 02:05:08.110
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

2014
02:05:08.110 --> 02:05:10.960
<v 4>potentially a good bit of time in jail.
A joint.</v>

2015
02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:16.330
I don't know that the fucked up thing with multidrug laws is that they really

2016
02:05:16.331 --> 02:05:19.540
don't draw a lot of distinctions between one drug and the next.

2017
02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:23.710
And there's a bit of a growing heroin problem there.

2018
02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:29.100
And so there's a bit of a push for harsher drug laws.

2019
02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:35.510
Chick crack down on that and there've been a couple cases of

2020
02:05:39.190 --> 02:05:44.190
that spilling over into weed and people getting in a lot of trouble for a

2021
02:05:44.591 --> 02:05:45.820
relatively small amount of weed.

2022
02:05:46.410 --> 02:05:48.180
<v 5>That kind of makes sense.
That does happen.</v>

2023
02:05:48.181 --> 02:05:52.200
A lot of these smaller countries or countries that are just not as
sophisticated.

2024
02:05:52.201 --> 02:05:56.820
They turned the lump drugs together and oftentimes they also tend to prosecute

2025
02:05:56.821 --> 02:06:01.410
people bakes based on the weight of the plant and they pick up the pot with the

2026
02:06:01.411 --> 02:06:06.210
plant.
Like the pot,
like the grows in.
Yeah,
the dirt,
the soil itself,

2027
02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:09.540
and they count all that as you're jogging,
you know,

2028
02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:13.020
be like if you found someone who had marijuana plants in their house

2029
02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:15.730
<v 4>and you know you weighed everything,</v>

2030
02:06:15.970 --> 02:06:20.490
it's like probably a few ounces smokeable marijuana,
but it's like,
yeah,

2031
02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:24.400
<v 5>many dozens of pounds of stuff associated with it.
Yeah,</v>

2032
02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:29.560
it's like a sneaky little fucking loophole that prosecutors use.
You know,

2033
02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:31.040
it's just gross.
It's just,

2034
02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:35.410
it's just when you make you make criminals out of people that are just doing

2035
02:06:35.411 --> 02:06:38.500
what they want to do,
that doesn't harm anybody else.
It's just,
it's,
it's,

2036
02:06:38.530 --> 02:06:41.560
it's a loophole and it just shows you that you have too many laws.
I mean,

2037
02:06:41.561 --> 02:06:43.330
that's what it is.
It becomes bureaucracy.

2038
02:06:43.331 --> 02:06:48.270
It becomes red tape and it becomes a machine that needs fuel to feed itself and

2039
02:06:48.271 --> 02:06:48.580
then yeah,

2040
02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:53.580
<v 4>getting to the point that everyone's a criminal and that they can just pick and</v>

2041
02:06:53.861 --> 02:06:57.760
choose who needs to be taken down and sent to jail.

2042
02:06:57.970 --> 02:07:02.970
And so that the criminal justice system just becomes a vehicle for

2043
02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:11.160
discrimination and oppression because if you interpret the laws to the maximum

2044
02:07:15.010 --> 02:07:19.570
stringency were all felons for a million different reasons.

2045
02:07:19.650 --> 02:07:21.080
I'm sure the shit you do on the Internet,

2046
02:07:21.081 --> 02:07:25.540
so felony a bunch of the shit you own in your house as a felony.
Mike,

2047
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.940
<v 5>have you do both of those?
You're a fucking double criminal.
Yeah.</v>

2048
02:07:28.970 --> 02:07:32.330
Smoking Pot and gambling online,
you dirty bastard,
you got to get you up.

2049
02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:36.020
That's trading videos that didn't pay for like,

2050
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:38.610
<v 0>yeah.
Well that's a tricky one,
man.</v>

2051
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:41.840
That's a tricky one because I think that as time goes on it,

2052
02:07:41.841 --> 02:07:46.841
it does seem to be changing in making access to legal purchasable versions of

2053
02:07:48.361 --> 02:07:50.520
these movies and things seems to be much,
much,

2054
02:07:50.521 --> 02:07:54.420
much easier than it used to be a while back.
And you know,

2055
02:07:54.421 --> 02:07:57.940
I'm not in favor of putting anyone in jail for downloading things.
Right.

2056
02:07:58.470 --> 02:08:02.970
But you're going to have to deal with what is a downloadable copy of something.

2057
02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:07.950
I mean,
what is that?
There's a lot of ethical arguments both ways.

2058
02:08:07.951 --> 02:08:12.140
I liked the argument that the people that have downloaded things when they,

2059
02:08:12.141 --> 02:08:13.530
you know,
start calling him piracy,

2060
02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:15.930
they will know it's not piracy because it was piracy.

2061
02:08:15.931 --> 02:08:19.170
I would take yours and you wouldn't have it anymore.
It's a copy.

2062
02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:21.420
And that's so true.
And this is just,

2063
02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:26.980
it's one more example of how people want to use these black and white sort of

2064
02:08:28.801 --> 02:08:32.580
definitions of things that exists for physical,
you know,

2065
02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:34.050
carbon based,

2066
02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:39.090
the hard things that you can put on a scale that you simply can't do when it

2067
02:08:39.091 --> 02:08:42.050
comes to digital content.
You just can't,
you can't do,

2068
02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:46.690
<v 4>applying property laws to ideas gets pretty complicated.</v>

2069
02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:51.840
Especially ideas where you're not stealing the idea for a profit like you when

2070
02:08:52.001 --> 02:08:56.380
you take in so much enjoying the idea without paying for it.
Yeah,
it's weird,

2071
02:08:56.381 --> 02:08:59.320
right?
And I'm not saying it's okay to do,
I'm not either.

2072
02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:01.390
My Dad's a writer there,

2073
02:09:01.391 --> 02:09:06.391
there are professional artists in my family who need to make a living by selling

2074
02:09:07.601 --> 02:09:10.720
their art.
And if you can get all the art you want for free,

2075
02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:12.340
that's fucking them over.

2076
02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:16.580
<v 0>It is.
But I think that there's room in this country for,
uh,</v>

2077
02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:20.480
ethical consideration by the consumer.
So like,
to put it this way,

2078
02:09:20.481 --> 02:09:23.060
like I remember when Napster was around,

2079
02:09:23.330 --> 02:09:27.530
there was a bunch of people that were downloading things for free off of
Napster.

2080
02:09:27.531 --> 02:09:28.880
They were doing the peer to peer thing,

2081
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:33.910
but a lot of people had this sort of really cool ethical consideration where

2082
02:09:34.101 --> 02:09:37.370
they would take,
like if they've got something and they liked it,

2083
02:09:37.371 --> 02:09:39.320
they would go buy it.
They would say,
Hey,

2084
02:09:39.321 --> 02:09:43.370
I owe this guy this fucking album kicks ass.
I'll go buy it.
You know?

2085
02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:47.600
And they also would become fans of the band and then they would go see the band

2086
02:09:47.601 --> 02:09:48.380
live,

2087
02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:52.070
which is even better for the band because then it's more profitable for the band

2088
02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:55.310
as opposed to like the record where they get kind of pennies on the dollar,

2089
02:09:55.311 --> 02:09:59.480
they would get a much larger chunk,
you know?
So there's,

2090
02:10:00.890 --> 02:10:02.630
there's a lot of shit going on,
you know what I mean?

2091
02:10:02.631 --> 02:10:05.450
How is it different that you could download music for free?

2092
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:08.180
How is that different in some ways than the radio?

2093
02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:11.570
Is it just because it's a better copy because the fucking radio is playing your

2094
02:10:11.571 --> 02:10:12.830
music all day long

2095
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.970
<v 4>cause you have to pay for your radio music by listening to the eds in between.</v>

2096
02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:19.000
<v 0>Right,
right.
But to,</v>

2097
02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:22.580
aren't you paying for your bandwidth that you use to download it?

2098
02:10:22.581 --> 02:10:24.560
I mean it all gets squirrely.

2099
02:10:24.670 --> 02:10:26.570
<v 4>Yeah.
It's all pretty complicated.</v>

2100
02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:32.220
My point in bringing that up wasn't that I think it's wrong that there are laws

2101
02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:36.530
regulating what you can and can't download without paying for it,

2102
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:41.770
but just that it creates a fucked up situation when the laws are such that if

2103
02:10:43.821 --> 02:10:45.140
the government decides to,

2104
02:10:45.141 --> 02:10:47.630
they've got a reason to put fucking anyone they want in jail.

2105
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:48.111
<v 0>Well,</v>

2106
02:10:48.111 --> 02:10:52.700
especially now that you're there literally downloading every single voicemail

2107
02:10:52.730 --> 02:10:54.410
that you've ever said,

2108
02:10:54.770 --> 02:10:58.550
every single email that you send from now till fucking,

2109
02:10:58.551 --> 02:11:02.480
who knows when we'll be in some NSA database somewhere and they might go look

2110
02:11:02.481 --> 02:11:03.800
through your shit and who knows?

2111
02:11:03.801 --> 02:11:07.220
You might have said something completely joking like this,
look,

2112
02:11:07.221 --> 02:11:10.940
this poker shit isn't working out so I'm going to start robbing babies and

2113
02:11:10.941 --> 02:11:12.410
fucking,
you know,
whatever.

2114
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:16.220
Shooting banks up and take all their money and then they say,
oh,

2115
02:11:16.221 --> 02:11:18.830
that's criminal intent and this is a terrorist that

2116
02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:23.440
<v 4>the super fucked up thing that they do is they,
I'm pretty sure this is accurate.</v>

2117
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:26.830
Um,
if I'm spouting conspiracy theory bullshit here,

2118
02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:28.270
someone called me out on area,

2119
02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:32.170
but I'm pretty sure they find that shit.

2120
02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:37.440
They leak the information to the FBI or the local police who then basically

2121
02:11:39.641 --> 02:11:44.641
conduct a sham investigation to find the information legally so that they can

2122
02:11:45.611 --> 02:11:46.444
use it in court.

2123
02:11:46.690 --> 02:11:50.440
But they already know what they're looking for because the NSA got it illegally

2124
02:11:50.441 --> 02:11:51.520
and just gave it to them.

2125
02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:54.060
<v 0>Yes,
that's exactly what they do.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2126
02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:58.580
So that should be illegal.
That that Shit's insane.

2127
02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:01.740
Sneaky as fuck my,
depending on pound what you're doing,

2128
02:12:01.741 --> 02:12:02.760
and that's where it gets squirrely.

2129
02:12:02.761 --> 02:12:06.930
If it turns out you're involved in trafficking,
human trafficking,
and you know,

2130
02:12:06.931 --> 02:12:09.030
selling children to sex slavery.

2131
02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:09.361
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

2132
02:12:09.361 --> 02:12:14.361
there's shit that's bad enough that it becomes just difficult question of what

2133
02:12:14.911 --> 02:12:17.880
rights you can trample to keep people from doing that.

2134
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:22.630
<v 0>Yeah.
But there's gotta be a better way.
Just gotta be right.
And also,</v>

2135
02:12:22.631 --> 02:12:23.950
if our society was just,

2136
02:12:23.951 --> 02:12:27.490
and if all the laws that were in place were in place in order to actual party

2137
02:12:27.550 --> 02:12:31.840
actually protect people,
protect people from being victimized by bad people,

2138
02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:35.020
but that's not what's going on.
I mean,
it's like,
especially when you come,

2139
02:12:35.021 --> 02:12:37.450
when you're dealing with most drug laws,

2140
02:12:37.451 --> 02:12:41.860
if there no one's getting victimized by pot,
it's just they're just not,
you know,

2141
02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:43.870
they tried to push it for a while that they were,

2142
02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:47.080
do you mind when they used to have those commercials where these two fucking no

2143
02:12:47.081 --> 02:12:49.600
nonsense guys would be eating dinner and uh,

2144
02:12:49.630 --> 02:12:54.070
like the guy would be saying that if you buy drugs,
you support terrorism period.

2145
02:12:54.210 --> 02:12:55.340
Right.
And He'd,

2146
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:59.020
Kelly kept eating like to tell you like look like it was like giving you this,

2147
02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:01.450
this feeling of authority.
Like it's your dad.

2148
02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:04.000
It's side of your fucking stupid nonsense.

2149
02:13:04.001 --> 02:13:08.140
They'd been talking with your friends around.
He's like,
no,
listen,
listen.
Period.

2150
02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:11.020
End of discussion.
If you buy drugs,

2151
02:13:11.110 --> 02:13:14.550
you're supporting terrorism and he's eating the salad.
Something like,

2152
02:13:14.551 --> 02:13:15.580
what the fuck is this?

2153
02:13:15.850 --> 02:13:20.200
What is this weird psychological message you guys are trying to do?

2154
02:13:20.201 --> 02:13:21.910
You remember that day?
You know what I'm talking about?

2155
02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:22.741
<v 4>No,</v>

2156
02:13:22.741 --> 02:13:27.741
I'm pretty sure my buddy Dave and as a guy named Jeff who are these mushrooms

2157
02:13:27.781 --> 02:13:28.380
and his claws.

2158
02:13:28.380 --> 02:13:32.610
<v 0>Yeah,
well especially with pot.
I mean,
I was buying it directly</v>

2159
02:13:32.610 --> 02:13:36.480
<v 5>from the guys who are growing it.
So there was no terrorism involved there.
Man.</v>

2160
02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:40.770
They might a terrorize fertilizer,
pop the top and pour it into the ground.

2161
02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:46.560
Let me just so silly.
I mean there is a little truth to that.

2162
02:13:46.561 --> 02:13:50.220
Like if you buy cocaine somewhere up the chain,

2163
02:13:50.221 --> 02:13:55.221
there are some fucked up people involved in getting cocaine to you.

2164
02:13:56.250 --> 02:14:00.660
And you know why?
Because cocaine is illegal.

2165
02:14:00.690 --> 02:14:04.680
It's illegal for cocaine was legal.
You'd be buying it from Merck tech curve.

2166
02:14:04.681 --> 02:14:08.250
Fucking,
you know,
Glaxo Smith Kline or something like that.

2167
02:14:08.610 --> 02:14:12.150
They'd be selling cocaine there.
Of course.
Just ethically,
Hey,

2168
02:14:12.151 --> 02:14:15.030
just like Jack Daniels,
they have a commercial for it back then.

2169
02:14:15.031 --> 02:14:18.810
Oles have you seen it?
I mean is what he,
yeah,
pull it up.
What's,

2170
02:14:18.811 --> 02:14:21.750
let's watch this fucking goofy ass commercial cause this is,

2171
02:14:21.810 --> 02:14:25.140
it's quite hilarious how they treat you like you're a fucking monkey.

2172
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:29.460
Let's take a look at this.
Yeah,
this is exactly it.
This is so funny.

2173
02:14:30.570 --> 02:14:31.403
Watch this.

2174
02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:36.980
<v 8>It's employing this drug money,
funds terror.</v>

2175
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:40.010
It's employing a manipulation.

2176
02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:46.590
Money,
funds,
terror.
I mean,
why should I believe that?
Because it's a fat fat.

2177
02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:52.820
So you're saying that I shouldn't believe it because it's true.
That's,

2178
02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:54.900
that's your argument and his true.

2179
02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:03.030
<v 5>So the guy in the left,
the first guy is a moron.</v>

2180
02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:06.710
The handsome guy and the older gentlemen is like his,

2181
02:15:07.530 --> 02:15:11.220
it's the dumbest fucking ad ever because there's nothing being said.

2182
02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:16.030
It's two dickheads.
Why is that convincing who?

2183
02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:18.720
That was a good idea.
Because people are scared of their dad.

2184
02:15:20.210 --> 02:15:22.680
It's convincing for people that are scared of the Dat.
No.
Yeah.

2185
02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:24.030
Who's going to fucking see that and go,

2186
02:15:24.031 --> 02:15:26.610
I don't want that guy eaten salad to be mad at me so I'm not going to buy drugs.

2187
02:15:26.940 --> 02:15:29.220
Like completely ineffective.

2188
02:15:29.250 --> 02:15:33.720
Like absolutely 100% of the fact that like not one person watch that ad and

2189
02:15:33.721 --> 02:15:37.470
didn't do drugs.
Matter of fact,
I did more drugs because of that ad.

2190
02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:41.880
I got mad and I did extra drugs because it's so fucking stupid.

2191
02:15:42.690 --> 02:15:45.030
They treat you like you're a moron,
like somehow or another.

2192
02:15:45.031 --> 02:15:49.200
That's all you have to say.
Like first of all,
the that was pre internet.

2193
02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:51.540
This was like 2001 not pre-internet,

2194
02:15:51.541 --> 02:15:53.760
but pre the effect of the Internet and social media.

2195
02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:55.770
Social media really changed the whole game.

2196
02:15:55.771 --> 02:15:58.230
The way people communicate and the way they understand information.

2197
02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:02.640
That was pre social media because you can't have those kinds of arguments.

2198
02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:04.980
You just can't.
You can't say cause it's fact.

2199
02:16:05.010 --> 02:16:09.240
Fac t o Q can fucking spell fact must be right.

2200
02:16:09.970 --> 02:16:10.803
He sold.

2201
02:16:11.010 --> 02:16:13.770
Have that guy come over here and sit them down for a podcast for three hours.

2202
02:16:13.771 --> 02:16:17.430
I'll dissect that dude.
I'll send him through the fucking vita mix.

2203
02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:21.240
Splice them up.
Silly Bitch.
It's ridiculous.

2204
02:16:21.241 --> 02:16:25.910
It's a ridiculous way to expressing an opinion.
Yeah,
you,
you know.

2205
02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:30.310
First of all,
you can't make an argument about terrorism and drugs

2206
02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:33.100
<v 0>in a 32nd commercial.
It's just physically not possible.</v>

2207
02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:35.110
You don't have the really complicated issue.

2208
02:16:35.290 --> 02:16:39.460
It is as complex as as biological life itself,

2209
02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:41.560
I mean is unbelievably complex.

2210
02:16:41.561 --> 02:16:46.561
If you want to break down the root cause of addiction where drugs come from,

2211
02:16:47.681 --> 02:16:52.330
what is a drug?
What are the effects?
Why does this one term drug?

2212
02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:56.380
Why is it a blanket that we throw over things that save lives,

2213
02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:59.650
that enhance cognitive function and productivity,

2214
02:16:59.651 --> 02:17:03.670
like caffeine and things that kill you and things that are bad for you and

2215
02:17:03.671 --> 02:17:06.100
things that makes life more interesting.

2216
02:17:06.310 --> 02:17:10.000
There's all together under this one big blanket called drugs.

2217
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:12.430
So if you're saying if you buy drugs,
you support terrorism.

2218
02:17:12.550 --> 02:17:14.410
If you have a cup of coffee after your meal,

2219
02:17:14.411 --> 02:17:18.550
I'm going to stab you cause you're a fucking drug user.
Crazy asshole.

2220
02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:21.850
You're going to have a whiskey on the rocks like a gentlemen,
you piece of Shit.

2221
02:17:22.310 --> 02:17:24.970
He's just like a,
it's madness.
It's like,

2222
02:17:25.210 --> 02:17:28.150
and that's all the kind of shit that was available,
you know,

2223
02:17:28.151 --> 02:17:31.210
that they or was out there before,
you know,

2224
02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:34.420
the social media aspect of the Internet made that preposterous.

2225
02:17:34.590 --> 02:17:38.200
You could you imagine the Twitter response if somebody tried to put a fucking

2226
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:41.020
video like that,
you know,
Hashtag yes.

2227
02:17:41.021 --> 02:17:45.070
All Drugs Hashtag yes.
All drugs would be the fucking,

2228
02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:49.810
the parity,
a attack of it.
They're still out there.
They're still putting out,

2229
02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:54.580
not like that.
Not that bad.
What is one that you could think of?
Um,

2230
02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:55.481
Jamie,

2231
02:17:55.481 --> 02:17:59.890
see if you can look up recent anti-drug propaganda commercial because I don't

2232
02:17:59.891 --> 02:18:04.600
think they do them anymore.
I really think that there's so idiotic.

2233
02:18:05.050 --> 02:18:09.820
If one child went without a school lunch that was funded by the state,

2234
02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.670
if one teacher got paid one extra dollar,

2235
02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:16.420
someone who made that video should get their dick kicked into a fucking meaty

2236
02:18:16.421 --> 02:18:20.950
pulp.
Cause it's just,
it's just a waste of money.
It's a waste of taxpayer money.

2237
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:24.460
Not only that,
most of that shit,
when you see that,

2238
02:18:24.490 --> 02:18:28.810
remember that talking dog like,
yeah.
Then Z,
a wishy leading new drugs.

2239
02:18:28.811 --> 02:18:32.560
That was the one I was about to bring up.
Isn't that pretty recent?
A fairly,

2240
02:18:32.561 --> 02:18:35.920
it was on my 2009 comedy special,

2241
02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:41.220
so I'm assuming that it was 2007 or eight and it was just mocked mercilessly.

2242
02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:44.020
I wish you wouldn't smoke

2243
02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:50.680
and miss me friend.
Fucking retarded sponsorship.

2244
02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:53.650
That's all made by a partnership for drug free America.

2245
02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:55.330
The problem with that of course,

2246
02:18:55.331 --> 02:18:59.470
is a partnership for a drug free America has received millions of dollars from

2247
02:18:59.471 --> 02:19:03.550
alcohol,
tobacco,
and pharmaceutical companies.
So,
of course,

2248
02:19:03.610 --> 02:19:07.270
my joke was that that's like hookers making commercials against strippers.

2249
02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:08.920
That's really what it's like.

2250
02:19:08.921 --> 02:19:13.180
It's pretty much like alcohol companies making commercials against pot or

2251
02:19:13.181 --> 02:19:15.310
pharmaceutical drug commercials making commercials against.

2252
02:19:15.310 --> 02:19:18.490
But it's preposterous.
It's just,
it's just idiotic.
Is there more,

2253
02:19:18.491 --> 02:19:22.720
is there something recently the foundation for a drug free world.
Oh,

2254
02:19:22.721 --> 02:19:26.020
a world filled with,
first of all,
before we talk about this,

2255
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:28.820
if you're interested in any of this stuff,
like really in depth,

2256
02:19:28.821 --> 02:19:32.600
I recommend Dr Karl Heart's work.
Dr. Carl Hart,

2257
02:19:32.601 --> 02:19:36.350
who has been a podcast guest and what was his name of his book?

2258
02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:41.090
You remember his book?
Um,
uh,
here,
I'll pull it up real quick.

2259
02:19:41.091 --> 02:19:43.720
Dr. Carl Hart.
Um,

2260
02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:48.710
he had a great point and one of his,
a high price high price.
Yeah.

2261
02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:50.870
He's brilliant.
Just a brilliant guy.

2262
02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:55.900
And he's the socio professor of psychology and Psychiatry at Columbia University

2263
02:19:56.211 --> 02:20:00.920
and he,
uh,
is well known for his research and drug use and abuse.
And uh,
his,

2264
02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:04.850
his statement is so clear that it's just the best statement.

2265
02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:10.240
Not only is they're never going to be a drug free America or drug free world,

2266
02:20:10.851 --> 02:20:14.660
you wouldn't want it.
Yeah,
of course you wouldn't like why would you take drugs?

2267
02:20:14.661 --> 02:20:16.670
Our technology,
you know the,

2268
02:20:16.730 --> 02:20:21.730
the reason they exist is because they're effective has because we have figured

2269
02:20:21.771 --> 02:20:25.340
out that there's ways that we can manipulate the way our mind works and the way

2270
02:20:25.341 --> 02:20:29.660
our body works,
the way our body feels for good and for bad.

2271
02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:32.300
And like all things in life.

2272
02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:38.020
Human beings have tools and those tools can be abused or they can be used and

2273
02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:41.180
they can use be used for the greater good of mankind.

2274
02:20:41.210 --> 02:20:44.660
And that's a drug is just like that.
And it's just like a tool.
Absolutely.

2275
02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:47.450
What does it,
the apple commercials,
a bunch of them on this play.

2276
02:20:47.451 --> 02:20:49.100
One of these goofy fucking things

2277
02:20:50.010 --> 02:20:54.000
<v 8>and in the United States have tried drugs or alcohol by the time they're 13</v>

2278
02:20:54.001 --> 02:20:58.770
years old,
a third of teens have gone to a house party.
Boy There was alcohol,
pot,

2279
02:20:58.830 --> 02:21:02.930
cocaine,
ecstasy are prescription drugs.
Over half those kids,

2280
02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:05.800
they would today sneak use of an or statement.
They won.

2281
02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:10.140
Seven out of 10 teenagers had been offered an illegal drug.

2282
02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:15.720
Teenagers whose parents talk to them about drugs are 42% less likely to use

2283
02:21:15.721 --> 02:21:18.830
drugs.
Okay,
well that,
that's a good commercial.

2284
02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:23.440
<v 0>I mean that's,
that's,
that's like talk to your kids.
Does that make sense?</v>

2285
02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:24.820
That really wasn't bad.
Also,

2286
02:21:24.821 --> 02:21:28.060
seven out of 10 kids get offered drugs in high school.

2287
02:21:28.061 --> 02:21:30.640
I want to know who those other three are.
Those fucking losers.

2288
02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:36.910
No,
he's offering you drugs.
Come on,
man.
Fucking part is you're going to,

2289
02:21:37.330 --> 02:21:40.090
you're not getting something.
Yeah.
Don't take pills.
You don't know what they are.

2290
02:21:40.110 --> 02:21:42.100
All right.
Don't do heroin.
That shit's addictive.

2291
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:46.360
But the only way we learn all these things is by,
you know,

2292
02:21:46.361 --> 02:21:48.610
the ability to freely communicate and express each other.

2293
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:54.070
Express thoughts rather like Portugal has instituted a w s countrywide

2294
02:21:54.130 --> 02:21:57.640
decriminalization of all drugs a while ago.
Yeah.
And going great.

2295
02:21:57.670 --> 02:22:01.990
The results have been fantastic.
Yeah.
Lower Crime,
lower drug addiction,
you know,

2296
02:22:01.991 --> 02:22:06.790
Lord,
cases of HIV infection.
It's just across the board,
across the board.

2297
02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:09.730
You know,
you,
you can't suppress people.
You know,

2298
02:22:09.731 --> 02:22:12.950
I I know this as a parent,
um,

2299
02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.700
I try very hard to not suppress my children.

2300
02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.720
I try to explain to them what's good or bad about doing things,

2301
02:22:19.721 --> 02:22:23.780
explained to them the dangers of things.
But give them like I don't,

2302
02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:26.070
I don't want to be the boss,
you know,
I just want to be

2303
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:29.910
<v 5>the person who can tell them things that they don't know yet and do it because I</v>

2304
02:22:29.911 --> 02:22:33.260
love them.
But when you,
as soon as you fucking tell people,

2305
02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:38.760
cause it's a drug cause defact FH t fact,
I just want to beat you to death.

2306
02:22:38.761 --> 02:22:43.761
You fucking dunce shitty propaganda machine walking around with a fucking pair

2307
02:22:44.971 --> 02:22:46.200
of glasses,
eating salad,

2308
02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:51.810
asshole asshole face just to,
to fucking shitty commercial.

2309
02:22:51.811 --> 02:22:54.060
That's my least favorite commercial I think ever.

2310
02:22:54.510 --> 02:22:57.630
Cause it's a fact Fsu to fact.

2311
02:22:58.740 --> 02:23:01.890
So you're telling me that it's a fact that I'm telling you you're both assholes.

2312
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:06.800
The first guy's an asshole or anything like that cause it's the fact.
Yeah,

2313
02:23:06.810 --> 02:23:10.650
your dad.
That's like a dad thing.
That guy is like a dad.

2314
02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:15.210
I have a friend who has a dad like that and I know people who have dads like

2315
02:23:15.211 --> 02:23:17.820
that.
I can't talk to him cause I'd be like,
you're a dunce.

2316
02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:20.880
And that's why your son doesn't accept your thoughts.

2317
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:24.780
You don't even understand this.
You gets away from you.
He mocks you.
Okay,

2318
02:23:24.781 --> 02:23:27.030
I gotta go cause I can't have this conversation.

2319
02:23:27.690 --> 02:23:32.270
I'll fucking yell at you and your own house.
I wouldn't really,
but,

2320
02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:34.080
but that,
that thing,

2321
02:23:34.081 --> 02:23:39.081
that fucking Mr no nonsense guy that Mr Known Nancy nonsense guy intimidates

2322
02:23:39.211 --> 02:23:42.620
people cause it's tracked FACD fact.
Did you,

2323
02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:44.970
anybody fucking spells fact out like that?

2324
02:23:45.180 --> 02:23:46.620
You should be able to just spit on them.

2325
02:23:47.730 --> 02:23:51.620
Just should be an automatic lock.
The funds,

2326
02:23:52.130 --> 02:23:54.720
it seems like the appropriate response pit spit.

2327
02:23:55.410 --> 02:23:59.590
It's not assault but clearly too late for an intellectual discussion.
Yeah,

2328
02:23:59.610 --> 02:24:04.470
you got to hit him,
hit him with rocks,
fucking pee on his something.

2329
02:24:05.540 --> 02:24:09.360
And I've taken this fucking way out of the boundaries of normal thinking.

2330
02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:14.550
How's awesome.
But you know,
those,
those kind of commercials are really insidious,

2331
02:24:14.850 --> 02:24:16.470
insidious.
And there,

2332
02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:20.700
it's the roots of them is what's the most disturbing when you find out this

2333
02:24:20.701 --> 02:24:23.040
partnership for a drug free America is just,

2334
02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:25.410
it's essentially just a business boy.
Yeah.

2335
02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:30.360
The alcohol lobby protecting their market.
Yeah.
I mean it's so weird.

2336
02:24:30.390 --> 02:24:34.080
It's so weird.
Especially like,
you know what it would be like,

2337
02:24:34.450 --> 02:24:36.290
well that's not gonna be good to know.
I would,

2338
02:24:36.330 --> 02:24:40.260
I was saying that it'd be like a really shitty movie that's attacking like a

2339
02:24:40.261 --> 02:24:44.850
really awesome movie,
you know,
for,
for being,
you know,

2340
02:24:44.851 --> 02:24:46.080
cause they don't want you to go be the cause.

2341
02:24:46.081 --> 02:24:47.640
That's what it's like kind of in a way

2342
02:24:49.330 --> 02:24:51.450
that no nonsense guys.

2343
02:24:51.451 --> 02:24:55.410
It's just that that is something that like for whatever reason,

2344
02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:59.510
like even the ineffective way that the first guy communicated the way he fought.

2345
02:24:59.580 --> 02:25:02.350
So you're trying to tell me that's what you're trying to tell me.
Like,
Hey,

2346
02:25:02.370 --> 02:25:06.300
he's not telling you anything.
You guys both dumb like you guys are idiots.

2347
02:25:06.330 --> 02:25:09.090
This conversation sucks and this is the reason why people shouldn't be allowed

2348
02:25:09.091 --> 02:25:13.170
to vote you two dummies.
You two dummies having this fucking salad argument.

2349
02:25:14.530 --> 02:25:16.620
Weird and Malta worse,
Huh?

2350
02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:21.360
In terms of drug laws.
Yeah,
it's pretty bad.

2351
02:25:21.390 --> 02:25:23.980
You can end up in jail for a very long time for

2352
02:25:24.310 --> 02:25:27.430
<v 7>not very much to some fucking midnight express type shit.
Right.</v>

2353
02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:31.810
You ever see that movie and that express?
It's a movie where the guy,

2354
02:25:31.811 --> 02:25:34.690
no movies ever.
It's embarrassing.
Really?
Yeah.

2355
02:25:35.170 --> 02:25:39.400
Just playing poker like a madman.
How many hours a day you play poker?
Ah,

2356
02:25:39.970 --> 02:25:41.740
not that much.
I mean,

2357
02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:48.310
I'd say like I probably averaged 30 to 50 hours a week.
Ah,
okay.

2358
02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:53.230
Um,
50 hours a week still like a real workshop.
So it's a real job.
Oh,

2359
02:25:53.231 --> 02:25:57.670
and it varies a lot through for,
yes,
it is a lot of suiting.

2360
02:25:57.671 --> 02:26:00.670
It's not good for you.
Yeah.
Terrible for you.
Sitting is the new smoking,

2361
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:05.110
have you not heard?
I have heard that phrase a night.
I kind of buy it.

2362
02:26:05.111 --> 02:26:09.310
I mean my back is way too fucked up for a 28 year old.
Is it really fucked up?

2363
02:26:09.690 --> 02:26:12.640
Do you stretch out or to yoga or anything like that?
I stretch a bit,

2364
02:26:12.641 --> 02:26:15.700
but nothing organized.
Not as good as it should be.
Yeah.

2365
02:26:15.701 --> 02:26:18.610
You can get some bulging discs that way.
Do a degeneration of discs.

2366
02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:21.700
I don't think it's gone that far yet.
But yeah,
I was wearing,

2367
02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:25.630
I was using this thing for awhile.
It was pretty cool.
That's a neat thing.

2368
02:26:25.930 --> 02:26:30.930
But I decided that I like sitting up straight and this better than I liked

2369
02:26:30.941 --> 02:26:33.100
sitting on that thing.
But it doesn't happen.
You know what?

2370
02:26:33.101 --> 02:26:34.930
These things are ever see these up here.
I'll put it on.

2371
02:26:38.530 --> 02:26:41.140
It's a,
um,
it's like a kneeling chair.

2372
02:26:42.830 --> 02:26:43.950
I,

2373
02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:48.460
I thought about buying one of those to sit on while playing poker and didn't do

2374
02:26:48.461 --> 02:26:52.690
it well.
There's good and bad to it.
It's a,
it's not the most comfortable thing,

2375
02:26:53.290 --> 02:26:55.720
but uh,
it definitely forces you to sit up straight.

2376
02:26:55.930 --> 02:26:59.380
A buddy of mine had started playing from a treadmill desk.
Really?

2377
02:26:59.390 --> 02:27:01.060
So he's on his treadmill while he's a,

2378
02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:05.710
it's this like specially designed treadmill desk.
He's like walking real slowly.

2379
02:27:05.711 --> 02:27:10.540
It's not strenuous because the studies show if you go more than like two miles

2380
02:27:10.541 --> 02:27:12.850
an hour,
it starts impacting your cognitive function.

2381
02:27:12.970 --> 02:27:16.600
I was just walking real slowly,
but he's standing up and moving around all day.

2382
02:27:16.810 --> 02:27:21.640
That's clubs computer for you.
He's liking it a lot.
I may do that eventually.

2383
02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:26.050
Treadmill desk.
What if it gets to like some virtual reality type shit,

2384
02:27:26.051 --> 02:27:28.660
some oculus rift poker playing.
That would be kind of dope.

2385
02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:31.750
You aware of Oculus rift?
I am not.
You're not.
Oh,

2386
02:27:31.751 --> 02:27:34.750
but I have to tell you oculus rift is the newest,
latest,

2387
02:27:34.751 --> 02:27:39.520
greatest three d virtual reality helmet that they've created.

2388
02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:43.600
Okay.
Um,
my friend Duncan,
who's a big proponent of it,

2389
02:27:43.601 --> 02:27:46.630
he loves this shit cause he got a copy of one of the earlier ones.

2390
02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:50.110
He let me try it on and it was amazing but it was really pixelated.

2391
02:27:50.111 --> 02:27:53.210
It was like quake one like old school video gamey.

2392
02:27:53.230 --> 02:27:58.090
Like there's no way you could misinterpret what it is like you,
you know,

2393
02:27:58.091 --> 02:28:03.091
it's that really old Nintendo one came out like virtual boy virtual boy.

2394
02:28:03.641 --> 02:28:07.510
That's why I thought it was that thing was this red red.
My,

2395
02:28:07.511 --> 02:28:10.570
a friend of mine got it and he got hit a headache within 30 minutes.

2396
02:28:10.690 --> 02:28:14.530
Some people get headaches.
Brian got a headache from a oculus rift,

2397
02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:16.030
but it doesn't give me a headache.

2398
02:28:16.090 --> 02:28:19.480
I think maybe it's the same kind of people that get like a boat sickness,

2399
02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:21.300
like motion sickness on boats.
Seasick.

2400
02:28:22.450 --> 02:28:26.500
<v 0>Yeah.
It's an inner ear thing apparently.
But I think maybe I'm,</v>

2401
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:27.530
that's a genetic thing.

2402
02:28:27.531 --> 02:28:29.840
Like you either get it or you don't get it because my kids don't get it.

2403
02:28:29.841 --> 02:28:30.770
But my wife gets it.

2404
02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:35.450
It's weird because I think my kids get their robustness from the fucking old
man.

2405
02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:39.920
Um,
but um,
uh,
anyway,
this oculus rift,

2406
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:44.270
apparently it's gotten exponentially better and Dunkin called me the other day.

2407
02:28:44.271 --> 02:28:48.180
I was at the Improv and he called me up and he was like,
fucking frothy.

2408
02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:52.520
He's like,
dude,
what I just saw,
he's going to change everything.

2409
02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:56.420
The world is going to change.
This is bigger than the Internet.
It goes,

2410
02:28:56.421 --> 02:28:59.690
this is bigger.
This is bigger than the invention of the wheel.

2411
02:28:59.810 --> 02:29:02.240
This is bigger than him.
He goes,
it's fucking crazy.

2412
02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:04.190
He was fucking frothing at the mouth.

2413
02:29:04.191 --> 02:29:07.700
I wish I could see his fucking beady eyes bolting out of his head.

2414
02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:09.680
He was so happy and excited.

2415
02:29:09.681 --> 02:29:14.681
He went to this three d virtual reality developers conference thing and he said

2416
02:29:14.961 --> 02:29:18.440
the newest version of the oculus rift,
which hasn't reached consumers,

2417
02:29:18.441 --> 02:29:21.740
I don't think any of them have.
Right.
Just in a low level sense.

2418
02:29:21.770 --> 02:29:25.610
You like developers but the newest,
latest,
greatest one,

2419
02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:29.480
you go into a room and there's a guy playing piano and the way they filmed it,

2420
02:29:29.481 --> 02:29:33.710
apparently they've put cameras all over a person's body.

2421
02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:37.970
And so everywhere you look it's like you,
you,

2422
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.510
you see it as if the camera like you're looking like there's no,

2423
02:29:41.690 --> 02:29:43.580
there's no breakup of the motion.

2424
02:29:43.581 --> 02:29:48.581
It's a completely smooth and it's completely HD three dimensional.

2425
02:29:48.860 --> 02:29:50.540
Like a movie.
Like,
like,

2426
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:55.460
like you're watching perfect three-dimensional four k video.
Jesus.
Yeah.

2427
02:29:55.461 --> 02:29:55.911
And he goes,

2428
02:29:55.911 --> 02:29:59.210
you go into this room and there's a guy playing piano when he talks to you and

2429
02:29:59.211 --> 02:30:03.080
you get to sit down,
you can like move near him,
you can move around him,

2430
02:30:03.081 --> 02:30:04.940
you can go like,
it's all been filmed.

2431
02:30:04.970 --> 02:30:09.170
Like you can change where you're going and the video follows you.
And he said,

2432
02:30:09.171 --> 02:30:10.610
it's fucking nuts.

2433
02:30:10.930 --> 02:30:14.870
I like the sound he said is like three d stereo sound.

2434
02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:17.960
The guy playing the beat goes that you feel like you're in a fucking room with

2435
02:30:17.961 --> 02:30:21.760
this guy.
He said it just changed.
It changes everything.
He was,

2436
02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:25.190
he was going raising.
Yeah,
he was going nuts.
He was going nuts about it.

2437
02:30:25.460 --> 02:30:29.750
And based on his original one that I uh,
fucked with,
which was like I said,

2438
02:30:29.751 --> 02:30:34.410
very pixelated,
very old school,
like 1990 video gamey type.

2439
02:30:35.090 --> 02:30:37.190
It was a still very fucking cool.
Yeah.

2440
02:30:37.191 --> 02:30:41.070
And then they have ones now or virtual boy.
It was fun.
Wasn't it?

2441
02:30:41.650 --> 02:30:45.970
Will pull up virtual boy.
I've never seen that before.
Never.
Uh,
I'm,

2442
02:30:46.050 --> 02:30:47.930
I'm actually in this chair,

2443
02:30:48.220 --> 02:30:53.220
<v 2>this sorta helmet thing on top of a tripod that you lean into and it's just like</v>

2444
02:30:55.811 --> 02:30:58.630
red lines on a black background,
if I remember right.

2445
02:30:58.631 --> 02:31:03.170
And there are various video games you can play like flight simulators right
here,

2446
02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:07.390
<v 0>virtual boy.
That's what this is what the games looked like.
Basically.</v>

2447
02:31:07.391 --> 02:31:11.980
There's very little detail.
Oh God.
It's all red like that.

2448
02:31:12.990 --> 02:31:17.650
It was grossly three slide that will pull up.

2449
02:31:17.651 --> 02:31:20.400
Um,
uh,
Lewis unbox therapy,

2450
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:22.260
<v 5>our pal Lewis,
he,
uh,</v>

2451
02:31:22.290 --> 02:31:27.010
Lou has a video on that one that they made with an iPhone.
Um,

2452
02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:31.830
it's,
it's a cardboard box.
He had it here and take this cardboard box,

2453
02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:36.330
you open it up and then put the pieces are in place and then set your iPhone

2454
02:31:36.331 --> 02:31:39.990
there and then you put it on your head.
It's got,
it's like so low rent.

2455
02:31:40.350 --> 02:31:44.640
And apparently they made it that low rent on perfect on purpose rather to mock

2456
02:31:44.820 --> 02:31:48.060
the oculus rift.
Oculus rift is this gigantic,

2457
02:31:48.270 --> 02:31:52.380
huge silicone.
And,
and this is,
uh,
he's a

2458
02:31:54.730 --> 02:31:59.730
<v 9>board Vr headset or crazy as a cardboard cutout that uses your phone to create a</v>

2459
02:32:00.941 --> 02:32:03.520
headset.
Does that make any sense?
Anyways,

2460
02:32:03.610 --> 02:32:08.290
I recently made a reaction video in which I gave this contraption to a number of

2461
02:32:08.291 --> 02:32:11.950
individuals who you might recognize and I got some amazing reactions.

2462
02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:15.400
So if you haven't seen that video yet,
you should definitely go and check it out.

2463
02:32:15.610 --> 02:32:20.610
But this one is dedicated to telling you and showing you how this seemingly

2464
02:32:20.951 --> 02:32:25.951
boring piece of cardboard can turn your phone into a state of VR virtual reality

2465
02:32:27.940 --> 02:32:29.260
headset.
So it also

2466
02:32:30.850 --> 02:32:35.730
is cardboard cutout that you construct into what you see here.

2467
02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:40.330
Now you can actually make this on your own using plans via the cardboard

2468
02:32:40.331 --> 02:32:42.790
websites.
So you don't need to purchase one of these.

2469
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:45.700
Just get your hands on some cardboard,
use the plans,

2470
02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:50.530
and you can make it yourself.
Or you can buy a preconfigured cutout via Amazon.

2471
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:54.730
If you want something that's a little bit more streamlined and closer to a

2472
02:32:54.731 --> 02:32:58.570
finished product,
it's about $10.
And I'll link that down in the description.

2473
02:32:58.690 --> 02:32:59.960
[inaudible] an interesting,
cut it off

2474
02:32:59.960 --> 02:33:02.240
<v 5>here.
So Lou gets the hits.
It's a,</v>

2475
02:33:02.250 --> 02:33:05.900
but it's an unbox therapy on youtube and he's got that.

2476
02:33:05.901 --> 02:33:10.901
You could see that as well as the recent video of us shooting the iPhone six

2477
02:33:11.001 --> 02:33:15.200
glass with a bow and arrow.
But,
um,

2478
02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:20.930
he got a copy a or hold of the newest,
the glass screen,

2479
02:33:21.250 --> 02:33:25.010
the iPhone six.
It's a sapphire glass and you can bend it.

2480
02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:29.540
Do you get scratch it with keys.
You can.
It's like really super,
super durable.

2481
02:33:29.930 --> 02:33:34.490
That sounds like a thing I would have some use for.
This is what my iPhone looks.

2482
02:33:34.530 --> 02:33:39.470
Ah,
there it's taken a beating.
Uh,
most of them have.

2483
02:33:39.860 --> 02:33:44.000
Um,
but uh,
what you can't do with that we found is shoot an arrow through it.

2484
02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:48.610
Did not the flag.
Yeah.
It did not deflect well.
Right through it.
It's a steroid.

2485
02:33:48.611 --> 02:33:52.010
It,
yeah.
Arrows and phones don't mix,
but you know,

2486
02:33:52.220 --> 02:33:55.100
how often are you going to get shot by a fucking error?
We've got a phone on.

2487
02:33:55.101 --> 02:33:58.400
You're probably not often.
Probably if your phone is ruined,

2488
02:33:58.430 --> 02:34:01.370
that's not your biggest concern you have for getting shot by arrows.

2489
02:34:01.430 --> 02:34:04.910
Your phone is not,
it's the least of your concern.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2490
02:34:05.100 --> 02:34:06.860
Better be worried about your fucking personal health.

2491
02:34:07.660 --> 02:34:10.910
Shit's going down and being attacked by Mongols or something.

2492
02:34:10.940 --> 02:34:13.760
Usually the arrows don't come one at a time.
Yeah.

2493
02:34:13.761 --> 02:34:16.790
I don't know how we got on this virtual reality headset thing,

2494
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:20.170
<v 7>but yeah.
I don't remember where that,
sorry.
Oh,</v>

2495
02:34:20.290 --> 02:34:23.940
I remember because I was thinking ergonomics.
Yeah.

2496
02:34:25.250 --> 02:34:28.510
To being able to do it.
Sort of like in the oculus world.

2497
02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:33.160
Like I think eventually you're going to be able to grab at a virtual table,

2498
02:34:33.650 --> 02:34:38.410
physical object,
virtual cards will or,
or virtual screens in front of you,

2499
02:34:38.411 --> 02:34:41.830
minority report style and you're moving them around through this oculus rift

2500
02:34:41.831 --> 02:34:45.290
headset and you're standing up while you're on this treadmill and you're walking

2501
02:34:45.291 --> 02:34:49.930
there.
That's not too far.
Yeah,
I bet it's not,
you know,
um,

2502
02:34:50.380 --> 02:34:55.030
the,
um,
I really love this idea of this guy's doing,
of walking really slowly.

2503
02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:59.440
You know,
a lot of people claim up writers especially,
um,

2504
02:34:59.470 --> 02:35:02.380
claim that they get some of their best ideas while walking.
Yeah.

2505
02:35:02.410 --> 02:35:05.110
Like they walk specifically and they hold onto a tape recorder while they're

2506
02:35:05.111 --> 02:35:07.750
walking and then they just talk while you're walking the dog or something like

2507
02:35:07.751 --> 02:35:10.870
that.
Talking on the tape recorder.
Yeah,
I could see that.
Yeah.

2508
02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:15.820
There's something about moving,
like the movement,
like just getting,

2509
02:35:15.821 --> 02:35:19.080
not nothing heavy but a little bit of blood flow.
Yup.

2510
02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:22.450
But your back's fucked up from sitting,
Huh?
I mean,
it's not terrible,

2511
02:35:22.451 --> 02:35:27.370
but I want to try this.
Sure.
We'll try one of these jammies here.
Get this to you.

2512
02:35:27.790 --> 02:35:32.050
Take a few seconds ladies.
Gentlemen,
this is a,

2513
02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:35.380
a kneeling chair.
I just started doing it recently.

2514
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:36.790
<v 1>I did it now and I love it.</v>

2515
02:35:45.970 --> 02:35:49.000
<v 7>I'm going to try to do podcasts like this.
Say it again.
End Up.</v>

2516
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:51.610
Do you think there's any benefit in that?

2517
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:57.750
How many podcasts do you think you could do if you had to stand up?
Would,

2518
02:35:57.751 --> 02:36:01.450
that'd be good.
So what are you thinking about that does,
this isn't bad.

2519
02:36:01.530 --> 02:36:03.100
It's not bad,
right?
The standing up thing,

2520
02:36:03.130 --> 02:36:05.890
I've actually been messing around with that a little bit recently.

2521
02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:10.630
I started playing poker a using an Xbox controller instead of a mouse.
Really?

2522
02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:15.660
And then I don't need to be flat on the desk so I can stand up while I play.

2523
02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:20.170
Wow.
That's pretty cool.
Yeah.
You can kind of lie on your back.

2524
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:23.410
What about that was the lying on your back staring up at the ceiling?

2525
02:36:23.411 --> 02:36:26.560
Put a screen on the con.
I don't like it.
I feel like I'm less,

2526
02:36:27.210 --> 02:36:30.710
I'm like play poker or I'll just on my laptop lying in bed before.
Uh,

2527
02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:34.790
I feel like I'm less mentally engaged when I'm lying down.
I think,
uh,

2528
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:39.610
sitting upright or standing or a lot better.
Yeah.
I wonder standing writing.

2529
02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:43.630
Cause I think one of the things about being desks are getting pretty popular.

2530
02:36:43.650 --> 02:36:44.440
Yeah.

2531
02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:47.470
But I wonder if they're getting popular for writers because there's something

2532
02:36:47.471 --> 02:36:50.470
about writing.
You don't want to be thinking about what you're doing.

2533
02:36:50.770 --> 02:36:52.300
Like you don't want to be thinking about standing.

2534
02:36:52.301 --> 02:36:55.540
You just want to be on to get in that flow state.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2535
02:36:55.830 --> 02:36:56.663
<v 1>I wonder.</v>

2536
02:36:58.660 --> 02:37:01.480
<v 7>Hmm.
It seems like it would work though.
Yeah.</v>

2537
02:37:01.481 --> 02:37:06.040
I don't see why not dictating would work well.
I could see dictating.
Standing.

2538
02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:06.880
Yeah.
Yeah.

2539
02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:09.700
Did you walk around on a cell phone or on a phone when you talk and just sure

2540
02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:13.900
meander?
Yeah,
whenever I'm on the phone I'm definitely moving around.
Wandering,

2541
02:37:14.170 --> 02:37:16.520
dictating.
Software's fucking incredible now.

2542
02:37:16.570 --> 02:37:18.560
Just the dictating software that you have on your phone.

2543
02:37:18.770 --> 02:37:21.740
The voice recognition software on your phone.
We're really good.
It's amazing.

2544
02:37:21.770 --> 02:37:23.450
It's like a,
the,
the,
the,
the

2545
02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:28.380
<v 0>ability to pick it up.
Like,
uh,
you could,
you know,</v>

2546
02:37:28.381 --> 02:37:32.310
you could get on these,
um,
these note things on your,

2547
02:37:32.370 --> 02:37:36.510
on your phone and just talk into it and it just picks it up incredibly well.

2548
02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:41.490
Like,
look,
I'll give you a
hello.
You dirty bitches.

2549
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:46.320
I'm tired of writing,
so I just figured I talk into my phone.
Ps,
fuck you.
Period.

2550
02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:49.193
<v 3>Bam.</v>

2551
02:37:50.650 --> 02:37:54.820
<v 7>Pretty good.
Nailed it.
Absolutely.
Ps Fuck you.
Period.</v>

2552
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:58.930
I'll say we live in the future.

2553
02:37:59.310 --> 02:38:02.530
Do you mean put a period or did we have the word period?
No,
period.

2554
02:38:02.810 --> 02:38:04.840
If you say period,
uh,
it,

2555
02:38:04.841 --> 02:38:07.870
it puts a period of say exclamation point and puts an exclamation point.

2556
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:10.990
But what if you want to use the word period?
That's a very good question.

2557
02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:14.650
Is Limited in that regard.
Maybe you see,
say the word period.

2558
02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:19.870
What did you say the Jurassic period does it right.
The Jurassic Dot.

2559
02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:24.160
Or it's a good question.
Here we go.
Does it have context with Jurassic period?

2560
02:38:26.470 --> 02:38:27.303
<v 3>The Jurassic.</v>

2561
02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:34.400
<v 7>Okay,
hold on.
How about this
period?
The word</v>

2562
02:38:36.730 --> 02:38:38.450
<v 3>period?
The word?
Hmm.</v>

2563
02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:45.250
<v 0>The Jurassic P e R.
I o.
D</v>

2564
02:38:50.230 --> 02:38:53.890
<v 7>can you tell us at the end of the sentence if you say the Jurassic period was a</v>

2565
02:38:53.891 --> 02:38:54.970
very exciting time?

2566
02:38:55.050 --> 02:38:56.010
<v 0>Oh,
that's a good question.</v>

2567
02:38:57.270 --> 02:39:01.710
The Jurassic period was a time where a lot of dinosaur has got dinosaur pussy

2568
02:39:02.070 --> 02:39:02.903
period.

2569
02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:12.590
<v 7>It's fucking confusing.
Confused.
Let me try that again.</v>

2570
02:39:14.180 --> 02:39:15.013
<v 0>Here we go.</v>

2571
02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:21.010
The Jurassic period was a time where a lot of dinosaurs got a lot of dinosaur

2572
02:39:21.011 --> 02:39:22.240
pussy period.

2573
02:39:25.330 --> 02:39:29.140
<v 7>Yep.
Did it that time can tell you at the end of a sentence,</v>

2574
02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:33.370
so that is if you're going to use or you keep going.
Yeah,

2575
02:39:34.030 --> 02:39:37.810
it keeps going.
It thinks of it as period,
but if you want to say no,

2576
02:39:37.811 --> 02:39:40.900
that happened during the Jurassic period.
Hmm.

2577
02:39:41.950 --> 02:39:44.920
I wonder if you can get the intonation just right that it can tell anyway,

2578
02:39:44.921 --> 02:39:47.530
or if it's the last word,
it always goes to the dot.
No,

2579
02:39:47.531 --> 02:39:51.100
that happened during the Jurassic period.
Period.

2580
02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:53.393
<v 3>Trick.
This bitch</v>

2581
02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:57.910
<v 7>you that worked nice.
Period.
Period.
Works.
That's how you do it.</v>

2582
02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:00.730
If you want to say period in the middle,
you just keep going.

2583
02:40:00.731 --> 02:40:04.750
If you want to see period,
period.
Then you get the word period and a period.

2584
02:40:04.810 --> 02:40:09.640
All right,
we've got it figured out.
We got it,
man.
Fucking got it.

2585
02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:12.040
That's we live in the future,
ladies and gentlemen.

2586
02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:14.040
But sooner later you're going to be able to do

2587
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:18.240
<v 5>that with your oculus rift and it'll just show it to you on a scroll.
Like some,</v>

2588
02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:21.990
like one of those kings scrolls will appear out of thin air.

2589
02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:25.440
Um,
how long have you think you're going to do this poker thing?

2590
02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:30.350
<v 7>Zipper for your life?
You're 28 ride this bitch right into the rocks.
I mean,</v>

2591
02:40:30.351 --> 02:40:31.190
at some point

2592
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:35.670
I'm not going to be able to compete at the highest level the way I do now that

2593
02:40:35.671 --> 02:40:38.490
that just has to be true.
Right?
What age do you think that is?

2594
02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.760
40 50.
But why would that be?
What would it be?
Do you think?
His brain slow down.

2595
02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:48.540
Do they though?
Do they,
do they slow down because of atrophy?

2596
02:40:48.541 --> 02:40:51.480
Because of lack of use.
Do they slow down because you're dying?

2597
02:40:51.481 --> 02:40:55.410
Like at what age does that has never been a seven year old chess world champion.

2598
02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:59.850
Aww.
How old have they gotten?
I think 50s,
50s.
Um,

2599
02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:03.630
I think poker is probably similar though.

2600
02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:07.290
You can make a living in poker without being one of the best in the world,

2601
02:41:07.291 --> 02:41:09.390
so make a living.
Yeah,

2602
02:41:10.290 --> 02:41:10.730
<v 3>yeah,</v>

2603
02:41:10.730 --> 02:41:15.050
<v 7>yeah.
But it's like,
it gets to be a lot less fun at that point.
Yeah.
Right.</v>

2604
02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:16.720
You're just kind of a journeyman.
Yeah.

2605
02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:19.730
One of those guys that they bring in as an opponent for a boxer and he gets beat

2606
02:41:19.731 --> 02:41:21.420
up every time.
Yeah.

2607
02:41:21.890 --> 02:41:24.790
<v 5>Well still a test.
Still a good opponent.</v>

2608
02:41:24.791 --> 02:41:29.050
So by then you'll be living in Malta,
you'll be in jail for pot.

2609
02:41:29.470 --> 02:41:33.160
You'll be willing to,
won't be able to come back to America or

2610
02:41:34.660 --> 02:41:35.470
what's a,

2611
02:41:35.470 --> 02:41:38.770
do you have like a strategy like of how many years you want to do this or are

2612
02:41:38.771 --> 02:41:40.270
you just like enjoying it right now?

2613
02:41:40.310 --> 02:41:45.310
<v 7>Enjoy it now and it's just so hard to predict what the landscape of poker will</v>

2614
02:41:45.451 --> 02:41:49.530
look like.
What making a living in poker will look like 10 years from now.

2615
02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:54.680
<v 5>Yeah.
I would imagine,
especially with the regulations and the laws,</v>

2616
02:41:54.681 --> 02:41:58.580
if everybody just opened everything up,
I think it would be quite fascinating.

2617
02:41:58.610 --> 02:42:02.630
Yeah.
I'm hoping,
you know,
I,
there was a,
um,

2618
02:42:03.090 --> 02:42:06.190
there's an article that I posted recently about uh,
what the death,

2619
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:08.450
the death of politics.
Um,

2620
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:12.680
it was technology and the death of politics and the idea was that data was going

2621
02:42:12.681 --> 02:42:15.920
to deny politics.
A lot of what politics is,

2622
02:42:15.921 --> 02:42:20.921
is sort of like manipulating data and that the internet and this free access to

2623
02:42:21.111 --> 02:42:25.370
information is going to sort of cut out most of the forms of,

2624
02:42:25.450 --> 02:42:27.590
of political sense.
Totally makes sense.

2625
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:30.620
I would hope that that would also have a similar effect on things like your

2626
02:42:30.621 --> 02:42:31.550
business.
Cause it just,

2627
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:35.150
it frustrates me to no end that you have to live in some fucking weird island in

2628
02:42:35.151 --> 02:42:38.390
the middle of nowhere to avoid being locked in a cage.

2629
02:42:39.270 --> 02:42:40.400
<v 7>I have to lock me in a cage.</v>

2630
02:42:40.401 --> 02:42:43.850
They're just going to lock the guy who lets me play poker on his site from the u

2631
02:42:43.851 --> 02:42:46.490
s and,
and they're going to steal your money and they might steal your money,

2632
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:50.220
steal your fucking money's on.
The Doj likes stealing people's,
yeah,

2633
02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:52.690
<v 5>they do.
They love it.
It's their best thing they do.</v>

2634
02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:55.960
They do that better than any of that.
The DEA does it too.

2635
02:42:56.130 --> 02:43:00.340
That's what the DEA was doing in California.
It was hilarious.
They would a bus,

2636
02:43:00.341 --> 02:43:02.790
these pot shops not charged him with anything,

2637
02:43:02.810 --> 02:43:05.740
take all their money and then say the case is pending and so they would just

2638
02:43:05.741 --> 02:43:09.610
steal,
you know,
$1 million here.
100,000.
Their bumper bumper,

2639
02:43:09.820 --> 02:43:12.190
<v 7>uh,
happened to a of mine who's a</v>

2640
02:43:12.250 --> 02:43:16.960
<v 4>nother professional poker player,
a professional gambler.
He took a trip to,</v>

2641
02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:18.790
I want to say Puerto Rico.

2642
02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:23.560
Pretty sure it was Puerto Rico to play blackjack in a casino there.
Um,

2643
02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:26.890
he's a new advantage blackjack player of the game.

2644
02:43:26.891 --> 02:43:29.350
There was such that he could get an edge counting cards.

2645
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:34.590
So he made a trip there to make some money and he flew back into,

2646
02:43:36.670 --> 02:43:37.503
<v 3>okay,</v>

2647
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:40.420
<v 4>I want to say it was the Atlanta airport.
Uh,</v>

2648
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:45.870
and he had $80,000 in cash on him and he had all the receipts from,

2649
02:43:46.180 --> 02:43:50.230
I sent this bank transfer to the casino because I was going to go gamble there.

2650
02:43:50.590 --> 02:43:54.550
I gambled there.
They paid me out this money.
I've got the cash,

2651
02:43:54.551 --> 02:43:59.230
I've got all the receipts.
Clear trail of what he did.
He got there,

2652
02:43:59.231 --> 02:44:03.940
they said you got a lot of cash,
but kind of like a drug dealer to me.
Mine.

2653
02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:09.400
Wow.
It wasn't charged with anything.
They just took his money and what happened?

2654
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:10.503
He

2655
02:44:11.940 --> 02:44:15.360
had to take them to court to get it back and he did win,

2656
02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:20.850
but it took years and a lot of money and if you don't have a lot of money to

2657
02:44:20.851 --> 02:44:25.680
pursue the case and you don't have the wherewithal to navigate the legal system

2658
02:44:25.681 --> 02:44:29.220
the way he did and something like that happens to you,
you're just fucked.

2659
02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:33.100
Well not only that $80,000 it seems like there could be eaten up pretty quickly

2660
02:44:33.101 --> 02:44:37.980
in legal fees.
I think he ended up suing for the fees as well,

2661
02:44:37.981 --> 02:44:42.330
so he got paid the money back.
He got paid his costs.
Man,

2662
02:44:42.331 --> 02:44:43.540
that's nice.
But still,

2663
02:44:43.541 --> 02:44:47.100
I mean interest and all that jazz and you don't always win.

2664
02:44:47.101 --> 02:44:50.490
Sometimes you're out the 80 they took from you and 60 more than you spent

2665
02:44:50.491 --> 02:44:51.324
chasing it.

2666
02:44:51.750 --> 02:44:54.630
I wonder if that could have been prevented if he had legal representation like

2667
02:44:54.631 --> 02:44:58.170
as he landed or had it cleared in advance.
You know what I'm saying?

2668
02:44:58.171 --> 02:45:01.580
Instead of trying to go and travel around with a lawyer everywhere you own your

2669
02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:03.700
professional gambler.
No,
I didn't mean that.

2670
02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:07.860
I meant like contact a lawyer and arrange to have everything taken care of as

2671
02:45:07.861 --> 02:45:11.970
you get there.
That'd be,
is there a way around that?
Ah,

2672
02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:17.190
I mean like if you contacted a lawyer and traveling with cash and declaring it

2673
02:45:17.191 --> 02:45:21.180
at the border is a thing professional gamblers deal with all the time to have

2674
02:45:21.181 --> 02:45:24.630
you dealt with that before?
Yeah,
and it's no,
no issues.
Almost always no problem.

2675
02:45:24.631 --> 02:45:26.520
It's legal to carry money.

2676
02:45:26.521 --> 02:45:29.370
If you're carrying more than $10,000 across the border,

2677
02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:33.420
you have to fill out a form saying you're doing so,
but you fill out the form.

2678
02:45:33.421 --> 02:45:36.240
They say,
why are you,
where'd you get all this money?
What are you doing with it?

2679
02:45:36.420 --> 02:45:38.250
And I say,
I'm a professional poker player.

2680
02:45:38.251 --> 02:45:43.251
I won it in Vegas and I'm going to deposit in my bank account when I get to

2681
02:45:44.311 --> 02:45:46.470
somewhere else or whatever and it's fine.

2682
02:45:46.500 --> 02:45:48.480
What's the most cash you've ever traveled with?

2683
02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:54.390
Traveled with like head with me on a plane.

2684
02:45:55.230 --> 02:45:58.770
I want to say around 70,000 euro.
What's that in dollars.

2685
02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:00.690
Not 100,000 damn son.

2686
02:46:01.500 --> 02:46:06.500
Walking around with a hundred K and a briefcase with a fucking big chain

2687
02:46:08.190 --> 02:46:09.530
attached to your wrist in a bag.

2688
02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:14.350
<v 7>A bag.
Like a gym bag.
That's what you want,
right?
Yeah.</v>

2689
02:46:14.370 --> 02:46:19.280
Nike bag conspicuous if you're,
yeah,
moving around.
The one handcuffs,

2690
02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:22.400
handcuffs attached to the fucking,
they'll just chop your hand off.

2691
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:27.370
That's what they do.
That's what I heard.
Yeah,
it seems like.
Yeah.

2692
02:46:27.470 --> 02:46:30.370
The the arbitrary limit of 10,000 always drove me crazy too.

2693
02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:33.020
You covering more than $10,000 in cash,
like,
well,

2694
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:38.110
what's $10,000 to Bill Gates and what's $10,000 to the regular person when

2695
02:46:38.850 --> 02:46:40.070
you're reporting requirement?

2696
02:46:40.071 --> 02:46:43.490
It's not like you're not allowed to do it if you have more than that.
Yeah.

2697
02:46:43.491 --> 02:46:45.370
So if Bill Gates shows up somewhere and he said that,

2698
02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:48.500
why do you have $1 billion in cash?
It's like,
cause I'm Bill Gates,
bitch,

2699
02:46:50.210 --> 02:46:52.460
I just like to roll around with a billion in my pocket.

2700
02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:54.800
Could you even carry $1 billion on you?

2701
02:46:54.830 --> 02:46:56.900
What's like the F Zero Thousand Dollar Bill?

2702
02:46:56.901 --> 02:46:59.660
What's the like the largest hundred dollars bills in the largest hundreds of the

2703
02:46:59.661 --> 02:47:02.180
biggest us bill.
He used to be larger though,
right?

2704
02:47:02.210 --> 02:47:06.830
There used to be thousands or maybe even 10 thousands but they were like not in

2705
02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:08.810
general circulation.

2706
02:47:09.170 --> 02:47:13.380
They were printed for like banks to hold onto and pass between themselves.
See,

2707
02:47:13.450 --> 02:47:14.283
um,

2708
02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:18.950
the 500 euro note is I think the

2709
02:47:20.690 --> 02:47:24.650
largest international largest denomination that's like actually in wide

2710
02:47:24.651 --> 02:47:25.484
circulation.

2711
02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:30.640
I've read that international crime is mostly done in euro's now because it's a

2712
02:47:31.701 --> 02:47:36.701
lot easier to move around cash in 500 euro note if it's giant amounts of it.

2713
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:42.190
That makes sense because a 500 euro note is like 700 US dollars and takes up

2714
02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:47.270
same mental space as a u s hundred what is that?
What does that right there?

2715
02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:49.880
That's $100,000.
Is that real?
Yeah.

2716
02:47:49.881 --> 02:47:54.140
It was a gold certificate only printed once in 1934.
Oh,
okay.

2717
02:47:54.170 --> 02:47:57.290
God Damn.
Who's that creepy dude on the crowd with Woodrow Wilson.

2718
02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:01.120
Creepy looking fuck.
And he's responsible for some shit.
Guaranteed.

2719
02:48:01.490 --> 02:48:02.450
Look in as background,

2720
02:48:03.230 --> 02:48:07.510
what is the most money that you ever won in a poker tournament in poker or

2721
02:48:07.511 --> 02:48:10.660
playing poker on any,
any event.
And He,
yeah,

2722
02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:16.360
the biggest cash I've ever had in a poker tournament was bout $3 million.

2723
02:48:16.820 --> 02:48:17.653
Um,

2724
02:48:18.410 --> 02:48:22.070
I finished second in a tournament in Australia this year.

2725
02:48:22.071 --> 02:48:24.200
That was a $250,000 buy in.

2726
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:29.180
So you had to spend $250,000 to get it.
Well,

2727
02:48:29.550 --> 02:48:32.170
second earlier I took on investors to play,

2728
02:48:32.510 --> 02:48:34.840
then I didn't put up all the money myself.
So the big,

2729
02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:36.080
it was a reentry tournament.

2730
02:48:36.081 --> 02:48:38.780
So I busted once on the first day and then bought in again.

2731
02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:43.850
So I spent 500,000 on the tournament.
Oh my God.

2732
02:48:43.930 --> 02:48:46.850
And he,
but he came in second,
I came in second and ended up making some money.

2733
02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:49.370
How much does that pay to come in?
Second.
About 3 million.

2734
02:48:49.371 --> 02:48:51.230
I don't actually remember the number off the top of my head.

2735
02:48:51.490 --> 02:48:54.260
You could Google it real quick.
It was two point something.

2736
02:48:54.270 --> 02:48:55.760
What kind of pressure is there on you?

2737
02:48:55.761 --> 02:49:00.560
Once you spent $250,000 then you get shanked and he'd come back and again,

2738
02:49:01.010 --> 02:49:04.940
it was a rough week.
It was a series of tournaments.
They're the first one was,

2739
02:49:05.170 --> 02:49:08.460
or the first big one I played was the

2740
02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:13.640
<v 2>hundred k that was also re-entry that I was in six times and didn't cash.</v>

2741
02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:20.690
<v 5>So he's an 600 grand and you didn't catch in a day.
Oh my.</v>

2742
02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:25.150
And then four days later is the 250 K oh.

2743
02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:28.580
I show up for that and bust right away.
You have,

2744
02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:33.760
you have major league false on giant huge iron fucking balls.

2745
02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:39.540
Wow.
Six Times in a day.
It's a rough day.

2746
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:43.710
Oh my God.
What did he,
how do you sleep that night?
What does that night like?
Um,

2747
02:49:43.770 --> 02:49:46.920
you obviously can't do that too many times in a row.
Nobody can.
Right?

2748
02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:48.870
Well with that exact one.

2749
02:49:49.060 --> 02:49:49.893
<v 6>MMM.</v>

2750
02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:55.600
<v 2>The reentry period was open until the start of the second day of the tournament.</v>

2751
02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:01.480
So after the first day I was getting blood bath and down,

2752
02:50:01.941 --> 02:50:05.810
done the money and still had to come back the next day and play for real.

2753
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:07.280
Wow.

2754
02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:10.910
And came back and got knocked out for the sixth time on the first hand of the

2755
02:50:10.911 --> 02:50:13.130
second day.
She's,
that's Christ son.

2756
02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:19.000
So then after that it was a lot of Australian Shiraz and a long,

2757
02:50:19.281 --> 02:50:23.010
long sleep and then a couple of days off and then the two 50 k

2758
02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:28.920
<v 5>wow.
That's crazy.
That's digging into the account there,
Huh?
Fuck.</v>

2759
02:50:29.130 --> 02:50:33.900
Do some damage.
So when you look at like losses like that and wins,

2760
02:50:33.901 --> 02:50:37.410
does that make you play more conservatively and upcoming events or do you just

2761
02:50:37.411 --> 02:50:40.230
have to play intelligently period and just take the losses when they come?

2762
02:50:40.530 --> 02:50:45.390
<v 2>Um,
the place where you get more conservative is your bankroll management rather</v>

2763
02:50:45.391 --> 02:50:46.224
than your play.

2764
02:50:46.470 --> 02:50:50.580
The play from one hand to the next is really about,

2765
02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:56.240
you have to put the magnitude of the numbers out of your head and try to make

2766
02:50:56.910 --> 02:51:01.310
the best play each time it's on you to make a decision.

2767
02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:02.480
<v 5>So are you in the moment,</v>

2768
02:51:02.481 --> 02:51:06.790
are you zen or are you still thinking about that $600,000 a year?

2769
02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:10.920
<v 2>Pretty good at just getting myself into the moment.
Um,
the,</v>

2770
02:51:10.930 --> 02:51:15.930
the place where you get more conservative is you lose for awhile.

2771
02:51:17.540 --> 02:51:21.200
You have less money than you did before that period started.
You reevaluate,

2772
02:51:21.380 --> 02:51:25.700
I have only 75% of the money I did a few months ago.

2773
02:51:26.780 --> 02:51:28.070
Should I maybe sell

2774
02:51:29.690 --> 02:51:34.460
75% of my action in this upcoming tournament instead of 50.
Right.
I say,
I say,
oh,

2775
02:51:34.500 --> 02:51:34.920
that,
that,

2776
02:51:34.920 --> 02:51:38.050
that's the way in which you can get more conservative if you're going through

2777
02:51:38.110 --> 02:51:40.320
losing stretch is play for lower stage.

2778
02:51:40.370 --> 02:51:42.230
What's the biggest losing stretch you've ever gone through?

2779
02:51:43.330 --> 02:51:44.800
<v 6>MMM,</v>

2780
02:51:46.110 --> 02:51:50.750
<v 2>in dollar amount period mounts.
Uh,
let's see.</v>

2781
02:51:51.490 --> 02:51:51.820
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

2782
02:51:51.820 --> 02:51:54.280
<v 5>I'll give you ever gone through like a couple million dollars in a weekend.</v>

2783
02:51:54.710 --> 02:51:55.640
<v 6>MMM.</v>

2784
02:51:56.190 --> 02:52:00.150
<v 2>In Games where I didn't,
where I had told action,
didn't have all of myself.</v>

2785
02:52:00.870 --> 02:52:02.100
Yeah,
I've lost,

2786
02:52:04.370 --> 02:52:06.010
I guess my losing

2787
02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:11.040
<v 3>couple of days was on the order of</v>

2788
02:52:12.910 --> 02:52:15.970
<v 2>50 million Hong Kong,
Hong Kong dollars,
Hong Kong dollars,</v>

2789
02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:19.700
which are bigger or let let let last rather.
So only like 6 million years.

2790
02:52:20.050 --> 02:52:25.050
My God signed only 6 million u s dollars and personally I had a small share of

2791
02:52:27.071 --> 02:52:31.480
that so I didn't personally lose $6 million.
What's a small share?
1 million.

2792
02:52:31.481 --> 02:52:34.900
2 million.
What's the small share?
10% ish.

2793
02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:39.010
<v 0>Okay.
600 grand
still.</v>

2794
02:52:39.160 --> 02:52:42.940
That's a lot of fucking money.
Yeah.
It's doesn't feel good.

2795
02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:44.383
Wow.

2796
02:52:44.530 --> 02:52:49.220
<v 2>Of course a bunch of my friends lost a shit load of money too and I have to send</v>

2797
02:52:49.221 --> 02:52:52.130
out the email.
Hey guys didn't go real well.

2798
02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:54.440
Fuck that.

2799
02:52:54.460 --> 02:52:59.220
That's the worst part of it for sure is the hey guys didn't go real well.
Sure.

2800
02:52:59.350 --> 02:53:04.030
<v 0>Cause everybody's like planning on making a like a profit based on your success</v>

2801
02:53:04.031 --> 02:53:08.140
in the past.
Yeah.
So it's rare that you hit these dark spots.

2802
02:53:08.260 --> 02:53:12.080
What do you attribute them to?
Is it just luck?
Is it,
is it not

2803
02:53:12.170 --> 02:53:16.790
<v 2>that rare?
Like any given day that I play poker,
I might be,</v>

2804
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:22.190
if I'm playing cash,
games may be like a 52% favorite to have a winning day,

2805
02:53:22.610 --> 02:53:26.150
maybe less than that.
Uh,
if I'm playing a tournament,

2806
02:53:26.151 --> 02:53:28.540
I'm a favorite and have a losing day because uh,

2807
02:53:28.550 --> 02:53:32.990
tournament they pay about 10% top 10% of the field.

2808
02:53:33.260 --> 02:53:38.260
So if they're paying top 10% of the field are really good player caches,

2809
02:53:39.770 --> 02:53:44.420
<v 0>15 18% of the time.
That seems incredibly stressful.
It's very stressful.</v>

2810
02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:48.140
Is it?
What,
how do you feel like,
like about this,
like as a,

2811
02:53:48.141 --> 02:53:50.930
as a human being trying to make a living in this incredibly,

2812
02:53:51.170 --> 02:53:53.300
it feels like you're navigating a minefield.

2813
02:53:54.520 --> 02:53:55.353
<v 6>MMM.</v>

2814
02:53:56.010 --> 02:54:00.450
<v 0>Yeah.
It,
you've been,
obviously you've been very successful with this.</v>

2815
02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:03.210
You've turned a very nice profit.
You do very well.

2816
02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:06.840
But the amount of stress that on your 28 year old body,

2817
02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:09.660
I mean not just your back,
but your mind,

2818
02:54:09.720 --> 02:54:13.240
you're like racing and battling these numbers.
You know,

2819
02:54:13.290 --> 02:54:16.470
you're talking millions of dollars back and forth and down and up.

2820
02:54:16.471 --> 02:54:19.720
And what does that do you do something to mitigate that?

2821
02:54:19.860 --> 02:54:22.320
I like to meditate every day.
What kind of meditation?

2822
02:54:22.460 --> 02:54:25.370
<v 2>Odd.
Just breath focused.
Um,</v>

2823
02:54:25.760 --> 02:54:30.760
basically just sit quietly for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes and attend to my

2824
02:54:32.121 --> 02:54:32.954
breathing.

2825
02:54:33.390 --> 02:54:36.820
<v 0>Just concentrate on breathing in and breathing out and just trying to stay calm</v>

2826
02:54:36.821 --> 02:54:37.050
and,

2827
02:54:37.050 --> 02:54:41.400
<v 2>and sometimes I'll do an exercise on top of that where I'll track the thoughts</v>

2828
02:54:41.401 --> 02:54:46.401
that enter my mind and label them as thoughts about the future or thoughts about

2829
02:54:47.731 --> 02:54:51.780
the past.
And that what that exercise does is helps you,

2830
02:54:52.350 --> 02:54:54.180
helps to bring you into the present moment.

2831
02:54:54.790 --> 02:54:55.623
<v 6>MMM.</v>

2832
02:54:56.520 --> 02:54:58.680
<v 2>And to see that,
uh,</v>

2833
02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:02.330
it's difficult to have

2834
02:55:04.210 --> 02:55:06.400
thoughts about the present moment.
You,

2835
02:55:06.401 --> 02:55:11.401
you just have sensations and feelings and experiences of the present moment and

2836
02:55:11.981 --> 02:55:16.150
the thoughts that you build on top of that are almost all about the future or

2837
02:55:16.151 --> 02:55:17.110
about the past.

2838
02:55:17.380 --> 02:55:22.380
And observing that process is really good for bringing you into the present

2839
02:55:23.351 --> 02:55:24.184
moment.

2840
02:55:24.670 --> 02:55:29.320
And that that's great for poker because all the shit that stresses you out when

2841
02:55:29.321 --> 02:55:33.040
you're playing in dealing with these big swings is thinking about the past and

2842
02:55:33.041 --> 02:55:34.090
thinking about the future.

2843
02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:38.710
Thinking I'm down this much in the last couple of days.
That's real fucking bad.

2844
02:55:38.711 --> 02:55:39.820
What am I going to do?

2845
02:55:40.030 --> 02:55:45.030
Or I'm going to win all this money and then I'm going to buy a fucking yacht and

2846
02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:47.500
sail off into the sunset.

2847
02:55:47.501 --> 02:55:51.610
And both of those are things you can think that take you out at the moment of

2848
02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:55.080
all right.
He just bet,

2849
02:55:56.080 --> 02:55:56.560
<v 3>okay,</v>

2850
02:55:56.560 --> 02:55:58.780
<v 2>what do I think he has?
What's the right place?</v>

2851
02:55:58.850 --> 02:56:02.420
<v 7>So in that sense,
uh,
poker is a lot like life.
Like,
Oh yeah.</v>

2852
02:56:02.450 --> 02:56:04.550
I think key to life is to be present.

2853
02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:09.760
<v 2>It's great training for living your life mindfully and</v>

2854
02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:12.890
<v 7>rationally and effectively.</v>

2855
02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:17.990
Have you ever done any treatments or a sessions in the isolation tank?

2856
02:56:18.020 --> 02:56:22.010
I have an I really want to.
Why don't you get one you're making banks on.

2857
02:56:22.190 --> 02:56:23.680
If I'm traveling around on them time,

2858
02:56:23.790 --> 02:56:25.670
it's a multiple how to get something shipped.
Them all.

2859
02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:28.190
I can't fucking figure out how to get them to send me a desk chair.
Malta.

2860
02:56:28.700 --> 02:56:32.990
I guarantee you somewhere in Europe this,
they have a sensory deprivation.

2861
02:56:32.991 --> 02:56:36.530
They have a couple of adults.
I looked it up.
I didn't get around to go into one,

2862
02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:39.800
but it's across the whole island.
No,
it's right fucking there.

2863
02:56:39.801 --> 02:56:43.190
I'm just so it's there of Lazy Jesus Christ.
If you do it once,

2864
02:56:43.310 --> 02:56:45.200
you're going to realize what amazing tool it is.

2865
02:56:45.210 --> 02:56:46.150
You don't want to do it all the time.

2866
02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:48.560
I'm really close to doing it once with JC in La.

2867
02:56:48.561 --> 02:56:51.360
Several years ago we got in the cab and we went to the place and we got there

2868
02:56:51.361 --> 02:56:55.040
and it was closed.
Well,
there's a place that's in Venice while you're here,

2869
02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:57.950
the float lab there,
the pressure.
That's where I tried to go.
Uh,

2870
02:56:58.550 --> 02:57:01.210
I mean JC took me there,
so it's amazing.
So they,

2871
02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:04.100
they're the best place to the best place in California for sure.

2872
02:57:04.130 --> 02:57:05.240
I should check that out for sure.
Yeah.

2873
02:57:05.241 --> 02:57:08.050
Well I'll try to see if I can hook it up once you get out of here.
Cool.
We're,

2874
02:57:08.060 --> 02:57:10.620
we're out of time.
Man,
we're going to turn into a pumpkin.
Oh,
sorry.

2875
02:57:10.910 --> 02:57:14.600
We're three hours then.
That was three hours and not credible.
That flew by.
Yeah.
