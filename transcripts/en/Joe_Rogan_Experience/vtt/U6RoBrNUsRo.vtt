00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Let's take that element out of it.</v>

10
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Let's just take the house,</v>

11
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:14.084
<v Speaker 2>the cash,</v>

12
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 2>the bows and arrows.</v>

13
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.663
<v Speaker 2>It's all gone.</v>

14
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Could Joe Rogan go live in,</v>

15
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 2>let's just pick New York,</v>

16
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:24.050
<v Speaker 2>this is not a city question,</v>

17
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.120
<v Speaker 2>but let's pick New York.</v>

18
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Could you go live down by Washington Square Park in a studio,</v>

19
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:30.740
<v Speaker 2>apartment heavier act.</v>

20
00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Have your fans go do your thing and kind of be okay with a low bank account or</v>

21
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 2>have you got,</v>

22
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Speaker 2>are you at an age now and you've,</v>

23
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.590
<v Speaker 2>you've had stability.</v>

24
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like that would freak you out?</v>

25
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Well it would definitely freak you out if you all the sudden,</v>

26
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that I've,</v>

27
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:48.574
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.730
<v Speaker 1>sort of relied on is not needing anything.</v>

29
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

30
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>So by not needing anything,</v>

31
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:54.551
<v Speaker 1>everything I do,</v>

32
00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I do because I enjoy it.</v>

33
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

34
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>So like if I do stand up,</v>

35
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I do it cause I enjoy it and if I do podcasts because I enjoy it if I do the UFC</v>

36
00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>is cause I enjoy it.</v>

37
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy the money is done.</v>

38
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>

39
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

40
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not neat.</v>

41
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not needy.</v>

42
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a position where I'm like worried about my next check.</v>

43
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I need that stuff.</v>

44
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>So if I got to that,</v>

45
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

46
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

47
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.250
<v Speaker 1>not even need that stuff.</v>

48
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Like neither stuff has kind of like if you have a car and you can get around</v>

49
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:19.611
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

50
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>if you got food on the table and your family's taken care of,</v>

51
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>everything else is kind of bullshit.</v>

52
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>It's nice.</v>

53
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to have a good couch.</v>

54
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:27.551
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

55
00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

56
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>we have a 70 inch TV.</v>

57
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

58
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>this is nice.</v>

59
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.093
<v Speaker 1>Feels Nice.</v>

60
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.660
<v Speaker 1>But Watch Westworld on a 70 inch TV.</v>

61
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:35.261
<v Speaker 1>It's nice.</v>

62
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Look how big it is.</v>

63
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.913
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

64
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately what really counts is,</v>

65
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>are you nervous?</v>

66
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Are you nervous about your bills?</v>

67
00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Cause like,</v>

68
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.140
<v Speaker 1>do you remember that feeling?</v>

69
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

71
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>That's how terrible feeling.</v>

72
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I never worried about what,</v>

73
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 2>where that's going to come from and what you're going to do.</v>

74
00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:52.870
<v Speaker 2>But you still have your act.</v>

75
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.130
<v Speaker 2>You can still go make money,</v>

76
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to put you back at square one.</v>

77
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:58.210
<v Speaker 2>We're going to put you in that studio apartment.</v>

78
00:01:58.211 --> 00:01:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Could you,</v>

79
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.870
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

80
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Speaker 2>would you be cool with it?</v>

81
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll studios cost small one.</v>

82
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh like a four bedroom house with a yard and some work.</v>

83
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

84
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.710
<v Speaker 1>but honestly the,</v>

85
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.060
<v Speaker 1>the big thing,</v>

86
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.200
<v Speaker 1>and this is such a cliche,</v>

87
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>but the big thing is do I still have my friends?</v>

88
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Do I still have the same friends?</v>

89
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Because like if I lived in an apartment building and Ari Shaffir lived next door</v>

90
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 1>or any Donkin live down the hallway and Joey was the uh,</v>

91
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.053
<v Speaker 1>over the other side.</v>

92
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

93
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.273
<v Speaker 1>I have a great time.</v>

94
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>We all lived on the same floor,</v>

96
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>the same building.</v>

97
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I would have zero problem with that.</v>

98
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.590
<v Speaker 1>If they knocked on the door.</v>

99
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:27.891
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

100
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:28.401
<v Speaker 1>you got any weed?</v>

101
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wait.</v>

102
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.983
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

103
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

104
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.270
<v Speaker 1>That would be no problem at all.</v>

105
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:35.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like how much different is that then when you stay on the road in the</v>

106
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>hotel,</v>

107
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

108
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Because the hotel is like a studio apartment.</v>

109
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>And you're right.</v>

111
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Good percentage of our lives.</v>

112
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 1>We stay in a studio apartment a lot.</v>

113
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

114
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

115
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 2>and I bring it up cause I really,</v>

116
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about it and it's like if it all fell apart,</v>

117
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 2>like he grab you grab on to your lifestyle and what you're doing so hard,</v>

118
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 2>but if at all for whatever reason washed away and you could still go perform and</v>

119
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 2>you still had your friends at this club,</v>

120
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:00.960
<v Speaker 2>he could go see whatever it's,</v>

121
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

122
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 2>I could totally do it.</v>

123
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.070
<v Speaker 2>I could totally go back to I have clothes that fit in this big of a closet and</v>

124
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

125
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>and just keep doing what I'm doing.</v>

126
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 2>But in those circumstances I 100% in some ways I think your,</v>

127
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 2>you'd be lighter.</v>

128
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 2>You'd be right.</v>

129
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people do believe that and a lot of people do go towards that</v>

130
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>minimalism wife or they give up everything.</v>

131
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>My friend Steve Maxwell,</v>

132
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.980
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

133
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>a really a world renowned fitness trainer.</v>

134
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Strength and conditioning coach for a lot of pro athletes.</v>

135
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:34.594
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fighters.</v>

136
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>He lives out of a Duffel bag.</v>

137
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.061
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

138
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I saw that guy.</v>

139
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I saw you interviewed guy.</v>

140
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.190
<v Speaker 1>He used to have a big house and he had a gym in Philadelphia,</v>

141
00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>you'd like one of the very,</v>

142
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the very first American Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belts.</v>

143
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>And he had his gigantic jam where he's teaching and he said,</v>

144
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting guy.</v>

146
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>And then he just decided he got divorced,</v>

147
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

148
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.181
<v Speaker 1>And he decided,</v>

149
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.014
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

150
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

151
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.341
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

152
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live out of a van.</v>

153
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.610
<v Speaker 1>And he got like a,</v>

154
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:02.030
<v Speaker 1>a camper van and he lived out of that.</v>

155
00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:02.441
<v Speaker 1>And then he's like,</v>

156
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>fuck this van I'm getting,</v>

157
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to keep traveling now.</v>

158
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.980
<v Speaker 1>He just stays in hotels everywhere.</v>

159
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

160
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's what brings it up.</v>

161
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 2>It's the divorce.</v>

162
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.583
<v Speaker 2>I see it.</v>

163
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

164
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think willingly I would do it,</v>

165
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>but if something was thrust upon me because he got divorced,</v>

166
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 2>divorced or some something,</v>

167
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.961
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

168
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

169
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I could go back.</v>

170
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I could be like,</v>

171
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.761
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

172
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:25.100
<v Speaker 1>but you're thinking about it so much that you brought it up as a subject.</v>

173
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>It was something you wonder.</v>

174
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.883
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

175
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.551
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

176
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Not as far as the divorce part of it,</v>

177
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.700
<v Speaker 2>but just the simple life.</v>

178
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

179
00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:37.121
<v Speaker 2>Because I've built a life that's bigger and more complicated and I,</v>

180
00:04:37.371 --> 00:04:37.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

181
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.740
<v Speaker 2>you want to know what you want to know what it was.</v>

182
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Last time I was in here,</v>

183
00:04:41.811 --> 00:04:42.261
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

184
00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

185
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Speaker 2>I had this back issue where it was like shooting pain down my arm.</v>

186
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I was doing all of this kind of stuff and it was just making it worse.</v>

195
00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I was just in words.</v>

196
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

197
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.590

00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:23.150
<v Speaker 2>He's calling him a crack and it's a crackpot and it doesn't work and all this</v>

215
00:05:23.151 --> 00:05:23.421
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

216
00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:24.800
<v Speaker 2>And Greg is like,</v>

217
00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:25.790
<v Speaker 2>just please read it.</v>

218
00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Just read it,</v>

219
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.800
<v Speaker 2>just read it and it's,</v>

220
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.461
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is.</v>

221
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 2>It's just basically about that you're carrying,</v>

222
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.450
<v Speaker 2>your brain wants to go to work on something simple like pain in your body rather</v>

223
00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:40.010
<v Speaker 2>than deal with issues of stress and anxiety and anger that you carry all the</v>

224
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:44.210
<v Speaker 2>time and basically just realizing that that's where the pain is coming from.</v>

225
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Don't have to solve the anxiety or the pain or the anger.</v>

226
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.820
<v Speaker 2>You just have to be aware,</v>

227
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.841
<v Speaker 2>okay brain,</v>

228
00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:51.800
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're doing,</v>

229
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're working on.</v>

230
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.300
<v Speaker 2>It just kind of alleviates that stress.</v>

231
00:05:56.301 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And then the physical manifestation of not having oxygen go into your,</v>

232
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.680
<v Speaker 2>into your muscles and stuff starts to slowly release and just it,</v>

233
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.453
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>

234
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.533
<v Speaker 2>It's gone.</v>

235
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

236
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I have no pain.</v>

237
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I have no,</v>

238
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 2>how long did it take after you read the book and adopted the principles?</v>

239
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 2>I go month and a half.</v>

240
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

241
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

242
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 2>So a year of pain and then a month and a half of adopting these principles and</v>

243
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 2>like what does he tell you to do?</v>

244
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:20.961
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

245
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 2>what are the exercises that he tells you to do?</v>

246
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.850
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

247
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 2>just live.</v>

248
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Don't just a live your life,</v>

249
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.471
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>

250
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 2>whatever you were doing,</v>

251
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

252
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Don't live timidly don't think I can't run now.</v>

253
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't do yoga now because I've got a neck issue.</v>

254
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Do it live your life.</v>

255
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Don't live like in this preventative way of I can't move or I'm going to mess up</v>

256
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

257
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 2>my body.</v>

258
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 2>So what does he tell you about like physical issues?</v>

259
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Like what if you have a herniated disc and it's pressing against your nerve and</v>

260
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 2>it's causing your hands to go numb and your arms atrophying.</v>

261
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 2>He says there's,</v>

262
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 2>those are very rare cases.</v>

263
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not that rare in my world.</v>

264
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

265
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.271
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

266
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

267
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 2>But he says,</v>

268
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>he says it's very rare cases where there's like a real pinched nerve kind of a</v>

269
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.374
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

270
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 2>A lot seems like crazy advice.</v>

271
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that have like real issues,</v>

272
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Speaker 2>like real physical issues.</v>

273
00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not a rare thing I don't think to have like disc issues are gigantic.</v>

274
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

275
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 2>It's cause people,</v>

276
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 2>they don't strengthen their spine enough.</v>

277
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 2>They don't drink their core enough and they wind up doing something to Yank it</v>

278
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 2>and they heard it and then they try to work around it and they wind up</v>

279
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 2>reactivating it and then it gets worse and worse.</v>

280
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.430
<v Speaker 2>He was saying that the,</v>

281
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you'll have,</v>

282
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

283
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 2>you'll have like your disk will be bulging a little bit or whatever these little</v>

284
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 2>imperfections are and we all have these imperfections in us,</v>

285
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 2>but when you are stressed and the muscles are tightening around you and becoming</v>

286
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:46.340
<v Speaker 2>inflamed because you're carrying this stuff that you're not working through,</v>

287
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 2>everything's constricting around it.</v>

288
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 2>So then it's going to aggravate that and that's going to become a bigger</v>

289
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

290
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think that's true.</v>

291
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

292
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 2>and some cases,</v>

293
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.061
<v Speaker 2>but there's like,</v>

294
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:56.871
<v Speaker 2>there's legitimate,</v>

295
00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 2>like I had a conversation with a friend of mine about this with the same sort of</v>

296
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:01.580
<v Speaker 2>a thing and I was like that.</v>

297
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 2>That's all well and good,</v>

298
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 2>but I know people who were very light and happy people who develop a legitimate</v>

299
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:10.260
<v Speaker 2>back issue and has nothing to do with stress that they're carrying around and</v>

300
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 2>has to do with the soft tissue that protects your joints,</v>

301
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 2>bulging out and contacting a nerve.</v>

302
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.393
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

303
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 2>there's a zillion of us out there and I'm sure there's all different issues for</v>

304
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:24.320
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

305
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 2>but back to your original question of why am I thinking about simplifying and</v>

306
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 2>all this kind of stuff?</v>

307
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I am a pretty light,</v>

308
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.110
<v Speaker 2>positive person,</v>

309
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.100
<v Speaker 2>very optimistic,</v>

310
00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:34.491
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>

311
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I kind of live in that world,</v>

312
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.000
<v Speaker 2>but when I just started reading the book I'm like,</v>

313
00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I think is really pissing me off.</v>

314
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Am I stressed?</v>

315
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Do I have anxiety because I live in this house because I'm trying to do these</v>

316
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 2>things with my career because I'm trying to always do this because I'm carrying</v>

317
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 2>children and parents and all of this stuff.</v>

318
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make everybody happy.</v>

319
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

320
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

321
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just realizing that in thinking about it,</v>

322
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm in no heavy meditation on it.</v>

323
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

324
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Just being aware that maybe that's where it's coming from.</v>

325
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you over a month and a half,</v>

326
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 2>the pain slowly went away and I don't have it.</v>

327
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

328
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.890
<v Speaker 1>that is interesting.</v>

329
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.690
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

330
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.540
<v Speaker 1>like what was bothering you before?</v>

331
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Like I know that you're,</v>

332
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:09:19.251 --> 00:09:23.210
<v Speaker 1>you're successful and you had a television show for a while and you've got a</v>

334
00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:24.500
<v Speaker 1>bunch of projects going on.</v>

335
00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:26.840
<v Speaker 1>You're always doing standup and specials,</v>

336
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.400
<v Speaker 1>so you've had a lot of success,</v>

337
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.230
<v Speaker 1>you've got a lot of great stuff going on.</v>

338
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.190
<v Speaker 1>What was,</v>

339
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.080
<v Speaker 1>what was kind of chewing at you?</v>

340
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.331
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

341
00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:37.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really 100% sure of what the sources,</v>

342
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 2>but I do feel like I have a lot of people on my back and it's all,</v>

343
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.670
<v Speaker 2>it's all quiet.</v>

344
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.720
<v Speaker 2>It's all in my head,</v>

345
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.740
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

346
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.880
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people on your back.</v>

347
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

348
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.680
<v Speaker 2>I've got a wife,</v>

349
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.460
<v Speaker 2>I've got,</v>

350
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.510
<v Speaker 2>I've got kids,</v>

351
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.830
<v Speaker 2>I've got pets,</v>

352
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I've got family.</v>

353
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.400
<v Speaker 2>I've got</v>

354
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.530
<v Speaker 1>in the in that you feel that there's a weird,</v>

355
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:00.970
<v Speaker 1>weird way to bring this,</v>

356
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.171
<v Speaker 1>bring this up.</v>

357
00:10:02.171 --> 00:10:03.220
<v Speaker 1>But is that,</v>

358
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.811
<v Speaker 1>how much of that,</v>

359
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:06.640
<v Speaker 1>like having a wife and having kids,</v>

360
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.410
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's going to be compromises and there's going to be stressed that</v>

361
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:12.940
<v Speaker 1>comes along with any sort of relationship,</v>

362
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:18.340
<v Speaker 1>but do you feel like it was tipping more towards the negative than towards the</v>

363
00:10:18.341 --> 00:10:19.174
<v Speaker 1>positive?</v>

364
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.913
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

365
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was.</v>

366
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.680
<v Speaker 2>I think I just,</v>

367
00:10:23.681 --> 00:10:24.514
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

368
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.850
<v Speaker 2>the whole experience to me seems positive.</v>

369
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.520
<v Speaker 2>My relationship with my wife is great.</v>

370
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.790
<v Speaker 2>The kids I adore.</v>

371
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's all positive,</v>

372
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.120
<v Speaker 2>but I do carry the burden of everybody's worries and everybody's wellbeing all</v>

373
00:10:40.121 --> 00:10:40.361
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

374
00:10:40.361 --> 00:10:41.410
<v Speaker 2>I was working on this axis,</v>

375
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.700
<v Speaker 2>this joke in my act before I started thinking about all this stuff I had this</v>

376
00:10:45.701 --> 00:10:47.050
<v Speaker 2>moment when I was standing in this house,</v>

377
00:10:47.051 --> 00:10:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I moved to this bigger house.</v>

378
00:10:48.431 --> 00:10:49.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a really nice house.</v>

379
00:10:49.511 --> 00:10:51.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a bigger how bigger home.</v>

380
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.270
<v Speaker 2>And I was shutting off all the lights is what I was working through on stage.</v>

381
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.050
<v Speaker 2>I was turning off all the lights one night and locking the doors for all the bad</v>

382
00:10:59.051 --> 00:11:00.460
<v Speaker 2>people that are coming to get us.</v>

383
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.820
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's in their beds and the cat's asleep and the dog's asleep and</v>

384
00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:05.230
<v Speaker 2>everybody the lizard to sleep.</v>

385
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.753
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>

386
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.710
<v Speaker 2>all my responsibility washed over me like everybody,</v>

387
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.500
<v Speaker 2>every living thing here is,</v>

388
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.180
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>

389
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.860
<v Speaker 2>depending on my success,</v>

390
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.930
<v Speaker 2>if I don't keep going,</v>

391
00:11:19.931 --> 00:11:22.720
<v Speaker 2>if I don't keep succeeding this,</v>

392
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.120
<v Speaker 2>everything here changes everybody's little life.</v>

393
00:11:25.121 --> 00:11:25.954
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's Pref,</v>

394
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.460
<v Speaker 2>perfect little existence.</v>

395
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.600
<v Speaker 2>It's all washing over me and I can't tell anyone about it.</v>

396
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I could tell you the audience,</v>

397
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.770
<v Speaker 2>but I can't go sit on my daughter's bed at two in the morning when I have that</v>

398
00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:36.604
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

399
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.583
<v Speaker 2>Honey,</v>

400
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.423
<v Speaker 2>you ever,</v>

401
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.720
<v Speaker 2>do you ever feel like you just can't do it anymore?</v>

402
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.790
<v Speaker 2>You ever feel like he can't,</v>

403
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.440
<v Speaker 2>he just want to stop.</v>

404
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.150
<v Speaker 2>He just want to take a break.</v>

405
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.300
<v Speaker 2>This whole thing about waking up my daughter with my fears,</v>

406
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

407
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't tell my wife that stuff.</v>

408
00:11:51.971 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't tell my kids that stuff.</v>

409
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I just carry it.</v>

410
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.010
<v Speaker 2>So when I started reading this book,</v>

411
00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.281
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

412
00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm just taking all this really seriously and feeling like,</v>

413
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.173
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

414
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.073
<v Speaker 2>Did you</v>

415
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.250
<v Speaker 1>extended with the new home?</v>

416
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>

417
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of times I have a friend of mine,</v>

418
00:12:07.411 --> 00:12:08.111
<v Speaker 1>I did that recently.</v>

419
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:10.380
<v Speaker 1>He bought a big place and uh,</v>

420
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.310
<v Speaker 1>he can afford it,</v>

421
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.870
<v Speaker 1>but kind of right.</v>

422
00:12:12.871 --> 00:12:13.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

423
00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:13.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

424
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.333
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

425
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.010
<v Speaker 1>think about this now I'm a,</v>

426
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big advocate in never doing that.</v>

427
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

428
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should ever buy a big place unless you're like,</v>

429
00:12:22.561 --> 00:12:22.741
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

430
00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:24.720
<v Speaker 1>we can get a nice place now and not even think about it.</v>

431
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

432
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:25.461
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

433
00:12:25.461 --> 00:12:26.330
<v Speaker 2>we're totally cool.</v>

434
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.193
<v Speaker 2>We can do it.</v>

435
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.621
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

436
00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:27.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

437
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.200
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't really small place for a long time and did all the right thing.</v>

438
00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:32.034
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

439
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.390
<v Speaker 2>the outlay is no different from my little place before.</v>

440
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:36.740
<v Speaker 2>It's all cool.</v>

441
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.590
<v Speaker 2>But when you walk into a place like that,</v>

442
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.060
<v Speaker 2>it just feels bigger.</v>

443
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:41.720
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

444
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:41.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

445
00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.520
<v Speaker 2>the first time I bought a home ever,</v>

446
00:12:43.521 --> 00:12:45.350
<v Speaker 2>I had this little place in studio city.</v>

447
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a little,</v>

448
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:46.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

449
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:46.881
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

450
00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:49.760
<v Speaker 2>I remember laying on the couch like,</v>

451
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.511
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

452
00:12:50.511 --> 00:12:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can take with this.</v>

453
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I've got to sign this paper.</v>

454
00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:55.760
<v Speaker 2>And towards the years is a long,</v>

455
00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.420
<v Speaker 2>every time the mail came for the first year that I owned home,</v>

456
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to be a notice saying you've got to get out of there now.</v>

457
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.140
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

458
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:03.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

459
00:13:03.471 --> 00:13:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I just was fearful about it.</v>

460
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Mortgages are weird,</v>

461
00:13:06.381 --> 00:13:06.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

462
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like you here's a bill for 30 years,</v>

463
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:10.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

464
00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

465
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.121
<v Speaker 2>That's heavy.</v>

466
00:13:11.121 --> 00:13:11.931
<v Speaker 2>That weighs on you.</v>

467
00:13:11.931 --> 00:13:12.764
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

468
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's what it just brought me to the feeling of like,</v>

469
00:13:16.551 --> 00:13:21.530
<v Speaker 2>well maybe just going back and living with my wife in that little studio</v>

470
00:13:21.531 --> 00:13:22.910
<v Speaker 2>apartment in New York again,</v>

471
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.230
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be so bad.</v>

472
00:13:24.231 --> 00:13:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Kid's a freak out.</v>

473
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.530
<v Speaker 2>It'd be the kids would free kids would hate it.</v>

474
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.610
<v Speaker 2>The kids would have to be gone.</v>

475
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this dad.</v>

476
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.430
<v Speaker 2>You need to be more successful.</v>

477
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

478
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Just take your pressure like a man ditch.</v>

479
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Why did you downsize?</v>

480
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Who cares if your next crooked son of a bitch,</v>

481
00:13:39.201 --> 00:13:40.610
<v Speaker 2>who cares if your arms go numb?</v>

482
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to Berkeley.</v>

483
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Everything's with your teeth.</v>

484
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:45.711
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

485
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:45.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

486
00:13:45.981 --> 00:13:46.570
<v Speaker 2>cause it's a,</v>

487
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.450
<v Speaker 2>it was a little self aware moment because I do,</v>

488
00:13:50.451 --> 00:13:51.021
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

489
00:13:51.021 --> 00:13:51.854
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

490
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.110
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm pretty carefree,</v>

491
00:13:54.111 --> 00:13:56.180
<v Speaker 2>but why the hell was my neck so</v>

492
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.230
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

493
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
